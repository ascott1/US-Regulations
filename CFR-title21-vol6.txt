          <GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>
          
          The seal of the National Archives and Records Administration 
              (NARA) authenticates the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) as 
              the official codification of Federal regulations established 
              under the Federal Register Act. Under the provisions of 44 
              U.S.C. 1507, the contents of the CFR, a special edition of the 
              Federal Register, shall be judicially noticed. The CFR is 
              prima facie evidence of the original documents published in 
              the Federal Register (44 U.S.C. 1510).

          It is prohibited to use NARA's official seal and the stylized Code 
              of Federal Regulations logo on any republication of this 
              material without the express, written permission of the 
              Archivist of the United States or the Archivist's designee. 
              Any person using NARA's official seals and logos in a manner 
              inconsistent with the provisions of 36 CFR part 1200 is 
              subject to the penalties specified in 18 U.S.C. 506, 701, and 
              1017.

                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2009), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in eleven separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, Washington DC 20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R04>
         Subpart B_Specific Administrative Rulings and Decisions


<R05>
Sec. 500.23  Thermally processed low-acid foods packaged in
hermetically sealed containers.

    The provisions of part 113 of this chapter shall apply to the 
manufacture, processing or packing of low-acid foods in hermetically 
sealed containers, and intended for use as food for animals.

[61 FR 37681, July 19, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 500.24  Emergency permit control.

    The provisions of part 108 of this chapter shall apply to the 
issuance of emergency control permits for the manufacturer or packer of 
thermally processed low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed 
containers, and intended for use as food for animals.

[61 FR 37681, July 19, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 500.25  Anthelmintic drugs for use in animals.

    (a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that, in order 
to assure that anthelmintic drugs, including animal feeds bearing or 
containing such drugs, which do not carry the prescription statement are 
labeled to provide adequate directions for their effective use, labeling 
of these anthelmintic drugs shall bear, in addition to other required 
information, a statement that a veterinarian should be consulted for 
assistance in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of parasitism.
    (b) The label and any labeling furnishing or purporting to furnish 
directions for use, shall bear conspicuously the following statement: 
``Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, treatment, 
and control of parasitism.''

[[Page 6]]

    (c) For drugs covered by approved new animal drug applications, the 
labeling revisions required for compliance with this section may be 
placed into effect without prior approval, as provided for in Sec. 
514.8(c)(3) of this chapter. For drugs listed in the index, the labeling 
revisions required for compliance with this section may be placed into 
effect without prior granting of a request for a modification, as 
provided for in Sec. 516.161(b)(1) of this chapter.
    (d) Labeling revisions required for compliance with this section 
shall be placed into effect by February 25, 1975, following which, any 
such drugs that are introduced into interstate commerce and not in 
compliance with this section will be subject to regulatory proceedings.

[40 FR 13802, Mar. 27, 1975, as amended at 71 FR 74782, Dec. 13, 2006; 
72 FR 69120, Dec. 6, 2007]


<R05>
Sec. 500.26  Timed-release dosage form drugs.

    (a) Drugs are being offered in dosage forms that are designed to 
release the active ingredients over a prolonged period of time. There is 
a possibility of unsafe overdosage or ineffective dosage if such 
products are improperly made and the active ingredients are released at 
one time, over too short or too long a period of time, or not released 
at all. Drugs marketed in this form, which are referred to by such terms 
as timed-release, controlled-release, prolonged-release, sustained-
release, or delayed-release drugs, are regarded as new animal drugs 
within the meaning of section 201(v) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act.
    (b) Timed-release dosage form animal drugs that are introduced into 
interstate commerce are deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of 
section 501(a)(5) of the act and subject to regulatory action, unless 
such animal drug is the subject of an approved new animal drug 
application, or listed in the index, as required by paragraph (a) of 
this section.
    (c) The fact that the labeling of this kind of drug may claim 
delayed, prolonged, controlled, or sustained-release of all or only some 
of the active ingredients does not affect the new animal drug status of 
such articles. A new animal drug application or index listing is 
required in any such case.
    (d) New animal drug applications for timed-release dosage form 
animal drugs must contain, among other things, data to demonstrate 
safety and effectiveness by establishing that the article is 
manufactured using procedures and controls to ensure release of the 
total dosage at a safe and effective rate. Data submitted in the new 
animal drug application must demonstrate that the formulation of the 
drug and the procedures used in its manufacture will ensure release of 
the active ingredient(s) of the drug at a safe and effective rate and 
that these release characteristics will be maintained until the 
expiration date of the drug. When the drug is intended for use in food-
producing animals, data submitted must also demonstrate that, with 
respect to possible residues of the drug, food derived from treated 
animals is safe for consumption.

Sec. 500.27  Methylene blue-containing drugs for use in animals.

    (a) New information requires a re- evaluation of the status of drugs 
containing methylene blue (tetramethylthionine chloride) for oral use in 
cats or dogs.
    (1)(i) It has been demonstrated that two orally administered urinary 
antiseptic-antispasmodic preparations that contained methylene blue 
cause Heinz body hemolytic anemia in cats when used according to label 
directions. The specific cause of the reaction was determined to be the 
methylene blue contained in the preparations. The reaction can be severe 
enough to cause death of treated animals.
    (ii) The Heinz body hemolytic anemia reaction to methylene blue has 
also been demonstrated in dogs under laboratory conditions. The precise 
mechanism by which methylene blue produces the characteristic 
erythrocytic inclusion bodies (Heinz bodies) and associated hemolytic 
anemia is unclear.
    (2) The effectiveness of orally administered methylene blue as a 
urinary antiseptic is open to question. It appears that following oral 
administration,

[[Page 7]]

methylene blue is poorly and erratically absorbed and also slowly and 
erratically excreted in the urine. Studies in the dog indicate it is 
excreted in the urine essentially as leukomethylene blue stabilized in 
some manner. Methylene blue itself is stepwise demethylated in alkaline 
solutions (alkaline urine being a frequent consequence of urinary 
infection) to Azure B, Azure A, and Azure C. The antiseptic efficacy of 
all of these excretion products is unsubstantiated.
    (3) In view of the foregoing, the Commissioner has concluded that 
animal drugs containing methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs are 
neither safe nor generally recognized as effective within the meaning of 
section 201(v) of the act and are therefore considered new animal drugs. 
Accordingly, all prior formal and informal opinions expressed by the 
Food and Drug Administration that such drugs are ``not new drugs'' or 
``no longer new drugs'' are hereby revoked.
    (b) Animal drugs that contain methylene blue for oral use in cats or 
dogs and not the subject of an approved new animal drug application 
(NADA) are deemed to be adulterated under the provisions of section 
501(a) (5) and/or (6) and/or misbranded under section 502(a) of the act 
and subject to regulatory action as of April 10, 1978.
    (c) Sponsors of animal drugs that contain methylene blue for oral 
use in cats or dogs and not the subject of an approved new animal drug 
application (NADA) may submit an application in conformity with Sec. 
514.1 of this chapter. Such applications will be processed in accordance 
with section 512 of the act. Submission of an NADA will not constitute 
grounds for continued marketing of this drug substance until such 
application is approved.
    (d) New animal drug applications required by this regulation 
pursuant to section 512 of the act shall be submitted to the Food and 
Drug Administration. Center for Veterinary Medicine, Office of New 
Animal Drug Evaluation (HFV-100), 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD

Sec. 500.29  Gentian violet for use in animal feed.

    The Food and Drug Administration has determined that gentian violet 
is not generally recognized as safe for use in animal feed and is a food 
additive subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (the act), unless it is intended for use as a new animal drug, in 
which case it is subject to section 512 of the act. The Food and Drug 
Administration has determined that gentian violet is not prior 
sanctioned for any use in animal feed.

Sec. 500.30  Gentian violet for animal drug use.

    The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that gentian 
violet is not generally recognized as safe and effective for any 
veterinary drug use in food animals and is a new animal drug subject to 
section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. FDA has 
determined that gentian violet is not exempted from new animal drug 
status under the ``grandfather'' provisions of the Drug Amendments of 
1962 (21 U.S.C. 342).

Sec. 500.35  Animal feeds contaminated with Salmonella microorganisms.

    (a) Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers 
for Disease Control of the U.S. Public Health Service, the Animal Health 
Division of the Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, and by various State public health agencies have revealed 
that processed fish meal, poultry meal, meat meal, tankage, and other 
animal byproducts intended for use in animal feed may be contaminated 
with Salmonella bacteria, an organism pathogenic to man and animals. 
Contamination of these products may occur through inadequate heat 
treatment of the product during its processing or through 
recontamination of the heat-treated product during a time of improper 
storage or handling subsequent to processing.
    (b) Articles used in food for animals are included within the 
definition of

[[Page 8]]

food in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 
Further, Salmonella contamination of such animal feeds having the 
potentiality for producing infection and disease in animals must be 
regarded as an adulterant within the meaning of section 402(a) of the 
act. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration will regard as 
adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a) of the act shipments of 
the following when intended for animal feed and encountered in 
interstate commerce and found upon examination to be contaminated with 
Salmonella microorganisms: Bone meal, blood meal, crab meal, feather 
meal, fish meal, fish solubles, meat scraps, poultry meat meal, tankage, 
or other similar animal byproducts, or blended mixtures of these.

<R05>
Sec. 500.45  Use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in the 
production, handling, and storage of animal feed.

    (a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) represent a class of toxic 
industrial chemicals manufactured and sold under a variety of trade 
names, including: Aroclor (United States); Phenoclor (France); Colphen 
(Germany); and Kanaclor (Japan). PCB's are highly stable, heat 
resistant, and nonflammable chemicals. Industrial uses of PCB's include, 
or did include in the past, their use as electrical transformer and 
capacitor fluids, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, plasticizers, 
and in formulations of lubricants, coatings, and inks. Their unique 
physical and chemical properties and widespread, uncontrolled industrial 
applications have caused PCB's to be a persistent and ubiquitous 
contaminant in the environment, causing the contamination of certain 
foods. In addition, incidents have occurred in which PCB's have directly 
contaminated animal feeds as a result of industrial accidents (leakage 
or spillage of PCB fluids from plant equipment). These accidents in turn 
cause the contamination of food intended for human consumption (meat, 
milk, and eggs). Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration have 
revealed that heat exchange fluids for certain pasteurization equipment 
used in processing animal feed contain PCB's. Although heat exchange 
fluids in such equipment are considered to be in closed systems, leakage 
has occurred that resulted in direct contamination of animal feed with 
PCB's and subsequently resulted in the transfer of PCB's to human food 
produced by animals consuming the contaminated feed. The use of PCB-
containing coatings on the inner walls of silos has resulted in the 
contamination of silage which has in turn caused PCB residues in the 
milk of dairy cows consuming the contaminated silage. Since PCB's are 
toxic chemicals, the PCB contamination of food as a result of these and 
other incidents represent a hazard to public health. It is therefore 
necessary to place certain restrictions on the industrial uses of PCB's 
in the production, handling, and storage of animal feed.
    (b) The following special provisions are necessary to preclude 
accidental PCB contamination of animal feed:
    (1) Coatings or paints for use on the contact surfaces of feed 
storage areas may not contain PCB's or any other harmful or deleterious 
substances likely to contaminate feed.
    (2) New equipment or machinery for handling or processing feed in or 
around an establishment producing animal feed shall not contain PCB's.
    (3) On or before Sept. 4, 1973, the management of establishments 
producing animal feed shall:
    (i) Have the heat exchange fluid used in existing equipment or 
machinery for handling and processing feed sampled and tested to 
determine whether it contains PCB's, or verify the absence of PCB's in 
such formulations by other appropriate means. On or before Sept. 4, 
1973, any such fluid formulated with PCB's must to the fullest extent 
possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices, be 
replaced with a heat exchange fluid that does not contain PCB's.
    (ii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with 
current good manufacturing practices from the animal feed producing 
establishment any PCB-containing lubricants for equipment or machinery 
used for handling or processing animal feed.

[[Page 9]]

    (iii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with 
current good manufacturing practices from the animal feed producing 
establishment any other PCB-containing materials, whenever there is a 
reasonable expectation that such materials could cause animal feed to 
become contaminated with PCB's either as a result of normal use or as a 
result of accident, breakage, or other mishap.
    (iv) The toxicity and other characteristics of fluids selected as 
PCB replacements must be adequately determined so that the least 
potentially hazardous replacement should be used. In making this 
determination with respect to a given fluid, consideration should be 
given to (a) its toxicity; (b) the maximum quantity that could be 
spilled onto a given quantity of food before it would be noticed, taking 
into account its color and odor; (c) possible signaling devices in the 
equipment to indicate a loss of fluid, etc.; (d) and its environmental 
stability and tendency to survive and be concentrated through the food 
chain. The judgment as to whether a replacement fluid is sufficiently 
non-hazardous is to be made on an individual installation and operation 
basis.
    (c) For the purpose of this section, the provisions do not apply to 
electrical transformers and condensers containing PCB's in sealed 
containers.
    (d) For the purpose of this section, the term animal feed includes 
all articles used for food or drink for animals other than man.

Sec. 500.46  Hexachlorophene in animal drugs.

    (a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that there are 
no adequate data to establish that animal drugs containing 
hexachlorophene are safe and effective for any animal use other than in 
topical products for use on non-food-producing animals as part of a 
product preservative system at a level not to exceed 0.1 percent; that 
there is no information on the potential risk to humans from exposure to 
hexachlorophene by persons who apply animal products containing the drug 
at levels higher than 0.1 percent; and that there is likewise no 
information on human exposure to animals on which these animal drugs 
have been used and no information on possible residues of 
hexachlorophene in edible products of food-producing animals treated 
with new animal drugs that contain any quantity of hexachlorophene.
    (b) Animal drugs containing hexachlorophene for other than 
preservative use on non-food-producing animals at levels not exceeding 
0.1 percent are considered new animal drugs and shall be the subject of 
new animal drug applications (NADA's).
    (c) Any person currently marketing animal drugs that contain 
hexachlorophene other than as part of a product preservative system for 
products used on non-food-producing animals at a level not exceeding 0.1 
percent shall submit a new animal drug application, supplement an 
existing application, or reformulate the product by September 29, 1977. 
Each application or supplemental application shall include adequate data 
to establish that the animal drug is safe and effective. If the animal 
drug is currently subject to an approved new animal drug application, 
each reformulation shall require an approved supplemental application. 
The interim marketing of these animal drugs may continue until the 
application has been approved, until it has been determined that the 
application is not approvable under the provisions of Sec. 514.111 of 
this chapter, or until an existing approved application has been 
withdrawn.
    (d) After September 29, 1977, animal drugs that contain 
hexachlorophene other than for preservative use on non-food-producing 
animals at a level not exceeding 0.1 percent that are introduced into 
interstate commerce shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning 
of section 501(a)(5) of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5)) unless such animal 
drug is the subject of a new animal drug application submitted pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section. Action to withdraw approval of new 
animal drug applications will be initiated if supplemental new animal 
drug applications have not been submitted in accordance with this 
section.
    (e) New animal drug applications submitted for animal drugs 
containing hexachlorophene for use in or on food-

[[Page 10]]

producing animals shall include adequate data to assure that edible 
products from treated animals are safe for human consumption under the 
labeled conditions of use.

<R05>
Sec. 500.51  Labeling of animal drugs; misbranding.

    (a) Among the representations on the label or labeling of an animal 
drug which will render the drug misbranded are any broad statements 
suggesting or implying that the drug is not safe and effective for use 
when used in accordance with labeling direction, or suggesting or 
implying that the labeling does not contain adequate warnings or 
adequate directions for use. Such statements include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Any statement that disclaims liability when the drug is used in 
accordance with directions for use contained on the label or labeling.
    (2) Any statement that disclaims liability when the drug is used 
under ``abnormal'' or ``unforeseeable'' conditions.
    (3) Any statement limiting the warranty for the products to a 
warranty that the drug in the package contains the ingredients listed on 
the label.
    (b) This regulation is not intended to prohibit any liability 
disclaimer that purports to limit the amount of damages or that sets 
forth the legal theory under which damages are to be recovered.
    (c) Any person wishing to obtain an evaluation of an animal drug 
liability disclaimer under this regulation may submit it to Division of 
Compliance, (HFV-230), Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug 
Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855. A supplemental 
NADA providing appropriately revised labeling shall be submitted for any 
approved new animal drug the labeling of which is not in compliance with 
this regulation.

<R05>
Sec. 500.52  Use of terms such as ``tonic'', ``tone'', ``toner'', o
r ``conditioner'' in the labeling of preparations intended for use

in or on animals.

    (a) The use of terms such as tonic, tone, toner, and similar terms 
in the labeling of a product intended for use in or on animals implies 
that such product is capable of a therapeutic effect(s) and causes such 
a product to be a drug within the meaning of section 201(g) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The unqualified use of such terms 
in a product's labeling fails to provide adequate directions and 
indications for use of such product and causes it to be misbranded 
within the meaning of section 502(a) and (f)(1) of the act. The terms 
tonic, tone, toner, and similar terms may be used in labeling only when 
appropriately qualified so as to fully inform the user regarding the 
intended use(s) of the product.
    (b) The unqualified use of the term conditioner and similar terms in 
the labeling of a product intended for use in or on animals implies that 
such product is capable of a therapeutic effect(s) and causes such a 
product to be a drug within the meaning of section 201(g) of the act. 
The unqualified use of such terms in a product's labeling fails to 
provide adequate directions and indications for use of such product and 
causes it to be misbranded within the meaning of section 502(a) and 
(f)(1) of the act. The term conditioner and similar terms may be used in 
labeling only when appropriately qualified so as to fully inform the 
user regarding the intended use(s) of the product. A product labeled as 
a ``conditioner'' or with a similar term can be either a food or drug 
depending upon the manner in

[[Page 11]]

which the term is qualified in the labeling to reflect the product's 
intended use.
    (c) An article so qualified as to be represented as a drug must be 
the subject of an approved new animal drug application unless the use of 
the article under the conditions set forth in its labeling is generally 
recognized as safe and effective among experts qualified by scientific 
training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 
animal drugs.


<R05>
Sec. 500.55  Exemption from certain drug-labeling requirements.

    (a) Section 201.105(c) of this chapter provides that in the case of 
certain drugs for which directions, hazards, warnings, and use 
information are commonly known to practitioners licensed by law, such 
information may be omitted from the dispensing package. Under this 
proviso, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will offer an opinion, upon 
written request, stating reasonable grounds therefore on a proposal to 
omit such information from the dispensing package.
    (b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has considered submitted 
material covering a number of drug products and has offered the opinion 
that the following drugs when intended for those veterinary uses for 
which they are now generally employed by the veterinary medical 
profession, should be exempt from the requirements of Sec. 201.105(c) 
of this chapter, provided that they meet the conditions prescribed in 
this paragraph. Preparations that are not in dosage unit form (for 
example, solutions) will be regarded as meeting the conditions with 
respect to the maximum quantity of drug per dosage unit if they are 
prepared in a manner that enables accurate and ready administration of a 
quantity of drug not in excess of the stated maximum per dosage unit:

Atropine sulfate. As an injectable for cattle, goats, horses, pigs, and 
sheep, not in excess of 15 milligrams per dosage unit; as an injectable 
for cats and dogs, not in excess of 0.6 milligram per dosage unit.
Barbital sodium. For oral use in cats and dogs, not in excess of 300 
milligrams per dosage unit.
Epinephrine injection. 1:1,000. For cats, dogs, cattle, goats, horses, 
pigs, and sheep (except as provided in Sec. 500.65).
Morphine sulfate. As an injectable for dogs, not in excess of 15 
milligrams per dosage unit.
Pentobarbital sodium. For oral use in cats and dogs, not in excess of 
100 milligrams per dosage unit.
Phenobarbital sodium. For oral use in cats and dogs, not in excess of 
100 milligrams per dosage unit.
Procaine hydrochloride injection. Containing not in excess of 2 percent 
procaine hydrochloride, with or without epinephrine up to a 
concentration of 1:50,000. For use in cats, dogs, cattle, goats, horses, 
pigs, and sheep.
Thyroid. For oral use in dogs, not in excess of 60 milligrams per dosage 
unit.

<R05>
Sec. 500.65  Epinephrine injection 1:1,000 in 10-milliliter containers
for emergency treatment of anaphylactoid shock in cattle, horses,

sheep, and swine.

    (a) Anaphylactoid reactions in cattle, horses, sheep, and swine 
occur occasionally from the injection of antibiotics, bacterins, and 
vaccines. Adequate directions for use of these antibiotics, bacterins, 
and vaccines can generally be written for use by the laity and thus are 
available to livestock producers. Epinephrine injection is effective for 
the treatment of anaphylactoid reactions in animals and would be of 
value in saving lives of animals if it were readily available at the 
time of administration of the causative agents. In connection with this 
problem the Food and Drug Administration has obtained the views of the 
Advisory Committee on Veterinary Medicine, and other experts, and has 
concluded that adequate directions for over-the-counter sale of 
epinephrine injection 1:1,000 can be prepared.
    (b) In view of the above, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has 
concluded that it is in the public interest to make epinephrine 
injection 1:1,000 available for sale without a prescription provided 
that it is packaged in vials not exceeding 10 milliliters and its label 
bears, in addition to other required information, the following 
statements in a prominent and conspicuous manner: ``For emergency use 
only in treating

[[Page 12]]

anaphylactoid shock. Usual Dosage: Cattle, horses, sheep, and swine--1 
cubic centimeter per 100 pounds of body weight. Inject subcutaneously''.
    (c) The labeling must also bear a description of the symptoms of 
anaphylactoid shock including glassy eyes, increased salivation, 
grinding of the teeth, rapid breathing, muscular tremors, staggering 
gait, and collapse with death following. These symptoms may appear 
shortly after injection of a bacterin, vaccine, or antibiotic.

<R05>
Sec. 500.80  Scope of this subpart.

    (a) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires that sponsored 
compounds intended for use in food-producing animals be shown to be safe 
and that food produced from animals exposed to these compounds be shown 
to be safe for consumption by people. The statute prohibits the use in 
food-producing animals of any compound found to induce cancer when 
ingested by people or animals unless it can be determined by methods of 
examination prescribed or approved by the Secretary (a function 
delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs) that no residue of that 
compound will be found in the food produced from those animals under 
conditions of use reasonably certain to be followed in practice. This 
subpart identifies the steps a sponsor of a compound shall follow to 
secure the approval of the compound. FDA guidance documents contain the 
procedures and protocols FDA recommends for the implementation of this 
subpart. These guidance documents are available from the Division of 
Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers 
Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. Requests for these guidance 
documents should be identified with Docket No. 1983D-0288.
    (b) If FDA concludes on the basis of the threshold assessment that a 
sponsor shall conduct carcinogenicity testing on the sponsored compound, 
FDA will also determine whether and to what extent the sponsor shall 
conduct carcinogenicity testing on metabolites of the sponsored 
compound. The bioassays that a sponsor conducts must be designed to 
assess carcinogenicity and to determine the quantitative aspects of any 
carcinogenic response.
    (c) If FDA concludes on the basis of the threshold assessment or at 
a later time during the approval process that the data show that the 
sponsored compound and its metabolites should not be subject to this 
subpart, FDA will continue to consider the compound for approval under 
the general safety provisions of the act for risks other than cancer.
    (d) This subpart does not apply to essential nutrients.

Sec. 500.82  Definitions.

    (a) The definitions and interpretations contained in section 201 of 
the act apply to those terms when used in this subpart.
    (b) The following definitions apply to this subpart:
    Act means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sections 201-
901, 52 Stat. 1040 et seq. as amended (21 U.S.C. 301-392)).
    Essential nutrients means compounds that are found in the tissues of 
untreated, healthy target animals and not produced in sufficient 
quantity to support the animal's growth, development, function, or 
reproduction, e.g., vitamins, essential minerals, essential amino acids, 
and essential fatty acids. These compounds must be supplied from 
external sources.
    FDA means the Food and Drug Administration.
    Limit of detection (LOD) means the lowest concentration of analyte 
that can be confirmed by the approved regulatory method.
    Marker residue means the residue selected for assay whose 
concentration is in a known relationship to the concentration of the 
residue of carcinogenic concern in the last tissue to deplete to its 
S<INF>m</INF>.

[[Page 13]]

    Preslaughter withdrawal period or milk discard time means the time 
after cessation of administration of the sponsored compound at which no 
residue is detectable in the edible product using the approved 
regulatory method (i.e., the marker residue is below the LOD).
    Regulatory method means the aggregate of all experimental procedures 
for measuring and confirming the presence of the marker residue of the 
sponsored compound in the target tissue of the target animal.
    R<INF>m</INF> means the concentration of the marker residue in the 
target tissue when the residue of carcinogenic concern is equal to 
S<INF>m</INF>.
    Residue means any compound present in edible tissues of the target 
animal which results from the use of the sponsored compound, including 
the sponsored compound, its metabolites, and any other substances formed 
in or on food because of the sponsored compound's use.
    Residue of carcinogenic concern means all compounds in the total 
residue of a demonstrated carcinogen excluding any compounds judged by 
FDA not to present a carcinogenic risk.
    S<INF>m</INF> means the concentration of residue in a specific 
edible tissue corresponding to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in the 
test animals of 1 in 1 million.
    S<INF>o</INF> means the concentration of the test compound in the 
total diet of test animals that corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk 
of cancer in the test animals of 1 in 1 million. For the purpose of this 
subpart, FDA will also assume that this S<INF>o</INF> will correspond to 
the concentration of residue of carcinogenic concern in the total human 
diet that represents no significant increase in the risk of cancer to 
people.
    Sponsor means the person or organization proposing or holding an 
approval by FDA for the use of a sponsored compound.
    Sponsored compound means any drug or food additive or color additive 
proposed for use, or used, in food-producing animals or in their feed.
    Target animals means the production class of animals in which a 
sponsored compound is proposed or intended for use.
    Target tissue means the edible tissue selected to monitor for 
residues in the target animals, including, where appropriate, milk or 
eggs.
    Test animals means the species selected for use in the toxicity 
tests.
    Threshold assessment means FDA's review of data and information 
about a sponsored compound to determine whether chronic bioassays in 
test animals are necessary to resolve questions concerning the 
carcinogenicity of the compound.

Sec. 500.84  Conditions for approval of the sponsored compound.

    (a) On the basis of the results of the chronic bioassays and other 
information, FDA will determine whether any of the substances tested are 
carcinogenic.
    (b) If FDA concludes that the results of the bioassays do not 
establish carcinogenicity, then FDA will not subject the sponsored 
compound to the remainder of the requirements of this subpart.
    (c) For each sponsored compound that FDA decides should be regulated 
as a carcinogen, FDA will analyze the data from the bioassays using a 
statistical extrapolation procedure.
    (1) For each substance tested in separate bioassays, FDA will 
calculate the concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern that 
corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk to the test animal of 1 in 1 
million. FDA will designate the lowest value obtained as S<INF>o</INF>. 
Because the total diet is not derived from food-producing animals, FDA 
will make corrections for food intake. FDA will designate as 
S<INF>m</INF> the concentration of residue in a specific edible tissue 
corresponding to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in test animals of 1 
in 1 million.
    (2) From the appropriate residue chemistry data FDA will calculate 
the R<INF>m</INF> as described in Sec. 500.86(c). The sponsor must 
provide a regulatory method in accordance with Sec. 500.88(b). FDA will 
calculate the LOD of the method from data submitted by the sponsor under 
Sec. 500.88. The LOD must be less than or equal to R<INF>m</INF>.

[[Page 14]]

    (3) FDA will conclude that the provisions of this subpart are 
satisfied when no residue of the compound is detectable (that is, the 
marker residue is below the LOD) using the approved regulatory method 
under the conditions of use of the sponsored compound, including any 
required preslaughter withdrawal period or milk discard time.

<R05>
Sec. 500.86  Marker residue and target tissue.

    (a) For each edible tissue, the sponsor shall measure the depletion 
of the residue of carcinogenic concern until its concentration is at or 
below S<INF>m</INF>.
    (b) In one or more edible tissues, the sponsor shall also measure 
the depletion of one or more potential marker residues until the 
concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern is at or below 
S<INF>m</INF>.
    (c) From these data, FDA will select a target tissue and a marker 
residue and designate the concentration of marker residue 
(R<INF>m</INF>) that the regulatory method must be capable of measuring 
in the target tissue. FDA will select R<INF>m</INF> such that the 
absence of the marker residue in the target tissue above R<INF>m</INF> 
can be taken as confirmation that the residue of carcinogenic concern 
does not exceed S<INF>m</INF> in each of the edible tissues and, 
therefore, that the residue of carcinogenic concern in the diet of 
people does not exceed S<INF>o</INF>.
    (d) When a compound is to be used in milk- or egg-producing animals, 
milk or eggs must be the target tissue in addition to the tissue 
selected to monitor for residues in the edible carcass.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0910-0228)


<R05>
Sec. 500.88  Regulatory method.

    (a) The sponsor shall submit for evaluation and validation a 
regulatory method developed to monitor compliance with FDA's operational 
definition of no residue.
    (b) The regulatory method must be able to confirm the identity of 
the marker residue in the target tissue at a minimum concentration 
corresponding to the R<INF>m</INF>. FDA will determine the LOD from the 
submitted analytical method validation data.
    (c) FDA will publish in the Federal Register the complete regulatory 
method for ascertaining the marker residue in the target tissue in 
accordance with the provisions of sections 409(c)(3)(A), 512(d)(1)(I), 
and 721(b)(5)(B) of the act.

Sec. 500.90  Waiver of requirements.

    In response to a petition or on the Commissioner's own initiative, 
the Commissioner may waive, in whole or in part, the requirements of 
this subpart except those provided under Sec. 500.88. A petition for 
this waiver may be filed by any person who would be adversely affected 
by the application of the requirements to a particular compound. The 
petition shall explain and document why the requirements from which a 
waiver is requested are not reasonably applicable to the compound, and 
set forth clearly the reasons why the alternative procedures will 
provide the basis for concluding that approval of the compound satisfies 
the requirements of the anticancer provisions of the act. If the 
Commissioner determines that waiver of any of the requirements of this 
subpart is appropriate, the Commissioner will state the basis for that 
determination in the regulation approving marketing of the sponsored 
compound.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 
0910-0228)


<R05>
Sec. 500.92  Implementation.

    (a) This subpart E applies to all new animal drug applications, food 
additive petitions, and color additive petitions concerning any compound 
intended for use in food-producing animals (including supplemental 
applications and amendments to petitions).
    (b) This subpart E also applies in the following manner to compounds 
already approved:
    (1) For those compounds that FDA determines may induce cancer when 
ingested by man or animals, i.e., suspect

[[Page 15]]

carcinogens, Sec. Sec. 500.80(b), 500.82, and 500.90 apply.
    (2) For those compounds that FDA determines have been shown to 
induce cancer when ingested by man or animals, Sec. Sec. 500.82 through 
500.90 apply.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 501.1  Principal display panel of package form animal food.

    The term principal display panel as it applies to food in package 
form and as used in this part, means the part of a label that is most 
likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary 
conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel shall 
be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information 
required to be placed thereon by this part with clarity and 
conspicuousness and without obscuring design, vignettes, or crowding. 
Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information 
required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated 
on each principal display panel. For the purpose of obtaining uniform 
type size in declaring the quantity of contents for all packages of 
substantially the same size, the term area of the principal display 
panel means the area of the side or surface that bears the principal 
display panel, which area shall be:
    (a) In the case of a rectangular package where one entire side 
properly can be considered to be the principal display panel side, the 
product of the height times the width of that side;
    (b) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40 
percent of the product of the height of the container times the 
circumference;
    (c) In the case of any otherwise shaped container, 40 percent of the 
total surface of the container: Provided, however, That where such 
container presents an obvious principal display panel such as the top of 
a triangular or circular package, the area shall consist of the entire 
top surface. In determining the area of the principal display panel, 
exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at tops and bottoms of cans, and 
shoulders and necks of bottles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or 
nearly cylindrical containers, information required by this part to 
appear on the principal display panel shall appear within that 40 
percent of the circumference which is most likely to be displayed, 
presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for 
retail sale.

<R05>
Sec. 501.2  Information panel of package for animal food.

    (a) The term information panel as it applies to packaged food means 
that part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the 
principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the 
principal display panel with the following exceptions:
    (1) If the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right 
of the principal display panel is too small to accommodate the necessary 
information or is otherwise unusable label space, e.g., folded flaps or 
can ends, the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part 
of the label may be used.
    (2) If the package has one or more alternate principal display 
panels, the information panel is immediately contiguous and to the right 
of any principal display panel.
    (3) If the top of the container is the principal display panel and 
the package has no alternate principal display panel, the information 
panel is any panel adjacent to the principal display panel.
    (b) All information required to appear on the label of any package 
of food pursuant to Sec. Sec. 501.4, 501.5, 501.8 and 501.17 shall 
appear either on the principal display panel or on the information 
panel, unless otherwise specified by regulations in this chapter.
    (c) All information appearing on the principal display panel or the 
information panel pursuant to this section shall appear prominently and 
conspicuously, but in no case may the letters and/or numbers be less 
than \1/16\ inch in height unless an exemption pursuant to paragraph (f) 
of this section is established. The requirements for conspicuousness and 
legibility shall include the specifications of Sec. Sec. 501.15 and 
501.105(h) (1) and (2).
    (1) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of 
this paragraph: Provided, That:
    (i) The package is designed such that it has a surface area that can 
bear an information panel and/or an alternate principal display panel.
    (ii) The area of surface available for labeling on the principal 
display panel of the package as this term is defined in Sec. 501.1 is 
less than 10 square inches.
    (iii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in 
accordance with regulations in this part.
    (iv) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section 
appears on the principal display panel or information panel label in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the 
type size is not less than \3/64\ inch in height.
    (2) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of 
this paragraph: Provided, That:
    (i) The package is designed such that it has a single obvious 
principal display panel as this term is defined in Sec. 501.1 and has 
no other available surface area for an information panel or alternate 
principal display panel.
    (ii) The area of surface available for labeling on the principal 
display panel of the package as this term is defined in Sec. 501.1 is 
less than 12 square inches and bears all labeling appearing on the 
package.
    (iii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in 
accordance with regulations in this part.
    (iv) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section 
appears on the single, obvious principal display panel in accordance 
with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the type size is 
not less than \1/32\ inch in height.
    (3) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of 
this paragraph: Provided, That:
    (i) The package is designed such that it has a total surface area 
available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches.
    (ii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in 
accordance with regulations in this part.
    (iii) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section 
appears on the principal display panel or information panel label in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the 
type size is not less than \1/32\ inch in height.
    (d) All information required to appear on the principal display 
panel or on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear 
on the same panel unless there is insufficient space. In determining the 
sufficiency of the available space, any vignettes, design,

[[Page 17]]

and other nonmandatory label information shall not be considered. If 
there is insufficient space for all of this information to appear on a 
single panel, it may be divided between these two panels except that the 
information required pursuant to any given section or part shall all 
appear on the same panel. A food whose label is required to bear the 
ingredient statement on the principal display panel may bear all other 
information specified in paragraph (b) of this section on the 
information panel.
    (e) All information appearing on the information panel pursuant to 
this section shall appear in one place without other intervening 
material.
    (f) If the label of any package of food is too small to accommodate 
all of the information required by Sec. Sec. 501.4, 501.5, 501.8, and 
501.17, the Commissioner may establish by regulation an acceptable 
alternative method of disseminating such information to the public, 
e.g., a type size smaller than one-sixteenth inch in height, or labeling 
attached to or inserted in the package or available at the point of 
purchase. A petition requesting such a regulation, as an amendment to 
this paragraph shall be submitted pursuant to part 10 of this chapter.

[41 FR 38619, Sept. 10, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 4716, Jan. 25, 1977; 
42 FR 15675, Mar. 22, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 501.3  Identity labeling of animal food in package form.

    (a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear 
as one of its principal features a statement of the identity of the 
commodity.
    (b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of:
    (1) The name now or hereafter specified in or required by any 
applicable Federal law or regulation; or, in the absence thereof,
    (2) The common or usual name of the food; or, in the absence 
thereof,
    (3) An appropriately descriptive term, or when the nature of the 
food is obvious, a fanciful name commonly used by the public for such 
food.
    (c) Where a food is marketed in various optional forms (whole, 
slices, diced, etc.), the particular form shall be considered to be a 
necessary part of the statement of identity and shall be declared in 
letters of a type size bearing a reasonable relation to the size of the 
letters forming the other components of the statement of identity; 
except that if the optional form is visible through the container or is 
depicted by an appropriate vignette, the particular form need not be 
included in the statement. This specification does not affect the 
required declarations of identity under definitions and standards for 
foods promulgated pursuant to section 401 of the act.
    (d) This statement of identity shall be presented in bold type on 
the principal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to 
the most prominent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines 
generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is 
designed to be displayed.
    (e) Under the provisions of section 403(c) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is 
an imitation of another food unless its label bears, in type of uniform 
size and prominence, the word imitation and, immediately thereafter, the 
name of the food imitated.
    (1) A food shall be deemed to be an imitation and thus subject to 
the requirements of section 403(c) of the act if it is a substitute for 
and resembles another food but is nutritionally inferior to that food.
    (2) A food that is a substitute for and resembles another food shall 
not be deemed to be an imitation provided it meets each of the following 
requirements:
    (i) It is not nutritionally inferior to the food for which it 
substitutes and which it resembles.
    (ii) Its label bears a common or usual name that complies with the 
provisions of Sec. 502.5 of this chapter and that is not false or 
misleading, or in the absence of an existing common or usual name, an 
appropriately descriptive term that is not false or misleading. The 
label may, in addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or 
misleading.
    (3) A food for which a common or usual name is established by 
regulation (e.g., in a standard of identity pursuant to section 401 of 
the act, in a common or usual name regulation and may, in

[[Page 18]]

addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or misleading, and 
established pursuant to part 502 of this chapter), and which complies 
with all of the applicable requirements of such regulation(s), shall not 
be deemed to be an imitation.
    (4) Nutritional inferiority includes:
    (i) Any reduction in the content of an essential nutrient that is 
present in a measurable amount.
    (ii) If the Commissioner concludes that a food is a substitute for 
and resembles another food but is inferior to the food imitated for 
reasons other than those set forth in this paragraph, he may propose 
appropriate revisions to this regulation or he may propose a separate 
regulation governing the particular food.
    (f) A label may be required to bear the percentage(s) of a 
characterizing ingredient(s) or information concerning the presence or 
absence of an ingredient(s) or the need to add an ingredient(s) as part 
of the common or usual name of the food pursuant to part 502 of this 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 501.4  Animal food; designation of ingredients.

    (a) Ingredients required to be declared on the label of a food, 
including foods that comply with standards of identity that require 
labeling in compliance with this part 501, except those exempted by 
Sec. 501.100, shall be listed by common or usual name in descending 
order of predominance by weight on either the principal display panel or 
the information panel in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 501.2.
    (b) The name of an ingredient shall be a specific name and not a 
collective (generic) name, except that:
    (1) Spices, flavorings, colorings and chemical preservatives shall 
be declared according to the provisions of Sec. 501.22.
    (2) An ingredient which itself contains two or more ingredients and 
which has an established common or usual name, conforms to a standard 
established pursuant to the Meat Inspection or Poultry Products 
Inspection Acts by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or conforms to a 
definition and standard of identity established pursuant to section 401 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, shall be designated in the 
statement of ingredients on the label of such food by either of the 
following alternatives:
    (i) By declaring the established common or usual name of the 
ingredient followed by a parenthetical listing of all ingredients 
contained therein in descending order of predominance except that, if 
the ingredient is a food subject to a definition and standard of 
identity established in this subchapter E, only the ingredients required 
to be declared by the definition and standard of identity need be 
listed; or
    (ii) By incorporating into the statement of ingredients in 
descending order of predominance in the finished food, the common or 
usual name of every component of the ingredient without listing the 
ingredient itself.
    (3) Skim milk, concentrated skim milk, reconstituted skim milk, and 
nonfat dry milk may be declared as skim milk or nonfat milk.
    (4) Milk, concentrated milk, reconstituted milk, and dry whole milk 
may be declared as milk.
    (5) Bacterial cultures may be declared by the word cultured followed 
by the name of the substrate, e.g., made from cultured skim milk or 
cultured buttermilk.
    (6) Sweetcream buttermilk, concentrated sweetcream buttermilk, 
reconstituted sweetcream buttermilk, and dried sweetcream buttermilk may 
be declared as buttermilk.
    (7) Whey, concentrated whey, reconstituted whey, and dried whey may 
be declared as whey.
    (8) Cream, reconstituted cream, dried cream, and plastic cream 
(sometimes known as concentrated milkfat) may be declared as cream.
    (9) Butteroil and anhydrous butterfat may be declared as butterfat.
    (10) Dried whole eggs, frozen whole eggs, and liquid whole eggs may 
be declared as eggs.
    (11) Dried egg whites, frozen egg whites, and liquid egg whites may 
be declared as egg whites.
    (12) Dried egg yolks, frozen egg yolks, and liquid egg yolks may be 
declared as egg yolks.

[[Page 19]]

    (13) A livestock or poultry feed may be declared by a collective 
name listed in Sec. 501.110 if it is an animal feed within the meaning 
of section 201(w) of the act and meets the requirements for the use of a 
collective name as prescribed in Sec. 501.110 for certain feed 
ingredients.
    (14) [Reserved]
    (15) When all the ingredients of a wheat flour are declared in an 
ingredient statement, the principal ingredient of the flour shall be 
declared by the name(s) specified in Sec. Sec. 137.105, 137.200, 
137.220, 137.225 of this chapter, i.e., the first ingredient designated 
in the ingredient list of flour, or bromated flour, or enriched flour, 
or self-rising flour is flour, white flour, wheat flour, or plain flour; 
the first ingredient designated in the ingredient list of durum flour is 
durum flour; the first ingredient designated in the ingredient list of 
whole wheat flour, or bromated whole wheat flour is whole wheat flour, 
graham flour, or entire wheat flour; and the first ingredient designated 
in the ingredient list of whole durum wheat flour is whole durum wheat 
flour.
    (c) When water is added to reconstitute, completely or partially, an 
ingredient permitted by paragraph (b) of this section to be declared by 
a class name, the position of the ingredient class name in the 
ingredient statement shall be determined by the weight of the 
unreconstituted ingredient plus the weight of the quantity of water 
added to reconstitute that ingredient, up to the amount of water needed 
to reconstitute the ingredient to single strength. Any water added in 
excess of the amount of water needed to reconstitute the ingredient to 
single strength shall be declared as water in the ingredient statement.

60 FR 38480, July 27, 1995]


<R05>
Sec. 501.5  Animal food; name and place of business of manufacturer,
packer, or distributor.

    (a) The label of a food in packaged form shall specify conspicuously 
the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or 
distributor.
    (b) The requirement for declaration of the name of the manufacturer, 
packer, or distributor shall be deemed to be satisfied, in the case of a 
corporation, only by the actual corporate name, which may be preceded or 
followed by the name of the particular division of the corporation. In 
the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under 
which the business is conducted shall be used.
    (c) Where the food is not manufactured by the person whose name 
appears on the label, the name shall be qualified by a phrase that 
reveals the connection such person has with such food; such as 
``Manufactured for ------------,'' ``Distributed by ------------,'' or 
any other wording that expresses the facts.
    (d) The statement of the place of business shall include the street 
address, city, state, and ZIP Code; however, the street address may be 
omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone 
directory. The requirement for inclusion of the ZIP Code shall apply 
only to consumer commodity labels developed or revised after the 
effective date of this section. In the case of nonconsumer packages, the 
ZIP Code shall appear either on the label or the labeling (including 
invoice).
    (e) If a person manufactures, packs, or distributes a food at a 
place other than his principal place of business, the label may state 
the principal place of business in lieu of the actual place where such 
food was manufactured or packed or is to be distributed, unless such 
statement would be misleading.


<R05>
Sec. 501.8  Labeling of animal food with number of servings.

    (a) The label of any package of a food which bears a representation 
as to the number of servings contained in such package shall bear in 
immediate conjunction with such statement, and in the same size type as 
is used for such statement, a statement of the net quantity (in terms of 
weight, measure, or numerical count) of each such serving; however, such 
statement may be expressed in terms that differ from the terms used in 
the required statement of net quantity of contents (for example, 
cupfuls, tablespoonfuls, etc.) when such differing term is common to 
cookery and describes a constant quantity.

[[Page 20]]

Such statement may not be misleading in any particular. A statement of 
the number of units in a package is not in itself a statement of the 
number of servings.
    (b) If there exists a voluntary product standard promulgated 
pursuant to the procedures found in 15 CFR part 10 by the Department of 
Commerce, quantitatively defining the meaning of the term serving with 
respect to a particular food, then any label representation as to the 
number of servings in such packaged food shall correspond with such 
quantitative definition. (Copies of published standards are available 
upon request from the National Bureau of Standards, Department of 
Commerce, Washington, DC 20234.)


<R05>
Sec. 501.15  Animal food; prominence of required statements.

    (a) A word, statement, or other information required by or under 
authority of the act to appear on the label may lack that prominence and 
conspicuousness required by section 403(f) of the act by reason (among 
other reasons) of:
    (1) The failure of such word, statement, or information to appear on 
the part or panel of the label which is presented or displayed under 
customary conditions of purchase;
    (2) The failure of such word, statement, or information to appear on 
two or more parts or panels of the label, each of which has sufficient 
space therefor, and each of which is so designed as to render it likely 
to be, under customary conditions of purchase, the part or panel 
displayed;
    (3) The failure of the label to extend over the area of the 
container or package available for such extension, so as to provide 
sufficient label space for the prominent placing of such word, 
statement, or information;
    (4) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such 
word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space 
for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or 
under authority of the act to appear on the label;
    (5) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such 
word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space 
to give materially greater conspicuousness to any other word, statement, 
or information, or to any design or device; or
    (6) Smallness or style of type in which such word, statement, or 
information appears, insufficient background contrast, obscuring designs 
or vignettes, or crowding with other written, printed, or graphic 
matter.
    (b) No exemption depending on insufficiency of label space, as 
prescribed in regulations promulgated under section 403(e) or (i) of the 
act, shall apply if such insufficiency is caused by:
    (1) The use of label space for any word, statement, design, or 
device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear

    (2) The use of label space to give greater conspicuousness to any 
word, statement, or other information that is required by section 403(f) 
of the act; or
    (3) The use of label space for any representation in a foreign 
language.
    (c)(1) All words, statements, and other information required by or 
under authority of the act to appear on the label or labeling shall 
appear thereon in the English language: Provided, however, That in the 
case of articles distributed solely in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
or in a territory where the predominant language is one other than 
English, the predominant language may be substituted for English.
    (2) If the label contains any representation in a foreign language, 
all words, statements, and other information required by or under 
authority of the act to appear on the label shall appear thereon in the 
foreign language.
    (3) If any article of labeling (other than a label) contains any 
representation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other 
information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the 
label or labeling shall appear on such article of labeling.

<R05>
Sec. 501.18  Misbranding of animal food.

    (a) Among representations in the labeling of a food which render 
such food misbranded is a false or misleading representation with 
respect to another food or a drug, device, or cosmetic.
    (b) The labeling of a food which contains two or more ingredients 
may be misleading by reason (among other reasons) of the designation of 
such food in such labeling by a name which includes or suggests the name 
of one or more but not all such ingredients, even though the names of 
all such ingredients are stated elsewhere in the labeling.
    (c) Among representations in the labeling of a food which render 
such food misbranded is any representation that expresses or implies a 
geographical origin of the food or any ingredient of the food except 
when such representation is either:
    (1) A truthful representation of geographical origin.
    (2) A trademark or trade name provided that as applied to the 
article in question its use is not deceptively misdescriptive. A 
trademark or trade name comprised in whole or in part of geographical 
words shall not be considered deceptively misdescriptive if it:
    (i) Has been so long and exclusively used by a manufacturer or 
distributor that it is generally understood by the consumer to mean the 
product of a particular manufacturer or distributor; or
    (ii) Is so arbitrary or fanciful that it is not generally understood 
by the consumer to suggest geographic origin.
    (3) A part of the name required by applicable Federal law or 
regulation.
    (4) A name whose market significance is generally understood by the 
consumer to connote a particular class, kind, type, or style of food 
rather than to indicate geographical origin.

          Subpart B_Specific Animal Food Labeling Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 501.22  Animal foods; labeling of spices, flavorings, colorings,
and chemical preservatives.

    (a)(1) The term artificial flavor or artificial flavoring means any 
substance, the function of which is to impart flavor, which is not 
derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable 
juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant 
material, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation 
products thereof. Artificial flavor includes the substances listed in 
Sec. Sec. 172.515(b) and 582.60 of this chapter except where these are 
derived from natural sources.
    (2) The term spice means any aromatic vegetable substance in the 
whole, broken, or ground form, except for those substances which have 
been traditionally regarded as foods, such as onions, garlic and celery; 
whose significant function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional; 
that is true to name; and from which no portion of any volatile oil or 
other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices 
listed in subpart A of part 582 of this chapter, such as the following:

Allspice, Anise, Basil, Bay leaves, Caraway seed, Cardamon, Celery seed, 
Chervil, Cinnamon, Cloves, Coriander, Cumin seed, Dill seed, Fennel 
seed, Fenugreek, Ginger, Horseradish, Mace, Marjoram, Mustard flour,

red; Rosemary, Saffron, Sage, Savory, Star aniseed, Tarragon, Thyme, 
Turmeric.


Paprika, turmeric, and saffron or other spices which are also colors, 
shall be declared as spice and coloring unless declared by their common 
or usual name.
    (3) The term natural flavor or natural flavoring means the essential 
oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, 
or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the 
flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, 
vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf 
or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, 
or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is 
flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors, include the natural 
essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in subpart A of part 
582 of this chapter, and the substances listed in Sec. 172.510 of this 
chapter.
    (4) The term artificial color or artificial coloring means any color 
additive as defined in Sec. 70.3(f) of this chapter.
    (5) The term chemical preservative means any chemical that, when 
added to food, tends to prevent or retard deterioration thereof, but 
does not include common salt, sugars, vinegars, spices, or oils 
extracted from spices, substances added to food by direct exposure 
thereof to wood smoke, or chemicals applied for their insecticidal or 
herbicidal properties.
    (b) A food which is subject to the requirements of section 403(k) of 
the act shall bear labeling, even though such food is not in package 
form.
    (c) A statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or 
chemical preservative shall be placed on the food, or on its container 
or wrapper, or on any two or all of these, as may be necessary to render 
such statement likely to be read by the ordinary individual under 
customary conditions of purchase and use of such food.
    (d) A food shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of 
section 403(k) of the act if it is not in package form and the units 
thereof are so small that a statement of artificial flavoring, 
artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, as the case may be, 
cannot be placed on such units with such conspicuousness as to render it 
likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions 
of purchase and use.
    (e) A food shall be exempt while held for sale from the requirements 
of section 403(k) of the act (requiring label statement of any 
artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservatives) if 
said food, having been received in bulk containers at a retail 
establishment, is displayed to the purchaser with either (1) the 
labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (2) a counter card, 
sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously 
the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 
403(k) of the act.

[[Page 23]]

    (f) A fruit or vegetable shall be exempt from compliance with the 
requirements of section 403(k) of the act with respect to a chemical 
preservative applied to the fruit or vegetable as a pesticide chemical 
prior to harvest.
    (g) A flavor shall be labeled in the following way when shipped to a 
food manufacturer or processor (but not a consumer) for use in the 
manufacture of a fabricated food, unless it is a flavor for which a 
standard of identity has been promulgated, in which case it shall be 
labeled as provided in the standard:
    (1) If the flavor consists of one ingredient, it shall be declared 
by its common or usual name.
    (2) If the flavor consists of two or more ingredients, the label 
either may declare each ingredient by its common or usual name or may 
state ``All flavor ingredients contained in this product are approved 
for use in a regulation of the Food and Drug Administration.'' Any 
flavor ingredient not contained in one of these regulations, and any 
nonflavor ingredient, shall be separately listed on the label.
    (3) In cases where the flavor contains a solely natural flavor(s), 
the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., strawberry flavor, banana flavor, 
or natural strawberry flavor. In cases where the flavor contains both a 
natural flavor and an artificial flavor, the flavor shall be so labeled, 
e.g., natural and artificial strawberry flavor. In cases where the 
flavor contains a solely artificial flavor(s), the flavor shall be so 
labeled, e.g., artificial strawberry flavor.
    (h) The label of a food to which flavor is added shall declare the 
flavor in the statement of ingredients in the following way:
    (1) Spice, natural flavor, and artificial flavor may be declared as 
spice, natural flavor, or artificial flavor, or any combination thereof, 
as the case may be.
    (2) An incidental additive in a food, originating in a spice or 
flavor used in the manufacture of the food, need not be declared in the 
statement of ingredients if it meets the requirements of Sec. 
501.100(a)(3).
    (3) Substances obtained by cutting, grinding, drying, pulping, or 
similar processing of tissues derived from fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, 
or poultry, e.g., powdered or granulated onions, garlic powder, and 
celery powder, are commonly understood by consumers to be food rather 
than flavor and shall be declared by their common or usual name.
    (4) Any salt (sodium chloride) used as an ingredient in food shall 
be declared by its common or usual name salt.
    (5) Any monosodium glutamate used as an ingredient in food shall be 
declared by its common or usual name monosodium glutamate.
    (6) Any pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavors used as 
an ingredient in a food may be declared as artificial flavor or 
artificial smoke flavor. No representation may be made, either directly 
or implied, that a food flavored with pyroligneous acid or other 
artificial smoke flavor has been smoked or has a true smoked flavor, or 
that a seasoning sauce or similar product containing pyroligneous acid 
or other artificial smoke flavor and used to season or flavor other 
foods will result in a smoked product or one having a true smoked 
flavor.
    (i) If the label, labeling, or advertising of a food makes any 
direct or indirect representations with respect to the primary 
recognizable flavor(s), by word, vignette, e.g., depiction of a fruit, 
or other means, or if for any other reason the manufacturer or 
distributor of a food wishes to designate the type of flavor in the food 
other than through the statement of ingredients, such flavor shall be 
considered the characterizing flavor and shall be declared in the 
following way:
    (1) If the food contains no artificial flavor which simulates, 
resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food 
on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be 
accompanied by the common or usual name of the characterizing flavor in 
letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the 
name of the food, except that:
    (i) If the food is one that is commonly expected to contain a 
characterizing food ingredient, and the food contains natural flavor 
derived from such ingredient and an amount of characterizing ingredient 
insufficient to independently characterize the food, or the food 
contains no such ingredient, the

[[Page 24]]

name of the characterizing flavor may be immediately preceded by the 
word natural and shall be immediately followed by the word flavored in 
letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of 
the characterizing flavor.
    (ii) If none of the natural flavor used in the food is derived from 
the product whose flavor is simulated, the food in which the flavor is 
used shall be labeled either with the flavor of the product from which 
the flavor is derived or as artificially flavored.
    (iii) If the food contains both a characterizing flavor from the 
product whose flavor is simulated and other natural flavor which 
simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the food 
shall be labeled in accordance with the introductory text and paragraph 
(i)(1)(i) of this section and the name of the food shall be immediately 
followed by the words with other natural flavor in letters not less than 
one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the 
characterizing flavor.
    (2) If the food contains any artificial flavor which simulates, 
resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food 
on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be 
accompanied by the common or usual name(s) of the characterizing flavor, 
in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the 
name of the food and the name of the characterizing flavor shall be 
accompanied by the word(s) artificial or artificially flavored, in 
letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of 
the characterizing flavor.
    (3) Wherever the name of the characterizing flavor appears on the 
label (other than in the statement of ingredients) so conspicuously as 
to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the words 
prescribed by this paragraph shall immediately and conspicuously precede 
or follow such name, without any intervening written, printed, or 
graphic matter, except:
    (i) Where the characterizing flavor and a trademark or brand are 
presented together, other written, printed, or graphic matter that is a 
part of or is associated with the trademark or brand may intervene if 
the required words are in such relationship with the trademark or brand 
as to be clearly related to the characterizing flavor; and
    (ii) If the finished product contains more than one flavor subject 
to the requirements of this paragraph, the statements required by this 
paragraph need appear only once in each statement of characterizing 
flavors present in such food.
    (iii) If the finished product contains three or more distinguishable 
characterizing flavors, or a blend of flavors with no primary 
recognizable flavor, the flavor may be declared by an appropriately 
descriptive generic term in lieu of naming each flavor.
    (4) A flavor supplier shall certify, in writing, that any flavor he 
supplies which is designated as containing no artificial flavor does 
not, to the best of his knowledge and belief, contain any artificial 
flavor, and that he has added no artificial flavor to it. The 
requirement for such certification may be satisfied by a guarantee under 
section 303(c)(2) of the act which contains such a specific statement. A 
flavor used shall be required to make such a written certification only 
where he adds to or combines another flavor with a flavor which has been 
certified by a flavor supplier as containing no artificial flavor, but 
otherwise such user may rely upon the supplier's certification and need 
make no separate certification. All such certifications shall be 
retained by the certifying party throughout the period in which the 
flavor is supplied and for a minimum of 3 years thereafter, and shall be 
subject to the following conditions:
    (i) The certifying party shall make such certifications available 
upon request at all reasonable hours to any duly authorized officer, or 
employee of the Food and Drug Administration or any other employee 
acting on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Such 
certifications are regarded by the Food and Drug Administration as 
reports to the government and as guarantees or other undertakings within 
the meaning of section 301(h) of the act and subject the certifying 
party to the penalties for making any false report to the government 
under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and any false guarantee or undertaking under 
section

[[Page 25]]

303(a) of the act. The defenses provided under section 303(c)(2) of the 
act shall be applicable to the certifications provided for in this 
section.
    (ii) Wherever possible, the Food and Drug Administration shall 
verify the accuracy of a reasonable number of certifications made 
pursuant to this section, constituting a representative sample of such 
certifications, and shall not request all such certifications.
    (iii) Where no person authorized to provide such information is 
reasonably available at the time of inspection, the certifying party 
shall arrange to have such person and the relevant materials and records 
ready for verification as soon as practicable; provided that, whenever 
the Food and Drug Administration has reason to believe that the supplier 
or user may utilize this period to alter inventories or records, such 
additional time shall not be permitted. Where such additional time is 
provided, the Food and Drug Administration may require the certifying 
party to certify that relevant inventories have not been materially 
disturbed and relevant records have not been altered or concealed during 
such period.
    (iv) The certifying party shall provide, to an officer or 
representative duly designated by the Secretary, such qualitative 
statement of the composition of the flavor or product covered by the 
certification as may be reasonably expected to enable the Secretary's 
representatives to determine which relevant raw and finished materials 
and flavor ingredient records are reasonably necessary to verify the 
certifications. The examination conducted by the Secretary's 
representative shall be limited to inspection and review of inventories 
and ingredient records for those certifications which are to be 
verified.
    (v) Review of flavor ingredient records shall be limited to the 
qualitative formula and shall not include the quantitative formula. The 
person verifying the certifications may make only such notes as are 
necessary to enable him to verify such certification. Only such notes or 
such flavor ingredient records as are necessary to verify such 
certification or to show a potential or actual violation may be removed 
or transmitted from the certifying party's place of business: Provided, 
That, where such removal or transmittal is necessary for such purposes 
the relevant records and notes shall be retained as separate documents 
in Food and Drug Administration files, shall not be copied in other 
reports, and shall not be disclosed publicly other than in a judicial 
proceeding brought pursuant to the act or 18 U.S.C. 1001.
    (j) A food to which a chemical preservative(s) is added shall, 
except when exempt pursuant to Sec. 501.100, bear a label declaration 
stating both the common or usual name of the ingredient(s) and a 
separate description of its function, e.g., preservative, to retard 
spoilage, a mold inhibitor, to help protect flavor or to promote color 
retention.

       Subpart F_Exemptions From Animal Food Labeling Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 501.100  Animal food; exemptions from labeling.

    (a) The following foods are exempt from compliance with the 
requirements of section 403(i)(2) of the act (requiring a declaration on 
the label of the common or usual name of each ingredient when the food 
is fabricated from two or more ingredients).
    (1) An assortment of different items of food, when variations in the 
items that make up different packages packed from such assortment 
normally occur in good packing practice and when such variations result 
in variations in the ingredients in different packages, with respect to 
any ingredient that is not common to all packages. Such exemption, 
however, shall be on the condition that the label shall bear, in 
conjunction with the names of such ingredients as are common to all 
packages, a statement (in terms that are as informative as practicable 
and that are not misleading) indicating by name other ingredients which 
may be present.

[[Page 26]]

    (2) A food having been received in bulk containers at a retail 
establishment, if displayed to the purchaser with either (i) the 
labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (ii) a counter card, 
sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously 
the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 
403(i)(2) of the act.
    (3) Incidental additives that are present in a food at insignificant 
levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food. 
For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), incidental additives are:
    (i) Substances that have no technical or functional effect but are 
present in a food by reason of having been incorporated into the food as 
an ingredient of another food, in which the substance did have a 
functional or technical effect.
    (ii) Processing aids, which are as follows:
    (a) Substances that are added to a food during the processing of 
such food but are removed in some manner from the food before it is 
packaged in its finished form.
    (b) Substances that are added to a food during processing, are 
converted into constituents normally present in the food, and do not 
significantly increase the amount of the constituents naturally found in 
the food.
    (c) Substances that are added to a food for their technical or 
functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food 
at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional 
effect in that food.
    (iii) Substances migrating to food from equipment or packaging or 
otherwise affecting food that are not food additives as defined in 
section 201(s) of the act; or if they are food additives as so defined, 
they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to 
section 409 of the act.
    (b) A food repackaged in a retail establishment is exempt from the 
following provisions of the act if the conditions specified are met.
    (1) Section 403(e)(1) of the act (requiring a statement on the label 
of the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or 
distributor).
    (2) Section 403(g)(2) of the act (requiring the label of a food 
which purports to be or is represented as one for which a definition and 
standard of identity has been prescribed to bear the name of the food 
specified in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required 
by the regulation establishing the standard the common names of the 
optional ingredients present in the food), if the food is displayed to 
the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a 
counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and 
conspicuously the information required by these provisions.
    (3) Section 403(i)(1) of the act (requiring the label to bear the 
common or usual name of the food), if the food is displayed to the 
purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a 
counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and 
conspicuously the common or usual name of the food, or if the common or 
usual name of the food is clearly revealed by its appearance.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Except as provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, a 
shipment or other delivery of a food which is, in accordance with the 
practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in 
substantial quantity at an establishment other than that where 
originally processed or packed, shall be exempt, during the time of 
introduction into and movement in interstate commerce and the time of 
holding in such establishment, from compliance with the labeling 
requirements of section 403 (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of the 
act if:
    (1) The person who introduced such shipment or delivery into 
interstate commerce is the operator of the establishment where such food 
is to be processed, labeled, or repacked; or
    (2) In case such person is not such operator, such shipment or 
delivery is made to such establishment under a written agreement, signed 
by and containing the post office addresses of such person and such 
operator, and containing such specifications for the processing, 
labeling, or repacking, as the case may be, of such food in such 
establishment as will ensure, if such specifications are followed, that 
such

[[Page 27]]

food will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act 
upon completion of such processing, labeling, or repacking. Such person 
and such operator shall each keep a copy of such agreement until 2 years 
after the final shipment or delivery of such food from such 
establishment, and shall make such copies available for inspection at 
any reasonable hour to any officer or employee of the Department who 
requests them.
    (e) Conditions affecting expiration of exemptions.
    (1) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall, at the beginning of the act of 
removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such 
establishment become void ab initio if the food comprising such 
shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the 
meaning of the act when so removed.
    (2) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall become void ab initio with 
respect to the person who introduced such shipment or delivery into 
interstate commerce upon refusal by such person to make available for 
inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section.
    (3) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall expire:
    (i) At the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or 
delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment if the food 
comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded 
within the meaning of the act when so removed; or
    (ii) Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such 
food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for 
inspection a copy of the agreement as required by such paragraph.
    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) The label declaration of a harmless marker used to identify a 
particular manufacturer's product may result in unfair competition 
through revealing a trade secret. Exemption from the label declaration 
of such a marker is granted, therefore, provided that the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) The person desiring to use the marker without label declaration 
of its presence has submitted to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs full 
information concerning the proposed usage and the reasons why he 
believes label declaration of the marker should be subject to this 
exemption; and
    (2) The person requesting the exemption has received from the 
Commissioner of Food and Drugs a finding that the marker is harmless and 
that the exemption has been granted.

Sec. 501.103  Petitions requesting exemptions from or special 
requirements for label declaration of ingredients.

    The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, either on his own initiative or 
on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a petition pursuant 
to part 10 of this chapter may issue a proposal to amend Sec. 501.4 to 
specify the manner in which an ingredient(s) shall be declared, i.e., by 
specific or class name, or Sec. 501.100 to exempt an ingredient(s) from 
the requirements for label declaration.

<R05>
Sec. 501.105  Declaration of net quantity of contents when exempt.

    (a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear 
a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed 
in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of 
numerical count and weight or measure. The statement shall be in terms 
of fluid measure if the food is liquid, or in terms of weight if the 
food is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid; 
except that such statement may be in terms of dry measure if the food is 
a fresh fruit, fresh vegetable, or other dry commodity that is 
customarily sold by dry measure. If there is a firmly established 
general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the contents of a 
liquid by weight, or a solid, semisolid, or viscous product by fluid 
measure, it may be used. Whenever the Commissioner determines that an 
existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by

weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination in the case of a 
specific packaged food does not facilitate value comparisons by 
consumers and offers opportunity for consumer confusion, he will by 
regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such 
commodity.
    (b)(1) Statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound 
and ounce.
    (2) Statements of fluid measure shall be in terms of the U.S. gallon 
of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid ounce subdivisions 
thereof, and shall:
    (i) In the case of frozen food that is sold and consumed in a frozen 
state, express the volume at the frozen temperature.
    (ii) In the case of refrigerated food that is sold in the 
refrigerated state, express the volume at 40 [deg]F (4 [deg]C).
    (iii) In the case of other foods, express the volume at 68 [deg]F 
(20 [deg]C).
    (3) Statements of dry measure shall be in terms of the U.S. bushel 
of 2,150.42 cubic inches and peck, dry quart, and dry pint subdivisions 
thereof.
    (c) When the declaration of quantity of contents by numerical count 
does not give adequate information as to the quantity of food in the 
package, it shall be combined with such statement of weight, measure, or 
size of the individual units of the foods as will provide such 
information.
    (d) The declaration may contain common or decimal fractions. A 
common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eighths, 
sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that if there exists a firmly 
established general consumer usage and trade custom of employing 
different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a 
particular commodity, they may be employed. A common fraction shall be 
reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out 
to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an 
ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does 
not include such fractions.
    (e) The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel 
of the label, and with respect to packages bearing alternate principal 
panels it shall be duplicated on each principal display panel.
    (f) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal 
display panel, shall be separated (by at least a space equal to the 
height of the lettering used in the declaration) from other printed 
label information appearing above or below the declaration and (by at 
least a space equal to twice the width of the letter ``N'' of the style 
of type used in the quantity of contents statement) from other printed 
label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It 
shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or 
count (such as jumbo quart and full gallon) that tends to exaggerate the 
amount of the food in the container. It shall be placed on the principal 
display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label 
panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests 
as it is designed to be displayed: Provided, That on packages having a 
principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for 
placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel 
shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets 
the other requirements of this part.
    (g) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of food in 
the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith; 
provided that in the case of foods packed in containers designed to 
deliver the food under pressure, the declaration shall state the net 
quantity of the contents that will be expelled when the instructions for 
use as shown on the container are followed. The propellant is included 
in the net quantity declaration.
    (h) The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible 
boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout, 
color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except 
that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or molded on a glass 
or plastic surface is permissible when all label information is so 
formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility 
shall include the specifications that:

[[Page 29]]

    (1) The ratio of height to width (of the letter) shall not exceed a 
differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is 
wide).
    (2) Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When 
upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower 
case letter ``o'' or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum 
standards.
    (3) When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-
half the minimum height standards.
    (i) The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size 
established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel 
of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially 
the same size by complying with the following type specifications:
    (1) Not less than \1/16\ inch in height on packages the principal 
display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less.
    (2) Not less than \1/8\ inch in height on packages the principal 
display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more than 25 
square inches.
    (3) Not less than \3/16\ inch in height on packages the principal 
display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 
square inches.
    (4) Not less than \1/4\ inch in height on packages the principal 
display panel of which has an area of more than 100 square inches, 
except not less than \1/2\ inch in height if the area is more than 400 
square inches.


Where the declaration is blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or 
plastic surface rather than by printing, typing, or coloring, the 
lettering sizes specified in paragraphs (i) (1) through (4) of this 
section shall be increased by \1/16\ of an inch.
    (j) On packages containing less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon and 
labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure:
    (1) The declaration shall be expressed both in ounces, with 
identification by weight or by liquid measure and, if applicable (1 
pound or 1 pint or more) followed in parentheses by a declaration in 
pounds for weight units, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common 
or decimal fractions of the pound (see examples set forth in paragraphs 
(m) (1) and (2) of this section), or in the case of liquid measure, in 
the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints, as 
appropriate) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or 
decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see examples in paragraphs (m) 
(3) and (4) of this section).
    (2) If the net quantity of contents declaration appears on a random 
package, that is a package which is one of a lot, shipment, or delivery 
of packages of the same consumer commodity with varying weights and with 
no fixed weight pattern, it may, when the net weight exceeds 1 pound, be 
expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound carried 
out to not more than two decimal places. When the net weight does not 
exceed 1 pound, the declaration on the random package may be in decimal 
fractions of the pound in lieu of ounces (see example in paragraph 
(m)(5) of this section).
    (3) The declaration may appear in more than one line. The term net 
weight shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms 
of weight. Use of the terms net or net contents in terms of fluid 
measure or numerical count is optional. It is sufficient to distinguish 
avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of terms; for 
example, Net wt. 6 oz. or 6 oz. net wt. and 6 fl. oz. or net contents 6 
fl. oz.
    (k) On packages containing 4 pounds or 1 gallon or more and labeled 
in terms of weight or fluid measure, the declaration shall be expressed 
in pounds for weight units with any remainder in terms of ounces or 
common or decimal fraction of the pound, or in the case of fluid 
measure, it shall be expressed in the largest whole unit (gallons 
followed by common or decimal fraction of a gallon or by the next 
smaller whole unit or units (quarts, or quarts and pints)) with any 
remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the 
pint or quart (see paragraph (m)(6) of this section).
    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) Examples: (1) A declaration of 1\1/2\ pounds weight shall be 
expressed as Net Wt. 24 oz. (1 lb. 8 oz.), Net Wt. 24 oz. (1\1/2\ lb.), 
or Net Wt. 24 oz. (1.5 lb.).
    (2) A declaration of \3/4\ pound avoirdupois weight shall be 
expressed as Net Wt. 12 oz.

[[Page 30]]

    (3) A declaration of 1 quart liquid measure shall be expressed as 
Net 32 fl. oz. (1 qt.).
    (4) A declaration of 1\3/4\ quarts liquid measure shall be expressed 
as Net contents 56 fluid ounces (1 quart 1\1/2\ pints) or as Net 56 
fluid oz. (1 qt. 1 pt. 8 oz.), but not in terms of quart and ounce such 
as Net 56 fluid oz. (1 quart 24 ounces).
    (5) On a random package, declaration of \3/4\ pound avoirdupois may 
be expressed as Net Wt. .75 lb.
    (6) A declaration of 2\1/2\ gallons liquid measure shall be 
expressed as Net contents 2\1/2\ gallons, Net contents 2.5 gallons, or 
Net contents 2 gallons 2 quarts and not as 2 gallons 4 pints.
    (n) For quantities, the following abbreviations and none other may 
be employed (periods and plural forms are optional):

weight wt.
ounce oz.
pound lb.
gallon gal.
pint pt.
quart qt.
fluid fl.

    (o) Nothing in this section shall prohibit supplemental statements 
at locations other than the principal display panel(s) describing in 
nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents; provided, that such 
supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include 
any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends to 
exaggerate the amount of the food contained in the package; for example, 
jumbo quart and full gallon. Dual or combination declarations of net 
quantity of contents as provided for in paragraphs (a), (c), and (j) of 
this section (for example, a combination of net weight plus numerical 
count, net contents plus dilution directions of a concentrate, etc.) are 
not regarded as supplemental net quantity statements and may be located 
on the principal display panel.
    (p) A separate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of 
the metric system is not regarded as a supplemental statement and an 
accurate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the 
metric system of weight or measure may also appear on the principal 
display panel or on other panels.
    (q) The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an 
accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package. 
Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the 
course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in 
good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated 
quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large.
    (r) [Reserved]
    (s) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the quantity of 
contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include 
the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, 
and, in parentheses, the total quantity of contents of the multiunit 
package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces, except that such 
declaration of total quantity need not be followed by an additional 
parenthetical declaration in terms of the largest whole units and 
subdivisions thereof, as required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section. A 
multiunit retail package may thus be properly labeled: 6-16 oz. 
bottles--(96 fl. oz.) or 3-16 oz. cans--(net wt. 48 oz). For the 
purposes of this section, multiunit retail package means a package 
containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical 
commodity and in the same quantity, intended to be sold as part of the 
multiunit retail package but capable of being individually sold in full 
compliance with all requirements of the regulations in this part. Open 
multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units nor 
prevent examination of the labeling on each of the individual units are 
not subject to this paragraph if the labeling of each individual unit 
complies with the requirements of paragraphs (f) and (i) of this 
section.
    (t) Where the declaration of net quantity of contents is in terms of 
net weight and/or drained weight or volume and does not accurately 
reflect the actual quantity of the contents or the product falls below 
the applicable standard of fill of container because of equipment 
malfunction or otherwise unintentional product variation, and the label 
conforms in all other respects to the requirements of this chapter 
(except the requirement that food falling below the applicable standard 
of fill of container shall bear the general statement of substandard 
fill specified in

[[Page 31]]

Sec. 564.14(b) of this chapter), the mislabeled food product, including 
any food product that fails to bear the general statement of substandard 
fill specified in Sec. 564.14(b) of this chapter, may be sold by the 
manufacturer or processor directly to institutions operated by Federal, 
State or local governments: Provided, That:
    (1) The purchaser shall sign a statement at the time of sale stating 
that he is aware that the product is mislabeled to include 
acknowledgement of the nature and extent of the mislabeling, e.g., 
``Actual net weight may be as low as ----% below labeled quantity'' and 
that any subsequent distribution by him of said product except for his 
own institutional use is unlawful. This statement shall be kept on file 
at the principal place of business of the manufacturer or processor for 
2 years subsequent to the date of shipment of the product and shall be 
available to the Food and Drug Administration upon request.
    (2) The product shall be labeled on the outside of its shipping 
container with the statement(s):
    (i) When the variation concerns net weight and/or drained weight of 
volume--``Product Mislabeled. Actual net weight (drained weight or 
volume where appropriate) may be as low as ----% below labeled quantity. 
This Product Not for Retail Distribution,'' the blank to be filled in 
with the maximum percentage variance between the labeled and actual 
weight or volume of contents of the individual packages in the shipping 
container, and
    (ii) When the variation is in regard to a fill of container 
standard--``Product Mislabeled. Actual fill may be as low as ----% below 
standard of fill. This Product Not for Retail Distribution.''
    (3) The statements required by paragraphs (t)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, which may be consolidated where appropriate, shall appear 
prominently and conspicuously as compared to other printed matter on the 
shipping container and in boldface print or type on a clear, contrasting 
background in order to render them likely to be read and understood by 
the purchaser under ordinary conditions of purchase.

<R05>
Sec. 502.5  General principles.

    (a) The common or usual name of a food, which may be a coined term, 
shall accurately identify or describe, in as simple and direct terms as 
possible, the basic nature of the food or its characterizing properties 
or ingredients. The name shall be uniform among all identical or similar 
products and may not be confusingly similar to the name of any other 
food that is not reasonably encompassed within the same name. Each class 
or subclass of food shall be given its own common or usual name that 
states, in clear terms, what it is in a way that distinguishes it from 
different foods.
    (b) The common or usual name of a food shall include the 
percentage(s) of any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) when 
the proportion of such ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food has a 
material bearing on price or consumer acceptance or when the labeling or 
the appearance of the food may otherwise create an erroneous impression 
that such ingredient(s) or component(s) is present in an amount greater 
than is actually the case. The following requirements shall apply unless 
modified by a specific regulation in this part.
    (1) The percentage of a characterizing ingredient or component shall 
be declared on the basis of its quantity in the finished product (i.e., 
weight/weight in the case of solids, or volume/volume in the case of 
liquids).
    (2) The percentage of a characterizing ingredient or component shall 
be declared by the words ``containing (or contains) ---- percent (or %) 
----'' or ``---- percent (or %) ----'' with the first blank filled in 
with the percentage expressed as a whole number not greater than the 
actual percentage of the ingredient or component named and the second 
blank filled in with the common or usual name of the ingredient or 
component. The word ``containing'' (or ``contains''), when used, shall 
appear on a line immediately below the part of the common or usual name 
of the food required by paragraph (a) of this section. For each 
characterizing ingredient or component, the words ``---- percent (or %) 
----''shall appear following or directly below the word ``containing'' 
(or ``contains''), or directly below the part of the common or usual 
name of the food required by paragraph (a) of this section when the word 
``containing'' (or ``contains'') is not used, in easily legible boldface 
print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, 
and in a height not less than the larger of the following alternatives:
    (i) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on packages having a 
principal display panel with an area of 5 square inches or less and not 
less than one-eighth inch in height if the area of the principal display 
panel is greater than 5 square inches; or
    (ii) Not less than one-half the height of the largest type appearing 
in the part of the common or usual name of the food required by 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The common or usual name of a food shall include a statement of 
the presence or absence of any characterizing ingredient(s) or 
component(s) and/or the need for the user to add any characterizing 
ingredient(s) or component(s) when the presence or absence of such 
ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food has a material bearing on 
price or consumer acceptance or when the labeling or the appearance of 
the food may otherwise create an erroneous impression that such 
ingredient(s) or component(s) is present when it is not, and consumers 
may otherwise be misled about the presence or absence of the 
ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food. The following requirements 
shall apply unless modified by a specific regulation in this part.

[[Page 33]]

    (1) The presence or absence of a characterizing ingredient or 
component shall be declared by the words ``containing (or contains) ----
----'' or ``containing (or contains) ----------'' or ``no ----------'' 
or ``does not contain ----------'', with the blank being filled in with 
the common or usual name of the ingredient or component.
    (2) The need for the user of a food to add any characterizing 
ingredient(s) or component(s) shall be declared by an appropriate 
informative statement.
    (3) The statement(s) required under paragraph (c) (1) and/or (2) of 
this section shall appear following or directly below the part of the 
common or usual name of the food required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, in easily legible boldface print or type in distinct 
contrast to other printed or graphic matter, and in a height not less 
than the larger of the alternatives established under paragraph (b)(2) 
(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (d) A common or usual name of a food may be established by common 
usage or by establishment of a regulation in this part, in a standard of 
identity, or in other regulations in this chapter.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 509.3  Definitions and interpretations.

    (a) Act means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
    (b) The definitions of terms contained in section 201 of the act are 
applicable to such terms when used in this part unless modified in this 
section.
    (c) A naturally occurring poisonous or deleterious substance is a 
poisonous or deleterious substance that is an inherent natural 
constituent of a food and is not the result of environmental, 
agricultural, industrial, or other contamination.
    (d) An added poisonous or deleterious substance is a poisonous or 
deleterious substance that is not a naturally occurring poisonous or 
deleterious substance. When a naturally occurring poisonous or 
deleterious substance is increased to abnormal levels through

[[Page 34]]

mishandling or other intervening acts, it is an added poisonous or 
deleterious substance to the extent of such increase.
    (e) Food includes pet food, animal feed, and substances migrating to 
food from food-contact articles.


<R05>
Sec. 509.4  Establishment of tolerances, regulatory limits, and
action levels.

    (a) When appropriate under the criteria of Sec. 509.6, a tolerance 
for an added poisonous or deleterious substance, which may be a food 
additive, may be established by regulation in subpart B of this part 
under the provisions of section 406 of the act. A tolerance may prohibit 
any detectable amount of the substance in food.
    (b) When appropriate under the criteria of Sec. 509.6, and under 
section 402(a)(1) of the act, a regulatory limit for an added poisonous 
or deleterious substance, which may be a food additive, may be 
established by regulation in subpart C of this part under the provisions 
of sections 402(a)(1) and 701(a) of the act. A regulatory limit may 
prohibit any detectable amount of the substance in food. The regulatory 
limit established represents the level at which food is adulterated 
within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act.
    (c)(1) When appropriate under the criteria of Sec. 509.6, an action 
level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance, which may be a 
food additive, may be established to define a level of contamination at 
which a food may be regarded as adulterated.
    (2) Whenever an action level is established or changed, a notice 
shall be published in the Federal Register as soon as practicable 
thereafter. The notice shall call attention to the material supporting 
the action level which shall be on file with the Division of Dockets 
Management before the notice is published. The notice shall invite 
public comment on the action level.
    (d) A regulation may be established in subpart D of this part to 
identify a food containing a naturally occurring poisonous or 
deleterious substance which will be deemed to be adulterated under 
section 402(a)(1) of the act. These regulations do not constitute a 
complete list of such foods.

<R05>
Sec. 509.5  Petitions.

    The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, either on his own initiative or 
on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a petition, may 
issue a proposal to establish, revoke, or amend a regulation under this 
part. Any such petition shall include an adequate factual basis to 
support the petition, shall be in the form set forth in Sec. 10.30 of 
this chapter, and will be published in the Federal Register for comment 
if it contains reasonable grounds for the proposed regulation.

[42 FR 52821, Sept. 30, 1977, as amended at 54 FR 18280, Apr. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 509.6  Added poisonous or deleterious substances.

    (a) Use of an added poisonous or deleterious substance, other than a 
pesticide chemical, that is also a food additive will be controlled by a 
regulation issued under section 409 of the act when possible. When such 
a use cannot be approved under the criteria of section 409 of the act, 
or when the added poisonous or deleterious substance is not a food 
additive, a tolerance, regulatory limit, or action level may be 
established pursuant to the criteria in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of 
this section. Residues resulting from the use of an added poisonous or 
deleterious substance that is also a pesticide chemical will ordinarily 
be controlled by a tolerance established in a regulation issued under 
sections 406, 408, or 409 of the act by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA). When such a regulation has not been issued, an 
action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance that is 
also a pesticide chemical may be established by the Food and Drug 
Administration. The Food and Drug Administration will request EPA to 
recommend such an action level pursuant to the criteria established in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) A tolerance for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in 
any food may be established when the following criteria are met:

[[Page 35]]

    (1) The substance cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice.
    (2) The tolerance established is sufficient for the protection of 
the public health, taking into account the extent of which the presence 
of the substance cannot be avoided and the other ways in which the 
consumer may be affected by the same or related poisonous or deleterious 
substances.
    (3) No technological or other changes are foreseeable in the near 
future that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance 
established. Examples of changes that might affect the appropriateness 
of the tolerance include anticipated improvements in good manufacturing 
practice that would change the extent to which use of the substance is 
unavoidable and anticipated studies expected to provide significant new 
toxicological or use data.
    (c) A regulatory limit for an added poisonous or deleterious 
substance in any food may be established when each of the following 
criteria is met:
    (1) The substance cannot be avoided by current good manufacturing 
practices.
    (2) There is no tolerance established for the substance in the 
particular food under sections 406, 408, or 409 of the act.
    (3) There is insufficient information by which a tolerance may be 
established for the substance under section 406 of the act or 
technological changes appear reasonably possible that may affect the 
appropriateness of a tolerance. The regulatory limit established 
represents the level at which food is adulterated within the meaning of 
section 402(a)(1) of the act.
    (d) An action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance 
in any food may be established when the criteria in paragraph (b) of 
this section are met, except that technological or other changes that 
might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance are foreseeable in the 
near future. An action level for an added poisonous or deleterious 
substance in any food may be established at a level at which the Food 
and Drug Administration may regard the food as adulterated within the 
meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act, without regard to the criteria 
in paragraph (b) of this section or in section 406 of the act. An action 
level will be withdrawn when a tolerance or regulatory limit for the 
same substance and use has been established.
    (e) Tolerances will be established under authority appropriate for 
action levels (sections 306, 402(a), and 701(a) of the act, together 
with section 408 or 409 of the act, if appropriate) as well as under 
authority appropriate for tolerances (sections 406 and 701 of the act). 
In the event the effectiveness of a tolerance is stayed pursuant to 
section 701(e)(2) of the act by the filing of an objection, the order 
establishing the tolerance shall be deemed to be an order establishing 
an action level until final action is taken upon such objection.

Sec. 509.7  Unavoidability.

    (a) Tolerances and action levels in this part are established at 
levels based on the unavoidability of the poisonous or deleterious 
substance concerned and do not establish a permissible level of 
contamination where it is avoidable.
    (b) Compliance with tolerances, regulatory limits, and action levels 
does not excuse failure to observe either the requirement in section 
402(a)(4) of the act that food may not be prepared, packed, or held 
under insanitary conditions or the other requirements in this chapter 
that food manufacturers must observe current good manufacturing 
practices. Evidence obtained through factory inspection or otherwise 
indicating such a violation renders the food unlawful, even though the 
amounts of poisonous or deleterious substances are lower than the 
currently established tolerances, regulatory limits, or action levels. 
The manufacturer of food must at all times utilize quality control 
procedures which will reduce contamination to the lowest level currently 
feasible.

Sec. 509.15  Use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in 
establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials.

    (a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) represent a class of toxic 
industrial chemicals manufactured and sold under

[[Page 36]]

a variety of trade names, including: Aroclor (United States); Phenoclor 
(France); Colphen (Germany); and Kanaclor (Japan). PCB's are highly 
stable, heat resistant, and nonflammable chemicals. Industrial uses of 
PCB's include, or did include in the past, their use as electrical 
transformer and capacitor fluids, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic 
fluids, and plasticizers, and in formulations of lubricants, coatings, 
and inks. Their unique physical and chemical properties and widespread, 
uncontrolled industrial applications have caused PCB's to be a 
persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment, causing the 
contamination of certain foods. In addition, incidents have occurred in 
which PCB's have directly contaminated animal feeds as a result of 
industrial accidents (leakage or spillage of PCB fluids from plant 
equipment). These accidents in turn caused the contamination of food 
products intended for human consumption (meat, milk and eggs). 
Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration have revealed that a 
significant percentage of paper food-packaging material contains PCB's 
which can migrate to the packaged food. The origin of PCB's in such 
material is not fully understood. Reclaimed fibers containing carbonless 
copy paper (contains 3 to 5 percent PCB's) have been identified as a 
primary source of PCB's in paper products. Some virgin paper products 
have also been found to contain PCB's, the source of which is generally 
attributed to direct contamination from industrial accidents from the 
use of PCB-containing equipment and machinery in food-packaging 
manufacturing establishments. Since PCB's are toxic chemicals, the PCB 
contamination of food-packaging materials as a result of industrial 
accidents, which can cause the PCB contamination of food, represents a 
hazard to public health. It is therefore necessary to place certain 
restrictions on the industrial uses of PCB's in establishments 
manufacturing food-packaging materials.
    (b) The following special provisions are necessary to preclude the 
accidental PCB contamination of food-packaging materials:
    (1) New equipment or machinery for manufacturing food-packaging 
materials shall not contain or use PCB's.
    (2) On or before September 4, 1973, the management of establishments 
manufacturing food-packaging materials shall:
    (i) Have the heat exchange fluid used in existing equipment for 
manufacturing food-packaging materials sampled and tested to determine 
whether it contains PCB's or verify the absence of PCB's in such 
formulations by other appropriate means. On or before Sept. 4, 1973, any 
such fluid formulated with PCB's must to the fullest extent possible 
commensurate with current good manufacturing practices be replaced with 
a heat exchange fluid that does not contain PCB's.
    (ii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with 
current good manufacturing practices from the establishment any other 
PCB-containing equipment, machinery and materials wherever there is a 
reasonable expectation that such articles could cause food-packaging 
materials to become contaminated with PCB's either as a result of normal 
use or as a result of accident, breakage, or other mishap.
    (iii) The toxicity and other characteristics of fluids selected as 
PCB replacements must be adequately determined so that the least 
potentially hazardous replacement is used. In making this determination 
with respect to a given fluid, consideration should be given to (a) its 
toxicity; (b) the maximum quantity that could be spilled onto a given 
quantity of food before it would be noticed, taking into account its 
color and odor; (c) possible signaling devices in the equipment to 
indicate a loss of fluid, etc.; and (d) its environmental stability and 
tendency to survive and be concentrated through the food chain. The 
judgment as to whether a replacement fluid is sufficiently non-hazardous 
is to be made on an individual installation and operation basis.
    (c) The provisions of this section do not apply to electrical 
transformers and condensers containing PCB's in sealed containers.

<R05>
Sec. 509.30  Temporary tolerances for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's).

    (a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) are toxic, industrial 
chemicals. Because of their widespread, uncontrolled industrial 
applications, PCB's have become a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant 
in the environment. As a result, certain foods and animal feeds, 
principally those of animal and marine origin, contain PCB's as 
unavoidable, environmental contaminants. PCB's are transmitted to the 
food portion (meat, milk, and eggs) of food producing animals ingesting 
PCB contaminated animal feed. In addition, a significant percentage of 
paper food-packaging materials contain PCB's which may migrate to the 
packaged food. The source of PCB's in paper food-packaging materials is 
primarily of certain types of carbonless copy paper (containing 3 to 5 
percent PCB's) in waste paper stocks used for manufacturing recycled 
paper. Therefore, temporary tolerances for residues of PCB's as 
unavoidable environmental or industrial contaminants are established for 
a sufficient period of time following the effective date of this 
paragraph to permit the elimination of such contaminants at the earliest 
practicable time. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) is applicable to mixtures of 
chlorinated biphenyl compounds, irrespective of which mixture of PCB's 
is present as the residue. The temporary tolerances for residues of 
PCB's are as follows:
    (1) 0.2 part per million in finished animal feed for food-producing 
animals (except the following finished animal feeds: feed concentrates, 
feed supplements, and feed premixes).
    (2) 2 parts per million in animal feed components of animal origin, 
including fishmeal and other by-products of marine origin and in 
finished animal feed concentrates, supplements, and premixes intended 
for food-producing animals.
    (3) 10 parts per million in paper food-packaging material intended 
for or used with finished animal feed and any components intended for 
animal feeds. The tolerance shall not apply to paper food-packaging 
material separated from the food therein by a functional barrier which 
is impermeable to migration of PCB's.
    (b) A compilation entitled ``Analytical Methodology for 
Polychlorinated Biphenyls, February 1973'' for determining compliance 
with the tolerances established in this section is available from the 
Division of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration, 5630 
Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.

Sec. 510.105  Labeling of drugs for use in milk-producing animals.

    (a) Part 526 of this chapter provides for new animal drugs intended 
for intramammary use in animals and includes conditions of use intended 
to prevent the contamination of milk from the use of such drugs.
    (b) Preparations containing antibiotics and other potent drugs 
labeled with directions for use in milk-producing animals will be 
misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the act unless their labeling 
bears appropriate warnings and directions for use to avoid adulteration 
of milk under section 402(a)(2)(c)(ii) of the act.
    (c) It is the position of the Food and Drug Administration that the 
labeling

[[Page 40]]

for such preparations should bear a clear warning that either:
    (1) The article should not be administered to animals producing 
milk, since to do so would result in contamination of the milk; or
    (2) The label should bear the following statement: ``Warning: Milk 
that has been taken from animals during treatment and for ---- hours 
after the latest treatment must not be used for food'', the blank being 
filled in with the figure that the manufacturer has determined by 
appropriate investigation is needed to insure that the milk will not 
carry violative residues resulting from use of the preparation. If the 
use of the preparation as recommended does not result in contamination 
of the milk, neither of the above warning statements is required.

Sec. 510.106  Labeling of antibiotic and antibiotic-containing drugs
intended for use in milk-producing animals.

    Whenever the labeling of an antibiotic drug included in the 
regulations in this chapter suggests or recommends its use in milk-
producing animals, the label of such drugs shall bear either the 
statement ``Warning: Not for use in animals producing milk, since this 
use will result in contamination of the milk'' or the statement 
``Warning: Milk that has been taken from animals during treatment and 
for ----hours after the latest treatment must not be used for food'', 
the blank being filled in with the figure that the Commissioner has 
authorized the manufacturer of the drug to use. The Commissioner shall 
determine what such figures shall be from information submitted by the 
manufacturer and which the Commissioner considers is adequate to prove 
that period of time after the latest treatment that the milk from 
treated animals will contain no violative residues from use of the 
preparation. If the Commissioner determines from the information 
submitted that the use of the antibiotic drug as recommended does not 
result in its appearance in the milk, the Commissioner may exempt the 
drug from bearing either of the above warning statements.

Sec. 510.110  Antibiotics used in food-producing animals.

    (a) The Food and Drug Administration in the interest of fulfilling 
its responsibilities with regard to protection of the public health has 
requested an evaluation of the public health aspects of the use of 
antibiotics in veterinary medical and nonmedical uses. There is 
particular concern with regard to the potential hazards associated with 
the extensive use of antibiotics administered to food-producing animals. 
Accordingly, an ad hoc committee on the Veterinary Medical and 
Nonmedical Uses of Antibiotics was established by the Food and Drug 
Administration to study and advise the Commissioner of Food and Drugs on 
the uses of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and for various 
nonmedical purposes as such uses may affect the enforcement of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to their safety and 
effectiveness.
    (b) Based upon an evaluation of the conclusions of said Committee 
and other relevant material, Sec. 510.112 was published in the Federal 
Register of August 23, 1966 (31 FR 11141), asking sponsors of drugs 
containing any antibiotic intended for use in food-producing animals to 
submit data to establish whether such antibiotic and its metabolites are 
present as residues in edible tissues, milk, and eggs from treated 
animals. The data on the residues of antibiotics in milk from 
intramammary infusion preparations were requested within 60 days and the 
data on all other products were requested within 180 days following the 
date of publication of Sec. 510.112 in the Federal Register.
    (c) An evaluation of the data now available shows that use of many 
antibiotic preparations cause residues in edible products of treated 
animals for varying and, in some cases, for long periods of time 
following the last administration. Because of the accumulation of new 
information with regard to the development of resistance of bacteria to 
antibiotics, the ability of bacteria to

[[Page 41]]

transfer this resistance, and the development of sensitivity to 
antibiotics in humans, unauthorized and unsafe residues of antibiotics 
cannot be permitted in food obtained from treated animals.
    (d) Based on evaluation of information available, including the 
conclusions of the aforementioned ad hoc Committee, the Commissioner 
concludes that antibiotic preparations intended for use in food-
producing animals, other than topical and ophthalmic preparations, are 
not generally recognized among qualified experts as having been shown to 
be safe for their intended use(s) within the meaning of section 201(s) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
    (e) Therefore, all exemptions from the provisions of section 409 of 
the act for use of antibiotics in food-producing animals based on 
sanctions or approvals granted prior to enactment of the Food Additives 
Amendment of 1958 (Pub. L. 85-929; 72 Stat. 1784) will be revoked and 
the uses which are concluded to be safe will be covered by food additive 
regulations. On those products for which there are inadequate residue 
data, actions will be initiated to withdraw approval of new-drug 
applications under the provisions of section 505 of the act. Antibiotic 
preparations, other than those for topical and ophthalmic application in 
food-producing animals, which are not covered by food additive 
regulations will be subject to regulatory action within 180 days after 
publication of the forthcoming revocation order.
    (f) Because of the variation in the period of time that antibiotic 
residues may remain in edible products from treated animals, all 
injectable, intramammary infusion, intrauterine, and oral preparations, 
including medicated premixes intended for use in food-producing animals, 
are deemed to be new drugs as well as food additives.

Sec. 510.112  Antibiotics used in veterinary medicine and for 
nonmedical purposes; required data.

    (a) An ad hoc committee, Committee on the Veterinary Medical and 
Nonmedical Uses of Antibiotics, was formed by the Food and Drug 
Administration to study, and advise the Commissioner on, the use of 
antibiotics in veterinary medicine and for various nonmedical purposes 
as such uses may affect the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act with respect to the safety and effectiveness of such 
substances. A copy of the report may be obtained from the Food and Drug 
Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Room 15-05, Parklawn Building, 
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.
    (b) On the basis of the report of the Committee and other 
information, sponsors of drugs containing any antibiotic intended for 
use in food-producing animals shall submit data for determining whether 
or not such antibiotics and their metabolites are present as residues in 
edible tissues, milk, and eggs from treated animals; however, in the 
case of a drug for which such data have already been submitted and for 
which a regulation has been promulgated under section 409 of the act, 
only such data as has been accumulated since the issuance of the 
regulation need be submitted.
    (c) The required data shall be submitted within 180 days of the date 
of publication of this section in the Federal Register; except that in 
the case of data on intramammary infusion preparations the data shall be 
submitted within 60 days of such publication. Data demonstrating the 
absence in milk of residues of intramammary infusion preparations when 
used as directed in their labeling are needed within the 60-day period 
because of the importance of milk in the human diet.
    (d) Regulatory proceedings including revocation of prior sanctions, 
or actions to suspend or amend new drug or antibiotic approvals granted 
prior to passage of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (72 Stat. 
1784), may be initiated with regard to the continued marketing of any 
antibiotic preparation on which the required information is not 
submitted within the period of time prescribed by paragraph (c) of this 
section.

protocols and assay methods for determining the amount of antibiotic 
residues in food

drug, except that this requirement shall not apply to the submission of 
information described in a written communication to the applicant from 
the Food and Drug Administration as types of information that may be 
submitted at other designated intervals. Unexpected as used in this 
paragraph refers to conditions or developments not previously submitted 
as part of the new animal drug application or in support of the index 
listing or not encountered during clinical trials of the drug, or 
conditions or developments occurring at a rate higher than shown by 
information previously submitted as part of the new animal drug 
application or in support of the index listing or at a rate higher than 
encountered during such clinical trials.
    (2) Information concerning any unusual failure of the new animal

          Subpart E_Requirements for Specific New Animal Drugs


<R05>
Sec. 510.410  Corticosteroids for oral, injectable, and ophthalmic
use in animals; warnings and labeling requirements.

    (a) The Food and Drug Administration has received reports of side 
effects associated with the oral, injectable, and ophthalmic use of 
corticosteroid animal drugs. The use of these drugs administered orally 
or by injection has resulted in premature parturition when administered 
during the last trimester of pregnancy. Premature parturition

[[Page 43]]

may be followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and 
metritis. Additionally, corticosteroids used in dogs, rabbits, and 
rodents during pregnancy have produced cleft palate in offspring. Use in 
dogs has resulted in other congenital anomalies, including deformed 
forelegs, phocomelia, and anasarca. Drugs subject to this section are 
required to carry the veterinary prescription legend and are subject to 
the labeling requirements of Sec. 201.105 of this chapter.
    (b) In view of these potentially serious side effects, the Food and 
Drug Administration has concluded that the labeling on or within 
packaged corticosteroid-containing preparations intended for animal use 
shall bear conspicuously the following warning statement:

    Warning: Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that 
corticosteroids administered orally or by injection to animals may 
induce the first stage of parturition if used during the last trimester 
of pregnancy and may precipitate premature parturition followed by 
dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis.
    Additionally, corticosteroids administered to dogs, rabbits, and 
rodents during pregnancy have resulted in cleft palate in offspring. 
Corticosteroids administered to dogs during pregnancy have also resulted 
in other congenital anomalies, including deformed forelegs, phocomelia, 
and anasarca.

[49 FR 48535, Dec. 13, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 510.440  Injectable iron preparations.

    There has been an increasing interest in the use of injectable iron 
compounds for the prevention or treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in 
animals. Although some such preparations have been shown to be safe, 
such articles are regarded as new animal drugs within the meaning of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Accordingly, an approved new 
animal drug application is required prior to the marketing of such 
preparations within the jurisdiction of the act. In addition to the need 
for demonstrating the safety of such articles, the labeling of such 
preparations should not only recommend appropriate dosages of iron but 
also declare the amount (in milligrams) of available iron (Fe) per 
milliliter of the subject product.


<R05>
Sec. 510.455  Requirements for free-choice medicated feeds.

    (a) What is free-choice medicated feed? For the purpose of this 
part, free-choice medicated feed is medicated feed that is placed in 
feeding or grazing areas and is not intended to be consumed fully at a 
single feeding or to constitute the entire diet of the animal. Free-
choice feeds include, but are not limited to, medicated blocks 
(agglomerated feed compressed or rendered into a solid mass and cohesive 
enough to hold its form), mineral mixes, and liquid feed tank 
supplements (``lick tank'' supplements) containing one or more new 
animal drugs. The manufacture of medicated free-choice feeds is subject 
to the current good manufacturing practice regulations in part 225 of 
this chapter for medicated feeds.
    (b) What is required for new animal drugs intended for use in free-
choice feed? Any new animal drug intended for use in free-choice feed 
must be approved for such use under section 512 of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360(b)) or listed in the 
index under section 572 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360ccc-1). Such approvals 
under section 512 of the act must be:
    (1) An original new animal drug application (NADA),
    (2) A supplemental NADA, or
    (3) An abbreviated NADA.
    (c) What are the approval requirements under section 512 of the act 
for new animal drugs intended for use in free-choice feed? An approval 
under section 512 of the act for a Type A medicated article intended for 
use in free-choice feed must contain the following information:
    (1) Data, or reference to data in a master file (MF), showing that 
the target animal consumes the new animal drug in the Type C free-choice 
feed in an amount that is safe and effective (consumption/effectiveness 
data); and
    (2) Data, or reference to data in an MF, showing the relevant ranges 
of conditions under which the drug will be chemically and physically 
stable in the Type C free-choice feed under field conditions.
    (d) How are consumption/effectiveness and/or stability data to be 
submitted? The data must be submitted as follows:

[[Page 44]]

    (1) Directly in the NADA, by a sponsor; and/or
    (2) To an MF that a sponsor may then reference in its NADA with 
written consent of the MF holder.
    (e) What will be stated in the published approval for a new animal 
drug intended for use in free-choice feed? The approval of a new animal 
drug intended for use in free-choice feed, as published in this 
subchapter, will include:
    (1) The formula and/or specifications of the free-choice medicated 
feed, where the owner of this information requests such publication, or
    (2) A statement that the approval has been granted for a proprietary 
formula and/or specifications.
    (f) When is a medicated feed mill license required for the 
manufacture of a free-choice medicated feed? An approved medicated feed 
mill license is required for the manufacture of the following types of 
feeds:
    (1) All free-choice medicated feeds that contain a Category II drug, 
and
    (2) Free-choice medicated feeds that contain a Category I drug and 
use a proprietary formula and/or specifications.

PART 511_NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR INVESTIGATIONAL USE--Table of Contents

<R05>


    Authority: 21 U.S.C. 321, 351, 352, 353, 360b, 371.


<R05>
Sec. 511.1  New animal drugs for investigational use exempt from 
section 512(a) of the act.

    (a) New animal drugs for tests in vitro and in laboratory research 
animals. (1) A shipment or other delivery of a new animal drug or animal 
feed bearing or containing a new animal drug intended solely for tests 
in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory research purposes shall 
be exempt from section 512 (a) and (m) of the act if it is labeled as 
follows:

    Caution. Contains a new animal drug for investigational use only in 
laboratory research animals or for tests in vitro. Not for use in 
humans.

    (2) The person distributing or causing the distribution of new 
animal drugs for tests in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory 
research purposes under this exemption shall use due diligence to assure 
that the consignee is regularly engaged in conducting such tests and 
that the shipment of the new animal drug will actually be used for tests 
in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory research.
    (3) The person who introduced such shipment or who delivered the new 
animal drug for introduction into interstate commerce shall maintain 
adequate records showing the name and post office address of the expert 
or expert organization to whom the new animal drug is shipped and the 
date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and delivery for 
a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon the request 
of a properly authorized employee of the Department at reasonable times, 
he shall make such records available for inspection and copying.
    (4) The exemption allowed in this paragraph shall not apply to any 
new animal drug intended for in vitro use in the regular course of 
diagnosing or treating disease, including antibacterial sensitivity 
discs impregnated with any new animal drug or drugs, which discs are 
intended for use in determining susceptibility of microorganisms to the 
new animal drug or drugs.
    (b) New animal drugs for clinical investigation in animals. A 
shipment or other delivery of a new animal drug or an animal feed 
containing a new animal drug intended for clinical investigational use 
in animals shall be exempt from section 512(a) and (m) of the act if all 
the following conditions are met:
    (1) The label shall bear the statements:

    Caution. Contains a new animal drug for use only in investigational 
animals in clinical trials. Not for use in humans. Edible products of 
investigational animals are not to be used for food unless authorization 
has been granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture.

    In the case of containers too small or otherwise unable to 
accommodate a label with sufficient space to bear the caution statements 
required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the statements may be 
included on the carton label and other labeling on or within the package 
from which the new animal drug is to be dispensed.
    (2) The person or firm distributing or causing the distribution of 
the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug shall 
use due diligence to assure that the new animal drug or animal feed 
containing a new animal drug will actually be used for tests in animals 
and is not used in humans.
    (3) The person who introduced such shipment or who delivered the new 
animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug for introduction 
into interstate commerce shall maintain adequate records showing the 
name and post office address of the investigator to whom the new animal 
drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug is shipped and the 
date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and delivery for 
a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon the request 
of a properly authorized employee of the Department at reasonable times, 
such records shall be made available for inspection and copying.
    (4) Prior to shipment of the new animal drug for clinical tests in 
animals, the sponsor of the investigation shall

[[Page 50]]

submit in triplicate to the Food and Drug Administration a ``Notice of 
Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Animal Drug'' including a 
signed statement containing the following information:
    (i) The identity of the new animal drug.
    (ii) All labeling and other pertinent information to be supplied to 
the investigators. When such pertinent information includes nonclinical 
laboratory studies, the information shall include, with respect to each 
nonclinical study, either a statement that the study was conducted in 
compliance with the requirements set forth in part 58 of this chapter, 
or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations, 
a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.
    (iii) The name and address of each clinical investigator.
    (iv) The approximate number of animals to be treated (or if not 
available, the amount of new animal drug to be shipped).
    (v) If the new animal drug is given to food-producing animals, the 
statement shall contain the following additional information:
    (a) A commitment that the edible products from such animals shall 
not be used for food without prior authorization in accordance with the 
provisions prescribed in this section.
    (b) Approximate dates of the beginning and end of the experiment or 
series of experiments.
    (c) The maximum daily dose(s) to be administered to a given species, 
the size of animal, maximum duration of administration, method(s) of 
administration, and proposed withdrawal time, if any.
    (vi) If a sponsor has transferred any obligations for the conduct of 
any clinical study to a contract research organization, a statement 
containing the name and address of the contract research organization, 
identification of the clinical study, and a listing of the obligations 
transferred. If all obligations governing the conduct of the study have 
been transferred, a general statement of this transfer--in lieu of a 
listing of the specific obligations transferred--may be submitted.
    (5) Authorization for use of edible products derived from a treated 
food-producing animal may be granted under the provisions of this 
section and when the following specified conditions are met, except that 
in the case of an animal administered any unlicensed experimental 
veterinary biological product regulated under the viruses, serums, 
toxins statute (21 U.S.C., chapter V, sec. 151 et seq. ) the product 
shall be exempt from the requirements of this section when U.S. 
Department of Agriculture approval has been obtained as provided in 9 
CFR 103.2. Conditional authorization may be granted in advance of 
identification of the name(s) and address(es) of the clinical 
investigator(s) as required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. 
Information required for authorization shall include, in addition to all 
other requirements of this section, the following:
    (i) Data to show that consumption of food derived from animals 
treated at the maximum levels with the minimum withdrawal periods, if 
any, specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v)(c) of this 
section, will not be inconsistent with the public health; or
    (ii) Data to show that food derived from animals treated at the 
maximum levels and with the minimum withdrawal periods, if any, 
specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v)(c) of this section, 
does not contain drug residues or metabolites.
    (iii) The name and location of the packing plant where the animals 
will be processed, except that this requirement may be waived, on 
request, by the terms of the authorization.

Authorizations granted under this paragraph do not exempt 
investigational animals and their products from compliance with other 
applicable inspection requirements. Any person who contests a refusal to 
grant such authorization shall have an opportunity for a regulatory 
hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of 
this chapter.
    (6) On written request of the Food and Drug Administration, the 
sponsor shall submit any additional information reported to or otherwise 
received by him with respect to the investigation deemed necessary to 
facilitate a determination whether there are

[[Page 51]]

grounds in the interest of public health for terminating the exemption.
    (7) The sponsor shall assure himself that the new animal drug is 
shipped only to investigators who:
    (i) Are qualified by scientific training and/experience to evaluate 
the safety and/or effectiveness of the new animal drug.
    (ii) Shall maintain complete records of the investigations, 
including complete records of the receipt and disposition of each 
shipment or delivery of the new animal drug under investigation. Copies 
of all records of the investigation shall be retained by the 
investigator for 2 years after the termination of the investigation or 
approval of a new animal drug application.
    (iii) Shall furnish adequate and timely reports of the investigation 
to the sponsor.
    (8) The sponsor:
    (i) Shall retain all reports received from investigators for 2 years 
after the termination of the investigation or approval of a new animal 
drug application and make such reports available to a duly authorized 
employee of the Department for inspection at all reasonable times.
    (ii) Shall provide for current monitoring of the investigation by a 
person qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate 
information obtained from the investigation, and shall promptly 
investigate and report to the Food and Drug Administration and to all 
investigators any findings associated with use of the new animal drug 
that may suggest significant hazards pertinent to the safety of the new 
animal drug.
    (iii) Shall not unduly prolong distribution of the new animal drug 
for investigational use.
    (iv) Shall not, nor shall any person acting for or on behalf of the 
sponsor, represent that the new animal drug is safe or effective for the 
purposes for which it is under investigation. This requirement is not 
intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information.
    (v) Shall not commercially distribute nor test-market the new animal 
drug until a new animal drug application is approved pursuant to section 
512(c) of the act.
    (9) If the shipment or other delivery of the new animal drug is 
imported or offered for importation into the United States for clinical 
investigational use in animals, it shall also meet the following 
conditions:
    (i) The importer of all such shipments or deliveries is an agent of 
the foreign exporter residing in the United States or the ultimate 
consignee, which person has, prior to such shipments and deliveries, 
informed the Food and Drug Administration of his intention to import the 
new animal drug as sponsor in compliance with the conditions prescribed 
in this subdivision; or
    (ii) The new animal drug is shipped directly to a scientific 
institution with adequate facilities and qualified personnel to conduct 
laboratory or clinical investigations and is intended solely for use in 
such institutions and which institution has submitted a statement as 
sponsor of the investigation.
    (10) The sponsor shall submit either a claim for categorical 
exclusion under Sec. 25.30 or Sec. 25.33 of this chapter or an 
environmental assessment under Sec. 25.40 of this chapter.
    (c) Withdrawal of eligibility to receive investigational-use new 
animal drugs. (1) Whenever the Food and Drug Administration has 
information indicating that an investigator has repeatedly or 
deliberately failed to comply with the conditions of these exempting 
regulations or has submitted false information either to the sponsor of 
the investigation or in any required report, the Center for Veterinary 
Medicine will furnish the investigator written notice of the matter 
complained of in general terms and offer him an opportunity to explain 
the matter in an informal conference and/or in writing. If an 
explanation is offered but not accepted by the Center for Veterinary 
Medicine, the investigator shall have an opportunity for a regulatory 
hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of 
this chapter on the question of whether the investigator is entitled to 
receive investigational new animal drugs.
    (2) If, after evaluating all available information, including any 
explanation presented by the investigator, the

[[Page 52]]

Commissioner determines that the investigator has repeatedly or 
deliberately failed to comply with the conditions of the exempting 
regulations in this section or has repeatedly or deliberately submitted 
false information to the sponsor of an investigation, the Commissioner 
will notify the investigator and the sponsor of any investigation in 
which he has been named as a participant that the investigator is not 
entitled to receive investigational use new animal drugs with a 
statement of the basis for such determination.
    (3) Each ``Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New 
Animal Drug'' and each approved new animal drug application containing 
data reported by an investigator who has been determined to be 
ineligible to receive investigational-use new animal drugs will be 
examined to determine whether he has submitted unreliable data that are 
essential to the continuation of the investigation or essential to the 
approval of any new animal drug application.
    (4) If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data 
submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that 
the data remaining are inadequate to support a conclusion that it is 
reasonably safe to continue the investigation, he shall first notify the 
sponsor, who shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before 
the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of this chapter on 
whether the exemption should be terminated. If a danger to the public 
health exists, however, he shall terminate the exemption forthwith and 
notify the sponsor of the termination. In such event the sponsor shall 
have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug 
Administration pursuant to part 16 (see 42 FR 15675, March 22, 1977) of 
this chapter on the question of whether the exemption should be 
reinstated.
    (5) If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data 
submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that 
the data remaining are such that a new animal drug application would not 
have been approved, he will proceed to withdraw approval of the 
application in accordance with section 512(e) of the act.
    (6) An investigator who has been determined to be ineligible may be 
reinstated as eligible to receive investigational-use new animal drugs 
when the Commissioner determines that he has presented adequate 
assurance that he will employ such new animal drugs solely in compliance 
with the exempting regulations in this section for investigational-use 
new animal drugs.
    (d) Termination of exemption. If the Commissioner finds that:
    (1) The sponsor of the investigation has failed to comply with any 
of the conditions for the exemption established under this section, or
    (2) The continuance of the investigation is unsafe or otherwise 
contrary to the public interest or the drug is being or has been used 
for purposes other than bona fide scientific investigation, he shall 
first notify the sponsor and invite his immediate correction. If the 
conditions of the exemption are not immediately met, the sponsor shall 
have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug 
Administration pursuant of part 16 of this chapter on whether the 
exemption should be terminated. If the exemption is terminated the 
sponsor shall recall or have destroyed the unused supplies of the new 
animal drug.
    (e) Statements and requests. ``Notice(s) of Claimed Investigational 
Exemption for a New Animal Drug'' and requests for authorization to use 
investigational animals and their products for food should be addressed 
to the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug 
Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Pl., 
Rockville, MD 20855.
    (f) Contract research organizations. (1) For purposes of this part 
and part 514, contract research organization means a person that 
assumes, as an independent contractor with the sponsor, one or more of 
the obligations of a sponsor, e.g., design of a protocol, selection or 
monitoring of investigations, evaluation of reports, and preparation of 
materials to be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.
    (2) A sponsor may transfer responsibility for any or all of the 
obligations set forth in this part to a contract research organization. 
Any such transfer

[[Page 53]]

shall be in writing and, if not all obligations are transferred, shall 
describe each of the obligations being assumed by the contract research 
organization. If all obligations are transferred, a general statement 
that all obligations have been transferred is acceptable. Any obligation 
not covered by the written description shall be deemed not to have been 
transferred.
    (3) A contract research organization that assumes any obligation of 
a sponsor shall comply with the specific regulations in this chapter 
applicable to this obligation and shall be subject to the same 
regulatory action as a sponsor for failure to comply with any obligation 
assumed under these regulations. Thus, all references to sponsor in this 
part apply to a contract research organization to the extent that it 
assumes one or more obligations of the sponsor.
    (g) Index of legally marketed unapproved new animal drugs for minor 
species. All provisions of part 511 apply to new animal drugs for 
investigational use in support of indexing, as described in section 572 
of the act, subject to the provisions of Sec. 516.125 of this chapter.

subdivisions, each containing at least three times the amount required 
to perform the laboratory test procedures described in the application 
to determine compliance with its control specifications for identity and 
assays. Each of the samples submitted shall be appropriately packaged 
and labeled to preserve its characteristics, to identify the material 
and the quantity in each subdivision of the sample, and to identify each 
subdivision with the name of the applicant and the new animal drug 
application to which it relates. Included are:
    (a) A sample or samples of any reference standard and blank used in 
the procedures described in the application for assaying each new animal 
drug and other assayed components of the finished new animal drug.
    (b) A representative sample or samples of each strength of the 
finished dosage form proposed in the application and employed in the 
clinical investigations and a representative sample or samples of each 
new animal drug from the batch(es) employed in the production of such 
dosage form.
    (c) A representative sample or samples of finished market packages 
of each strength of the dosage form of the new animal drug prepared for 
initial marketing and, if any such sample is not from a representative 
commercial-scale production batch, such a sample from a representative 
commercial-scale production batch, and a representative sample or 
samples of each new animal drug from the batch(es) employed in the 
production of such dosage form, provided that in the case of new animal 
drugs marketed in large packages the sample should contain only three 
times a sufficient quantity of the new animal drug to allow for 
performing the control tests for drug identity and assays.

[[Page 58]]

    (ii) The following information shall be included for the samples 
when requested:
    (a) For each sample submitted, full information regarding its 
identity and the origin of any new animal drug contained therein 
(including a statement whether it was produced on a laboratory, pilot-
plant, or full-production scale) and detailed results of all laboratory 
tests made to determine the identity, strength, quality, and purity of 
the batch represented by the sample, including assays.
    (b) For any reference standard submitted, a complete description of 
its preparation and the results of all laboratory tests on it. If the 
test methods used differed from those described in the application, full 
details of the methods employed in obtaining the reporting results.
    (7) Analytical methods for residues. Applications shall include a 
description of practicable methods for determining the quantity, if any, 
of the new animal drug in or on food, and any substance formed in or on 
food because of its use, and the proposed tolerance or withdrawal period 
or other use restrictions to ensure that the proposed use of this drug 
will be safe. When data or other adequate information establish that it 
is not reasonable to expect the new animal drug to become a component of 
food at concentrations considered unsafe, a regulatory method is not 
required.
    (i) The kind of information required by this subdivision may 
include: Complete experimental protocols for determining drug residue 
levels in the edible products, and the length of time required for 
residues to be eliminated from such products following the drug's use; 
residue studies conducted under appropriate (consistent with the 
proposed usage) conditions of dosage, time, and route of administration 
to show levels, if any, of the drug and/or its metabolites in test 
animals during and upon cessation of treatment and at intervals 
thereafter in order to establish a disappearance curve; if the drug is 
to be used in combination with other drugs, possible effects of 
interaction demonstrated by the appropriate disappearance curve or 
depletion patterns after drug withdrawal under appropriate (consistent 
with the proposed usage) conditions of dosage, time, and route of 
administration; if the drug is given in the feed or water, appropriate 
consumption records of the medicated feed or water and appropriate 
performance data in the treated animal; if the drug is to be used in 
more than one species, drug residue studies or appropriate metabolic 
studies conducted for each species that is food-producing. To provide 
these data, a sufficient number of birds or animals should be used at 
each sample interval. Appropriate use of labeled compounds (e.g. 
radioactive tracers), may be utilized to establish metabolism and 
depletion curves. Drug residue levels ordinarily should be determined in 
muscle, liver, kidney, and fat and where applicable, in skin, milk, and 
eggs (yolk and egg white). As a part of the metabolic studies, levels of 
the drug or metabolite should be determined in blood where feasible. 
Samples may be combined where necessary. Where residues are suspected or 
known to be present in litter from treated animals, it may be necessary 
to include data with respect to such residues becoming components of 
other agricultural commodities because of use of litter from treated 
animals.
    (ii) A new animal drug that has the potential to contaminate human 
food with residues whose consumption could present a risk of cancer to 
people must satisfy the requirements of subpart E of part 500 of this 
chapter.
    (8) Evidence to establish safety and effectiveness. (i) An 
application may be refused unless it contains full reports of adequate 
tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not the 
new animal drug is safe and effective for use as suggested in the 
proposed labeling.
    (ii) An application may be refused unless it includes substantial 
evidence of the effectiveness of the new animal drug as defined in Sec. 
514.4.

reports of the investigations, including studies made on laboratory 
animals, in which the purpose, methods, and results obtained are clearly 
set forth of acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity, and unless it 
contains appropriate clinical laboratory results related to safety and

[[Page 59]]

efficacy. Such information should include identification of the person 
who conducted each investigation, a statement of where the 
investigations were conducted, and where the raw data are available in 
the application.
    (iv) All information pertinent to an evaluation of the safety and 
effectiveness of the new animal drug received or otherwise obtained by 
the applicant from any source, including information derived from other 
investigations or commercial marketing (for example, outside the United 
States), or reports in the scientific literature, both favorable and 
unfavorable, involving the new animal drug that is the subject of the 
application and related new animal drugs shall be submitted. An adequate 
summary may be acceptable in lieu of a reprint of a published report 
that only supports other data submitted. Include any evaluation of the 
safety or effectiveness of the new animal drug that has been made by the 
applicant's veterinary or medical department, expert committee, or 
consultants.
    (v) If the new animal drug is a combination of active ingredients or 
animal drugs, an application may be refused unless it includes 
substantial evidence of the effectiveness of the combination new animal 
drug as required in Sec. 514.4.
    (vi) An application shall include a complete list of the names and 
post office addresses of all investigators who received the new animal 
drug. This may be incorporated in whole or in part by reference to 
information submitted under the provisions of Sec. 511.1 of this 
chapter.
    (vii) Explain any omission of reports from any investigator to whom 
the investigational new animal drug has been made available. The 
unexplained omission of any reports of investigations made with the new 
animal drug by the applicant or submitted to him by an investigator or 
the unexplained omission of any pertinent reports of investigations or 
clinical experience received or otherwise obtained by the applicant from 
published literature or other sources that would bias an evaluation of 
the safety of the new animal drug or its effectiveness in use, 
constitutes grounds for the refusal or withdrawal of the approval of an 
application.
    (viii) If a sponsor has transferred any obligations for the conduct 
of any clinical study to a contract research organization, the 
application is required to include a statement containing the name and 
address of the contract research organization, identifying the clinical 
study, and listing the obligations transferred. If all obligations 
governing the conduct of the study have been transferred, a general 
statement of this transfer--in lieu of a listing of the specific 
obligations transferred--may be submitted.
    (ix) If original subject records were audited or reviewed by the 
sponsor in the course of monitoring any clinical study to verify the 
accuracy of the case reports submitted to the sponsor, a list 
identifying each clinical study so audited or reviewed.

Sec. 514.3  Definitions.

    The definition and interpretation of terms contained in this section 
apply to those terms as used throughout subchapter E.
    Adverse drug experience is any adverse event associated with the use 
of a new animal drug, whether or not considered to be drug related, and 
whether or not the new animal drug was used in accordance with the 
approved labeling (i.e., used according to label directions or used in 
an extralabel manner, including but not limited to different route of 
administration, different species, different indications, or other than 
labeled dosage). Adverse drug experience includes, but is not limited 
to:
    (1) An adverse event occurring in animals in the course of the use 
of an animal drug product by a veterinarian or by a livestock producer 
or other animal owner or caretaker.
    (2) Failure of a new animal drug to produce its expected 
pharmacological or clinical effect (lack of expected effectiveness).

[[Page 61]]

    (3) An adverse event occurring in humans from exposure during 
manufacture, testing, handling, or use of a new animal drug.
    ANADA is an abbreviated new animal drug application including all 
amendments and supplements.
    Applicant is a person or entity who owns or holds on behalf of the 
owner the approval for an NADA or an ANADA, and is responsible for 
compliance with applicable provisions of the act and regulations.
    Increased frequency of adverse drug experience is an increased rate 
of occurrence of a particular serious adverse drug event, expected or 
unexpected, after appropriate adjustment for drug exposure.
    NADA is a new animal drug application including all amendments and 
supplements.
    Nonapplicant is any person other than the applicant whose name 
appears on the label and who is engaged in manufacturing, packing, 
distribution, or labeling of the product.
    Potential applicant means any person:
    (1) Intending to investigate a new animal drug under section 512(j) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act),
    (2) Investigating a new animal drug under section 512(j) of the act,
    (3) Intending to file a new animal drug application (NADA) or 
supplemental NADA under section 512(b)(1) of the act, or
    (4) Intending to file an abbreviated new animal drug application 
(ANADA) under section 512(b)(2) of the act.
    Presubmission conference means one or more conferences between a 
potential applicant and FDA to reach a binding agreement establishing a 
submission or investigational requirement.
    Presubmission conference agreement means that section of the 
memorandum of conference headed ``Presubmission Conference Agreement'' 
that records any agreement on the submission or investigational 
requirement reached by a potential applicant and FDA during the 
presubmission conference.
    Product defect/manufacturing defect is the deviation of a 
distributed product from the standards specified in the approved 
application, or any significant chemical, physical, or other change, or 
deterioration in the distributed drug product, including any microbial 
or chemical contamination. A manufacturing defect is a product defect 
caused or aggravated by a manufacturing or related process. A 
manufacturing defect may occur from a single event or from deficiencies 
inherent to the manufacturing process. These defects are generally 
associated with product contamination, product deterioration, 
manufacturing error, defective packaging, damage from disaster, or 
labeling error. For example, a labeling error may include any incident 
that causes a distributed product to be mistaken for, or its labeling 
applied to, another product.
    Serious adverse drug experience is an adverse event that is fatal, 
or life-threatening, or requires professional intervention, or causes an 
abortion, or stillbirth, or infertility, or congenital anomaly, or 
prolonged or permanent disability, or disfigurement.
    Unexpected adverse drug experience is an adverse event that is not 
listed in the current labeling for the new animal drug and includes any 
event that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an 
event listed on the labeling, but differs from the event because of 
greater severity or specificity. For example, under this definition 
hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the labeling referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.

Sec. 514.4  Substantial evidence.

    (a) Definition of substantial evidence. Substantial evidence means 
evidence consisting of one or more adequate and well-controlled studies, 
such as a study in a target species, study in laboratory animals, field 
study, bioequivalence study, or an in vitro study, on the basis of which 
it could fairly and reasonably be concluded by experts qualified by 
scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
new animal drug involved that the new animal drug will have the effect 
it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use 
prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling

[[Page 62]]

or proposed labeling thereof. Substantial evidence shall include such 
adequate and well-controlled studies that are, as a matter of sound 
scientific judgment, necessary to establish that a new animal drug will 
have its intended effect.
    (b) Characteristics of substantial evidence--(1) Qualifications of 
experts. Any study that is intended to be part of substantial evidence 
of the effectiveness of a new animal drug shall be conducted by experts 
qualified by scientific training and experience.
    (2) Intended uses and conditions of use. Substantial evidence of 
effectiveness of a new animal drug shall demonstrate that the new animal 
drug is effective for each intended use and associated conditions of use 
for and under which approval is sought.
    (i) Dose range labeling. Sponsors should, to the extent possible, 
provide for a dose range because it increases the utility of the new 
animal drug by providing the user flexibility in the selection of a safe 
and effective dose. In general, substantial evidence to support dose 
range labeling for a new animal drug intended for use in the diagnosis, 
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease must consist of at 
least one adequate and well-controlled study on the basis of which 
qualified experts could fairly and reasonably conclude that the new 
animal drug will be effective for the intended use at the lowest dose of 
the dose range suggested in the proposed labeling for that intended use. 
Substantial evidence to support dose range labeling for a new animal 
drug intended to affect the structure or function of the body of an 
animal generally must consist of at least one adequate and well-
controlled study on the basis of which qualified experts could fairly 
and reasonably conclude that the new animal drug will be effective for 
the intended use at all doses within the range suggested in the proposed 
labeling for the intended use.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) Studies--(i) Number. Substantial evidence of the effectiveness 
of a new animal drug for each intended use and associated conditions of 
use shall consist of a sufficient number of current adequate and well-
controlled studies of sufficient quality and persuasiveness to permit 
qualified experts:
    (A) To determine that the parameters selected for measurement and 
the measured responses reliably reflect the effectiveness of the new 
animal drug;
    (B) To determine that the results obtained are likely to be 
repeatable, and that valid inferences can be drawn to the target animal 
population; and
    (C) To conclude that the new animal drug is effective for the 
intended use at the dose or dose range and associated conditions of use 
prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.
    (ii) Types. Adequate and well-controlled studies that are intended 
to provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of a new animal 
drug may include, but are not limited to, published studies, foreign 
studies, studies using models, and studies conducted by or on behalf of 
the sponsor. Studies using models shall be validated to establish an 
adequate relationship of parameters measured and effects observed in the 
model with one or more significant effects of treatment.
    (c) Substantial evidence for combination new animal drugs--(1) 
Definitions. The following definitions of terms apply to this section:
    (i) Combination new animal drug means a new animal drug that 
contains more than one active ingredient or animal drug that is applied 
or administered simultaneously in a single dosage form or simultaneously 
in or on animal feed or drinking water.
    (ii) Dosage form combination new animal drug means a combination new 
animal drug intended for use other than in animal feed or drinking 
water.
    (iii) Antibacterial with respect to a particular target animal 
species means an active ingredient or animal drug: That is approved in 
that species for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or 
prevention of bacterial disease; or that is approved for use in that 
species for any other use that is attributable to its antibacterial 
properties. But, antibacterial does not include ionophores or arsenicals 
intended for use in combination in animal feed or drinking water.
    (iv) Appropriate concurrent use exists when there is credible 
evidence that

[[Page 63]]

the conditions for which the combination new animal drug is intended can 
occur simultaneously.
    (2) Combination new animal drugs that contain only active 
ingredients or animal drugs that have previously been separately 
approved. (i) For dosage form combination new animal drugs, except for 
those that contain a nontopical antibacterial, that contain only active 
ingredients or animal drugs that have previously been separately 
approved for the particular uses and conditions of use for which they 
are intended in combination, a sponsor shall demonstrate:
    (A) By substantial evidence, as defined in this section, that any 
active ingredient or animal drug intended only for the same use as 
another active ingredient or animal drug in the combination makes a 
contribution to the effectiveness of the combination new animal drug;
    (B) That each active ingredient or animal drug intended for at least 
one use that is different from all the other active ingredients or 
animal drugs used in the combination provides appropriate concurrent use 
for the intended target animal population; and
    (C) That the active ingredients or animal drugs are physically 
compatible and do not have disparate dosing regimens if FDA, based on 
scientific information, has reason to believe the active ingredients or 
animal drugs are physically incompatible or have disparate dosing 
regimens.
    (ii) For combination new animal drugs intended for use in animal 
feed or drinking water that contain only active ingredients or animal 
drugs that have previously been separately approved for the particular 
uses and conditions of use for which they are intended in combination, 
the sponsor shall demonstrate:
    (A) By substantial evidence, as defined in this section, that any 
active ingredient or animal drug intended only for the same use as 
another active ingredient or animal drug in the combination makes a 
contribution to the effectiveness of the combination new animal drug;
    (B) For such combination new animal drugs that contain more than one 
antibacterial ingredient or animal drug, by substantial evidence, as 
defined in this section, that each antibacterial makes a contribution to 
labeled effectiveness;
    (C) That each active ingredient or animal drug intended for at least 
one use that is different from all other active ingredients or animal 
drugs used in the combination provides appropriate concurrent use for 
the intended target animal population; and
    (D) That the active ingredients or animal drugs intended for use in 
drinking water are physically compatible if FDA, based on scientific 
information, has reason to believe the active ingredients or animal 
drugs are physically incompatible.
    (3) Other combination new animal drugs. For all other combination 
new animal drugs, the sponsor shall demonstrate by substantial evidence, 
as defined in this section, that the combination new animal drug will 
have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the 
conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed 
labeling and that each active ingredient or animal drug contributes to 
the effectiveness of the combination new animal drug.

<R05>
Sec. 514.5  Presubmission conferences.

    (a) General principle underlying the conduct of a presubmission 
conference. The general principle underlying the conduct of any 
presubmission conference is that there should be candid, full, and open 
communication.
    (b) Requesting a presubmission conference. A potential applicant is 
entitled to one or more conferences prior to the submission of an NADA, 
supplemental NADA, or an ANADA to reach an agreement establishing part 
or all of a submission or investigational requirement. A potential 
applicant's request for a presubmission conference must be submitted to 
FDA in a signed letter. The letter must include a proposed agenda that 
clearly outlines the scope, purpose, and objectives of the presubmission 
conference and must list the names and positions of the representatives 
who are expected to attend the presubmission conference on behalf of the 
applicant.

[[Page 64]]

    (c) Timing. A potential applicant may request one or more 
presubmission conferences at any time prior to the filing of a NADA, 
supplemental NADA, or an ANADA. A request for a presubmission conference 
must be received by FDA at least 30 calendar days in advance of the 
requested conference date. FDA will schedule the presubmission 
conference at a time agreeable to both FDA and the potential applicant.
    (d) Advance information. The potential applicant must provide to 
FDA, at least 30 calendar days before a scheduled presubmission 
conference, a detailed agenda, a copy of any materials to be presented 
at the conference, a list of proposed indications and, if available, a 
copy of the proposed labeling for the product under consideration, and 
copies of materials evaluated or referenced relative to issues listed in 
the agenda for the conference. If the materials are not provided or are 
not sufficient to provide the basis for meaningful discussion, FDA may 
elect to postpone part or all of the meeting until sufficient materials 
are provided to FDA.
    (e) Conduct of a presubmission conference. The potential applicant 
and FDA may each bring consultants to the presubmission conference. The 
presubmission conference(s) will be directed primarily at establishing 
agreement between FDA and the potential applicant regarding a submission 
or investigational requirement. The submission or investigational 
requirement may include, among other things, the number, types, and 
general design of studies that are necessary to demonstrate the safety 
and effectiveness of a new animal drug for the intended uses and 
conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed 
labeling for the new animal drug.
    (f) Documentation of a presubmission conference--(1) Memorandum of 
conference--(i) Preparation. FDA will prepare a memorandum for each 
presubmission conference that will include, among other things, any 
background pertinent to the request for meeting; a summary of the key 
points of discussion; agreements; and action items and assignments of 
responsibility. That portion of the memorandum of conference that 
documents any agreements reached regarding all or part of a submission 
or investigational requirement will be included under the heading 
``Presubmission Conference Agreement.'' If the presubmission conference 
agreement section of the memorandum is silent on an issue, including one 
that was discussed in the conference or addressed by materials provided 
for the conference, such silence does not constitute agreement between 
FDA and the potential applicant on the issue.
    (ii) Sending a copy to the potential applicant. FDA will send a copy 
of the memorandum to the potential applicant for review no later than 45 
calendar days after the date of the conference
    (iii) Requests for changes or clarification. If a potential 
applicant requests changes to, or clarification of, the substance of the 
memorandum, the request must be sent to FDA within 30 calendar days from 
the date a copy of the memorandum is sent to the applicant. If the 
potential applicant requests changes or clarification, FDA will send the 
potential applicant a response to their request no later than 45 
calendar days after the date of receipt of the request.
    (iv) Administrative record. A copy of FDA's original memorandum of 
conference and, as appropriate, a copy of an amended memorandum to 
correct or clarify the content of the original memorandum will be made 
part of the administrative file.
    (2) Field studies. If FDA requires more than one field study to 
establish by substantial evidence that the new animal drug is effective 
for its intended uses under the conditions of use prescribed, 
recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, FDA will provide 
written scientific justification for requiring more than one field 
study. Such justification must be provided no later than 25 calendar 
days after the date of the conference at which the requirement for more 
than one field study is established. If FDA does not believe more than 
one field study is required but the potential applicant voluntarily 
proposes to conduct more than one field study, FDA will not provide such 
written justification. If FDA

[[Page 65]]

requires one field study to be conducted at multiple locations, FDA will 
provide justification for requiring multiple locations verbally during 
the presubmission conference and in writing as part of the memorandum of 
conference.
    (g) Modification of presubmission conference agreements. An 
agreement made under a presubmission conference requested under section 
512(b)(3) of the act and documented in a memorandum of conference is 
binding on the potential applicant and FDA and may only be modified if:
    (1) FDA and the potential applicant mutually agree to modify, in 
part or in whole, the agreement and such modification is documented and 
provided to the potential applicant as described in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section; or
    (2) FDA by written order determines that a substantiated scientific 
requirement essential to the determination of safety or effectiveness of 
the new animal drug appeared after the conference.
    (h) When the terms of a presubmission conference agreement are not 
valid--(1) A presubmission conference agreement will no longer be valid 
if:
    (i) The potential applicant makes to FDA, before, during, or after 
the presubmission conference, any untrue statement of material fact; or
    (ii) The potential applicant fails to follow any material term of 
the agreement; and
    (2) A presubmission conference may no longer be valid if the 
potential applicant submits false or misleading data relating to a new 
animal drug to FDA.
    (i) Dispute resolution. FDA is committed to resolving differences 
between a potential applicant and FDA reviewing divisions with respect 
to requirements for the investigation of new animal drugs and for NADAs, 
supplemental NADAs, and ANADAs as quickly and amicably as possible 
through a cooperative exchange of information and views. When 
administrative or procedural disputes arise, a potential applicant 
should first attempt to resolve the matter within the appropriate review 
division beginning with the individual(s) most directly assigned to the 
review of the application or investigational exemption. If the dispute 
cannot be resolved after such attempts, the dispute shall be evaluated 
and administered in accordance with applicable regulations (21 CFR 
10.75). Dispute resolution procedures may be further explained by 
guidance available from the Center for Veterinary Medicine.

Sec. 514.6  Amended applications.

    The applicant may submit an amendment to an application that is 
pending, including changes that may alter the conditions of use, the 
labeling, safety, effectiveness, identity, strength, quality, or purity 
of the drug or the adequacy of the manufacturing methods, facilities, 
and controls to preserve them, in which case the unamended application 
may be considered as withdrawn and the amended application may be 
considered resubmitted on the date on which the amendment is received by 
the Food and Drug Administration. The applicant will be notified of such 
date.


<R05>
Sec. 514.7  Withdrawal of applications without prejudice.

    The sponsor may withdraw his pending application from consideration 
as a new animal drug application upon written notification to the Food 
and Drug Administration. Such withdrawal may be made without prejudice 
to a future filing. Upon resubmission, the time limitation will begin to 
run from the date the resubmission is received by the Food and Drug 
Administration. The original application will be retained by the Food 
and Drug Administration although it is considered withdrawn. The 
applicant shall be furnished a copy at cost on request.


<R05>
Sec. 514.8  Supplements and other changes to an approved application.

    (a) Definitions. (1) The definitions and interpretations contained 
in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) 
apply to those terms when used in this part.
    (2) The following definitions of terms apply to this part:
    (i) Assess the effects of the change means to evaluate the effects 
of a manufacturing change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, 
and potency

[[Page 66]]

of a drug as these factors may relate to the safety or effectiveness of 
the drug.
    (ii) Drug substance means an active ingredient as defined under 
Sec. 210.3(b)(7) of this chapter.
    (iii) Minor changes and stability report (MCSR) means an annual 
report that is submitted to the application once each year within 60 
days before or after the anniversary date of the application's original 
approval or on a mutually agreed upon date. The report must include 
minor manufacturing and control changes made according to Sec. 
514.8(b)(4) or state that no changes were made; and stability data 
generated on commercial or production batches according to an approved 
stability protocol or commitment.
    (iv) Specification means the quality standard (i.e., tests, 
analytical procedures, and acceptance criteria) provided in an approved 
application to confirm the quality of drugs including, for example, drug 
substances, Type A medicated articles, drug products, intermediates, raw 
materials, reagents, components, in-process materials, container closure 
systems, and other materials used in the production of a drug. For the 
purpose of this definition, the term ``acceptance criteria'' means 
numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described.
    (b) Manufacturing changes to an approved application--(1) General 
provisions. (i) The applicant must notify FDA about each change in each 
condition established in an approved application beyond the variations 
already provided for in the application. The notice is required to 
describe the change fully. Depending on the type of change, the 
applicant must notify FDA about it in a supplement under paragraph 
(b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section or by inclusion of the information in 
the annual report to the application under paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section.
    (ii) The holder of an approved application under section 512 of the 
act must assess the effects of the change before distributing a drug 
made with a manufacturing change.
    (iii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) of this section, an applicant must make a change provided for in 
those paragraphs in accordance with a regulation or guidance that 
provides for a less burdensome notification of the change (for example, 
by submission of a supplement that does not require approval prior to 
distribution of the drug, or by notification in the next annual report 
described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section).
    (iv) In each supplement and amendment to a supplement providing for 
a change under paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, the applicant 
must include a statement certifying that a field copy has been provided 
to the appropriate FDA district office. No field copy is required for a 
supplement providing for a change made to a drug manufactured outside of 
the United States.
    (v) A supplement or annual report described in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section must include a list of all changes contained in the 
supplement or annual report. For supplements, this list must be provided 
in the cover letter.
    (2) Changes requiring submission and approval of a supplement prior 
to distribution of the drug made using the change (major changes). (i) A 
supplement must be submitted for any change in the drug, production 
process, quality controls, equipment, or facilities that has a 
substantial potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, 
strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug as these factors may 
relate to the safety or effectiveness of the drug.
    (ii) These changes include, but are not limited to:
    (A) Except those described in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this 
section, changes in the qualitative or quantitative formulation of the 
drug, including inactive ingredients, or in the specifications provided 
in the approved application;
    (B) Changes requiring completion of appropriate clinical studies to 
demonstrate the equivalence of the drug to the drug as manufactured 
without the change;
    (C) Changes that may affect drug substance or drug product sterility 
assurance, such as changes in drug substance, drug product or component 
sterilization method(s) or an addition, deletion, or substitution of 
steps in an aseptic processing operation;

[[Page 67]]

    (D) Changes in the synthesis or manufacture of the drug substance 
that may affect the impurity profile and/or the physical, chemical, or 
biological properties of the drug substance;
    (E) Changes in a drug product container closure system that controls 
the drug delivered to the animal or changes in the type or composition 
of a packaging component that may affect the impurity profile of the 
drug product;
    (F) Changes solely affecting a natural product, a recombinant DNA-
derived protein/polypeptide, or a complex or conjugate of a drug 
substance with a monoclonal antibody for the following:
    (1) Changes in the virus or adventitious agent removal or 
inactivation method(s),
    (2) Changes in the source material or cell line, and
    (3) Establishment of a new master cell bank or seed;
    (G) Changes to a drug under an application that is subject to a 
validity assessment because of significant questions regarding the 
integrity of the data supporting that application.
    (iii) The applicant must obtain approval of a supplement from FDA 
prior to distribution of a drug made using a change under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section. The supplement must be labeled ``Prior Approval 
Supplement.'' Except for submissions under paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this 
section, the following information must be contained in the supplement:
    (A) A completed Form FDA 356V;
    (B) A detailed description of the proposed change;
    (C) The drug(s) involved;
    (D) The manufacturing site(s) or area(s) affected;
    (E) A description of the methods used and studies performed to 
assess the effects of the change;
    (F) The data derived from such studies;
    (G) Appropriate documentation (for example, updated master batch 
records, specification sheets) including previously approved 
documentation (with the changes highlighted) or references to previously 
approved documentation;
    (H) For a natural product, a recombinant DNA-derived protein/
polypeptide, or a complex or conjugate of a drug substance with a 
monoclonal antibody, relevant validation protocols and standard 
operating procedures must be provided in addition to the requirements in 
paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(E) and (b)(2)(iii)(F) of this section;
    (I) For sterilization process and test methodologies related to 
sterilization process validation, relevant validation protocols and a 
list of relevant standard operating procedures must be provided in 
addition to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(E) and 
(b)(2)(iii)(F) of this section; and
    (J) Any other information as directed by FDA.
    (iv) An applicant may ask FDA to expedite its review of a supplement 
for public health reasons or if a delay in making the change described 
in it would impose an extraordinary hardship on the applicant. Such a 
supplement and its mailing cover must be plainly marked: ``Prior 
Approval Supplement-Expedited Review Requested.''
    (v) Comparability Protocols. An applicant may submit one or more 
protocols describing the specific tests and studies and acceptance 
criteria to be achieved to demonstrate the lack of adverse effect for 
specified types of manufacturing changes on the identity, strength, 
quality, purity, and potency of the drug as these factors may relate to 
the safety or effectiveness of the drug. Any such protocols, if not 
included in the approved application, or changes to an approved 
protocol, must be submitted as a supplement requiring approval from FDA 
prior to distribution of the drug produced with the manufacturing 
change. The supplement, if approved, may subsequently justify a reduced 
reporting category for the particular change because the use of the 
protocol for that type of change reduces the potential risk of an 
adverse effect. A comparability protocol supplement must be labeled 
``Prior Approval Supplement--Comparability Protocol.''
    (3) Changes requiring submission of a supplement at least 30 days 
prior to distribution of the drug made using the change (moderate 
changes). (i) A supplement must be submitted for any change in the drug, 
production process,

[[Page 68]]

quality controls, equipment, or facilities that has a moderate potential 
to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or 
potency of the drug as these factors may relate to the safety or 
effectiveness of the drug.
    (ii) These changes include, but are not limited to:
    (A) A change in the container closure system that does not affect 
the quality of the drug except as otherwise described in paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (b)(4) of this section;
    (B) Changes solely affecting a natural protein, a recombinant DNA-
derived protein/polypeptide or a complex or conjugate of a drug 
substance with a monoclonal antibody, including:
    (1) An increase or decrease in production scale during finishing 
steps that involves different equipment, and
    (2) Replacement of equipment with that of a different design that 
does not affect the process methodology or process operating parameters.
    (C) Relaxation of an acceptance criterion or deletion of a test to 
comply with an official compendium that is consistent with FDA statutory 
and regulatory requirements.
    (iii) A supplement submitted under paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (b)(3)(vi) 
of this section is required to give a full explanation of the basis for 
the change and identify the date on which the change is made. The 
supplement submitted under paragraph (b)(3)(i) must be labeled 
``Supplement-Changes Being Effected in 30 Days.''
    (iv) Pending approval of the supplement by FDA and except as 
provided in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section, distribution of the 
drug made using the change may begin not less than 30 days after receipt 
of the supplement by FDA. The information listed in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(iii)(A) through (b)(2)(iii)(J) of this section must be contained 
in the supplement.
    (v) The applicant must not distribute the drug made using the change 
if within 30 days following FDA's receipt of the supplement, FDA informs 
the applicant that either:
    (A) The change requires approval prior to distribution of the drug 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or
    (B) Any of the information required under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of 
this section is missing. In this case, the applicant must not distribute 
the drug made using the change until the supplement has been amended to 
provide the missing information.
    (vi) The agency may designate a category of changes for the purpose 
of providing that, in the case of a change in such category, the holder 
of an approved application may commence distribution of the drug 
involved upon receipt by the agency of a supplement for the change. The 
information listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(A) through (b)(2)(iii)(J) 
of this section must be contained in the supplement. The supplement must 
be labeled ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected.'' These changes include, 
but are not limited to:
    (A) Addition to a specification or changes in the methods or 
controls to provide increased assurance that the drug will have the 
characteristics of identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency that 
it purports or is represented to possess; and
    (B) A change in the size and/or shape of a container for a 
nonsterile drug product, except for solid dosage forms, without a change 
in the labeled amount of drug product or from one container closure 
system to another.
    (vii) If the agency disapproves the supplemental application, it may 
order the manufacturer to cease distribution of the drug(s) made with 
the manufacturing change.
    (4) Changes and updated stability data to be described and submitted 
in an annual report (minor changes). (i) Changes in the drug, production 
process, quality controls, equipment, or facilities that have a minimal 
potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, 
purity, or potency of the drug as these factors may relate to the safety 
or effectiveness of the drug must be documented by the applicant in an 
annual report to the application as described under paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section. The report must be labeled ``Minor Changes 
and Stability Report.''
    (ii) These changes include but are not limited to:
    (A) Any change made to comply with a change to an official 
compendium,

[[Page 69]]

except a change in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, that is 
consistent with FDA statutory and regulatory requirements;
    (B) The deletion or reduction of an ingredient intended to affect 
only the color of the drug product;
    (C) Replacement of equipment with that of the same design and 
operating principles except for those equipment changes described in 
paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(2) of this section;
    (D) A change in the size and/or shape of a container containing the 
same number of dosage units for a nonsterile solid dosage form drug 
product, without a change from one container closure system to another;
    (E) A change within the container closure system for a nonsterile 
drug product, based upon a showing of equivalency to the approved system 
under a protocol approved in the application or published in an official 
compendium;
    (F) An extension of an expiration dating period based upon full 
shelf-life data on production batches obtained from a protocol approved 
in the application;
    (G) The addition or revision of an alternative analytical procedure 
that provides the same or increased assurance of the identity, strength, 
quality, purity, or potency of the drug being tested as the analytical 
procedure described in the approved application, or deletion of an 
alternative analytical procedure; and
    (H) The addition by embossing, debossing, or engraving of a code 
imprint to a solid oral dosage form drug product other than a modified 
release dosage form, or a minor change in an existing code imprint.
    (iii) For changes under this category, the applicant is required to 
submit in the annual report:
    (A) A completed Form FDA 356V;
    (B) A statement by the holder of the approved application that the 
effects of the change have been assessed;
    (C) A detailed description of the change(s);
    (D) The manufacturing site(s) or area(s) involved;
    (E) The date each change was implemented;
    (F) Data from studies and tests performed to assess the effects of 
the change;
    (G) For a natural product, recombinant DNA-derived protein/
polypeptide, complex or conjugate of a drug substance with a monoclonal 
antibody, sterilization process or test methodology related to 
sterilization process validation, relevant validation protocols and/or 
standard operating procedures;
    (H) Appropriate documentation (for example, updated master batch 
records, specification sheets, etc.) including previously approved 
documentation (with the changes highlighted) or references to previously 
approved documentation;

General provisions. The applicant must notify FDA about each change in 
each condition established in an approved application beyond the 
variations already provided for in the application. The notice is 
required to describe the change fully.
    (2) Labeling changes requiring the submission and approval of a 
supplement prior to distribution of the drug made using the change 
(major changes). (i) Addition of intended uses and changes to package 
labeling require a supplement. These changes include, but are not 
limited to:
    (A) Revision in labeling, such as updating information pertaining to 
effects, dosages, adverse reactions, contraindications, which includes 
information headed ``adverse reactions,'' ``warnings,'' ``precautions,'' 
and ``contraindications,'' except ones described in (c)(3) of this 
section;
    (B) Addition of an intended use;
    (C) If it is a prescription drug, any mailing or promotional piece 
used after the drug is placed on the market is labeling requiring a 
supplemental application, unless:
    (1) The parts of the labeling furnishing directions, warnings, and 
information for use of the drug are the same

[[Page 70]]

in language and emphasis as labeling approved or permitted; and
    (2) Any other parts of the labeling are consistent with and not 
contrary to such approved or permitted labeling.

changes of the following kinds that increase the assurance of drug 
safety proposed in supplemental applications must be placed into effect 
immediately:
    (A) The addition to package labeling, promotional labeling, or 
prescription drug advertising of additional warning, contraindication, 
adverse reaction, and precaution information;
    (B) The deletion from package labeling, promotional labeling, or 
drug advertising of false, misleading, or unsupported intended uses or 
claims for effectiveness; and
    (C) Any other changes as directed by FDA.
    (ii) Labeling changes (for example, design and style) that do not 
decrease safety of drug use proposed in supplemental applications may be 
placed into effect prior to written notice of approval from FDA of a 
supplemental application.
    (iii) A supplement submitted under paragraph (c)(3) of this section 
must include the following information:
    (A) A full explanation of the basis for the changes, the date on 
which such changes are being effected, and plainly marked on the mailing 
cover and on the supplement, ``Supplement--Labeling Changes Being 
Effected'';
    (B) Two sets of printed copies of any revised labeling to be placed

later than upon approval of the supplemental application.
    (iv) If the supplemental application is not approved and the drug is 
being distributed with the proposed labeling, FDA may initiate an 
enforcement action because the drug is misbranded under section 502 of 
the act and/or adulterated under section 501 of the act. In addition, 
under section 512(e) of the act, FDA may, after due notice and 
opportunity for a hearing, issue an order withdrawing approval of the 
application.
    (4) Changes providing for additional distributors to be reported 
under Records and reports concerning experience with approved new animal

relating to the NADA, in accordance with the provisions of part 20 of 
this chapter.
    (f) All safety and effectiveness data and information not previously 
disclosed to the public are available for public disclosure at the time 
any one of the following events occurs unless extraordinary 
circumstances are known:
    (1) The NADA has been abandoned and no further work is being 
undertaken with respect to it.
    (2) A final determination is made that the NADA is not approvable, 
and all legal appeals have been exhausted.
    (3) Approval of the NADA is withdrawn, and all legal appeals have 
been exhausted.

a new animal drug.
    (5) A final determination has been made that the animal drug may be 
marketed without submission of such safety and/or effectiveness data and 
information.
    (g) The following data and information in an NADA file are not 
available for public disclosure unless they have been previously 
disclosed to the public as defined in Sec. 20.81 of this chapter or 
they relate to a product or ingredient that has been abandoned and they 
no longer represent a trade secret or confidential commercial or 
financial information as defined in Sec. 20.61 of this chapter:
    (1) Manufacturing methods or processes, including quality control 
procedures.
    (2) Production, sales, distribution, and similar data and 
information, except that any compilation of such data and information 
aggregated and prepared in a way that does not reveal data or 
information which is not available for public disclosure under this 
provision is available for public disclosure.

Sec. 514.15  Untrue statements in applications.

    Among the reasons why an application for a new animal drug or animal 
feed bearing or containing a new animal drug may contain an untrue 
statement of a material fact are:
    (a) Differences in:
    (1) Conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested by the 
applicant for the product from the conditions of such use stated in the 
application;
    (2) Articles used as components of the product from those listed in 
the application;
    (3) Composition of the product from that stated in the application;
    (4) Methods used in or the facilities and controls used for the 
manufacture, processing, or packing of the product from such methods, 
facilities, and controls described in the application;
    (5) Labeling from the specimens contained in the application; or
    (b) The unexplained omission in whole or in part from an application 
or from an amendment or supplement to an application or from any record 
or report required under the provisions of section 512 of the act and 
Sec. 514.80 or Sec. 510.301 of this chapter of any information 
obtained from:

[[Page 73]]

    (1) Investigations as to the safety, effectiveness, identity, 
strength, quality, or purity of the drug, made by the applicant on the 
drug, or
    (2) Investigations or experience with the product that is the 
subject of the application, or any related product, available to the 
applicant from any source if such information is pertinent to an 
evaluation of the safety, effectiveness, identity, strength, quality, or 
purity of the drug, when such omission would bias an evaluation of the 
safety or effectiveness of the product.
    (c) Any nonclinical laboratory study contained in the application 
was not conducted in compliance with the good laboratory practice 
regulations as set forth in part 58 of this chapter, and the application 
fails to include a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Applicability. (1) Each applicant must establish and maintain 
indexed and complete files containing full records of all information 
pertinent to safety or effectiveness of a new animal drug that has not 
been previously submitted as part of the NADA or ANADA. Such records 
must include information from domestic as well as foreign sources. Each 
nonapplicant must establish and maintain indexed and complete files 
containing full records of all information pertinent to safety or 
effectiveness of a new animal drug that is received or otherwise 
obtained by the nonapplicant. Such records must include information from 
domestic as well as foreign sources.
    (2) Each applicant must submit reports of data, studies, and other 
information concerning experience with new animal drugs to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for each approved NADA and ANADA, as required 
in this section. A nonapplicant must submit data, studies, and other 
information concerning experience with new animal drugs to the 
appropriate applicant, as required in this section. The applicant, in 
turn, must report the nonapplicant's data, studies, and other 
information to FDA. Applicants and nonapplicants must submit data, 
studies, and other information described in this section from domestic, 
as well as foreign sources.
    (3) FDA reviews the records and reports required in this section to 
facilitate a determination under section 512(e) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(e)) as to whether there may be 
grounds for suspending or withdrawing approval of the NADA or ANADA.
    (4) The requirements of this section also apply to any approved Type 
A medicated article. In addition, the requirements contained in Sec. 
514.80(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4)(iv), and (b)(4)(v) apply to any approved 
Type A medicated article incorporated in animal feeds.
    (5) The records and reports referred to in this section are in 
addition to those required by the current good manufacturing practice 
regulations in parts 211, 225, and 226 of this chapter.
    (b) Reporting requirements--(1) Three-day NADA/ANADA field alert 
report. This report provides information pertaining to product and 
manufacturing defects that may result in serious adverse drug events. 
The applicant (or nonapplicant through the applicant) must submit the 
report to the appropriate FDA District Office or local FDA resident post 
within 3 working days of first becoming aware that a defect may exist. 
The information initially may be provided by telephone or other 
telecommunication means, with prompt written followup using Form FDA 
1932 ``Veterinary Adverse Drug Reaction, Lack of Effectiveness, Product 
Defect Report.'' The mailing cover for these reports must be plainly 
marked ``3-Day NADA/ANADA Field Alert Report.''
    (2) Fifteen-day NADA/ANADA alert report--(i) Initial report. This 
report provides information on each serious, unexpected adverse drug 
event, regardless of the source of the information. The applicant (or 
nonapplicant through the applicant) must submit the report to FDA within 
15 working days of first receiving the information. The report must be 
submitted on Form FDA 1932, and its mailing cover must be plainly marked 
``15-Day NADA/ANADA Alert Report.''
    (ii) Followup report. The applicant must promptly investigate all 
adverse drug events that are the subject of 15-day NADA/ANADA alert 
reports. If this investigation reveals significant new information, a 
followup report must be submitted within 15 working days of receiving 
such information. A followup

[[Page 76]]

report must be submitted on Form FDA 1932, and its mailing cover must be 
plainly marked ``15-Day NADA/ANADA Alert Report Followup.'' The followup 
report must state the date of the initial report and provide the 
additional information. If additional information is sought but not 
obtained within 3 months of the initial report, a followup report is 
required describing the steps taken and why additional information was 
not obtained.
    (3) Nonapplicant report. Nonapplicants must forward reports of 
adverse drug experiences to the applicant within 3 working days of first 
receiving the information. The applicant must then submit the report(s) 
to FDA as required in this section. The nonapplicant must maintain 
records of all nonapplicant reports, including the date the nonapplicant 
received the information concerning adverse drug experiences, the name 
and address of the applicant, and a copy of the adverse drug experience 
report including the date such report was submitted to the applicant. If 
the nonapplicant elects to also report directly to FDA, the nonapplicant 
should submit the report on Form FDA 1932 within 15 working days of 
first receiving the information.
    (4) Periodic drug experience report. This report must be accompanied 
by a completed Form FDA 2301 ``Transmittal of Periodic Reports and 
Promotional Materials for New Animal Drugs.'' It must be submitted every 
6 months for the first 2 years following approval of an NADA or ANADA 
and yearly thereafter. Reports required by this section must contain 
data and information for the full reporting period. The 6-month periodic 
drug experience reports must be submitted within 30 days following the 
end of the 6-month reporting period. The yearly periodic drug experience 
reports must be submitted within 60 days of the anniversary date of the 
approval of the NADA or ANADA. Any previously submitted information 
contained in the report must be identified as such. For yearly (annual) 
periodic drug experience reports, the applicant may petition FDA to 
change the date of submission or frequency of reporting, and after 
approval of such petition, file such reports on the new filing date or 
at the new reporting frequency. Also, FDA may require a report at 
different times or more frequently. The periodic drug experience report 
must contain the following:
    (i) Distribution data. Information about the distribution of each 
new animal drug product, including information on any distributor-
labeled product. This information must include the total number of 
distributed units of each size, strength, or potency (e.g., 100,000 
bottles of 100 5-milligram tablets; 50,000 10-milliliter vials of 5-
percent solution). This information must be presented in two categories: 
Quantities distributed domestically and quantities exported.
    (ii) Labeling. Applicant and distributor current package labeling, 
including package inserts (if any). For large-size package labeling or 
large shipping cartons, a representative copy must be submitted (e.g., a 
photocopy of pertinent areas of large feed bags). A summary of any 
changes in labeling made since the last report (listed by date of 
implementation) must be included with the labeling or if there have been 
no changes, a statement of such fact must be included with the labeling.
    (iii) Nonclinical laboratory studies and clinical data not 
previously reported.
    (A) Copies of in vitro studies (e.g., mutagenicity) and other 
nonclinical laboratory studies conducted by or otherwise obtained by the 
applicant.
    (B) Copies of published clinical trials of the new animal drug (or 
abstracts of them) including clinical trials on safety and 
effectiveness, clinical trials on new uses, and reports of clinical 
experience pertinent to safety conducted by or otherwise obtained by the 
applicant. Review articles, papers, and abstracts in which the drug is 
used as a research tool, promotional articles, press clippings, and 
papers that do not contain tabulations or summaries of original data are 
not required to be reported.
    (C) Descriptions of completed clinical trials conducted by or for 
the applicant must be submitted no later than 1 year after completion of 
research. Supporting information is not to be reported.

[[Page 77]]

    (iv) Adverse drug experiences. (A) Product/manufacturing defects and 
adverse drug experiences not previously reported under Sec. 
514.80(b)(1) and (b)(2) must be reported individually on Form FDA 1932.
    (B) Reports of adverse drug experiences in the literature must be 
noted in the periodic drug experience report. A bibliography of 
pertinent references must be included with the report. Upon FDA's 
request, the applicant must provide a full text copy of these 
publications.
    (C) Reports of previously not reported adverse drug experiences that 
occur in postapproval studies must be reported separately from other 
experiences in the periodic drug experience report and clearly marked or 
highlighted.
    (v) Summary report of increased frequency of adverse drug 
experience. The applicant must periodically review the incidence of 
reports of adverse drug experiences to determine if there has been an 
increased frequency of serious (expected and unexpected) adverse drug 
events. The applicant must evaluate the increased frequency of serious 
(expected or unexpected) adverse drug events at least as often as 
reporting of periodic drug experience reports. The applicant must report 
the increased frequency of serious (expected and unexpected) adverse 
drug events in the periodic drug experience report. Summaries of reports 
of increased frequency of adverse drug events must be submitted in 
narrative form. The summaries must state the time period on which the 
increased frequency is based, time period comparisons in determining 
increased frequency, references to any previously submitted Form FDA 
1932, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results. The 
summaries must be submitted in a separate section within the periodic 
drug experience report.
    (5) Other reporting--(i) Special drug experience report. Upon 
written request, FDA may require that the applicant submit a report 
required under Sec. 514.80 at different times or more frequently than 
the timeframes stated in Sec. 514.80.
    (ii) Advertisements and promotional labeling. The applicant must 
submit at the time of initial dissemination one set of specimens of 
mailing pieces and other labeling for prescription and over-the-counter 
new animal drugs. For prescription new animal drugs, the applicant must 
also submit one set of specimens of any advertisement at the time of 
initial publication or broadcast. Mailing pieces and labeling designed 
to contain product samples must be complete except that product samples 
may be omitted. Each submission of promotional labeling or 
advertisements must be accompanied by a completed Form FDA 2301.
    (iii) Distributor's statement. At the time of initial distribution 
of a new animal drug product by a distributor, the applicant must submit 
a special drug experience report accompanied by a completed Form FDA 
2301 containing the following:
    (A) The distributor's current product labeling.
    (1) The distributor's labeling must be identical to that in the 
approved NADA/ANADA except for a different and suitable proprietary name 
(if used) and the name and address of the distributor. The name and 
address of the distributor must be preceded by an appropriate qualifying 
phrase as permitted by the regulations such as ``manufactured for'' or 
``distributed by.''
    (2) Other labeling changes must be the subject of a supplemental 
NADA or ANADA as described under Sec. 514.8.
    (B) A signed statement by the distributor stating:
    (1) The category of the distributor's operations (e.g., wholesale or 
retail),
    (2) That the distributor will distribute the new animal drug only 
under the approved labeling,
    (3) That the distributor will promote the product only for use under 
the conditions stated in the approved labeling,
    (4) That the distributor will adhere to the records and reports 
requirements of this section, and
    (5) That the distributor is regularly and lawfully engaged in the 
distribution or dispensing of prescription products if the product is a

    (c) Multiple applications. Whenever an applicant is required to 
submit a periodic drug experience report under the provisions of Sec. 
514.80(b)(4) with respect

[[Page 78]]

to more than one approved NADA or ANADA for preparations containing the 
same new animal drug so that the same information is required to be 
reported for more than one application, the applicant may elect to 
submit as a part of the report for one such application (the primary 
application) all the information common to such applications in lieu of 
reporting separately and repetitively on each. If the applicant elects 
to do this, the applicant must do the following:
    (1) State when a report applies to multiple applications and 
identify all related applications for which the report is submitted by 
NADA or ANADA number.
    (2) Ensure that the primary application contains a list of the NADA 
or ANADA numbers of all related applications.
    (3) Submit a completed Form FDA 2301 to the primary application and 
each related application with reference to the primary application by 
NADA/ANADA number and submission date for the complete report of the 
common information.
    (4) All other information specific to a particular NADA/ANADA must 
be included in the report for that particular NADA/ANADA.
    (d) Reporting forms. Applicant must report adverse drug experiences 
and product/manufacturing defects on Form FDA 1932, ``Veterinary Adverse 
Drug Reaction, Lack of Effectiveness, Product Defect Report.'' Periodic 
drug experience reports and special drug experience reports must be 
accompanied by a completed Form FDA 2301 ``Transmittal of Periodic 
Reports and Promotional Material for New Animal Drugs,'' in accordance 
with directions provided on the forms. Computer-generated equivalents of 
Form FDA 1932 or Form FDA 2301, approved by FDA before use, may be used. 
Form FDA 1932 and Form FDA 2301 may be obtained on the Internet at 
http://www.fda.gov/cvm/forms/forms.html, by telephoning the Division of 
Surveillance (HFV-210), or by submitting a written request to the 
following address: Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary 
Medicine, Division of Surveillance (HFV-210), 7500 Standish Pl., 
Rockville, MD 20855-2764.
    (e) Records to be maintained. The applicants and nonapplicants must 
maintain records and reports of all information required by this section 
for a period of 5 years after the date of submission.
    (f) Access to records and reports. The applicant and nonapplicant 
must, upon request from any authorized FDA officer or employee, at all 
reasonable times, permit such officer or employee to have access to copy 
and to verify all such required records and reports.
    (g) Mailing addresses. Completed 15-day alert reports, periodic drug 
experience reports, and special drug experience reports must be 
submitted to the following address: Food and Drug Administration, Center

Addresses for district offices and resident posts may be obtained from 
the Internet at http://www.fda.gov (click on ``Contact FDA,'' then ``FDA 
Field Offices'').
    (h) Withdrawal of approval. If FDA finds that the applicant has 
failed to establish the required records, or has failed to maintain 
those records, or failed to make the required reports, or has refused 
access to an authorized FDA officer or employee to copy or to verify 
such records or reports, FDA may withdraw approval of the application to 
which such records or reports relate. If FDA determines that withdrawal 
of the approval is necessary, the agency shall give the applicant notice 
and opportunity for hearing, as provided in Sec. 514.200, on the 
question of whether to withdraw approval of the application.
    (i) Disclaimer. Any report or information submitted under this 
section and any release of that report or information by FDA will be 
without prejudice and does not necessarily reflect a conclusion that the 
report or information constitutes an admission that the drug caused or 
contributed to an adverse event. A person need not admit, and may deny, 
that the report or information constitutes an admission that a

Sec. 514.100  Evaluation and comment on applications.

    (a) After the filed application has been evaluated, the applicant 
will be furnished written comment on any apparent deficiencies in the 
application.
    (b) When the description of the methods used in, and the facilities 
and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of such 
new animal drug appears adequate on its face, but it is not feasible to 
reach a conclusion as to the safety and effectiveness of the new animal 
drug solely from consideration of this description, the applicant may be 
notified that an establishment inspection is required to verify their 
adequacy.
    (c) A request for samples of a new animal drug or any edible tissues 
and byproducts of animals treated with such a drug, shall specify the 
quantity deemed adequate to permit tests of analytical methods to 
determine their adequacy for regulatory purposes. The request should be 
made as early in the 180-day period as possible to assure timely 
completion. The date used for computing the 180-day limit for the 
purposes of section 512(c) of the act shall be moved forward 1 day for 
each day after the mailing date of the request until all of the 
requested samples are received. If the samples are not received within 
90 days after the request, the application will be considered withdrawn 
without prejudice.
    (d) The information contained in an application may be insufficient 
to determine whether a new animal drug is safe or effective in use if it 
fails to include (among other things) a statement showing whether such 
drug is to be limited to prescription sale and exempt under section 
502(f) of the act from the requirement that its labeling bear adequate 
directions for lay use. If such drug is to be exempt, the information 
may also be insufficient if:
    (1) The specimen labeling proposed fails to bear adequate 
information for professional use including indications, effects, 
dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration 
and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and 
precautions under which practitioners licensed by law to administer such 
drug can use the drug for the purposes for which it is intended, 
including all purposes for which it is to be advertised, or represented, 
in accordance with Sec. 201.105 of this chapter, and information 
concerning hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions 
relevant with respect to any uses for which such drug is to be 
prescribed.
    (2) The application fails to show that the labeling and advertising 
of such drug will offer the drug for use only under those conditions for 
which it is offered in the labeling that is part of the application.
    (3) The application fails to show that all labeling that furnishes 
or purports to furnish information for professional use of such drug 
will contain, in the same language and emphasis, the information for use 
including indications, effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency 
and duration of administration and any relevant warnings, hazards, 
contraindications, side effects, and precautions, which is contained in 
the labeling that is part of the application in accordance with Sec. 
201.105 of this chapter.
    (e) The information contained in an application will be considered 
insufficient to determine whether a new animal drug is safe and 
effective for use when there is a refusal or failure upon written notice 
to furnish inspectors authorized by the Food and Drug Administration an 
adequate opportunity to inspect the facilities, controls, and records 
pertinent to the application.
    (f) On the basis of preliminary consideration of an application or 
supplemental application containing typewritten or other draft labeling 
in lieu of final printed labeling, an applicant may be informed that 
such application is approvable when satisfactory final printed labeling 
identical in content to such draft copy is submitted.
    (g) When an application has been found incomplete on the basis of a 
need for the kind of information described in Sec. 514.6, such 
application shall be considered withdrawn without prejudice to future 
filing on the date of issuance of the letter citing the inadequacies 
contained in the application, unless within

[[Page 80]]

30 days the sponsor chooses to avail himself of the opportunity for 
hearing as prescribed by Sec. 514.111.


<R05>
Sec. 514.105  Approval of applications.

    (a) The Commissioner shall forward for publication in the Federal 
Register a regulation prescribing the conditions under which the new 
animal drug may be used, including the name and address of the 
applicant; the conditions and indications for use covered by the 
application; any tolerance, withdrawal period, or other use 
restrictions; any tolerance required for the new animal drug substance 
or its metabolites in edible products of food-producing animals; and, if 
such new animal drug is intended for use in animal feed, appropriate 
purposes and conditions of use (including special labeling requirements) 
applicable to any animal feed; and such other information the 
Commissioner deems necessary to assure safe and effective use.
    (b) He shall notify the applicant by sending him a copy of the 
proposed publication as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

Sec. 514.110  Reasons for refusing to file applications.

    (a) The date of receipt of an application for a new animal drug 
shall be the date on which the application shall be deemed to be filed.
    (b) An application for a new animal drug shall not be considered 
acceptable for filing for any of the following reasons:
    (1) It does not contain complete and accurate English translations 
of any pertinent part in a foreign language.
    (2) Fewer than three copies are submitted.
    (3) It is incomplete on its face in that it is not properly 
organized and indexed.
    (4) On its face the information concerning required matter is so 
inadequate that the application is clearly not approvable.
    (5) The new animal drug is to be manufactured, prepared, propagated, 
compounded, or processed in whole or in part in any State in an 
establishment that has not been registered or exempted from registration

<R05>
Sec. 514.111  Refusal to approve an application.

    (a) The Commissioner shall, within 180 days after the filing of the 
application, inform the applicant in writing of his intention to issue a 
notice of opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to refuse to approve 
the application, if the Commissioner determines upon the basis of the 
application, or upon the basis of other information before him with 
respect to a new animal drug, that:
    (1) The reports of investigations required to be submitted pursuant 
to section 512(b) of the act do not include adequate tests by all 
methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not such drug is safe 
for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in 
the proposed labeling thereof; or
    (2) The results of such tests show that such drug is unsafe for use 
under such conditions or do not show that such drug is safe for use 
under such conditions; or
    (3) The methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the 
manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug are inadequate to 
preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity; or
    (4) Upon the basis of the information submitted to the Food and Drug 
Administration as part of the application, or upon the basis of any 
other information before it with respect to such drug, it has 
insufficient information to determine whether such drug is safe for use 
under such conditions. In making this determination the Commissioner 
shall consider, among other relevant factors:
    (i) The probable consumption of such drug and of any substance 
formed in or on food because of the use of such drug;
    (ii) The cumulative effect on man or animal of such drug, taking 
into account any chemically or pharmacologically related substances;
    (iii) Safety factors which, in the opinion of experts qualified by 
scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of such drugs, 
are appropriate for the use of animal experimentation data; and
    (iv) Whether the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or 
suggested in the proposed labeling are reasonably certain to be followed 
in practice; or
    (5) Evaluated on the basis of information submitted as part of the 
application and any other information before the Food and Drug 
Administration with respect to such drug, there is lack of substantial 
evidence as defined in Sec. 514.4.
    (6) Failure to include an appropriate proposed tolerance for 
residues in edible products derived from animals or a withdrawal period 
or other restrictions for use of such drug if any tolerance or 
withdrawal period or other restrictions for use are required in order to 
assure that the edible products derived from animals treated with such 
drug will be safe.
    (7) Based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the labeling 
is false or misleading in any particular; or
    (8) Such drug induces cancer when ingested by man or animal or, 
after appropriate tests for evaluation of the safety of such drug, 
induces cancer in man or animal, except that this subparagraph shall not 
apply with respect to such drug if the Commissioner finds that, under 
the conditions of use specified in proposed labeling and reasonably 
certain to be followed in practice:
    (i) Such drug will not adversely affect the animal for which it is 
intended; and
    (ii) No residue of such drug will be found (by methods of 
examination prescribed or approved by the Commissioner by regulations) 
in any edible portion of such animal after slaughter or in any food 
yielded by, or derived from the living animals.
    (9) The applicant fails to submit an adequate environmental 
assessment under Sec. 25.40 of this chapter or fails to provide 
sufficient information to establish that the requested action is subject 
to categorical exclusion under Sec. 25.30 or Sec. 25.33 of this 
chapter.
    (10) The drug fails to satisfy the requirements of subpart E of part 
500 of this chapter.
    (11) Any nonclinical laboratory study that is described in the 
application and that is essential to show that the drug is safe for use 
under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its 
proposed labeling, was not conducted in compliance with the good

[[Page 83]]

laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of this chapter 
and no reason for the noncompliance is provided or, if it is, the 
differences between the practices used in conducting the study and the 
good laboratory practice regulations do not support the validity of the 
study.
    (b) The Commissioner, as provided in Sec. 514.200 of this chapter, 
shall expeditiously notify the applicant of an opportunity for a hearing 
on the question of whether such application is approvable, unless by the 
30th day following the date of issuance of the letter informing the 
applicant of the intention to issue a notice of opportunity for a 
hearing the applicant:
    (1) Withdraws the application; or
    (2) Waives the opportunity for a hearing; or
    (3) Agrees with the Commissioner on an additional period to precede 
issuance of such notice of hearing.

    (1) That the application contains any untrue statement of a material 
fact; or
    (2) That the applicant has made any changes from the standpoint of 
safety or effectiveness beyond the variations provided for in the 
application unless he has supplemented the application by filing with 
the Secretary adequate information respecting all such changes and 
unless there is in effect an approval of the supplemental application, 
or such changes are those for which written authorization or approval is 
not required as provided for in Sec. 514.8. The supplemental 
application shall be treated in the same manner as the original 
application.
    (3) That in the case of an application for use of a new animal drug 
approved or deemed approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act:
    (i) Experience or scientific data show that such drug is unsafe for 
use under the conditions of use upon the basis of which the application 
was approved; or
    (ii) New evidence not contained in such application or not available 
to the Secretary until after such application was approved, or tests by 
new methods, or tests by methods not deemed reasonably applicable when 
such application was approved, evaluated together with the evidence 
available to the Secretary when the application was approved, shows that 
such drug is not shown to be safe for use under the conditions of use 
upon the basis of which the application was approved or that section 512 
(d)(1)(H) of the act applies to such drug; or
    (iii) On the basis of new information before him with respect to 
such drug, evaluated together with the evidence available to him when 
the application was approved, there is a lack of substantial evidence 
that such drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to 
have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested 
in the labeling thereof.
    (4) That any nonclinical laboratory study that is described in the 
application and that is essential to show that the drug is safe for use 
under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its 
proposed labeling, was not conducted in compliance with the good 
laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of this chapter 
and no reason for the noncompliance is provided or, if it is, the 
differences between the practices used in conducting the study and the 
good laboratory practice regulations do not support the validity of the 
study.

    (c) The Commissioner may notify in writing the person holding an 
application approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act and afford an 
opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to withdraw approval of such 
application if he finds:
    (1) That the applicant has failed to establish a system for 
maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed 
to maintain such records or to make required reports in accordance with 
a regulation or order under section 512(l)(1) of the act, or the 
applicant has refused to permit access to, or copying, or verification 
of, such records as required by section 512(l)(2) of the act; or
    (2) That on the basis of new information before him evaluated 
together with the evidence before him when the application was approved, 
the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the 
manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug or animal feed are 
inadequate to assure and preserve its identity, strength, quality, and 
purity and were not made adequate within a reasonable time after receipt 
of written notice from the Secretary specifying the matter complained 
of; or
    (3) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated 
together with the evidence before him when the application was approved, 
the labeling of such drug, based on a fair evaluation of all material 
facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected 
within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the 
Secretary specifying the matter complained of.
    (d) Approval of an application pursuant to section 512(c) of the act 
will be withdrawn on the basis of a request for its withdrawal submitted 
in writing by a person holding an approved new animal drug application 
on the grounds that the drug subject to such application is no longer 
being marketed and information is included in support of this finding, 
provided none of the conditions cited in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section pertain to the subject drug. A written request for such 
withdrawal shall be construed as a waiver of the opportunity for a 
hearing as otherwise provided for in this section. Withdrawal of 
approval of an application under the provisions of this paragraph shall 
be without prejudice.
    (e) On the basis of the withdrawal of approval of an application for 
a new animal drug approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act, the 
regulation published pursuant to section 512(i) of the act covering the 
conditions of use of such drug as provided for in the application shall 
be revoked.

<R05>
Sec. 514.116  Notice of withdrawal of approval of application.

    When an approval of an application submitted pursuant to section 512 
of the act is withdrawn by the Commissioner, he will give appropriate 
public notice of such action by publication in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 514.117  Adequate and well-controlled studies.

    (a) Purpose. The primary purpose of conducting adequate and well-
controlled studies of a new animal drug is to distinguish the effect of 
the new animal drug from other influences, such as spontaneous change in 
the course of the disease, normal animal production performance, or 
biased observation. One or more adequate and well-controlled studies are 
required to establish, by substantial evidence, that a new animal drug 
is effective. The characteristics described in paragraph (b) of this 
section have been developed over a period of years and are generally 
recognized as the essentials of an adequate and well-controlled study. 
Well controlled, as used in the phrase adequate and well controlled, 
emphasizes an important aspect of adequacy. The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) considers these characteristics in determining 
whether a study is adequate and well controlled for purposes of section 
512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 
360b). Adequate and well-controlled studies, in addition to providing a 
basis for determining whether a new animal drug is effective, may also 
be relied upon to support target animal safety. The report of an 
adequate and well-controlled study should provide sufficient details of 
study design, conduct, and analysis

[[Page 85]]

to allow critical evaluation and a determination of whether the 
characteristics of an adequate and well-controlled study are present.
    (b) Characteristics. An adequate and well-controlled study has the 
following characteristics:
    (1) The protocol for the study (protocol) and the report of the 
study results (study report) must include a clear statement of the study 
objective(s).
    (2) The study is conducted in accordance with an appropriate 
standard of conduct that addresses, among other issues, study conduct, 
study personnel, study facilities, and study documentation. The protocol 
contains a statement acknowledging the applicability of, and intention 
to follow, a standard of conduct acceptable to FDA. The study report 
contains a statement describing adherence to the standard.
    (3) The study is conducted with a new animal drug that is produced 
in accordance with appropriate manufacturing practices, which include, 
but are not necessarily limited to, the manufacture, processing, 
packaging, holding, and labeling of the new animal drug such that the 
critical characteristics of identity, strength, quality, purity, and 
physical form of the new animal drug are known, recorded, and 
reproducible, to permit meaningful evaluations of and comparisons with 
other studies conducted with the new animal drug. The physical form of a 
new animal drug includes the formulation and physical characterization 
(including delivery systems thereof, if any) of the new animal drug as 
presented to the animal. The protocol and study report must include an 
identification number which can be correlated with the specific 
formulation and production process used to manufacture the new animal 
drug used in the study.
    (4) The study uses a design that permits a valid comparison with one 
or more controls to provide a quantitative evaluation of drug effects. 
The protocol and the study report must describe the precise nature of 
the study design, e.g., duration of treatment periods, whether 
treatments are parallel, sequential, or crossover, and the determination 
of sample size. Within the broad range of studies conducted to support a 
determination of the effectiveness of a new animal drug, certain of the 
controls listed below would be appropriate and preferred depending on 
the study conducted:
    (i) Placebo concurrent control. The new animal drug is compared with 
an inactive preparation designed to resemble the new animal drug as far 
as possible.
    (ii) Untreated concurrent control. The new animal drug is compared 
with the absence of any treatment. The use of this control may be 
appropriate when objective measurements of effectiveness, not subject to 
observer bias, are available.
    (iii) Active treatment concurrent control. The new animal drug is 
compared with known effective therapy. The use of this control is 
appropriate when the use of a placebo control or of an untreated 
concurrent control would unreasonably compromise the welfare of the 
animals. Similarity of the new animal drug and the active control drug 
can mean either that both drugs were effective or that neither was 
effective. The study report should assess the ability of the study to 
have detected a difference between treatments. The evaluation of the 
study should explain why the new animal drugs should be considered 
effective in the study, for example, by reference to results in previous 
placebo-controlled studies of the active control.
    (iv) Historical control. The results of treatment with the new 
animal drug are quantitatively compared with experience historically 
derived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or 
condition, or with a regimen (therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic) 
whose effectiveness is established, in comparable animals. Because 
historical control populations usually cannot be as well assessed with 
respect to pertinent variables as can concurrent control populations, 
historical control designs are usually reserved for special 
circumstances. Examples include studies in which the effect of the new 
animal drug is self-evident or studies of diseases with high and 
predictable mortality, or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or 
severity, or, in the case of prophylaxis, predictable morbidity.

[[Page 86]]

    (5) The study uses a method of selecting animals that provides 
adequate assurances that the animals are suitable for the purposes of 
the study. For example, the animals can reasonably be expected to have 
animal production characteristics typical of the class(es) of animals 
for which the new animal drug is intended, there is adequate assurance 
that the animals have the disease or condition being studied, or, in the 
case of prophylactic agents, evidence of susceptibility and exposure to 
the condition against which prophylaxis is desired has been provided. 
The protocol and the study report describe the method of selecting 
animals for the study.
    (6) The study uses a method to assign a treatment or a control to 
each experimental unit of animals that is random and minimizes bias. 
Experimental units of animals are groups of animals that are comparable 
with respect to pertinent variables such as age, sex, class of animal, 
severity of disease, duration of disease, dietary regimen, level of 
animal production, and use of drugs or therapy other than the new animal 
drug. The protocol and the study report describe the method of 
assignment of animals to an experimental unit to account for pertinent 
variables and method of assignment of a treatment or a control to the 
experimental units. When the effect of such variables is accounted for 
by an appropriate design, and when, within the same animal, effects due 
to the test drug can be obtained free of the effects of such variables, 
the same animal may be used for both the test drug and the control using 
the controls set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (7) The study uses methods to minimize bias on the part of observers 
and analysts of the data that are adequate to prevent undue influences 
on the results and interpretation of the study data. The protocol and 
study report explain the methods of observation and recording of the 
animal response variables and document the methods, such as ``blinding'' 
or ``masking,'' used in the study for excluding or minimizing bias in 
the observations.
    (8) The study uses methods to assess animal response that are well 
defined and reliable. The protocol and study report describe the methods 
for conducting the study, including any appropriate analytical and 
statistical methods, used to collect and analyze the data resulting from 
the conduct of the study, describe the criteria used to assess response, 
and, when appropriate, justify the selection of the methods to assess 
animal response.
    (9) There is an analysis and evaluation of the results of the study 
in accord with the protocol adequate to assess the effects of the new 
animal drug. The study report evaluates the methods used to conduct, and 
presents and evaluates the results of, the study as to their adequacy to 
assess the effects of the new animal drug. This evaluation of the 
results of the study assesses, among other items, the comparability of 
treatment and control groups with respect to pertinent variables and the 
effects of any interim analyses performed.
    (c) Field studies. (1) Field conditions as used in this section 
refers to conditions which closely approximate the conditions under 
which the new animal drug, if approved, is intended to be applied or 
administered.
    (2) Studies of a new animal drug conducted under field conditions 
shall, consistent with generally recognized scientific principles and 
procedures, use an appropriate control that permits comparison, employ 
procedures to minimize bias, and have the characteristics generally 
described in paragraph (b) of this section. However, because field 
studies are conducted under field conditions, it is recognized that the 
level of control over some study conditions need not or should not be 
the same as the level of control in laboratory studies. While not all 
conditions relating to a field study need to be or should be controlled, 
observations of the conditions under which the new animal drug is tested 
shall be recorded in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the 
study. Adequate and well-controlled field studies shall balance the need 
to control study conditions with the need to observe the true effect of 
the new animal drug under closely approximated actual use conditions.
    (d) Waiver. The Director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine (the 
Director) may, on the Director's own initiative

[[Page 87]]

or on the petition of an interested person, waive in whole or in part 
any of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a 
specific study. A petition for a waiver is required to set forth clearly 
and concisely the specific criteria from which waiver is sought, why the 
criteria are not reasonably applicable to the particular study, what 
alternative procedures, if any, are to be, or have been employed, and 
what results have been obtained. The petition is also required to state 
why the studies so conducted will yield, or have yielded, substantial 
evidence of effectiveness, notwithstanding nonconformance with the 
criteria for which waiver is requested.
    (e) Uncontrolled studies. Uncontrolled studies or partially 
controlled studies are not acceptable as the sole basis for the approval 
of claims of effectiveness or target animal safety. Such studies, 
carefully conducted and documented, may provide corroborative support of 
adequate and well-controlled studies regarding effectiveness and may 
yield valuable data regarding safety of the new animal drug. Such 
studies will be considered on their merits in light of the 
characteristics listed here. Isolated case reports, random experience, 
and reports lacking the details which permit scientific evaluation will 
not be considered.

Sec. 514.120  Revocation of order refusing to approve an application
or suspending or withdrawing approval of an application.

    The Commissioner, upon his own initiative or upon request of an

facts so require, may issue an order approving an application that 
previously has had its approval refused, suspended, or withdrawn.


<R05>
Sec. 514.121  Service of notices and orders.

    All notices and orders under this subchapter E and section 512 of 
the act pertaining to new animal drug applications shall be served:
    (a) In person by any officer or employee of the Department 
designated by the Commissioner; or
    (b) By mailing the order by certified mail addressed to the

Sec. 514.200  Contents of notice of opportunity for a hearing.

    (a) The notice to the applicant of opportunity for a hearing on a 
proposal by the Commissioner to refuse to approve an application or to 
withdraw the approval of an application will specify the grounds upon 
which he proposes to issue his order. On request of the applicant, the 
Commissioner will explain the reasons for his action. The notice of 
opportunity for a hearing will be published in the Federal Register and 
will specify that the applicant has 30 days after issuance of the notice 
within which he is required to file a written appearance electing 
whether:
    (1) To avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing; or
    (2) Not to avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) If the applicant fails to file a written appearance in answer to 
the notice of opportunity for hearing, his failure will be construed as 
an election not to avail himself of the opportunity for the hearing, and 
the Commissioner without further notice may enter a final order.
    (c) If the applicant elects to avail himself of the opportunity for 
a hearing, he is required to file a written appearance requesting the 
hearing within 30 days after the publication of the notice, giving the 
reason why the application should not be refused or should not be 
withdrawn, together with a well-organized and full-factual analysis of 
the clinical and other investigational data he is prepared to prove in 
support of his opposition to the Commissioner's proposal. A request for 
a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set 
forth specific facts showing there is a genuine and substantial issue of 
fact that requires a hearing. When it clearly appears from the data in 
the application and from the reasons and a factual analysis in the 
request for the hearing that no genuine and substantial issue

[[Page 88]]

of fact precludes the refusal to approve the application or the 
withdrawal of approval of the application (for example, no adequate and 
well-controlled clinical investigations to support the claims of 
effectiveness have been identified), the Commissioner will enter an 
order on this data, stating his findings and conclusions. If a hearing 
is requested and is justified by the applicant's response to the notice 
of opportunity for a hearing, the issues will be defined, an 
Administrative Law Judge will be named, and he shall issue a written 
notice of the time and place at which the hearing will commence. In the 
case of denial of approval, such time shall be not more than 90 days 
after the expiration of such 30 days unless the Administrative Law Judge 
and the applicant otherwise agree; and, in the case of withdrawal of 
approval, such time shall be as soon as practicable.
    (d) The hearing will be open to the public; however, if the 
Commissioner finds that portions of the application which serve as a 
basis for the hearing contain information concerning a method or process 
entitled to protection as a trade secret, the part of the hearing 
involving such portions will not be public, unless the respondent so 
specifies in his appearance.

application approved under section 512(m)(2) of the act and afford an 
opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to revoke approval of such 
application if the Commissioner finds:

[[Page 91]]

    (1) That the applicant has failed to establish a system for 
maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed 
to maintain such records or to make required reports in accordance with 
a regulation or order under sections 512(m)(5)(A) or 504(a)(3)(A) of the 
act, or the applicant has refused to permit access to, or copying, or 
verification of, such records as required by sections 512(m)(5)(B) or 
504(a)(3)(B) of the act; or
    (2) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated 
together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the 
methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the 
manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of such animal feed are 
inadequate to assure and preserve the identity, strength, quality, and 
purity of the new animal drug therein, and were not made adequate within 
a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Commissioner 
specifying the matter complained of; or
    (3) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated 
together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the 
labeling of any animal feeds, based on a fair evaluation of all material 
facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected 
within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the 
Commissioner specifying the matter complained of; or
    (4) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated 
together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the 
facility has manufactured, processed, packed, or held animal feed 
bearing or containing a new animal drug adulterated under section 
501(a)(6) of the act, and the facility did not discontinue the 
manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of such animal feed within 
a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Commissioner 
specifying the matter complained of.


<R05>
Sec. 515.23  Voluntary revocation of medicated feed mill license.

    A license issued under section 512(m)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (the act) will be revoked on the basis of a request for 
its revocation submitted in writing by a responsible individual holding 
such license on the grounds that the facility no longer manufactures any 
animal feed covered under Sec. 558.4(b) of this chapter. A written 
request for such revocation shall be construed as a waiver of the 
opportunity for a hearing as otherwise provided for in this section. 
Revocation of approval of a medicated feed mill license under the 
provisions of this paragraph shall be without prejudice.


<R05>
Sec. 515.24  Notice of revocation of a medicated feed mill license.

    When a license approved under section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (the act) is revoked by the Commissioner of Food and 
Drugs (the Commissioner), the Commissioner will give appropriate public 
notice of such action by publication in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 515.25  Revocation of order refusing to approve a medicated 
feed mill license application or suspending or revoking a license.

    The Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner), upon his/her 
own initiative or upon request of an applicant stating reasonable 
grounds therefor and if the Commissioner finds that the facts so 
require, may issue an order approving a medicated feed mill license 
application that previously has had its approval refused, suspended, or 
revoked.


<R05>
Sec. 515.26  Services of notices and orders.

    All notices and orders under this part 515 and section 512 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) pertaining to medicated 
feed mill licenses shall be served:
    (a) In person by any officer or employee of the Department of Health 
and Human Services designated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs; or
    (b) By mailing the order by certified mail addressed to the 
applicant or respondent at the applicant or respondent's last known 
address in the records of the Food and Drug Administration.

<R04>
                      Subpart C_Hearing Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 515.30  Contents of notice of opportunity for a hearing.

    (a) The notice to the applicant of opportunity for a hearing on a 
proposal by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner) to 
refuse to approve a medicated feed mill license application or to revoke 
the approval of a medicated feed mill license will specify the grounds 
upon which the Commissioner proposes to issue this order. On request of 
the applicant, the Commissioner will explain the reasons for the action. 
The notice of opportunity for a hearing will be published in the Federal 
Register and will specify that the applicant has 30 days after issuance 
of the notice within which the Commissioner is required to file a 
written appearance electing whether:
    (1) To avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing; or
    (2) Not to avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) If the applicant fails to file a written appearance in answer to 
the notice of opportunity for hearing, this failure will be construed as 
an election not to avail himself of the opportunity for the hearing, and 
the Commissioner without further notice may enter a final order.
    (c) If the applicant elects to avail himself of the opportunity for 
a hearing, the applicant is required to file a written appearance 
requesting the hearing within 30 days after the publication of the 
notice, giving the reason why the application should not be refused or 
the medicated feed mill license should not be revoked, together with a 
well-organized and full-factual analysis of the information the 
applicant is prepared to prove in support of his opposition to the 
Commissioner's proposal. A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere 
allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing there 
is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. When 
it clearly appears from the information in the application and from the 
reasons and factual analysis in the request for the hearing that no 
genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the refusal to approve 
the application or the revocation of approval of the application, the 
Commissioner will enter an order on this information, stating his/her 
findings and conclusions. If a hearing is requested and is justified by 
the applicant's response to the notice of opportunity for a hearing, the 
issues will be defined, an Administrative Law Judge will be named, and 
the Judge shall issue a written notice of the time and place at which 
the hearing will commence. In the case of denial of approval, such time 
shall be not more than 90 days after the expiration of such 30 days 
unless the Administrative Law Judge and the applicant otherwise agree; 
and, in the case of withdrawal of approval, such time shall be as soon 
as practicable.
    (d) The hearing will be open to the public; however, if the 
Commissioner finds that portions of the application which serve as a 
basis for the hearing contain information concerning a method or process 
entitled to protection as a trade secret, the part of the hearing 
involving such portions will not be public, unless the respondent so 
specifies in the appearance.


<R05>
Sec. 515.31  Procedures for hearings.

    Hearings relating to new animal drugs under section 512(m)(3) and 
(m)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) shall be 
governed by part 12 of this chapter.


<R04>
                        Subpart D_Judicial Review


<R05>
Sec. 515.40  Judicial review.

    The transcript and record shall be certified by the Commissioner of 
Food and Drugs (the Commissioner). In any case in which the Commissioner 
enters an order without a hearing under Sec. 314.200(g) of this 
chapter, the request(s) for hearing together with the data and 
information submitted and the Commissioner's findings and conclusions 
shall be included in the record certified by the Commissioner.

[[Page 94]]


<R05>
Sec. 516.2  Purpose.

    This part establishes standards and procedures for implementing 
section 573 of the act, including designation of minor use or minor 
species new animal drugs and associated exclusive marketing rights.


<R05>
Sec. 516.3  Definitions.

    (a) The definitions and interpretations contained in section 201 of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321) apply 
to those terms when used in this part.
    (b) The following definitions of terms apply to all subparts of part 
516:
    Active moiety means the molecule or ion, excluding those appended 
portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt 
(including a salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds), or other 
noncovalent derivative (such as a complex, chelate, or clathrate) of the 
molecule, responsible for the pharmacological action of the drug 
substance.
    Functionally superior means that a drug has been shown to provide a 
significant therapeutic or physiologic advantage over that provided by a 
conditionally-approved or approved MUMS drug, that is otherwise the same 
drug, in one or more of the following ways:
    (i) The drug has been shown to be more effective, as assessed by 
effect on a clinically meaningful endpoint in adequate and well-
controlled clinical trials, than a conditionally approved or approved 
MUMS drug, that is otherwise the same drug. Generally, this would 
represent the same kind of evidence needed to support a comparative 
effectiveness claim for two different drugs; in most cases, direct 
comparative clinical trials will be necessary; or
    (ii) The drug has been shown to be safer than a conditionally-
approved or approved MUMS drug, that is otherwise the same drug, in a 
substantial portion of the target population, for example, by the 
elimination of an ingredient or contaminant that is associated with 
relatively frequent adverse effects. In some cases, direct comparative 
clinical trials will be necessary.
    Infrequently, as used in the minor use definition, means a disease 
or condition that is uncommon or that occurs only sporadically on an 
annualized basis.
    Limited geographical areas, as used in the minor use definition, 
means regions of the United States distinguished by physical, chemical, 
or biological factors that limit the distribution of a disease or 
condition.
    Major species means cattle, horses, swine, chickens, turkeys, dogs, 
and cats.
    Minor species means animals, other than humans, that are not major 
species.
    Minor use means the intended use of a drug in a major species for an 
indication that occurs infrequently and in only a small number of 
animals or in limited geographical areas and in only a small number of 
animals annually.
    MUMS drug means a new animal drug, as defined in section 201 of the 
act, intended for a minor use or for use in a minor species.
    Same dosage form means the same as one of the dosage forms specified 
in the following parts of this chapter:
    (i) Part 520: Oral dosage form new animal drugs (excluding use in 
animal feeds as specified in part 558 of this chapter).
    (ii) Part 522: Implantation or injectable dosage form new animal 
drugs.
    (iii) Part 524: Ophthalmic and topical dosage form new animal drugs.
    (iv) Part 526: Intramammary dosage forms.
    (v) Part 529: Certain other dosage form new animal drugs.
    (vi) Part 558: New animal drugs for use in animal feeds.
    Same drug means a MUMS drug for which designation, indexing, or 
conditional approval is sought that meets the following criteria:
    (i) If it is a MUMS drug composed of small molecules and contains 
the same active moiety as a prior designated, conditionally-approved, or 
approved MUMS drug, even if the particular ester or salt (including a 
salt with hydrogen or coordination bonds) or other noncovalent 
derivative such as a complex, chelate or clathrate is not the same, it 
is considered the same drug; except that, if the prior MUMS drug is 
conditionally approved or approved and the second MUMS drug is shown to 
be functionally superior to the conditionally approved or approved MUMS

[[Page 95]]

drug for the same intended use, it is not considered the same drug.
    (ii) If it is a MUMS drug composed of large molecules 
(macromolecules) and contains the same principal molecular structural 
features (but not necessarily all of the same structural features) as a 
prior designated, conditionally approved, or approved MUMS drug, it is 
considered the same drug; except that, if the prior MUMS drug is 
conditionally approved or approved and the second MUMS drug is shown to 
be functionally superior to the conditionally approved or approved MUMS 
drug for the same intended use, it is not considered the same drug. This 
criterion will be applied as follows to different kinds of 
macromolecules:
    (A) Two protein drugs would be considered the same if the only 
differences in structure between them were due to post-translational 
events or infidelity of translation or transcription or were minor 
differences in amino acid sequence; other potentially important 
differences, such as different glycosylation patterns or different 
tertiary structures, would not cause the drugs to be considered 
different unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally 
superior.
    (B) Two polysaccharide drugs would be considered the same if they 
had identical saccharide repeating units, even if the number of units 
were to vary and even if there were postpolymerization modifications, 
unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally superior.
    (C) Two polynucleotide drugs consisting of two or more distinct 
nucleotides would be considered the same if they had an identical 
sequence of purine and pyrimidine bases (or their derivatives) bound to 
an identical sugar backbone (ribose, deoxyribose, or modifications of 
these sugars), unless the subsequent drug is shown to be functionally 
superior.
    (D) Closely related, complex partly definable drugs with similar 
pharmacologic intent would be considered the same unless the subsequent 
drug is shown to be functionally superior.
    Same intended use means an intended use of a MUMS drug, for which 
designation, indexing, or conditional approval is sought, that is 
determined to be the same as (or not different from) a previously 
designated, conditionally approved, or approved intended use of a MUMS 
drug. Same intended use is established by comparing two intended uses 
and not by simply comparing the specific language by means of which the 
intent is established in labeling in accordance with the following 
criteria:
    (i) Two intended uses are considered the same if one of the intended 
uses falls completely within the scope of the other.
    (ii) For intended uses associated with diseases or conditions with 
multiple causative organisms, two intended uses are not considered the 
same when they involve different causative organisms or different 
subsets of causative organisms of that disease or condition when the 
causative organisms involved can reliably be shown to be clinically 
significant causes of the disease or condition.
    (iii) Two intended uses of a drug are not considered the same if 
they involve different intended species or different definable 
subpopulations (including ``production classes'') of a species.
    Sponsor means the person requesting designation for a MUMS drug who 
must be the real party in interest of the development and the intended 
or actual production and sales of such drug (in this context, the 
sponsor may be an individual, partnership, organization, or 
association). Sponsor also means the person responsible for an 
investigation of a new animal drug (in this context, the sponsor may be 
an individual, partnership, corporation, or Government agency or may be 
a manufacturer, scientific institution, or an investigator regularly and 
lawfully engaged in the investigation of new animal drugs). Sponsor also 
means the person submitting or receiving approval for a new animal drug 
application (in this context, the sponsor may be an individual, 
partnership, organization, or association). In all contexts, the sponsor 
is responsible for compliance with applicable provisions of the act and 
regulations.

<R04>
  Subpart B_Designation of a Minor Use or Minor Species New Animal Drug


<R05>
Sec. 516.11  Scope of this subpart.

    This subpart implements section 573 of the act. Specifically, this 
subpart sets forth the procedures and requirements for submissions to 
FDA of requests for designation of a new animal drug for a minor use or 
a minor species.


<R05>
Sec. 516.12  Purpose.

    This subpart establishes standards and procedures for determining 
eligibility for designation and the associated incentives and benefits 
described in section 573 of the act, including a 7-year period of 
exclusive marketing rights.


<R05>
Sec. 516.13  Definitions.

    The following definitions of terms apply only in the context of 
subpart B of this part:
    Director means the Director of the Office of Minor Use and Minor 
Species Animal Drug Development of the FDA Center for Veterinary 
Medicine.
    Intended use means the intended treatment, control or prevention of 
a disease or condition, or the intention to affect the structure or 
function of the body of animals within an identified species, 
subpopulation of a species, or collection of species.
    MUMS-designated drug means a new animal drug, as defined in section 
201 of the act, intended for a minor use or for use in a minor species 
that has been designated under section 573 of the act.
    MUMS-drug exclusive marketing rights or exclusive marketing rights 
means that, effective on the date of FDA conditional approval or 
approval as stated in the approval letter of an application for a MUMS-
designated drug, no conditional approval or approval will be given to a 
subsequent application for the same drug, in the same dosage form, for 
the same intended use for 7 years, except as otherwise provided by law 
or in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 516.14  Submission of requests for designation.

    All correspondence relating to a request for designation of a MUMS 
drug must be addressed to the Director of the Office of Minor Use and 
Minor Species Animal Drug Development. Submissions not including all 
elements specified in Sec. 516.20 will be returned to the sponsor 
without review.


<R05>
Sec. 516.16  Eligibility to request designation.

    The person requesting designation must be the sponsor and the real 
party in interest of the development and the intended or actual 
production and sales of the drug or the permanent-resident U.S. agent 
for such a sponsor.


<R05>
Sec. 516.20  Content and format of a request for MUMS-drug designation.

    (a) A sponsor that submits a request for designation of a new animal 
drug intended for a minor use or minor species must submit each request 
in the form and containing the information required in paragraph (b) of 
this section. While a request for designation may involve multiple 
intended uses, each request for designation must constitute a separate 
submission. A sponsor may request MUMS-drug designation of a previously 
unapproved drug, or a new intended use or dosage form for an already 
conditionally approved or approved drug. Only one sponsor may receive 
MUMS-drug designation of the same drug, in the same dosage form, for the 
same intended use.
    (b) A sponsor must submit two copies of a completed, dated, and 
signed request for designation that contains the following information:
    (1) A request for designation of a new animal drug for a minor use 
or use in a minor species, which must be specific.
    (2) The name and address of the sponsor; the name of the sponsor's 
primary contact person and/or permanent-resident U.S. agent including 
title, address, and telephone number; the generic and trade name, if 
any, of the drug; and the name and address of the source of the drug.
    (3) A description of the proposed intended use for which the drug is 
being or will be investigated.

[[Page 97]]

    (4) A description of the drug and dosage form.
    (5) A discussion of the scientific rationale for the intended use of 
the drug; specific reference, including date(s) of submission, to all 
data from nonclinical laboratory studies, clinical investigations, 
copies of pertinent unpublished and published papers, and other relevant 
data that are available to the sponsor, whether positive, negative, or 
inconclusive.
    (6) A specific description of the product development plan for the 
drug, its dosage form, and its intended use.
    (7) If the drug is intended for a minor use in a major species, 
documentation in accordance with Sec. 516.21, with appended 
authoritative references, to demonstrate that such use is a minor use.
    (8) A statement that the sponsor submitting the request is the real 
party in interest of the development and the intended or actual 
production and sales of the product.
    (9) A statement that the sponsor acknowledges that, upon granting a 
request for MUMS designation, FDA will make information regarding the 
designation publicly available as specified in Sec. 516.28.


<R05>
Sec. 516.21  Documentation of minor use status.

    So that FDA can determine whether a drug qualifies for MUMS-drug 
designation as a minor use in a major species under section 573 of the 
act, the sponsor shall include in its request to FDA for MUMS-drug 
designation under Sec. 516.20 documentation demonstrating that the use 
is limited to a small number of animals (annualized). This documentation 
must include the following information:
    (a) The estimated total number of animals to which the drug could 
potentially be administered on an annual basis for the treatment, 
control, or prevention of the disease or condition for which the drug is 
being developed, including animals administered the drug as part of herd 
or flock treatment, together with a list of the sources (including dates 
of information provided and literature citations) for the estimate.
    (b) The estimated total number of animals referred to in paragraph 
(a) of this section may be further reduced to only a subset of the 
estimated total number of animals if administration of the drug is only 
medically justified for this subset. To establish this, requestors must 
demonstrate that administration of the drug to animals subject to the 
disease or condition for which the drug is being developed other than 
the subset is not medically justified. The sponsor must also include a 
list of the sources (including dates of information provided and 
literature citations) for the justification that administration of the 
drug to animals other than the targeted subset is medically 
inappropriate.
    (c) An estimate of the potential market associated with the total 
number of animals established in paragraph (a) of this section compared 
to an estimate of the development costs of the proposed drug, in the 
proposed dosage form, for the proposed intended use.


<R05>
Sec. 516.22  Permanent-resident U.S. agent for foreign sponsor.

    Every foreign sponsor that seeks MUMS-drug designation shall name a 
permanent resident of the United States as the sponsor's agent upon whom 
service of all processes, notices, orders, decisions, requirements, and 
other communications may be made on behalf of the sponsor. Notifications 
of changes in such agents or changes of address of agents should 
preferably be provided in advance, but not later than 60 days after the 
effective date of such changes. The permanent-resident U.S. agent may be 
an individual, firm, or domestic corporation and may represent any 
number of sponsors. The name and address of the permanent-resident U.S. 
agent shall be provided to the Director of the Office of Minor Use and 
Minor Species Animal Drug Development.


<R05>
Sec. 516.23  Timing of requests for MUMS-drug designation.

    A sponsor may request MUMS-drug designation at any time in the drug 
development process prior to the submission of an application for either 
conditional approval or approval of the

[[Page 98]]

MUMS drug for which designation is being requested.


<R05>
Sec. 516.24  Granting MUMS-drug designation.

    (a) FDA may grant the request for MUMS-drug designation if none of 
the reasons described in Sec. 516.25 for refusal to grant such a 
request apply.
    (b) When a request for MUMS-drug designation is granted, FDA will 
notify the sponsor in writing and will give public notice of the MUMS-
drug designation in accordance with Sec. 516.28.


<R05>
Sec. 516.25  Refusal to grant MUMS-drug designation.

    (a) FDA will refuse to grant a request for MUMS-drug designation if 
any of the following reasons apply:
    (1) The drug is not intended for use in a minor species or FDA 
determines that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the 
drug is intended for a minor use in a major species.
    (2) The drug is the same drug in the same dosage form for the same 
intended use as one that already has a MUMS-drug designation but has not 
yet been conditionally approved or approved.
    (3) The drug is the same drug in the same dosage form for the same 
intended use as one that is already conditionally approved or approved. 
A drug that FDA has found to be functionally superior is not considered 
the same drug as an already conditionally approved or approved drug even 
if it is otherwise the same drug in the same dosage form for the same 
intended use.
    (4) The sponsor has failed to provide:
    (i) A credible scientific rationale in support of the intended use,
    (ii) Sufficient information about the product development plan for 
the drug, its dosage form, and its intended use to establish that 
adherence to the plan can lead to successful drug development in a 
timely manner, and
    (iii) Any other information required under Sec. 516.20.
    (b) FDA may refuse to grant a request for MUMS-drug designation if 
the request for designation contains an untrue statement of material 
fact or omits material information.


<R05>
Sec. 516.26  Amendment to MUMS-drug designation.

    (a) At any time prior to conditional approval or approval of an 
application for a MUMS-designated drug, the sponsor may apply for an 
amendment to the designated intended use if the proposed change is due 
to new and unexpected findings in research on the drug, information 
arising from FDA recommendations, or other unforeseen developments.
    (b) FDA will grant the amendment if it finds:
    (1) That the initial designation request was made in good faith;
    (2) That the amendment is intended to make the MUMS-drug designated 
intended use conform to the results of new and unexpected findings in 
research on the drug, information arising from FDA recommendations, or 
other unforeseen developments; and
    (3) In the case of a minor use, that as of the date of the 
submission of the amendment request, the amendment would not result in 
the intended use of the drug no longer being considered a minor use.


<R05>
Sec. 516.27  Change in sponsorship.

    (a) A sponsor may transfer sponsorship of a MUMS-designated drug to 
another person. A change of sponsorship will also transfer the 
designation status of the drug which will remain in effect for the new 
sponsor subject to the same conditions applicable to the former sponsor 
provided that at the time of a potential transfer, the new and former 
sponsors submit the following information in writing and obtain 
permission from FDA:
    (1) The former sponsor shall submit a letter to FDA that documents 
the transfer of sponsorship of the MUMS-designated drug. This letter 
shall specify the date of the transfer. The former sponsor shall also 
certify in writing to FDA that a complete copy of the request for MUMS-
drug designation, including any amendments to the request, and 
correspondence relevant to the MUMS-drug designation, has been provided 
to the new sponsor.
    (2) The new sponsor shall submit a letter or other document 
containing the following information:

[[Page 99]]

    (i) A statement accepting the MUMS-drug designated file or 
application;
    (ii) The date that the change in sponsorship is intended to be 
effective;
    (iii) A statement that the new sponsor has a complete copy of the 
request for MUMS-drug designation, including any amendments to the 
request and any correspondence relevant to the MUMS-drug designation;
    (iv) A statement that the new sponsor understands and accepts the 
responsibilities of a sponsor of a MUMS-designated drug established 
elsewhere in this subpart;
    (v) The name and address of a new primary contact person or 
permanent resident U.S. agent; and
    (vi) Evidence that the new sponsor is capable of actively pursuing 
approval with due diligence.
    (b) No sponsor may relieve itself of responsibilities under the act 
or under this subpart by assigning rights to another person without:
    (1) Assuring that the new sponsor will carry out such 
responsibilities; and
    (2) Obtaining prior permission from FDA.


<R05>
Sec. 516.28  Publication of MUMS-drug designations.

    FDA will periodically update a publicly available list of MUMS-
designated drugs. This list will be placed on file at the FDA Division 
of Dockets Management, and will contain the following information for 
each MUMS-designated drug:
    (a) The name and address of the sponsor;
    (b) The established name and trade name, if any, of the drug;
    (c) The dosage form of the drug;
    (d) The species and the proposed intended use for which MUMS-drug 
designation was granted; and
    (e) The date designation was granted.


<R05>
Sec. 516.29  Termination of MUMS-drug designation.

    (a) The sponsor of a MUMS-designated drug must notify FDA of any 
decision to discontinue active pursuit of conditional approval or 
approval of such MUMS drug. FDA must terminate the designation upon such 
notification.
    (b) A conditionally-approved or approved MUMS-designated drug 
sponsor must notify FDA at least 1 year before it intends to discontinue 
the manufacture of such MUMS drug. FDA must terminate designation upon 
such notification.
    (c) MUMS designation shall terminate upon the expiration of any 
applicable period of exclusive marketing rights under this subpart.
    (d) FDA may terminate designation if it independently determines 
that the sponsor is not actively pursuing conditional approval or 
approval with due diligence. At a minimum, due diligence must be 
demonstrated by:
    (1) Submission of annual progress reports in a timely manner in 
accordance with Sec. 516.30 that demonstrate that the sponsor is 
progressing in accordance with the drug development plan submitted to 
the agency under Sec. 516.20 and
    (2) Compliance with all applicable requirements of part 511 of this 
chapter.
    (e) Designation of a conditionally approved or approved MUMS-
designated drug and the associated exclusive marketing rights may be 
terminated if the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities of 
the drug to meet the needs for which it is designated.
    (f) FDA may also terminate MUMS-drug designation for any drug if the 
agency finds that:
    (1) The request for designation contained an untrue statement of 
material fact; or
    (2) The request for designation omitted material information 
required by this subpart; or
    (3) FDA subsequently finds that the drug in fact had not been 
eligible for MUMS-drug designation at the time of submission of the 
request;
    (4) The same drug, in the same dosage form, for the same intended 
use becomes conditionally approved or approved for another sponsor; or
    (5) FDA withdraws the conditional approval or approval of the 
application for the new animal drug.
    (g) For a conditionally approved or approved drug, termination of 
MUMS-drug designation also terminates the sponsor's exclusive marketing 
rights for the drug but does not withdraw the conditional approval or 
approval of the drug's application.

[[Page 100]]

    (h) Where a drug has been MUMS-designated for a minor use in a major 
species, its designation will not be terminated on the grounds that the 
number of animals to which the drug could potentially be administered on 
an annual basis for the treatment, control, or prevention of the disease 
or condition for which the drug is being developed, including animals 
administered the drug as part of herd or flock treatment, subsequently 
increases.
    (i) When a MUMS-drug designation is terminated, FDA will notify the 
sponsor in writing and will give public notice of the termination of the 
MUMS-drug designation.


<R05>
Sec. 516.30  Annual reports for a MUMS-designated drug.

    Within 14 months after the date on which a MUMS drug is granted 
designation and annually thereafter until approval, the sponsor of a 
MUMS-designated drug shall submit a brief progress report on the drug to 
the investigational new animal drug file addressed to the Director of 
the Office of Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Drug Development that 
includes the following information:
    (a) A short account of the progress of drug development including a 
description of studies initiated, ongoing, and completed, and a short 
summary of the status or results of such studies;
    (b) A description of the investigational plan for the coming year, 
as well as any anticipated difficulties in development, testing, and 
marketing; and
    (c) A brief discussion of any changes that may affect the MUMS-
designated drug status of the product. For example, situations in which 
testing data demonstrate that the proposed intended use is inappropriate 
due to unexpected issues of safety or effectiveness.


<R05>
Sec. 516.31  Scope of MUMS-drug exclusive marketing rights.

    (a) After conditional approval or approval of an application for a 
MUMS-designated drug in the dosage form and for the intended use for 
which MUMS-drug designation has been granted, FDA will not conditionally 
approve or approve another application or abbreviated application for 
the same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use before 
the expiration of 7 years after the date of conditional approval or 
approval as stated in the approval letter from FDA, except that such an 
application can be conditionally approved or approved sooner if, and at 
such time as, any of the following occurs:
    (1) FDA terminates the MUMS-drug designation and associated 
exclusive marketing rights under Sec. 516.29; or
    (2) FDA withdraws the conditional approval or approval of the 
application for the drug for any reason; or
    (3) The sponsor with exclusive marketing rights provides written 
consent to FDA to conditionally approve or approve another application 
before the expiration of 7 years; or
    (4) The sponsor fails to assure a sufficient quantity of the drug in 
accordance with section 573 of the act and Sec. 516.36.
    (b) If an application for a MUMS drug cannot be approved until the 
expiration of the period of exclusive marketing of a MUMS-designated 
drug, FDA will so notify the sponsor in writing.


<R05>
Sec. 516.34  FDA recognition of exclusive marketing rights.

    (a) FDA will send the sponsor (or the permanent-resident U.S. agent, 
if applicable) timely written notice recognizing exclusive marketing 
rights when an application for a MUMS-designated drug has been 
conditionally approved or approved. The written notice will inform the 
sponsor of the requirements for maintaining MUMS-designated drug 
exclusive marketing rights for the full 7-year term. This notice will 
generally be contained in the letter conditionally approving or 
approving the application.
    (b) When an application is conditionally approved or approved for a 
MUMS-designated drug that qualifies for exclusive marketing rights, FDA 
will publish this information in the Federal Register at the time of the 
conditional approval or approval. This notice will generally be 
contained in the notice of conditional approval or approval of the 
application.

[[Page 101]]


<R05>
Sec. 516.36  Insufficient quantities of MUMS-designated drugs.

    (a) Under section 573 of the act, whenever FDA has reason to believe 
that sufficient quantities of a conditionally-approved or approved, 
MUMS-designated drug to meet the needs for which the drug was designated 
cannot be assured by the sponsor, FDA will so notify the sponsor of this 
possible insufficiency and will offer the sponsor the following options, 
one of which must be exercised by a time that FDA specifies:
    (1) Provide FDA information and data regarding how the sponsor can 
assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the MUMS-designated 
drug within a reasonable time to meet the needs for which the drug was 
designated; or
    (2) Provide FDA in writing the sponsor's consent for the conditional 
approval or approval of other applications for the same drug before the 
expiration of the 7-year period of exclusive marketing rights.
    (b) If, within the time that FDA specifies, the sponsor fails to 
consent to the conditional approval or approval of other applications 
and if FDA finds that the sponsor has not shown that it can assure the 
availability of sufficient quantities of the MUMS-designated drug to 
meet the needs for which the drug was designated, FDA will issue a 
written order terminating designation of the MUMS drug and the 
associated exclusive marketing rights. This order will state FDA's 
findings and conclusions and will constitute final agency action. An 
order terminating designation and associated exclusive marketing rights 
may issue whether or not there are other sponsors that can assure the 
availability of alternative sources of supply. Such an order will not 
withdraw the conditional approval or approval of an application. Once 
terminated under this section, neither designation, nor exclusive 
marketing rights may be reinstated.


<R05>
Sec. 516.52  Availability for public disclosure of data and
information in requests.

    (a) FDA will not publicly disclose the existence of a request for 
MUMS-drug designation under section 573 of the act prior to final FDA 
action on the request unless the existence of the request has been 
previously publicly disclosed or acknowledged.
    (b) Whether or not the existence of a pending request for 
designation has been publicly disclosed or acknowledged, no data or 
information in the request are available for public disclosure prior to 
final FDA action on the request.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, upon final 
FDA action on a request for designation, the public availability of data 
and information in the request will be determined in accordance with 
part 20 of this chapter and other applicable statutes and regulations.
    (d) In accordance with Sec. 516.28, FDA will make a cumulative list 
of all MUMS-drug designations available to the public and update such 
list periodically. In accordance with Sec. 516.29, FDA will give public 
notice of the termination of all MUMS-drug designations.

standards and procedures to establish an index of legally marketed 
unapproved new animal drugs. This subpart applies only to minor species 
and not to minor use in major species. This index is only available for 
new animal drugs intended for use in a minor species for which there is 
a reasonable certainty that the animal or edible products from the 
animal will not be consumed by humans or food-producing animals and for 
new animal drugs intended for use only in a hatchery, tank, pond, or 
other similar contained man-made structure in an early, nonfood life 
stage of a food-producing minor species, where safety for humans is 
demonstrated in accordance with the standard of section 512(d) of the 
act (including, for an antimicrobial new animal drug, with respect to 
antimicrobial resistance). The index shall not include a new animal drug 
that is

[[Page 102]]

contained in, or a product of, a transgenic animal. Among its topics, 
this subpart sets forth the standards and procedures for:
    (a) Investigational exemptions for indexing purposes;

informal conference presents new information not in the file, the matter 
will be returned to the appropriate lower level in the agency for 
reevaluation based on the new information.
    (h) Informal conferences under this part are not subject to the 
separation of functions rules in Sec. 10.55 of this chapter.
    (i) The rules of evidence do not apply to informal conferences. No 
motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information and 
views will be made or considered, but any party to the conference may 
comment upon or rebut all such data, information and views.
    (j) [Reserved]
    (k) The presiding officer will prepare a written report regarding 
the subject of the informal conference that states and describes the 
basis for his or her findings. Whenever time permits, the parties to the 
informal conference will have 30 days to review and comment on the 
report.
    (l) The administrative record of the informal conference will 
consist of:
    (1) The notice providing an opportunity for an informal conference

abbreviated new animal drug application under section 512(b) of the act.
    (b) Correspondence and information associated with investigations 
described in paragraph (a) of this section shall not be sent to the 
Director, OMUMS, but shall be submitted to FDA in accordance with the 
provisions of part 511 of this chapter.
    (c) The investigational use of a new animal drug or animal feed 
bearing or containing a new animal drug intended solely for 
investigational use in minor species, other than for an investigational 
use described in paragraph (a) of this section, shall meet the 
requirements of this section. For such investigations, all provisions of 
part 511 of this chapter apply with the following modifications:
    (1) Under Sec. 511.1(a)(1) of this chapter, the label statement is 
as follows:
    ``Caution. Contains a new animal drug for investigational use only 
in laboratory animals or for tests in vitro in support of index listing. 
Not for use in humans.''
    (2) Under Sec. 511.1(b)(1) of this chapter, the label statement is 
as follows:
    ``Caution. Contains a new animal drug for use only in 
investigational animals in clinical trials in support of index listing. 
Not for use in humans. Edible products of investigational animals are 
not to be used for food for humans or other animals unless authorization 
has been granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture.''
    (3) Under Sec. 511.1(b)(4) of this chapter, the notice is titled 
``Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Animal Drug for 
Index Listing'' and is submitted in duplicate to the Director, OMUMS.
    (4) Under Sec. 511.1(c)(3) of this chapter, if an investigator is 
determined to be ineligible to receive new animal drugs, each ``Notice 
of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New Animal Drug for Index 
Listing'' and each request for indexing shall be examined with respect

opportunity for an informal conference as described in Sec. 516.123.
    (6) Under Sec. 511.1(c)(5) of this chapter, if the Commissioner of 
Food and Drugs determines, after the unreliable data submitted by the 
investigator are eliminated from consideration, that the data remaining 
are such that a request for addition to the index would have been 
denied, FDA will remove the new animal drug from the index in accordance 
with Sec. 516.167.
    (d) The investigational use of a new animal drug or animal feed 
bearing or containing a new animal drug subject to paragraph (c) of this 
section shall not be subject to the good laboratory practice 
requirements in part 58 of this chapter.

that the animal or edible products from the animal will not be consumed 
by humans or food-producing animals; or
    (ii) In a hatchery, tank, pond, or other similar contained man-made 
structure in (which includes on) an early, non-food life stage of a 
food-producing minor species, and information to demonstrate food safety 
in accordance with the standards of section 512(d) of the act and Sec. 
514.111 of this chapter (including, for an antimicrobial new animal 
drug, with respect to antimicrobial resistance);
    (8) A description of the methods used in, and the facilities and 
controls used for, the manufacture, processing and packing of the new 
animal drug sufficient to demonstrate that the requestor has established 
appropriate specifications for the manufacture and control of the new

Sec. 516.141  Qualified expert panels.

    (a) Establishment of a qualified expert panel. Establishing a 
qualified expert panel is the first step in the process of requesting 
the addition of a new animal drug to the index. A qualified expert panel 
may not be established until FDA has determined that the new animal drug 
is eligible for indexing. The requestor must choose members for the 
qualified expert panel in accordance with selection criteria listed in 
paragraph (b) of this section and submit information about these 
proposed members to FDA. FDA must determine whether the proposed 
qualified expert panel meets the selection criteria prior to the panel 
beginning its work. Qualified expert panels operate external to FDA and 
are not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, 5 
U.S.C. App.
    (b) Criteria for the selection of a qualified expert panel. (1) A 
qualified expert panel member must be an expert qualified by training 
and experience to evaluate a significant aspect of target

[[Page 107]]

animal safety or effectiveness of the new animal drug under 
consideration.
    (2) A qualified expert panel member must certify that he or she has 
a working knowledge of section 572 of the act (the indexing provisions 
of the statute) and this subpart, and that he or she has also read and 
understood a clear written statement provided by the requestor stating 
his or her duties and responsibilities with respect to reviewing the new 
animal drug proposed for addition to the index.
    (3) A qualified expert panel member may not be an FDA employee.
    (4) A qualified expert panel must have at least three members.
    (5) A qualified expert panel must have members with a range of 
expertise such that the panel, as a whole, is qualified by training and 
experience to evaluate the target animal safety and effectiveness of the 
new animal drug under consideration.
    (6) Unless FDA makes a determination to allow participation 
notwithstanding an otherwise disqualifying financial interest, a 
qualified expert panel member must not have a conflict of interest or 
the appearance of a conflict of interest, as described in paragraph (g) 
of this section.
    (c) Requestor responsibilities. (1) The requestor must:
    (i) Choose members for the qualified expert panel in accordance with 
selection criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) Provide each potential expert panel member a copy of section 
572 of the act (the indexing provisions of the statute) and this subpart 
and obtain certification that he or she has a working knowledge of the 
information.
    (iii) Provide each potential expert panel member a written statement 
describing the purpose and scope of his or her participation on the 
qualified expert panel and obtain certification that he or she has read 
and understood the information. The written statement should describe 
the duties and responsibilities of qualified expert panels and their 
members established by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, including 
the need to prepare a written report under Sec. 516.143.
    (iv) Obtain information from each potential expert panel member 
demonstrating that he or she is qualified by training and experience to 
evaluate the target animal safety and effectiveness of the new animal 
drug under consideration. This information can be obtained from a 
comprehensive curriculum vitae or similar document.
    (v) Notify each potential expert panel member that he or she must 
submit information relating to potential conflict of interest directly 
to FDA in a timely manner, as required in paragraph (e)(6) of this 
section.
    (2) The requestor must submit, in writing, the names and addresses 
of the proposed qualified expert panel members and sufficient 
information about each proposed member for FDA to determine whether the 
panel meets the selection criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(b)(5) of this section.
    (3) After FDA has determined that the qualified expert panel meets 
the selection criteria, the requestor must provide to the panel all 
information known by the requestor that is relevant to a determination 
of the target animal safety and the effectiveness of the new animal drug 
at issue. In addition, the requestor must notify FDA of the name of the 
qualified expert panel leader.
    (4) The requestor must immediately notify FDA if it believes a 
qualified expert panel member no longer meets the selection criteria 
listed in paragraph (b) of this section or is otherwise not in 
compliance with the requirements of this section.
    (5) If a qualified expert panel member cannot complete the review 
for which he or she was selected, the requestor must either choose a 
replacement or justify the continued work of the panel in the absence of 
the lost panelist. In either case, the requestor must submit sufficient 
information for FDA to determine whether the proposed revised qualified 
expert panel meets the selection criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (b)(5) of this section.
    (6) The requestor must keep copies of all information provided to, 
or received from, qualified expert panel members, including the written 
report, for 2 years after the completion of the report, or the product 
is added to the index, whichever occurs later, and

make them available to a duly authorized employee of the agency at all 
reasonable times.
    (d) FDA responsibilities. (1) FDA will determine whether the 
requestor's proposed qualified expert panel meets the selection criteria 
listed in paragraph (b) of this section. FDA will expeditiously inform 
the requestor, in writing, of its determination. If FDA determines that 
the qualified expert panel does not meet the selection criteria, FDA 
will provide due notice and an opportunity for an informal conference as 
described in Sec. 516.123. A determination by FDA that a proposed 
qualified expert panel does not meet the selection criteria following an 
informal conference shall constitute final agency action subject to 
judicial review.
    (2) If FDA determines that a qualified expert panel no longer meets 
the selection criteria listed in paragraph (b) of this section or that 
the panel or its members are not in compliance with the requirements of 
this section, the agency will expeditiously inform the requestor, in 
writing, of this determination and provide due notice and an opportunity 
for an informal conference as described in Sec. 516.123. A 
determination by FDA, following an informal conference, that a qualified 
expert panel no longer meets the selection criteria listed in paragraph 
(b) of this section or that the panel or its members are not in 
compliance with the requirements of this section shall constitute final 
agency action subject to judicial review.
    (e) Responsibilities of a qualified expert panel member. A qualified 
expert panel member must do the following:
    (1) Continue to meet all selection criteria described in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (2) Act in accordance with generally accepted professional and 
ethical business practices.
    (3) Review all information relevant to a determination of the target 
animal safety and effectiveness of the new animal drug provided by the 
requestor. The panel should also consider all relevant information 
otherwise known by the panel members, including anecdotal information.
    (4) Participate in the preparation of the written report of the 
findings of the qualified expert panel, described in Sec. 516.143.
    (5) Sign, or otherwise approve in writing, the written report. Such 
signature or other written approval will serve as certification that the 
written report meets the requirements of the written report in Sec. 
516.143.
    (6) Provide the information relating to potential conflict of 
interest described in paragraph (g) of this section to FDA for its 
consideration. Such information should be submitted directly to the 
Director, OMUMS, when notified by the requestor.
    (7) Immediately notify the requestor and FDA of any change in 
conflict of interest status.
    (8) Certify at the time of submission of the written report that 
there has been no change in conflict of interest status, or identify and 
document to FDA any such change.
    (f) Additional responsibilities of a qualified expert panel leader. 
(1) The qualified expert panel leader must ensure that the activities of 
the panel are performed efficiently and in accordance with generally 
accepted professional and ethical business practices.
    (2) The qualified expert panel leader serves as the principal point 
of contact between representatives of the agency and the panel.
    (3) The qualified expert panel leader is responsible for submitting 
the written report and all notes or minutes relating to panel 
deliberations to the requestor.
    (4) The qualified expert panel leader must maintain a copy of the 
written report and all notes or minutes relating to panel deliberations 
that are submitted to the requestor for 2 years after the report is 
submitted. Such records must be made available to a duly authorized 
employee of the agency for inspection at all reasonable times.
    (g) Prevention of conflicts of interest. (1) For the purposes of 
this subpart, FDA will consider a conflict of interest to be any 
financial or other interest that could impair a person's objectivity in 
serving on the qualified expert panel or could create an unfair 
competitive advantage for a person or organization.

[[Page 109]]

    (2) Factors relevant to whether there is a conflict of interest or 
the appearance of a conflict of interest include whether the qualified 
expert panel member, their spouse, their minor children, their general 
partners, or any organizations in which they serve as an officer,

    (iii) Each submission of a request for a modification described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section should contain only one type of 
modification unless one modification is actually necessitated by 
another, such as a modification of dose necessitated by a modification 
of the concentration of an active ingredient. Submissions relating to 
addition of an intended use for an existing species or addition of a 
species should be submitted separately, but each such submission may 
include multiple additional intended uses and/or multiple additional 
species.
    (3) Minor changes. All modifications other than those described in 
paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section including, but not limited 
to, formulation, labeling, and manufacturing methods and controls (at 
the same level of detail that these were described in the request for 
determination of eligibility for indexing) must be submitted as part of 
the annual indexed drug experience report or as otherwise required by 
Sec. 516.165.
    (c) When changes affect the index listing, it will be updated 
accordingly.

<R05>
Sec. 516.165  Records and reports.

    (a) Scope and purpose. (1) The recordkeeping and reporting 
requirements of this section apply to all holders of indexed drugs, 
including indexed drugs intended for use in medicated feeds.
    (2) A holder is not required to report information under this 
section if the holder has reported the same information under Sec. 
514.80 of this chapter.
    (3) The records and reports referred to in this section are in 
addition to those required by the current good manufacturing practice 
regulations in parts 211, 225, and 226 of this chapter.
    (4) FDA will review the records and reports required in this section 
to determine, or facilitate a determination, whether there may be 
grounds for removing a drug from the index under section 572(f) of the 
act.
    (b) Recordkeeping requirements. (1) Each holder of an indexed drug 
must establish and maintain complete files containing full records of 
all information pertinent to the safety or effectiveness of the indexed 
drug. Such records must include information from foreign and domestic 
sources.
    (2) The holder must, upon request from any authorized FDA officer or 
employee, at all reasonable times, permit such officer or employee to 
have access to copy and to verify all such records.
    (c) Reporting requirements. (1) Three-day indexed drug field alert 
report. The holder must inform the appropriate FDA District Office or 
local FDA resident post of any product or manufacturing defects that may 
result in serious adverse drug events within 3 working days of first 
becoming aware that such a defect may exist. The holder may initially 
provide this information by telephone or other electronic communication 
means, with prompt written followup. The mailing cover must be plainly 
marked ``3-Day Indexed Drug Field Alert Report.''
    (2) Fifteen-day indexed drug alert report. The holder must submit a 
report on each serious, unexpected adverse drug event, regardless of the 
source of the information. The holder must submit the report within 15 
working days of first receiving the information. The mailing cover must 
be plainly marked ``15-Day Indexed Drug Alert Report.''
    (3) Annual indexed drug experience report. The holder must submit 
this report every year on the anniversary date of the letter granting 
the request for addition of the new animal drug to the index, or within 
60 days thereafter. The report must contain data and information for the 
full reporting period. Any previously submitted information contained in 
the report must be identified as such. The holder may ask FDA to change 
the date of submission and, after approval of such request, file such 
reports by the new filing date. The report must contain the following:
    (i) The number of distributed units of each size, strength, or 
potency (e.g., 100,000 bottles of 100 5-milligram tablets; 50,000 10-
milliliter vials of 5- percent solution) distributed during the 
reporting period. This information must be presented in two categories: 
Quantities distributed domestically and quantities exported. This 
information must include any distributor-labeled product.
    (ii) If the labeling has changed since the last report, include a 
summary of those changes and the holder's and distributor's current 
package labeling, including any package inserts. For large-size package 
labeling or large shipping cartons, submit a representative copy (e.g., 
a photocopy of pertinent areas of large feed bags). If the labeling has 
not changed since the last report, include a statement of such fact.
    (iii) A summary of any changes made during the reporting period in 
the methods used in, and facilities and controls used for, manufacture, 
processing, and packing. This information must be presented in the same 
level of detail that it was presented in the request for determination 
of eligibility for indexing. Do not include changes that have already 
been submitted under Sec. 516.161.
    (iv) Nonclinical laboratory studies and clinical data not previously 
reported under this section.
    (v) Adverse drug experiences not previously reported under this 
section.
    (vi) Any other information pertinent to safety or effectiveness of 
the indexed drug not previously reported under this section.
    (4) Distributor's statement. At the time of initial distribution of 
an indexed drug by a distributor, the holder must

[[Page 115]]

submit a report containing the following:
    (i) The distributor's current product labeling. This must be 
identical to that in the index listing except for a different and 
suitable proprietary name (if used) and the name and address of the 
distributor. The name and address of the distributor must be preceded by 
an appropriate qualifying phrase such as ``manufactured for'' or 
``distributed by.''
    (ii) A signed statement by the distributor stating:
    (A) The category of the distributor's operations (e.g., wholesale or 
retail);
    (B) That the distributor will distribute the drug only under the 
indexed drug labeling;
    (C) That the distributor will promote the indexed drug only for use 
under the conditions stated in the index listing; and
    (D) If the indexed drug is a prescription new animal drug, that the 
distributor is regularly and lawfully engaged in the distribution or 
dispensing of prescription products.
    (5) Other reporting. FDA may by order require that a holder submit 
information in addition to that required by this section or that the 
holder submit the same information but at different times or reporting 
periods.


<R05>
Sec. 516.167  Removal from the index.

    (a) After due notice to the holder of the index listing and an 
opportunity for an informal conference as described in Sec. 516.123, 
FDA shall remove a new animal drug from the index if FDA finds that:
    (1) The same drug in the same dosage form for the same intended use 
has been approved or conditionally approved;
    (2) The expert panel failed to meet the requirements in Sec. 
516.141;
    (3) On the basis of new information before FDA, evaluated together 
with the evidence available to FDA when the new animal drug was listed 
in the index, the benefits of using the new animal drug for the indexed 
use do not outweigh its risks to the target animal, taking into account 
the harm caused by the absence of an approved or conditionally-approved 
new animal drug for the minor species in question;
    (4) Any of the conditions in Sec. 516.133(a)(2), (5), or (6) are 
present;
    (5) The manufacture of the new animal drug is not in accordance with 
current good manufacturing practices;
    (6) The labeling, distribution, or promotion of the new animal drug 
is not in accordance with the index listing;
    (7) The conditions and limitations of use associated with the index 
listing have not been followed; or
    (8) Any information used to support the request for addition to the 
index contains any untrue statement of material fact.
    (b) The agency may partially remove an indexing listing if, in the 
opinion of the agency, such partial removal would satisfactorily resolve 
a safety or effectiveness issue otherwise warranting removal of the 
listing under section 572(f)(1)(B) of the act.
    (c) FDA may immediately suspend a new animal drug from the index if 
FDA determines that there is a reasonable probability that the use of 
the drug would present a risk to the health of humans or other animals. 
The agency will subsequently provide due notice and an opportunity for 
an informal conference as described in Sec. 516.123.
    (d) A decision of FDA to remove a new animal drug from the index 
following an informal conference, if any, shall constitute final agency 
action subject to judicial review.


<R05>
Sec. 516.171  Confidentiality of data and information in an index file.

    (a) For purposes of this section, the index file includes all data 
and information submitted to or incorporated by reference into the index 
file, such as data and information related to investigational use 
exemptions under Sec. 516.125, requests for determination of 
eligibility for indexing, requests for addition to the index, 
modifications to indexed drugs, changes in ownership, reports submitted 
under Sec. 516.165, and master files. The availability for public 
disclosure of any record in the index file shall be handled in 
accordance with the provisions of this section.
    (b) The existence of an index file will not be disclosed by FDA 
before an index listing has been made public by

[[Page 116]]

FDA, unless it has previously been publicly disclosed or acknowledged by 
the requestor.
    (c) If the existence of an index file has not been publicly 
disclosed or acknowledged, no data or information in the index file are 
available for public disclosure.
    (d) If the existence of an index file has been publicly disclosed or 
acknowledged before an index listing has been made public by FDA, no 
data or information contained in the file will be available for public 
disclosure before such index listing is made public, but the agency may, 
at its discretion, disclose a brief summary of such selected portions of 
the safety and effectiveness data as are appropriate for public 
consideration of a specific pending issue, e.g., at an open session of a 
Food and Drug Administration advisory committee or pursuant to an 
exchange of important regulatory information with a foreign government.
    (e) After FDA sends a written notice to the requestor granting a 
request for addition to the index, the following data and information in 
the index file are available for public disclosure unless extraordinary 
circumstances are shown:
    (1) All safety and effectiveness data and information previously 
disclosed to the public, as defined in Sec. 20.81 of this chapter.
    (2) A summary or summaries of the safety and effectiveness data and 
information submitted with or incorporated by reference in the index 
file. Such summaries do not constitute the full information described 
under section 572(c) and (d) of the act on which the safety or 
effectiveness of the drug may be determined. Such summaries will be 
based on the draft Freedom of Information summary submitted under Sec. 
516.145, which will be reviewed and, where appropriate, revised by FDA.
    (3) A protocol for a test or study, unless it is shown to fall 
within the exemption established for trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information in Sec. 20.61 of this chapter.
    (4) Adverse reaction reports, product experience reports, consumer 
complaints, and other similar data and information, after deletion of 
the following:
    (i) Names and any information that would identify the person using 
the product.
    (ii) Names and any information that would identify any third party 
involved with the report, such as a veterinarian.
    (5) A list of all active ingredients and any inactive ingredients 
previously disclosed to the public as defined in Sec. 20.81 of this 
chapter.
    (6) An assay method or other analytical method, unless it serves no 
regulatory or compliance purpose and is shown to fall within the 
exemption established in Sec. 20.61 of this chapter.
    (7) All correspondence and written summaries of oral discussions 
relating to the index file, in accordance with the provisions of part 20 
of this chapter.
    (f) The following data and information in an index file are not 
available for public disclosure unless they have been previously 
disclosed to the public as defined in Sec. 20.81 of this chapter, or 
they relate to a product or ingredient that has been abandoned and they 
no longer represent a trade secret or confidential commercial or 
financial information as defined in Sec. 20.61 of this chapter:
    (1) Manufacturing methods or processes, including quality control 
procedures.
    (2) Production, sales, distribution, and similar data and 
information, except that any compilation of such data and information 
aggregated and prepared in a way that does not reveal data or 
information which is not available for public disclosure under this 
provision is available for public disclosure.
    (3) Quantitative or semiquantitative formulas.
    (g) Subject to the disclosure provisions of this section, the agency 
shall regard the contents of an index file as confidential information 
unless specifically notified in writing by the holder of the right to 
disclose, to reference, or otherwise utilize such information on behalf 
of another named person.
    (h) For purposes of this regulation, safety and effectiveness data 
include all studies and tests of an animal drug on animals and all 
studies and tests on the animal drug for identity, stability, purity, 
potency, and bioavailability.

[[Page 117]]

    (i) Safety and effectiveness data and information that have not been 
previously disclosed to the public are available for public disclosure 
at the time any of the following events occurs unless extraordinary 
circumstances are shown:
    (1) No work is being or will be undertaken to have the drug indexed 
in accordance with the request.
    (2) A final determination is made that the drug cannot be indexed 
and all legal appeals have been exhausted.
    (3) The drug has been removed from the index and all legal appeals 
have been exhausted.
    (4) A final determination has been made that the animal drug is not 
a new animal drug.

potassium citrate 0.12 gram, aminoacetic acid (glycine) 6.36 grams, and 
dextrose 44.0 grams.
    (b) Sponsor. See No. 000069 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (c) Conditions of use. (1) Dextrose/glycine/electrolyte is indicated 
for use in the control of dehydration associated with diarrhea (scours) 
in calves. It is used as an early treatment at the first signs of 
scouring. It may also be used as followup treatment following 
intravenous fluid therapy.
    (2) Dissolve each packet in two quarts of warm water and administer 
to each calf as follows:
    (i) Scouring and/or dehydrated calves. Feed 2 quarts of solution, 
twice daily for 2 days (four feedings). No milk or milk replacer should 
be fed during this period. For the next four feedings (days 3 and 4), 
use 1 quart of solution together with 1 quart of milk replacer. 
Thereafter, feed as normal.
    (ii) Newly purchased calves. Feed 2 quarts of solution instead of 
milk as the first feed upon arrival. For the next scheduled feeding, use 
1 quart of solution mixed together with 1 quart of milk or milk 
replacer. Thereafter, feed as normal.
    (3) The product should not be used in animals with severe 
dehydration (down, comatose, or in a state of shock). Such animals need 
intravenous therapy. Oral therapy in these cases is too slow. Animals 
which cannot drink after initial intravenous therapy may need to be 
dosed with a stomach tube or esophageal tube. Adequate colostrum intake 
during the first 12 hours is essential for healthy, vigorous calves. 
Antibacterial therapy is often indicated in bacterial scours due to E. 
coli and/or Salmonella. The product does not contain antibacterial 
agents. A veterinarian should be consulted in severely

scouring calves or cases requiring antibacterial therapy. The product is 
not nutritionally complete if administered by itself for long periods of 
time. It should not be administered beyond the recommended treatment 
period without the addition of milk or milk replacer.

arthritis, the disc syndrome, and myositis.
    (ii) Dogs and cats: It is used in certain acute and chronic 
dermatoses of varying etiology to help control the pruritus, irritation, 
and inflammation associated with these conditions.
    (3) Limitations. Do not use in viral infections. Anti-inflammatory 
action of corticosteroids may mask signs of infection. Do not use in 
animals with tuberculosis, chronic nephritis, cushingoid syndrome, or 
where peptic ulcers occur, except for emergency therapy. Clinical and 
experimental data have demonstrated that corticosteroids administered 
orally or parenterally to animals may induce the first stage of 
parturition when administered during last trimester of pregnancy and may 
precipitate premature parturition followed by dystocia, fetal death, 
retained placenta, and metritis. Federal law restricts this drug to use 
by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.

trihydroxy - 16[alpha] - methylpregna - 1,4 - diene - 3,20 - dione.
    (b) Specifications. Flumethasone suspension is sterile and each 
milliliter of the drug contains: 2 milligrams of flumethasone, 20 
milligrams of propylene glycol, 9 milligrams of benzyl alcohol (as 
preservative), 8 milligrams of sodium chloride, 0.02 milligram of 
polysorbate-80, 0.1 milligram of citric acid, and water for injection 
q.s.
    (c) Sponsor. See No. 000856 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (d) Conditions of use. (1) It is recommended in the various disease 
states involving synovial structures (joints) of horses where excessive 
synovial fluid of inflammatory origin is present and where permanent 
structural changes do not exist. Such conditions include arthritis, 
carpitis, and osselets.
    (2) The drug is administered intraarticularly at a dosage level of 6 
to 10 milligrams per injection. The dosage level is dependent upon the 
size of the involved synovial structure and the degree of severity of 
the condition under treatment. The dosage is limited to a single 
injection per week in any one synovial structure.
    (3) Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that 
corticosteroids administered orally and parenterally to animals during 
the last trimester of pregnancy may induce the first stage of 
parturition and may precipitate premature parturition followed by 
dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. The drug is not 
to be used in horses intended for slaughter for food purposes.

    (1) Horses--(i) Amount. 1.25 to 2.5 milligrams daily, intravenously, 
intramuscularly, or intra-articularly.
    (ii) Indications for use. It is used for the treatment of 
musculoskeletal conditions due to inflammation, where permanent 
structural changes do not exist, e.g., bursitis, carpitis, osselets, and 
myositis; and allergic states, e.g., hives, urticaria, and insect bites.
    (iii) Limitations--(a) Clinical and experimental data have 
demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally to 
animals may induce the first stage of parturition when administered 
during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature 
parturition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and 
metritis.
    (b) When a long-term therapy is used, the dose should be 
individually adjusted to the minimum maintenance dose. A protein-rich 
diet is useful in dogs and cats on long-term therapy to counteract 
nitrogen loss if it should occur. A small amount of potassium chloride 
daily in the diet will counteract excessive potassium loss if this is 
present.
    (c) It has been demonstrated that corticosteroids, especially at 
high dose levels, may result in delayed wound and fracture healing.
    (d) Flumethasone may be administered to animals with bacterial 
diseases provided appropriate antibacterial therapy is administered 
simultaneously.
    (e) The drug is not to be used in horses intended for slaughter for 
food purposes.
    (f) Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a 
licensed veterinarian.

the condition and the size of the involved joint.
    (ii) Indications for use. It is used for the treatment of 
musculoskeletal conditions due to inflamation of muscles or joints and 
accessory structures where permanent structural changes do not exist, 
e.g., arthritis, osteoarthritis, disc syndrome, and myositis (in septic 
arthritis, appropriate antibacterial therapy should be concurrently 
administered); certain acute and chronic dermatoses of varying etiology 
to help control associated pruritus, irritation, and inflammation; 
otitis externa in conjunction with topical medication; allergic states, 
e.g., hives, urticaria, and insect bites; and shock and shock-like 
states by intravenous administration.
    (iii) Limitations. See paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Cats--(i) Amount. 0.03125 to 0.125 milligram daily

chapter.
    (c) Special considerations. (1) Clinical and experimental data have 
demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally to 
animals may induce the first stage of parturition when administered 
during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature 
parturition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and 
metritis.
    (2) Systemic therapy with methylprednisolone acetate, as with other 
corticoids, is contraindicated in animals with arrested tuberculosis, 
peptic ulcer, and Cushing's syndrome. The presence of active 
tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, renal insufficiency, 
predisposition to thrombophlebitis, hypertension, or congestive heart 
failure necessitates carefully controlled use of corticosteroids. 
Intrasynovial, intratendinous, or other injections of corticosteroids 
for local effect are contraindicated in the presence of acute infectious 
conditions. Exacerbation of pain, further loss of joint motion, with 
fever and malaise following injection

Sec. 522.2444  Sodium thiopental implantation or injectable dosage forms.


<R05>
Sec. 522.2444a  Sodium thiopental for injection.

    (a) Specifications. The drug contains sodium thiopental sterile 
powder for dilution with sterile water for injection.
    (b) Sponsor. See No. 000856 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (c) Conditions of use. (1) It is used as an anesthetic for 
intravenous administration to dogs and cats during short to moderately 
long surgical and other procedures. It is also used to induce anesthesia 
in dogs and cats which then have surgical anesthesia maintained by use 
of a volatile anesthetic.
    (2) It is administered as follows:
    (i) For brief anesthesia (6 to 10 minutes) a dosage of 6 to 9 
milligrams per pound of body weight is suggested.
    (ii) To obtain anesthesia of 15 to 25 minutes duration the suggested 
dosage is 10 to 12 milligrams per pound of body weight.
    (iii) Use of a preanesthetic tranquilizer or morphine will decrease 
the dosage of sodium thiopental required, provide for smoother induction 
and smoother recovery, and sometimes prolong the recovery period. If 
morphine is used as a preanesthetic agent the dose of the barbiturate 
can be reduced as much as 40 to 50 percent. When a tranquilizer is 
administered the barbiturate dosage can be reduced 10 to 25 percent.
    (3) Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a 
licensed veterinarian.

powder for dilution with sterile water for injection.
    (b) Sponsor. See No. 061623 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (c) Conditions of use. (1) It is used as an anesthetic for 
intravenous administration to dogs and cats during short to moderately 
long surgical procedures.
    (2) It is administered as follows:
    (i) For total anesthesia, it is given at approximately 10 to 12 
milligrams per pound of body weight over a period of 3.5 to 5 minutes.
    (ii) When preanesthetic medication is used, it is important to wait 
at least an hour before administering thiopental and sodium 
pentobarbital for injection, and the dosage necessary for anesthesia is 
reduced. Usually \1/2\ to \2/3\ the normal amount is adequate.
    (3) Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a 
licensed veterinarian.

    (5) Conditions of use. (i) The drug is used as a pour-on formulation 
for the control of grubs and lice in beef and nonlactating cattle.
    (ii) It is used at the rate of one-half fluid ounce per 100 pounds 
of body weight placed on the backline of the animal. Only one 
application per season should be made for grub control and this will 
also provide initial control of lice. A second application for lice 
control may be made if animals become reinfested, but no sooner than 35 
days after the first treatment. Proper timing of treatment is important 
for grub control; cattle should be treated as soon as possible after 
heel-fly activity ceases. Cattle should not be slaughtered within 35 
days following a single treatment. If a second application is made for 
lice control, cattle should not be slaughtered within 45 days of the 
second treatment. The drug must not be used within 28 days of freshening 
of dairy cattle. If freshening should occur within 28 days after 
treatment, do not use milk as human food for the balance of the 28-day 
interval. Do not treat lactating dairy cattle; calves less than 3 months 
old; or sick, convalescent, or stressed livestock. Do not treat cattle 
for 10 days before or after shipping, weaning, or dehorning or after 
exposure to contagious infectious diseases.
    (c) Specifications. (1) The drug is in a liquid form containing 20 
percent fenthion.
    (2) Sponsor. See No. 000859 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (3) Special considerations. Do not use on animals simultaneously or 
within a few days before or after treatment with or exposure to 
cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals.
    (4) Related tolerances. See 40 CFR 180.214.
    (5) Conditions of use. (i) The drug is used for control of cattle 
grubs and as an aid in controlling lice on beef cattle and on dairy 
cattle not of breeding age.
    (ii) It is applied as a single application placed on the backline of 
animals as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------


For most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible 
after heel-fly activity ceases. Host-parasite reactions such as bloat, 
salivation, staggering and paralysis may sometimes occur when cattle are 
treated while the common cattle grub (Hypoderma lineatum) is in the 
gullet, or while the northern cattle grub (H. bovis) is in the area of 
the spinal cord. Cattle should be treated before these stages of grub 
development. Consult your veterinarian, extension livestock specialist, 
or extension entomologist regarding the timing of treatment. If it is 
impossible to determine the area from which the cattle came and/or exact 
stage of the grubs, it is recommended that the cattle receive only a 
maintenance ration of low-energy feed during the treatment period. This 
lessens the likelihood of severe bloat which may occur in cattle on full 
feed when the common grub is killed while in the gullet. A second 
application is required for animals heavily infested with lice or for 
those which become reinfested. A second application should be made no 
sooner than 35 days after the first treatment.
    (iii) Do not treat dairy cattle of breeding age; calves less than 3 
months

old; sick, convalescent, or severely stressed livestock.
    (iv) Do not treat cattle for 10 days before or after shipping, 
weaning, dehorning, or after exposure to contagious or infectious 
diseases.
    (v) Do not slaughter within 45 days of treatment.
    (d) Specifications. (1) The drug is a solution containing either 5.6 
or 13.8 percent fenthion. Each concentration is available in 2 volumes 
which are contained in single-dose applicators.
    (2) Sponsor. See No. 000859 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (3) Special considerations. Fenthion is a cholinesterase inhibitor. 
Do not use this product on dogs simultaneously with or within 14 days 
before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting 
drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Do not use with flea or tick collars.
    (4) Conditions of use--(i) Amount. Four to 8 milligrams per kilogram 
of body weight.
    (ii) Indications for use. For flea control on dogs only.
    (iii) Limitations. Apply the contents of the proper size, single-
dose tube directly to one spot on the dog's skin. Frequency of repeat 
treatments depends upon rate of flea reinfestations. Do not use more 
often than once every 2 weeks. Treatment at 2-week intervals is not to 
exceed 6 months. Do not use on puppies under 10 weeks of age. Do not use 
on sick, stressed, or convalescing dogs. Safe use in breeding males has 
not been established. Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on 
the order of a licensed veterinarian.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Dip vat procedure. (a) Prior to charging vat, empty old contents 
and thoroughly clean the vat. Dip vats should be calibrated to maintain 
an accurate dilution. Add water, then drug to the vat according to the 
dilution rate indicated in the table. Add super phosphate at a rate of 
100 pounds per 1,000 gallons of vat solution. Super phosphate is added 
to control the pH of the solution and ensure vat stability. Super 
phosphate is usually available at most fertilizer dealers as 0-45-0 or 
0-46-0. Stir the dip thoroughly, preferably with a compressed air 
device; however, any form of thorough mixing is adequate. Re-stir vat 
contents prior to each use. During the dipping operation, each time the 
dip's volume is reduced by \1/8\ to \1/4\ of its initial volume, 
replenish with water and add the drug at a rate of 1 gallon for each 50 
or 200 gallons water added--depending on dilution rate 1:60 or 1:240. 
Also add super phosphate as necessary to maintain pH between 4.5 and 
6.5. Stir well and resume dipping. Repeat replenishment process as 
necessary. For evaportion, add additional water accordingly. For added 
water due to rainfall, merely replenish dip with the product according 
to directions. If overflow occurs, either analyze for drug concentration 
and adjust accordingly or dispose of vat contents and recharge. Check pH 
after each addition of water or super phosphate to assure proper pH 
controls.
    (b) Dip maintenance. (1) With use of dip vat tester, dipping may 
continue as long as the drug concentration is maintained between 0.15 
and 0.25 percent, and the dip is not too foul for satisfactory use as 
indicated by foul odor or excessive darkening (i.e., color changes from 
beige to very dark brown).
    (2) Without use of dip vat tester, vat should be emptied, cleaned, 
and recharged each time one of the following occurs: When the dip has 
been charged for 120 days; when the dip becomes too foul for 
satisfactory use, within the 120-day limit; if the number of animals 
dipped equals twice the number of gallons of the initial dip volume, 
within the 120-day limit.
    (ii) Spray method. To prepare the spray, mix drug with water 
according to table and stir thoroughly. Apply the fresh mixture as a 
high-pressure spray, taking care to wet the skin, not just the hair. 
Apply to the point of ``runoff,'' about 1 gallon of diluted spray per

[[Page 350]]

adult animal. Lesser amounts will permit runoff for younger animals.
    (iii) Pour-on method. Dilute the drug with water according to table 
by slowly adding water to the product while stirring. Apply 1 ounce of 
the diluted mixture per 100 pounds of body weight (to a maximum of 8 
ounces per head) down the center line of the back.
    (2) Timing of applications for cattle grub control. For optimum 
cattle grub control, it is important to treat as soon as possible after 
the heel fly season, before the grub larvae reach the gullet or spinal 
canal, as the rapid kill of large numbers of larvae in these tissues may 
cause toxic side effects, such as bloat, salivation, staggering, and 
paralysis.
    (3) Treatment regimens. (i) Control of scabies mites requires two 
treatments, 10 to 14 days apart.
    (ii) Control of Lone Star Ticks and hornflies requires two 
treatments, 7 days apart.
    (4) Warnings. The drug is a cholinesterase inhibitor. Do not use 
this drug on animals simultaneously or within a few days before or after 
treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, 
pesticides, or chemicals. Do not apply within 21 days of slaughter. For 
use on beef cattle only. Do not treat sick, convalescent, or stressed 
cattle, or calves less than 3 months old except in Federal or State 
eradication programs where immediate treatment of all animals in an 
infested herd is mandatory. Be sure free access to drinking water is 
available to cattle prior to dipping. Do not dip excessively thirsty 
animals. Do not dip animals when overheated. Repeat treatment as 
necessary but not more often than every 7 to 10 days. Treatment for

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          Concentration of formalin
                                           (microliters per liter)
                                   -------------------------------------
               Fish                  Tanks and raceways
                                      (for up to 1 hour    Earthen ponds
                                           daily)         (indefinitely)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salmon and trout:
    Above 50 [deg]F...............  Up to 170...........          15-25
    Below 50 [deg]F...............  Up to 250...........          15-25
    Catfish, largemouth bass, and   Up to 250...........      \1\ 15-25
     bluegill.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Use the lower concentrations when pond is heavily loaded with fish
  or phytoplankton.


[[Page 362]]

    (ii) For control of fungi of the Saprolegniaceae on salmon, trout, 
and esocid eggs: Apply in constant flow water supply of incubating 
facilities for 15 minutes. Concentration of formalin used is 1,000 to 
2,000 microliters per liter.
    (iii) For control of external protozoan parasites on shrimp:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Concentration of formalin (microliters
                                                per liter)
                                 ---------------------------------------
             Shrimp               Tanks and raceways
                                    (up to 4 hours       Earthen ponds
                                        daily)        (single treatment)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Penaeid Shrimp..................  50 to 100 \1\.....  25 \2\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Treat for up to 4 hours daily. Treatment may be repeated daily until
  parasite control is achieved. Use the lower concentration when the
  tanks and raceways are heavily loaded.
\2\ Single treatment. Treatment may be repeated in 5 to 10 days if
  needed.

    (iv) For control of external parasites on all finfish:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         Administer in tanks and
                           raceways for up to 1    Administer in earthen
    Aquatic species       hour (microliter/liter    ponds indefinitely
                           or part per million      ([micro]L/L or ppm)
                           ([micro]L/L or ppm))
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salmon and trout:
 Above 50 [deg]F         Up to 170                15 to 25 \1,2\
Below 50 [deg]F          Up to 250                15 to 25 \1,2\
All other finfish        Up to 250                15 to 25 \1,2\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Use the lower concentration when ponds, tanks, or raceways are
  heavily loaded with phytoplankton or fish to avoid oxygen depletion
  due to the biological oxygen demand by decay of dead phytoplankton.
  Alternatively, a higher concentration may be used if dissolved oxygen
  is strictly monitored.
\2\ Although the indicated concentrations are considered safe for cold
  and warm water finfish, a small number of each lot or pond to be
  treated should always be used to check for any unusual sensitivity to
  formalin before proceeding.

    (v) For control of fungi of the family Saprolegniaceae on all 
finfish eggs: Eggs of all finfish except Acipenseriformes, 1,000 to 
2,000 [micro]L/L (ppm) for 15 minutes; eggs of Acipenseriformes, up to 
1,500 [micro]L/L (ppm) for 15 minutes.
    (3) Limitations. Fish tanks and raceways may be treated daily until 
parasite control is achieved. Pond treatment may be repeated in 5 to 10 
days if needed. However, pond treatments for Ichthyophthirius should be 
made at 2-day intervals until control is achieved. Egg tanks may be 
treated as often as necessary to prevent growth of fungi. Do not use 
formalin which has been subjected to temperatures below 40 [deg]F, or 
allowed to freeze. Do not treat ponds containing striped bass. 
Treatments in tanks should never exceed 1 hour even if fish show no 
signs of stress. Do not apply formalin to ponds with water warmer than 
27 [deg]C (80 [deg]F), when a heavy bloom of phytoplankton is present, 
or when the concentration of dissolved oxygen is less than 5 milligrams 
per liter.

    The purpose of this part is to establish conditions for extralabel 
use or intended extralabel use in animals by or on the lawful order of 
licensed veterinarians of Food and Drug Administration approved new 
animal drugs and approved new human drugs. Such use is limited to 
treatment modalities when the health of an animal is threatened or 
suffering or death may result from failure to treat. This section 
implements the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994 (the 
AMDUCA) (Pub. L. 103-396).


<R05>
Sec. 530.3  Definitions.

    (a) Extralabel use means actual use or intended use of a drug in an 
animal in a manner that is not in accordance with the approved labeling. 
This includes, but is not limited to, use in species not listed in the 
labeling, use for indications (disease or other conditions) not listed 
in the labeling, use at

[[Page 367]]

dosage levels, frequencies, or routes of administration other than those 
stated in the labeling, and deviation from the labeled withdrawal time 
based on these different uses.
    (b) FDA means the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
    (c) The phrase a reasonable probability that a drug's use may 
present a risk to the public health means that FDA has reason to believe 
that use of a drug may be likely to cause a potential adverse event.
    (d) The phrase use of a drug may present a risk to the public health 
means that FDA has information that indicates that use of a drug may 
cause an adverse event.
    (e) The phrase use of a drug presents a risk to the public health 
means that FDA has evidence that demonstrates that the use of a drug has 
caused or likely will cause an adverse event.
    (f) A residue means any compound present in edible tissues that 
results from the use of a drug, and includes the drug, its metabolites, 
and any other substance formed in or on food because of the drug's use.
    (g) A safe level is a conservative estimate of a drug residue level 
in edible animal tissue derived from food safety data or other 
scientific information. Concentrations of residues in tissue below the 
safe level will not raise human food safety concerns. A safe level is 
not a safe concentration or a tolerance and does not indicate that an 
approval exists for the drug in that species or category of animal from 
which the food is derived.
    (h) Veterinarian means a person licensed by a State or Territory to 
practice veterinary medicine.
    (i) A valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship is one in 
which:
    (1) A veterinarian has assumed the responsibility for making medical 
judgments regarding the health of (an) animal(s) and the need for 
medical treatment, and the client (the owner of the animal or animals or 
other caretaker) has agreed to follow the instructions of the 
veterinarian;
    (2) There is sufficient knowledge of the animal(s) by the 
veterinarian to initiate at least a general or preliminary diagnosis of 
the medical condition of the animal(s); and
    (3) The practicing veterinarian is readily available for followup in 
case of adverse reactions or failure of the regimen of therapy. Such a 
relationship can exist only when the veterinarian has recently seen and 
is personally acquainted with the keeping and care of the animal(s) by 
virtue of examination of the animal(s), and/or by medically appropriate 
and timely visits to the premises where the animal(s) are kept.


<R05>
Sec. 530.4  Advertising and promotion.

    Nothing in this part shall be construed as permitting the 
advertising or promotion of extralabel uses in animals of approved new 
animal drugs or approved human drugs.


<R05>
Sec. 530.5  Veterinary records.

    (a) As a condition of extralabel use permitted under this part, to 
permit FDA to ascertain any extralabel use or intended extralabel use of 
drugs that the agency has determined may present a risk to the public 
health, veterinarians shall maintain the following records of extralabel 
uses. Such records shall be legible, documented in an accurate and 
timely manner, and be readily accessible to permit prompt retrieval of 
information. Such records shall be adequate to substantiate the 
identification of the animals and shall be maintained either as 
individual records or, in food animal practices, on a group, herd, 
flock, or per-client basis. Records shall be adequate to provide the 
following information:
    (1) The established name of the drug and its active ingredient, or 
if formulated from more than one ingredient, the established name of 
each ingredient;
    (2) The condition treated;
    (3) The species of the treated animal(s);
    (4) The dosage administered;
    (5) The duration of treatment;
    (6) The numbers of animals treated; and
    (7) The specified withdrawal, withholding, or discard time(s), if 
applicable, for meat, milk, eggs, or any food which might be derived 
from any food animals treated.

[[Page 368]]

    (b) A veterinarian shall keep all required records for 2 years or as 
otherwise required by Federal or State law, whichever is greater.
    (c) Any person who is in charge, control, or custody of such records 
shall, upon request of a person designated by FDA, permit such person 
designated by FDA to, at all reasonable times, have access to, permit 
copying, and verify such records.

<R04>
 Subpart C_Specific Provisions Relating to Extralabel Use of Animal and 
                  Human Drugs in Food-Producing Animals


<R05>
Sec. 530.20  Conditions for permitted extralabel animal and human drug
use in food-producing animals.

    (a) The following conditions must be met for a permitted extralabel 
use in food-producing animals of approved new animal and human drugs:
    (1) There is no approved new animal drug that is labeled for such 
use and that contains the same active ingredient which is in the 
required dosage form and concentration, except where a veterinarian 
finds, within the context of a valid veterinarian-client-patient 
relationship, that the approved new animal drug is clinically 
ineffective for its intended use.
    (2) Prior to prescribing or dispensing an approved new animal or 
human drug for an extralabel use in food animals, the veterinarian must:
    (i) Make a careful diagnosis and evaluation of the conditions for 
which the drug is to be used;-
    (ii) Establish a substantially extended withdrawal period prior to 
marketing of milk, meat, eggs, or other edible products supported by 
appropriate scientific information, if applicable;
    (iii) Institute procedures to assure that the identity of the 
treated animal or animals is carefully maintained; and
    (iv) Take appropriate measures to assure that assigned timeframes 
for withdrawal are met and no illegal drug residues occur in any food-
producing animal subjected to extralabel treatment.
    (b) The following additional conditions must be met for a permitted 
extralabel use of in food-producing animals an approved human drug, or 
of an animal drug approved only for use in animals not intended for 
human consumption:
    (1) Such use must be accomplished in accordance with an appropriate 
medical rationale; and
    (2) If scientific information on the human food safety aspect of the 
use of the drug in food-producing animals is not available, the 
veterinarian must take appropriate measures to assure that the animal 
and its food products will not enter the human food supply.
    (c) Extralabel use of an approved human drug in a food-producing 
animal is not permitted under this part if an animal drug approved for 
use in food-producing animals can be used in an extralabel manner for 
the particular use.


<R05>
Sec. 530.21  Prohibitions for food-producing animals.

    (a) FDA may prohibit the extralabel use of an approved new animal or 
human drug or class of drugs in food-producing animals if FDA determines 
that:
    (1) An acceptable analytical method needs to be established and such 
method has not been established or cannot be established; or
    (2) The extralabel use of the drug or class of drugs presents a risk 
to the public health.
    (b) A prohibition may be a general ban on the extralabel use of the 
drug or class of drugs or may be limited to a specific species, 
indication, dosage form, route of administration, or combination of 
factors.


<R05>
Sec. 530.22  Safe levels and analytical methods for food-producing animals.

    (a) FDA may establish a safe level for extralabel use of an approved 
human drug or an approved new animal drug when the agency finds that 
there is a reasonable probability that an

[[Page 370]]

extralabel use may present a risk to the public health. FDA may:
    (1) Establish a finite safe level based on residue and metabolism 
information from available sources;
    (2) Establish a safe level based on the lowest level that can be 
measured by a practical analytical method; or
    (3) Establish a safe level based on other appropriate scientific, 
technical, or regulatory criteria.
    (b) FDA may require the development of an acceptable analytical 
method for the quantification of residues above any safe level 
established under this part. If FDA requires the development of such an 
acceptable analytical method, the agency will publish notice of that 
requirement in the Federal Register.
    (c) The extralabel use of an animal drug or human drug that results 
in residues exceeding a safe level established under this part is an 
unsafe use of such drug.
    (d) If the agency establishes a safe level for a particular species 
or category of animals and a tolerance or safe concentration is later 
established through an approval for that particular species or category 
of animals, for that species or category of animals, the safe level is 
superseded by the tolerance or safe concentration for that species or 
category of animals.


<R05>
Sec. 530.23  Procedure for setting and announcing safe levels.

    (a) FDA may issue an order establishing a safe level for a residue 
of an extralabel use of an approved human drug or an approved animal 
drug. The agency will publish in the Federal Register a notice of the 
order. The notice will include:
    (1) A statement setting forth the agency's finding that there is a 
reasonable probability that extralabel use in animals of the human drug 
or animal drug may present a risk to the public health;
    (2) A statement of the basis for that finding; and
    (3) A request for public comments.
    (b) A current listing of those drugs for which a safe level for 
extralabel drug use in food-producing animals has been established, the 
specific safe levels, and the availability, if any, of a specific 
analytical method or methods for drug residue detection will be codified 
in Sec. 530.40.


<R05>
Sec. 530.24  Procedure for announcing analytical methods for drug 
residue quantification.

    (a) FDA may issue an order announcing a specific analytical method 
or methods for the quantification of extralabel use drug residues above 
the safe levels established under Sec. 530.22 for extralabel use of an 
approved human drug or an approved animal drug. The agency will publish 
in the Federal Register a notice of the order, including the name of the 
specific analytical method or methods and the drug or drugs for which 
the method is applicable.
    (b) Copies of analytical methods for the quantification of 
extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels established under 
Sec. 530.22 will be available upon request from the Communications and 
Education Branch (HFV-12), Division of Program Communication and 
Administrative Management, Center for Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish 
Pl., Rockville, MD 20855. When an analytical method for the detection of 
extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels established under 
Sec. 530.22 is developed, and that method is acceptable to the agency, 
FDA will incorporate that method by reference.


<R05>
Sec. 530.25  Orders prohibiting extralabel uses for drugs in
food-producing animals.

    (a) FDA may issue an order prohibiting extralabel use of an approved 
new animal or human drug in food-producing animals if the agency finds, 
after providing an opportunity for public comment, that:
    (1) An acceptable analytical method required under Sec. 530.22 has 
not been developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by FDA or that 
such method cannot be established; or
    (2) The extralabel use in animals presents a risk to the public 
health.-
    (b) After making a determination that the analytical method required 
under Sec. 530.22 has not been developed and submitted, or that such 
method cannot be established, or that an

[[Page 371]]

extralabel use in animals of a particular human drug or animal drug 
presents a risk to the public health, FDA will publish in the Federal 
Register, with a 90-day delayed effective date, an order of prohibition 
for an extralabel use of a drug in food-producing animals. Such order 
shall state that an acceptable analytical method required under Sec. 
530.22 has not been developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by 
FDA; that such method cannot be established; or that the extralabel use 
in animals presents a risk to the public health; and shall:
    (1) Specify the nature and extent of the order of prohibition and 
the reasons for the prohibition;
    (2) Request public comments; and
    (3) Provide a period of not less than 60 days for comments.
    (c) The order of prohibition will become effective 90 days after 
date of publication of the order unless FDA publishes a notice in the 
Federal Register prior to that date, that revokes the order of 
prohibition, modifies it, or extends the period of public comment.
    (d) The agency may publish an order of prohibition with a shorter 
comment period and/or delayed effective date than specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section in exceptional circumstances (e.g., where there is 
immediate risk to the public health), provided that the order of 
prohibition states that the comment period and/or effective date have 
been abbreviated because there are exceptional circumstances, and the 
order of prohibition sets forth the agency's rationale for taking such 
action.
    (e) If FDA publishes a notice in the Federal Register modifying an 
order of prohibition, the agency will specify in the modified order of 
prohibition the nature and extent of the modified prohibition, the 
reasons for it, and the agency's response to any comments on the 
original order of prohibition.
    (f) A current listing of drugs prohibited for extralabel use in 
animals will be codified in Sec. 530.41.
    (g) After the submission of appropriate information (i.e., adequate 
data, an acceptable method, approval of a new animal drug application 
for the prohibited extralabel use, or information demonstrating that the 
prohibition was based on incorrect data), FDA may, by publication of an 
appropriate notice in the Federal Register, remove a drug from the list 
of human and animal drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals, or 
may modify a prohibition.
    (h) FDA may prohibit extralabel use of a drug in food-producing 
animals without establishing a safe level.


<R04>
   Subpart D_Extralabel Use of Human and Animal Drugs in Animals Not 
                     Intended for Human Consumption


<R05>
Sec. 530.30  Extralabel drug use in nonfood animals.

    (a) Because extralabel use of animal and human drugs in nonfood-
producing animals does not ordinarily pose a threat to the public 
health, extralabel use of animal and human drugs is permitted in 
nonfood-producing animal practice except when the public health is 
threatened. In addition, the provisions of Sec. 530.20(a)(1) will apply 
to the use of an approved animal drug.
    (b) If FDA determines that an extralabel drug use in animals not 
intended for human consumption presents a risk to the public health, the 
agency may publish in the Federal Register a notice prohibiting such use 
following the procedures in Sec. 530.25. The prohibited extralabel drug 
use will be codified in Sec. 530.41.


<R04>
 Subpart E_Safe Levels for Extralabel Use of Drugs in Animals and Drugs 
                Prohibited From Extralabel Use in Animals


<R05>
Sec. 530.40  Safe levels and availability of analytical methods.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 556.1  General considerations; tolerances for residues of new
animal drugs in food.

    (a) Tolerances established in this part are based upon residues of 
drugs in edible products of food-producing animals treated with such 
drugs. Consideration of an appropriate tolerance for a drug shall result 
in a conclusion either that:
    (1) Finite residues will be present in the edible products--in which 
case a finite tolerance is required; or
    (2) It is not possible to determine whether finite residues will be 
incurred but there is reasonable expectation that they may be present--
in which case a tolerance for negligible residue is required; or
    (3) The drug induces cancer when ingested by man or animal or, after 
tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of such 
drug, has been shown to induce cancer in man or animal; however, such 
drug will not adversely affect the animals for which it is intended, and 
no residue of such drug will be found by prescribed methods of analysis 
in any edible portion of such animals after slaughter or in any food 
yielded by or derived from the living animal--in which case the accepted 
method of analysis shall be published or cited, if previously published 
and available elsewhere, in this part; or
    (4) It may or may not be possible to determine whether finite 
residues will be incurred but there is no reasonable expectation that 
they may be present--in which case the establishment of a tolerance is 
not required; or
    (5) The drug is such that it may be metabolized and/or assimilated 
in such form that any possible residue would be indistinguishable from 
normal tissue constituents--in which case the establishment of a 
tolerance is not required.
    (b) No tolerance established pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section will be set at any level higher than that reflected by the 
permitted use of the drug.
    (c) Any tolerance required pursuant to this section will, in 
addition to the toxicological considerations, be conditioned on the 
availability of a practicable analytical method to determine the 
quantity of residue. Such method must be sensitive to and reliable at 
the established tolerance level or, in certain instances, may be 
sensitive at a higher level where such level is also deemed satisfactory 
and safe in light of the toxicity of the drug residue and of the 
unlikelihood of such residue's exceeding the tolerance.

Sec. 556.220  3,5-Dinitrobenzamide.

    No residues of 3,5-dinitrobenzamide may be found in the uncooked 
edible tissues of chickens as determined by the following method of 
analysis:

    I. Method of analysis--3,5-dinitrobenzamide. A method for 3,5-
dinitrobenzamide (3,5-DNBA) in chicken tissues is described with a 
cleanup step that removes most of the interfering materials, thus 
allowing uncompensated measurements to be read. The 3,5-DNBA is 
extracted from the sample with acetone and chloroform and prepared for 
chromatography by removing the aqueous phase in a separatory funnel and 
the solvents in a flash evaporator. The extract residue is 
chromatographed on alumina to remove several lipid components and 
residues of other drugs. The benzamide eluate is passed through a column 
of Dowex-50 resin, or equivalent, to remove arylamines; for example, 3-
amino-5-nitrobenzamide. The 3,5-DNBA fraction is reduced, after removal 
of alcohol, with TiCl<INF>3</INF> in basic solution to an arylamine, 
presumably 3,5-diaminobenzamide. The reduced fraction is placed on 
another Dowex-50 column, most of the interfering substances are removed 
with washings of alcohol and water, and the arylamine residue is eluted 
with 4N HCl. Colorimetric measurement is made in a 100-millimeter cell 
at 530 millimicrons after reacting the residue with Bratton-Marshall 
reagents.
    II. Reagents. A. Acetone.
    B. Acetyl-(p- nitrophenyl)-sulfanilamide (APNPS) standard--melting

specially denatured alcohol 3A. Drain thoroughly.
    8. Make a slurry of resin in 1,250 milliliters of specially 
denatured alcohol 3A.
    G. Chloroform.
    H. Coupling reagent--0.25 gram of N-1-naphthyl-ethylenediamine

    I. 3,5-Dinitrobenzamide (3,5-DNBA standard). Add to boiling 
specially denatured alcohol 3A until a saturated solution is obtained 
and treat with activated carbon, filtered and crystallize by cooling to 
room temperature. The 3,5-DNBA therefrom is treated a second time with 
activated carbon and then recrystallized three more times from specially 
denatured alcohol 3A. The third crystallization is washed with diethyl 
ether and dried in a vacuum desiccator, melting point range 185 [deg]C.-
186 [deg]C.
    J. Ethyl alcohol--absolute, A.C.S.
    K. Eluting reagent A. The formula and volume required in procedure 
step V-D is dependent on the adsorptive strength of the Al<INF>2</INF> 
O<INF>3</INF>. For each lot Al<INF>2</INF> O<INF>3</INF>, make the 
following test:
    1. Prepare a column (see procedure step V-D for determining formula 
and volume to eluting reagent A).
    2. Transfer 1 milliliter of APNPS standard (100 micrograms per 
milliliter) in 75 milliliters of chloroform to the column.
    3. Wash the column with 100 milliliters of chloroform and discard 
the eluate.
    4. Pass through 100 milliliters of solution consisting of specially 
denatured alcohol 3A and ethyl alcohol 1:1 (volume to volume). Collect

    7. Add the Bratton-Marshall reagents.
    8. All fractions show a slight color. Note the portion containing 
the first significant increase in pink color.
    a. If the color increases in the second, third, or fourth portions 
of eluate, the formula in procedure step V-D is suitable and, depending 
on the portion, 45, 55, or 65 milliliters, respectively, should be used 
in procedure step V-D4. Thereby, the APNPS is retained on the column and 
the benzamides are eluted.
    b. If the color increases in the first portion, the eluting strength 
of the reagent is too strong. Return the test, substituting 1:4

[[Page 378]]

(volume to volume) in procedure step V-D4. If 1:4 (volume to volume) is 
too strong, rerun with ethyl alcohol in procedure step V-D. If none of 
these are suitable, another lot of Al<INF>2</INF> O<INF>3</INF> should 
be used.
    c. If the color increases in the fifth or sixth portion, the eluting 
strength of the reagent is too weak. Rerun the test, substituting in 
procedure step V-D4, respectively, 4:1 (volume to volume), specially 
denatured alcohol 3A: methyl alcohol, 4:1 (volume to volume), until a 
suitable formula is found. If none of these are suitable, another lot of

    V. Procedure. A. Extraction. 1. Mince 350 grams of tissue in a 1-
quart blending jar for 3 minutes. Use samples obtained from either 
freshly killed or quickly frozen birds. The latter should be analyzed as 
soon as thawed. For fibrous meats (for example, muscle, skin) put 
through a meat grinder before mincing.
    2. Weight 100 <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>0.5 grams of each replicate 
sample in a 150-milliliter beaker. Analyze each sample in triplicate and 
average the results. Reproducibility of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>10 percent 
between such analyses has been obtained.

[[Page 379]]

    3. Transfer the sample to a 1-quart blender jar. For kidney and 
liver tissues, make a slurry with acetone in the weighing beaker. 
Transfer with several rinses of acetone.
    4. Blend the sample for 5 minutes with 250 milliliters of acetone 
and a 100-milliliter beakerful of diatomaceous earth.
    5. Filter through a Buchner funnel containing a wetted Whatman No. 5 
filter paper (12.5 cm.) into a 1-liter suction flask.
    6. Rinse the blender jar into the funnel with three 25-milliliter 
portions of acetone.
    7. Transfer the pulp and paper from the funnel to the aforementioned 
blender jar.
    8. Add 250 milliliters of chloroform.
    9. Blend for 3 minutes.
    10. Filter through the aforementioned apparatus of procedure step V-
A5. For rapid filtration of skin and blood samples, prepare funnel by 
adding diatomaceous earth and tamping evenly over paper to a thickness 
of 3 to 5 millimeters.
    11. Rinse the blender jar into the funnel with three 25-milliliter 
rinses of chloroform.
    B. Phasic separation. 1. Pour the combined filtrates into a 1-liter 
separatory funnel.
    2. Rinse the suction flask twice with 25 milliliters of chloroform.
    3. Mix the funnel contents by gently rocking and swirling for 30 
seconds.
    4. Let stand 10 minutes to allow phases to separate.
    a. The upper (aqueous) phase (30 to 50 milliliters) is not always 
emulsion-free. Losses from emulsions have not been significant.
    b. If an upper (aqueous) phase does not appear, add an additional 
100 milliliters of chloroform and 10 milliliters of water and repeat 
procedure step V-B3.
    5. Withdraw the lower phase into a 1-liter round-bottom flask, and 
discard upper phase. Withdraw nearly all of the lower phase, let stand 
for 2 to 3 minutes, then withdraw the remainder.
    C. Evaporation. Attach the flask on a thin-film rotary evaporator 
connected to a vacuum supply, and place in a water bath maintained at 45 
[deg]C.-50 [deg]C. until an oily residue remains. Do not overheat the 
sample or allow to go to dryness.

using a column with calibrated etchings to indicate appropriate 
adsorbent and solvent levels as follows:
    a. Fill tube to a depth of 60 millimeters with 
Al<INF>2</INF>O<INF>3</INF>.
    b. Tap walls gently with hands.
    c. Add anhydrous sodium sulfate to an additional depth of 25 
millimeters.
    d. Wet and wash column with 50 milliliters of chloroform.
    i. During chromatography, make each addition to the tube when the 
liquid level has reached the top of the sodium sulfate layer.
    ii. Increase the percolation rates by applying a slight air pressure 
to the top of the column.
    2. Transfer the residue from procedure step V-C to the column with 
four 15-milliliter rinses of chloroform. Then rinse the walls of the 
tube and sodium sulfate layer with three 5-milliliter portions of 
chloroform. Percolation rate: 15 to 25 milliliters per minute. No color 
from sample should be seen in sodium sulfate layer after final rinse.
    3. Wash column with 100 milliliters of chloroform. Discard eluate.
    4. Add 75 milliliters of eluting reagent A and collect eluate A in a 
250-milliliter beaker for cation-exchange chromatography.
    a. Refer to ``Eluting reagent A'' under ``Reagents'' (II-K) for 
determining formula and volume.
    b. Percolation rate: 8 to 12 milliliters per minute.
    E. Cation-exchange chromatography--No. 1. 1. Prepare an ion-exchange 
column as follows:
    a. Add a uniform slurry of resin to the column to obtain a 4 to 5 
centimeter bed depth after settling.
    i. Obtain a uniform slurry using a magnetic stirrer. To add the 
required amount of resin, calibrate the slurry and transfer it with a 
10-milliliter pipette to deliver a reproducible volume.
    ii. Increase the flow rate to 2 to 4 milliliters per minute by 
applying air pressure to the column. A glycerol manostat adjusted to 30 
inches and attached between an air supply and column provides adequate 
pressure.
    b. Wash the resin with 10 milliliters of eluting reagent A. Discard 
eluate.
    2. Pass eluate A from procedure step V-D4 through the column. 
Collect in a 250-milliliter beaker.

column. Combine with the eluate of procedure step V-E2.
    F. Reduction. 1. Place the eluate A fraction from procedure step V-
E3 on a hot water bath (90 [deg]C.) and evaporate with a stream of air 
until 5 to 10 milliliters remain. Do not overheat the sample or allow 
the sample to go to dryness.
    2. Transfer to centrifuge tube and rinse beaker three times with 3 
milliliters of specially denatured alcohol 3A.
    3. Evaporate on a hot water bath (90 [deg]C.) under a stream of air 
until alcohol has evaporated. Do not overheat the sample or allow the 
sample to go to dryness.
    4. Remove the tube from the water bath and immediately add 5.0 
milliliters of water.
    5. While mixing, add 2 drops of titanium chloride and 4 drops of 10N 
sodium hydroxide. Continue mixing until greyish color disappears.
    a. Mix on Vortex Jr. mixer, or equivalent, regulated with 
autotransformer.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions


<R05>
Sec. 558.3  Definitions and general considerations applicable to this part.

    (a) Regulations in this part provide for approved uses of drugs and 
combinations of drugs in animal feeds. Approved combinations of such 
drugs are specifically identified or incorporated by cross-reference. 
Unless specifically provided for by the regulations, a combination of 
two or more drugs is not approved.
    (b) The following definitions apply to terms used in this part:
    (1) New animal drugs approved for use in animal feed are placed in 
two categories as follows:
    (i) Category I--These drugs require no withdrawal period at the 
lowest use level in each species for which they are approved.
    (ii) Category II--These drugs require a withdrawal period at the 
lowest use level for at least one species for which they are approved, 
or are regulated on

[[Page 391]]

a ``no-residue'' basis or with a zero tolerance because of a 
carcinogenic concern regardless of whether a withdrawal period is 
required, or are a veterinary feed directive drug.
    (2) A ``Type A medicated article'' is intended solely for use in the 
manufacture of another Type A medicated article or a Type B or Type C 
medicated feed. It consists of a new animal drug(s), with or without 
carrier (e.g., calcium carbonate, rice hull, corn, gluten) with or 
without inactive ingredients. The manufacture of a Type A medicated 
article requires an application approved under Sec. 514.105 of this 
chapter or an index listing granted under Sec. 516.151 of this chapter.
    (3) A ``Type B medicated feed'' is intended solely for the 
manufacture of other medicated feeds (Type B or Type C). It contains a 
substantial quantity of nutrients including vitamins and/or minerals 
and/or other nutritional ingredients in an amount not less than 25 
percent of the weight. It is manufactured by diluting a Type A medicated 
article or another Type B medicated feed. The maximum concentration of 
animal drug(s) in a Type B medicated feed is 200 times the highest 
continuous use level for Category I drugs and 100 times the highest 
continuous use level for Category II drugs. The term ``highest 
continuous use level'' means the highest dosage at which the drug is 
approved for continuous use (14 days or more), or, if the drug is not 
approved for continuous use, it means the highest level used for disease 
prevention or control. If the drug is approved for multiple species at 
different use levels, the highest approved level of use would govern 
under this definition. The manufacture of a Type B medicated feed from a 
Category II, Type A medicated article requires a medicated feed mill 
license application approved under Sec. 515.20 of this chapter.
    (4) A ``Type C medicated feed'' is intended as the complete feed for 
the animal or may be fed ``top dressed'' (added on top of usual ration) 
on or offered ``free-choice'' (e.g., supplement) in conjunction with 
other animal feed. It contains a substantial quantity of nutrients 
including vitamins, minerals, and/or other nutritional ingredients. It 
is manufactured by diluting a Type A medicated article or a Type B 
medicated feed. A Type C medicated feed may be further diluted to 
produce another Type C medicated feed. The manufacture of a Type C 
medicated feed from a Category II, Type A medicated article requires a 
medicated feed mill license application approved under Sec. 515.20 of 
this chapter.
    (5) A Type B or Type C medicated feed manufactured from a drug 
component (bulk or ``drum-run'' (dried crude fermentation product)) 
requires an application approved under Sec. 514.105 of this chapter or 
an index listing granted under Sec. 516.151 of this chapter.
    (6) A ``veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug'' is a new animal drug 
approved under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (the act) or listed in the index under section 572 of the act for 
use in or on animal feed. Use of a VFD drug must be under the 
professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian.
    (7) A ``veterinary feed directive'' is a written statement issued by 
a licensed veterinarian in the course of the veterinarian's professional 
practice that orders the use of a VFD drug in or on an animal feed. This 
written statement authorizes the client (the owner of the animal or 
animals or other caretaker) to obtain and use the VFD drug in or on an 
animal feed to treat the client's animals only in accordance with the 
directions for use approved or indexed by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA). A veterinarian may issue a VFD only if a valid 
veterinarian-client-patient relationship exists, as defined in Sec. 
530.3(i) of this chapter.
    (8) A ``medicated feed'' means a Type B medicated feed as defined in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section or a Type C medicated feed as defined 
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (9) For the purposes of this part, a ``distributor'' means any 
person who distributes a medicated feed containing a VFD drug to another 
distributor or to the client-recipient of the VFD.
    (10) An ``animal production facility'' is a location where animals 
are raised for any purpose, but does not include the specific location 
where medicated feed is made.
    (11) An ``acknowledgment letter'' is a written communication 
provided to a

[[Page 392]]

distributor by a consignee who is not the ultimate user of medicated 
feed containing a VFD drug. An acknowledgment letter affirms that the 
consignee will not ship such medicated animal feed to an animal 
production facility that does not have a VFD, and will not ship such 
feed to another distributor without receiving a similar written 
acknowledgment letter.

Sec. 558.4  Requirement of a medicated feed mill license.

    (a) A feed manufacturing facility must possess a medicated feed mill 
license in order to manufacture a Type B or Type C medicated feed from a 
Category II, Type A medicated article.
    (b) The manufacture of the following types of feed are exempt from 
the required license, unless otherwise specified:
    (1) Type B or Type C medicated feed using Category I, Type A 
medicated articles or Category I, Type B or Type C medicated feeds; and
    (2) Type B or Type C medicated feed using Category II, Type B or 
Type C medicated feeds.
    (c) The use of Type B and Type C medicated feeds shall also conform 
to the conditions of use provided for in subpart B of this part and in 
Sec. 558.15 of this chapter.
    (d) This paragraph identifies each drug by category, the maximum 
level of drug in Type B medicated feeds, and the assay limits for the 
drug in Type A medicated articles and Type B and Type C medicated feeds, 
as follows:

is physically stable in liquid feed under field conditions; or
    (3) Feed labeling with recirculation or agitation directions as 
follows:

[[Page 395]]

    (i) For liquid feeds stored in recirculating tank systems: 
Recirculate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 minutes, 
moving not less than 1 percent of the tank contents per minute from the 
bottom of the tank to the top. Recirculate daily as described even when 
not used.
    (ii) For liquid feeds stored in mechanical, air, or other agitation-
type tank systems: Agitate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 
minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the tank that is visible 
at the top. Agitate daily as described even when not used.
    (e) How are chemical and physical stability data to be submitted? 
The data must be submitted as follows:
    (1) Directly in the NADA,

Sec. 558.15  Antibiotic, nitrofuran, and sulfonamide drugs in the feed of animals.

    (a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will propose to revoke 
currently approved subtherapeutic (increased rate of gain, disease 
prevention. etc.) uses in animal feed of antibiotic and sulfonamide 
drugs whether granted by approval of new animal drug applications, 
master files and/or antibiotic or food additive regulations, by no later 
than April 20, 1975, or the nitrofuran drugs by no later than September 
5, 1975, unless data are submitted which resolve conclusively the issues 
concerning their safety to man and animals and their effectiveness under 
specific criteria established by the Food and Drug Administration based 
on the guidelines included in the report of the FDA task force on the 
use of antibiotics in animal feeds. All persons or firms previously 
marketing identical, related, or similar products except the nitrofuran 
drugs not the subject of an approved new animal drug application must 
submit a new animal drug application by July 19, 1973, or by December 4, 
1973, in the case of nitrofuran drugs, if marketing is to continue 
during the interim. New animal drug entities with antibacterial activity 
not previously marketed, now pending approval or submitted for approval 
prior to, on, or following the effective date of this publication, shall 
satisfy such criteria prior to approval.
    (b) Any person interested in developing data which will support 
retaining approval for such uses of such antibiotic, nitrofuran, and 
sulfonamide drugs pursuant to section 512(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act shall submit to the Commissioner the following:
    (1) By July 19, 1973, records and reports of completed, ongoing, or 
planned studies, including protocols, on the tetracyclines, 
streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, penicillin, and the sulfonamides; for 
all other antibiotics by October 17, 1973; and for the nitrofuran drugs 
by March 4, 1974. The Food and Drug Administration encourages sponsors 
to consult with the Center for Veterinary Medicine on protocol design 
and plans for future studies.
    (2) By April 20, 1974, data from completed studies on the 
tetracyclines, streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, the sulfonamides, and 
penicillin assessing the effect of the subtherapeutic use of the drug in 
feed on the salmonella reservoir in the target animal as compared to 
that in nonmedicated controls. Failure to complete the salmonella 
studies for any of these drugs by that time will be grounds for 
proceeding to immediately withdraw approval.
    (3) By April 20, 1975, data satisfying all other specified criteria 
for safety and effectiveness, including the effect on the salmonella 
reservoir for any antibiotic or sulfonamide drugs and by September 5, 
1975, for the nitrofuran drugs, approved for subtherapeutic use in 
animal feeds. Drug efficacy data shall be submitted for any feed-use 
combination product containing such drug and any feed-use single 
ingredient antibiotic, nitrofuran, or sulfonamide not reviewed by the 
National Academy of Sciences--National Research Council, Drug Efficacy 
Study covering drugs marketed between 1938 and 1962.
    (4) Progress reports on studies underway every January 1 and July 1 
until completion.
    (c) Failure on the part of any sponsor to comply with any of the 
provisions of

[[Page 398]]

paragraph (b) of this section for any of the antibacterial drugs 
included in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or interim results 
indicating a health hazard, will be considered as grounds for 
immediately proceeding to withdraw approval of that drug for use in 
animal feeds under section 512(l) of the act in the case of failure to 
submit required records and reports and under section 512(e) where new 
information shows that such drug is not shown to be safe.
    (d) Criteria based upon the guidelines laid down by the task force 
may be obtained from the Food and Drug Administration, Center for 
Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.
    (e) Reports as specified in this section shall be submitted to: Food 
and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, Office of New 
Animal Drug Evaluation (HFV-100), 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 
20855.
    (f) Following the completion of the requirements of paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section and the studies provided for therein:
    (1) Those antibiotic, nitrofuran, and sulfonamide drugs which fail 
to meet the prescribed criteria for subtherapeutic uses but which are 
found to be effective for the therapeutic purposes will be permitted in 
feed only for high-level, short-term therapeutic use and only by or on 
the order of a licensed veterinarian.
    (2) Animal feeds containing antibacterial drugs permitted to remain 
in use for subtherapeutic purposes shall be labeled to include a 
statement of the quantity of such drugs.
    (g) The submission of applications and data required by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section is not required for the continued 
manufacture of any Type A medicated article which is produced solely 
from a Type A article that is in compliance with the requirements of 
this section: Provided, That the Type A medicated article contains no 
drug ingredient whose use in or on animal feed requires an approved 
application pursuant to section 512(m) of the act and/or where the Type 
A article is approved by regulation in this part.
    (1) The following antibacterial Type A articles manufactured by the 
designated sponsors are eligible for interim marketing based on their 
compliance with the requirements of this section:

use as in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (1) No. 000859 for use of Type A medicated articles containing 1.12, 
2.0, 11.2, or 50 percent coumaphos as in paragraphs (e)(2) and (e)(3) of 
this section.
    (2) No. 017800 for use of Type A medicated articles containing 11.2 
percent coumaphos as in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (3) No. 051311 for use of Type A medicated articles containing 1.12 
percent coumaphos as in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (c) Related tolerances. See 40 CFR 180.189.
    (d) Special considerations. Labeling shall bear the following 
caution statement: ``The active ingredient coumaphos is a cholinesterase 
inhibitor. Do not use this product on animals simultaneously or within a 
few days before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-
inhibiting drugs, pesticides, or chemicals.'' Also, see Sec. 500.25 of 
this chapter.
    (e) Conditions of use--(1) Beef and dairy cattle--(i) Amount. 0.0002 
lb. (0.091 gram) per 100 lb. body weight per day for 6 consecutive days. 
Should conditions warrant, repeat treatment at 30-day intervals.
    (ii) Indications for use. Control of gastrointestinal roundworms 
(Haemonchus spp., Ostertagia spp., Cooperia spp., Nematodirus spp., 
Trichostrongylus spp.).
    (iii) Limitations. Feed in the normal grain ration to which the 
animals are accustomed, but not in rations containing more than 0.1 
percent coumaphos. Do not feed to animals less than 3 months old. Do not 
feed to sick animals or animals under stress, such as those just 
shipped, dehorned, castrated, or weaned within the last 3 weeks. Do not 
feed in conjunction with oral drenches or with feeds containing 
phenothiazine.
    (2) Laying chickens--(i) Amount. Coumaphos 27.2 grams per ton (0.003 
percent).
    (ii) Indications for use. For control of capillary worm (Capillaria 
obsignata) and as an aid in control of common round worm (Ascaridia 
galli) and cecal worm (Heterakis gallinae).

[[Page 428]]

    (iii) Limitations. In Type C feed; administer continuously as the 
total feed ration for 14 days; when reinfection occurs, treatment may be 
repeated but not sooner than 3 weeks after the end of the previous 
treatment; do not feed to chickens within 10 days of vaccination or 
other conditions of stress; treatment of colored breeds of commercial 
layers should be avoided while in production since these breeds appear 
to be more sensitive to coumaphos than white breeds; as sole medication; 
medications in general should be avoided while birds are approaching 
peak production; such interruption of normal feeding practices may upset 
the flock and lower egg production; diagnosis by competent personnel is 
essential; flock condition and production records should be carefully 
evaluated prior to treatment.
    (3) Replacement pullets--(i) Amount. Coumaphos 36.3 grams per ton 
(0.004 percent).
    (ii) Indications for use. For control of capillary worm (Capillaria 
obsignata) and as an aid in control of common roundworm (Ascaridia 
galli) and cecal worm (Heterakis gallinae).
    (iii) Limitations. In Type C feed; administer before the onset of 
production; diagnosis by competent personnel is essential; administer 
continuously as total feed ration for from 10 to 14 days; do not feed to 
chickens under 8 weeks of age nor within 10 days of vaccination or other 
conditions of stress; if birds are maintained on contaminated litter or 
exposed to infected birds, a second 10 to 14 day treatment is 
recommended but not sooner than 3 weeks after the end of the previous 
treatment; as sole medication; if reinfection occurs after production 
begins, repeat treatment as recommended for laying flocks.

    (a) Specifications. Type A medicated articles containing 50 grams 
laidlomycin propionate potassium per pound.
    (b) Approvals. See No. 046573 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (c) Tolerances. See Sec. 556.346 of this chapter.
    (d) Special considerations. (1) Laidlomycin liquid Type B feeds may 
be manufactured from dry laidlomycin Type A articles. The liquid Type B 
feeds must have a pH of 6.0 to 8.0, dry matter of 62 to 75 percent, and 
bear appropriate mixing directions as follows:
    (i) For liquid feeds stored in recirculating tank systems: 
Recirculate immediately prior to use for no less than 10 minutes, moving 
not less than 1 percent of the tank contents per minute from the bottom 
of the tank to the top. Recirculate daily as described even when not 
used.
    (ii) For liquid feeds stored in mechanical, air, or other agitation 
type tank systems: Agitate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 
minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the tank that is visible 
at the top. Agitate daily as described even when not used.
    (2) The expiration date for the liquid Type B feed is 21 days after 
date of manufacture. The expiration date for the dry Type C feed made 
from the liquid Type B feed is 7 days after date of manufacture.
    (3) Labeling for all Type B feeds (liquid and dry) and Type C feeds 
containing laidlomycin shall bear the following statements:
    (i) Do not allow horses or other equines access to feeds containing 
laidlomycin propionate potassium.
    (ii) The safety of laidlomycin propionate potassium in unapproved 
species has not been established.
    (iii) Not for use in animals intended for breeding.

blocks for cattle as in paragraphs (e)(1)(xix) of this section.
    (c) Related tolerance. See Sec. 556.347 of this chapter.
    (d) Special considerations. (1) Type C cattle and sheep feeds may be 
manufactured from lasalocid liquid Type B feeds which have a pH of 4.0 
to 8.0 and bear appropriate mixing directions as follows:
    (i) For liquid feeds stored in recirculating tank systems: 
Recirculate immediately prior to use for no less than 10 minutes, moving 
not less than 1 percent of the tank contents per minute from the bottom 
of the tank to the top. Recirculate daily as described even when not 
used.
    (ii) For liquid feeds stored in mechanical, air, or other agitation-
type tank systems: Agitate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 
minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the tank that is visible 
at the top. Agitate daily as described even when not used.
    (2) A physically stable lasalocid liquid feed will not be subject to 
the requirements for mixing directions prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section provided it has a pH of 4.0 to 8.0 and contains a 
suspending agent(s) sufficient to maintain a viscosity of not less than 
300 centipoises per second for 3 months.
    (3) If a manufacturer is unable to meet the requirements of 
paragraph

[[Page 450]]

(d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the manufacturer may secure approval 
of a positionally stable liquid feed by:
    (i) Either filing a new animal drug application for the product or 
establishing a master file containing data to support the stability of 
its product;
    (ii) Authorizing the agency to reference and rely upon the data in 
the master file to support approval of a supplemental new animal drug 
application to establish physical stability; and
    (iii) Requesting the sponsor of an approved new animal drug 
application to file a supplement to provide for use of its lasalocid 
Type A article in the manufacture of the liquid feed specified in the 
appropriate master file. If the data demonstrate the stability of the 
liquid feed described in the master file, the supplemental new animal 
drug application will be approved. The approval will provide a basis for 
the individual liquid feed manufacturer to manufacture under a medicated 
feed license the liquid mediated feed described in the master file. A 
manufacturer who seeks to market a physically unstable lasalocid liquid 
feed with mixing directions different from the standard directions 
established in paragraph (d)(1) of this section may also follow this 
procedure.
    (4) If adequate information is submitted to show that a particular 
liquid feed containing lasalocid is stable outside the pH of 4.0 to 8.0, 
the pH restriction described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this 
section may be waived.
    (5) Required label statements:
    (i) For liquid Type B feed (cattle and sheep): Mix thoroughly with 
grain and/or roughage prior to feeding. Feeding undiluted, mixing 
errors, or inadequate mixing (recirculation or agitation) may result in 
an excess lasalocid concentration which could be fatal to cattle and 
sheep. Do not allow horses or other equines access to Type A articles or 
Type B feeds containing lasalocid as ingestion may be fatal. Safety of 
lasalocid for use in unapproved species has not been established.
    (ii) For Type A articles or Type B feeds (cattle and sheep): Feeding 
undiluted or mixing errors may result in an excess lasalocid 
concentration which could be fatal to cattle and sheep. Do not allow 
horses or other equines access to Type A articles or Type B feeds 
containing lasalocid as ingestion may be fatal. Safety of lasalocid for 
use in unapproved species has not been established.
    (iii) For Type A articles, Type B or Type C feeds (cattle): A 
withdrawal period has not been established for this product in 
preruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.
    (6) Lasalocid Type A medicated articles containing lasalocid dried 
fermentation residue are for use in cattle and sheep feed only.
    (7) Each use in a free-choice Type C cattle feed as in paragraphs 
(e)(1)(xii) and (e)(1)(xviii) of this section must be the subject of an 
approved NADA or supplemental NADA as provided in Sec. 510.455 of this 
chapter.

gastrointestinal worms and lung worm infections; stomach worms 
(Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Ostertagia), intestinal worms 
(Trichostrongylus Cooperia, Nematodirus, Bunostomum, Oesophagostomum), 
and lungworms (Dictyocaulus).
    (iii) Limitations. Administer medicated feed mixed thoroughly in one 
half the usual amount of morning feed; the medicated feed mix should be 
consumed within 6 hours; when medicated feed is consumed resume normal 
feeding; medicated feed is to be fed at the rate of 0.36 gram of 
levamisole hydrochloride (equivalent) per 100 lb. of body weight; 
conditions of constant helminth exposure may require retreatment within 
2 to 4 weeks after the first treatment; do not slaughter for food within 
48 hours of treatment; consult veterinarian before using in severely 
debilitated animals; do not administer to dairy animals of breeding age; 
for use in pelleted or meal feeds only; the label shall bear the 
caution, ``Muzzle foam may be observed. However, this reaction will 
disappear within a few hours. If this condition persists, a veterinarian 
should be consulted. Follow recommended dosage carefully.''
    (2) Swine--(i) Amount per pound. 0.36 grams (0.08 percent).
    (ii) Indications for use. Treatment of the following nematode 
infections: large roundworms (Ascaris suum), nodular worms 
(Oesophagostomum spp.), lungworms (Metastrongylus spp.), intestinal 
threadworms (Strongyloides ransomi), swine kidney worms $(Stephanurus 
dentatus).
    (iii) Limitations. It is recommended that regular feed be withheld 
overnight and worming feed administered the following morning; dilute 
supplement with nonmedicated feed as directed; feed the equivalent of 1 
lb. of 0.08 percent worming feed per 100 lbs. of body weight of pigs to 
be treated; may be fed as sole feed or thoroughly mixed with 1 to 2 
parts of regular feed prior to feeding; when medicated feed is consumed, 
resume normal feeding. Pigs maintained under conditions of constant worm 
exposure may require retreatment within 4 to 5 weeks after the first 
treatment due to reinfection; do not slaughter for food within 72 hours 
of treatment; the label shall bear the caution, ``Excessive salivation 
or muzzle foam may be observed. This reaction is occasionally seen and 
will disappear in a short time after medication. If pigs are infected 
with mature lungworms, coughing and vomiting may be observed soon after 
medicated feed is consumed. This reaction is due to the expulsion of 
worms from the lungs and will be over in several hours.''

    (d) Special considerations. (1) Type C chicken feed containing 
monensin as the mycelial cake shall bear an expiration date of 90 days 
after its date of manufacture.
    (2)-(3) [Reserved]
    (4) Liquid Type B feeds shall bear an expiration date of 8 weeks 
after its date of manufacture.
    (5) All Type A medicated articles containing monensin shall bear the 
following warning statement: When mixing and handling monensin Type A 
medicated articles, use protective clothing, impervious gloves, and a 
dust mask. Operators should wash thoroughly with soap and water after 
handling. If accidental eye contact occurs, immediately rinse thoroughly 
with water.
    (6) All formulations containing monensin shall bear the following 
caution statement: Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed 
containing monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal.
    (7) Type A medicated articles containing monensin intended for use 
in cattle and goats shall bear, in addition to the caution statement in 
paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the following statements:
    (i) Monensin medicated cattle and goat feeds are safe for use in 
cattle and goats only. Consumption by unapproved species may result in 
toxic reactions.
    (ii) Feeding undiluted or mixing errors resulting in high 
concentrations of monensin has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal 
to goats.
    (iii) Must be thoroughly mixed in feeds before use.
    (iv) Do not feed undiluted.
    (v) Do not exceed the levels of monensin recommended in the feeding 
directions, as reduced average daily gains may result.
    (vi) Do not feed to lactating goats.
    (vii) If feed refusals containing monensin are fed to other groups 
of cattle, the concentration of monensin in the refusals and amount of 
refusals fed should be taken into consideration to prevent monensin 
overdosing.
    (viii) A withdrawal period has not been established for this product 
in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.
    (ix) You may notice the following: Reduced voluntary feed intake in 
dairy cows fed monensin. This reduction increases with higher doses of 
monensin fed. Rule out monensin as the cause of reduced feed intake 
before attributing to other causes such as illness, feed management, or 
the environment. Reduced milk fat percentage in dairy cows fed monensin. 
This reduction increases with higher doses of monensin fed. Increased 
incidence of cystic ovaries and metritis in dairy cows fed monensin. 
Reduced conception rates,

[[Page 465]]

increased services per animal, and extended days open and corresponding 
calving intervals in dairy cows fed monensin. Have a comprehensive and 
ongoing nutritional, reproductive, and herd health program in place when 
feeding monensin to dairy cows.
    (x) Inadequate mixing (recirculation or agitation) of monensin 
liquid Type B or Type C medicated feeds has resulted in increased 
monensin concentration which has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal 
to goats.
    (8) Type A medicated articles containing monensin intended for use 
in chickens, turkeys, and quail shall bear the following statements:
    (i) Do not allow horses, other equines, mature turkeys, or guinea 
fowl access to feed containing monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses 
and guinea fowl has been fatal.

clover) and wheat pasture bloat in cattle.
    (2) Poloxalene dry Type A article and liquid Type A article must be 
thoroughly blended and evenly distributed in feed prior to use. This may 
be accomplished by adding the Type A article to a small quantity of 
feed, mixing thoroughly, then adding this mixture to the remaining feed 
and again mixing thoroughly. Dosage is 1 gram of poloxalene per 100 
pounds of body weight daily and continued during exposure to bloat 
producing conditions. If bloating conditions are severe, the dose is 
doubled. Treatment should be started 2 to 3 days before exposure to 
bloat-producing conditions. Repeat dosage if animals are exposed to 
bloat-producing conditions more than 12 hours after the last treatment. 
Do not exceed the higher dosage levels in any 24-hour period.

Sec. 558.465  Poloxalene free-choice liquid Type C feed.

    (a) Approvals. Type A medicated articles: 99.5 percent to 066104 in 
Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (b) Conditions of use. (1) For control of legume (alfalfa, clover) 
and wheat pasture bloat in cattle, use 7.5 grams of poloxalene per pound 
of liquid Type C feed (1.65 percent weight/weight). Each animal must 
consume 0.2 pound of Type C feed per 100 pounds of body weight daily for 
adequate protection.
    (2) For control of legume (alfalfa, clover) bloat in cattle grazing 
of prebloom legumes, use 10.00 grams of poloxalene per pound of liquid 
Type C feed (2.2 percent weight/weight). Each animal must consume 0.15 
pound of Type C feed per 100 pounds of body weight daily for adequate 
protection. If consumption exceeds 0.2 pound of Type C feed per 100 
pounds of body weight daily, cattle should be changed to a Type C feed 
containing 7.5 grams of poloxalene per pound.
    (3) Poloxalene liquid Type A article must be thoroughly blended and 
evenly distributed into a liquid Type C feed and offered to cattle in a 
covered liquid Type C feed feeder with lick wheels. The formula for the 
liquid Type C feed, on a weight/weight basis, is as follows: Ammonium 
polyphosphate 2.66 percent, phosphoric acid (75 percent) 3.37 percent, 
sulfuric acid 1.00 percent, water 10.00 percent, and molasses sufficient 
to make 100.00 percent, vitamins A and D and/or trace minerals may be 
added. One free-turning lick wheel per 25 head of cattle must be 
provided.
    (4) The medicated liquid Type C feed must be introduced at least 2 
to 5 days before legume consumption to accustom the cattle to the 
medicated liquid Type C feed and to lick wheel feedings. If the 
medicated liquid wheel Type C feed feeding is interrupted, this 2- to 5-
day introductory feeding should be repeated.

    (c) Special considerations. (1) For control of outbreaks of disease, 
medication should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is determined. 
Medicated chickens, turkeys, and rabbits must actually consume enough 
medicated feed which provides a recommended dose of approximately 3.5 to 
60 milligrams per pound per day in chickens, 2.5 to 100 milligrams per 
pound per day in turkeys, and 2.8 to 68 milligrams per pound per day in 
rabbits depending upon age and class of animal, ambient temperature, and 
other factors. Consult a veterinarian or poultry pathologist for 
diagnosis.

coccidiosis caused by Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. 
maxima, and E. brunetti under average conditions of exposure.
    (b) Limitations. Feed continuously from the time birds are placed on 
litter and continue past the age when coccidiosis is ordinarily a 
hazard. If death losses exceed 0.5 percent in a 2-day period, obtain a 
laboratory diagnosis. If coccidiosis is the cause, use the 
sulfaquinoxaline levels recommended for control of outbreaks, returning 
to the original dosage schedule after the outbreak has subsided. Losses 
may result from intercurrent disease, other conditions affecting drug 
intake, or variant strains of coccidia species which can contribute to 
the virulence of coccidiosis under field conditions. Do not treat 
chickens within 10 days of slaughter. Do not medicate chickens producing 
eggs for human consumption.
    (ii) Amount. 0.0175 percent.
    (a) Indications for use. As an aid in preventing outbreaks of

increased due to overcrowding or other management factors.
    (b) Limitations. Feed continuously from the time birds are placed on 
litter and continue past the age when coccidiosis is ordinarily a 
hazard. If death

[[Page 514]]

losses exceed 0.5 percent in a 2-day period, obtain a laboratory 
diagnosis. If coccidiosis is the cause, use the sulfaquinoxaline levels 
recommended for control of outbreaks, returning to the original dosage 
schedule after the outbreak has subsided. Losses may result from 
intercurrent disease, other conditions affecting drug intake, or variant 
strains of coccidia species which can contribute to the virulence of 
coccidiosis under field conditions. Do not treat chickens within 10 days 
of slaughter. Do not medicate chickens producing eggs for human 
consumption.
    (iii) Amount. 0.1 to 0.05 percent.

regular feed and 2 more days on 0.05 percent sulfaquinoxaline feed. 
Again follow with 3 days on regular feed and 2 more days on 0.05 percent 
sulfaquinoxaline feed. Continue this schedule if necessary till all 
signs of the outbreaks have subsided. Do not treat turkeys within 10 
days of slaughter. Do not medicate turkeys producing eggs for human 
consumption.
    (3) Chickens and turkeys--(i) Amount. 0.05 or 0.1 percent.
    (a) Indications for use. As an aid in the control of acute fowl 
cholera caused by Pasteurella multocida susceptible to sulfaquinoxaline

<R05>
Sec. 570.3  Definitions.

    (a) Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
    (b) Department means the Department of Health and Human Services.
    (c) Commissioner means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
    (d) As used in this part, the term act means the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act approved June 25, 1936 (52 Stat. 1040 et seq., as 
amended; 21 U.S.C. 301-392).

[[Page 528]]

    (e) Food additives includes all substances not exempted by section 
201(s) of the act, the intended use of which results or may reasonably 
be expected to result, directly or indirectly, either in their becoming 
a component of food or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food. 
A material used in the production of containers and packages is subject 
to the definition if it may reasonably be expected to become a 
component, or to affect the characteristics, directly or indirectly, of 
food packed in the container. Affecting the characteristics of food does 
not include such physical effects, as protecting contents of packages, 
preserving shape, and preventing moisture loss. If there is no migration 
of a packaging component from the package to the food, it does not 
become a component of the food and thus is not a food additive. A 
substance that does not become a component of food, but that is used, 
for example, in preparing an ingredient of the food to give a different 
flavor, texture, or other characteristic in the food, may be a food 
additive.
    (f) Common use in food means a substantial history of consumption of 
a substance by a significant number of animals in the United States.
    (g) The word substance in the definition of the term food additive 
includes a food or feed or a component of a food or feed consisting of 
one or more ingredients.
    (h) Scientific procedures include those human, animal, analytical, 
and other scientific studies, whether published or unpublished, 
appropriate to establish the safety of a substance.
    (i) Safe or safety means that there is a reasonable certainty in the 
minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under 
the intended conditions of use. It is impossible in the present state of 
scientific knowledge to establish with complete certainty the absolute 
harmlessness of the use of any substance. Safety may be determined by 
scientific procedures or by general recognition of safety. In 
determining safety, the following factors shall be considered:
    (1) The probable consumption of the substance and of any substance 
formed in or on food because of its use;
    (2) The cumulative effect of the substance in the diet, taking into 
account any chemically or pharmacologically related substance or 
substances in such diet;
    (3) Safety factors which, in the opinion of experts qualified by 
scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of food and 
food ingredients, are generally recognized as appropriate.
    (j) The term nonperishable processed food means any processed food 
not subject to rapid decay or deterioration that would render it unfit 
for consumption. Not included are hermetically sealed foods and other 
processed foods requiring refrigeration.
    (k) General recognition of safety shall be determined in accordance 
with Sec. 570.30.
    (l) Prior sanction means an explicit approval granted with respect 
to use of a substance in food prior to September 6, 1958, by the Food 
Drug and Administration or the United States Department of Agriculture 
pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Poultry 
Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act.
    (m) Food includes human food, substances migrating to food from 
food-contact articles, pet food, and animal feed.

<R05>
Sec. 570.6  Opinion letters on food additive status.

    (a) Over the years the Food and Drug Administration has given 
informal written opinions to inquirers as to the safety of articles 
intended for use as components of, or in contact with, food. Prior to 
the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (Pub. L. 85-929, 
Sept. 6, 1958), these opinions were given pursuant to section 402(a)(1) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which reads in part: ``A 
food shall be deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any 
poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to 
health''.
    (b) Since enactment of the Food Additives Amendment, the Food and 
Drug Administration has advised such inquirers that an article:

[[Page 529]]

    (1) Is a food additive within the meaning of section 201(s) of the 
act; or
    (2) Is generally recognized as safe (GRAS); or
    (3) Has prior sanction or approval under that amendment; or
    (4) Is not a food additive under the conditions of intended use.
    (c) In the interest of the public health, such articles which have 
been considered in the past by the Food and Drug Administration to be 
safe under the provisions of section 402(a)(1), or to be generally 
recognized as safe for their intended use, or to have prior sanction or 
approval, or not to be food additives under the conditions of intended 
use, must be reexamined in the light of current scientific information 
and current principles for evaluating the safety of food additives if 
their use is to be continued.
    (d) Because of the time span involved, copies of many of the letters 
in which the Food and Drug Administration has expressed an informal 
opinion concerning the status of such articles may no longer be in the 
file of the Food and Drug Administration. In the absence of information 
concerning the names and uses made of all the articles referred to in 
such letters, their safety of use cannot be reexamined. For this reason 
all food additive status opinions of the kind described in paragraph (c) 
of this section given by the Food and Drug Administration are hereby 
revoked.
    (e) The prior opinions of the kind described in paragraph (c) of 
this section will be replaced by qualified and current opinions if the 
recipient of each such letter forwards a copy of each to the Department 
of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for 
Veterinary Medicine, Office of Surveillance and Compliance (HFV-200), 
7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, along with a copy of his letter 
of inquiry, on or before July 23, 1970.
    (f) This section does not apply to food additive status opinion 
letters pertaining to articles that were considered by the Food and Drug 
Administration to be food additives nor to articles included in 
regulations in this Subchapter E if the articles are used in accordance 
with the requirements of such regulations.

Sec. 570.13  Indirect food additives resulting from packaging
materials prior sanctioned for animal feed and pet food.

    Regulations providing for the use of food packaging materials as 
prior sanctioned in part 181 of this chapter are incorporated in 
Subchapter E as applicable to packaging materials used for animal feed 
and pet food.

Sec. 570.15  Adoption of regulation on initiative of Commissioner.

    (a) The Commissioner upon his own initiative may propose the 
issuance of a regulation prescribing, with respect to any particular use 
of a food additive, the conditions under which such additive may be 
safely used. Notice of such proposal shall be published in the Federal 
Register and shall state the reasons for the proposal.
    (b) Action upon a proposal made by the Commissioner shall proceed as 
provided in part 10 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec. 570.17  Exemption for investigational use and procedure for 
obtaining authorization to market edible products from experimental

animals.

    A food additive or food containing a food additive intended for 
investigational use by qualified experts shall be exempt from the 
requirements of section 409 of the act under the following conditions:

[[Page 530]]

    (a) If intended for investigational use in vitro or in laboratory 
research animals, it bears a label which states prominently, in addition 
to the other information required by the act, the warning:

    Caution. Contains a new food additive for investigational use only 
in laboratory research animals or for tests in vitro. Not for use in 
humans.

    (b) If intended for use in animals other than laboratory research 
animals and if the edible products of the animals are to be marketed as 
food, permission for the marketing of the edible products as food has 
been requested by the sponsor, and authorization has been granted by the 
Food and Drug Administration in accordance with Sec. 511.1 of this 
chapter or by the Department of Agriculture in accordance with 9 CFR 
309.17, and it bears a label which states prominently, in addition to 
the other information required by the act, the warning:

    Caution. Contains a new food additive for use only in 
investigational animals. Not for use in humans.
    Edible products of investigational animals are not to be used for 
food unless authorization has been granted by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration or by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

    (c) If intended for nonclinical laboratory studies in food-producing 
animals, the study is conducted in compliance with the regulations set 
forth in part 58 of this chapter.

[41 FR 38644, Sept. 10, 1976, as amended at 43 FR 60023, Dec. 22, 1978]


<R05>
Sec. 570.18  Tolerances for related food additives.

    (a) Food additives that cause similar or related pharmacological 
effects will be regarded as a class, and in the absence of evidence to 
the contrary, as having additive toxic effects and will be considered as 
related food additives.
    (b) Tolerances established for such related food additives may limit 
the amount of a common component that may be present, or may limit the 
amount of biological activity (such as cholinesterase inhibition) that 
may be present or may limit the total amount of related food additives 
that may be present.
    (c) Where food additives from two or more chemicals in the same 
class are present in or on a food, the tolerance for the total of such 
additives shall be the same as that for the additive having the lowest 
numerical tolerance in this class, unless there are available methods 
that permit quantitative determination of the amount of each food 
additive present or unless it is shown that a higher tolerance is 
reasonably required for the combined additives to accomplish the 
physical or technical effect for which such combined additives are 
intended and that the higher tolerance will be safe.
    (d) Where residues from two or more additives in the same class are 
present in or on a food and there are available methods that permit 
quantitative determination of each residue, the quantity of combined 
residues that are within the tolerance may be determined as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of each residue present.
    (2) Divide the quantity of each residue by the tolerance that would 
apply if it occurred alone, and multiply by 100 to determine the 
percentage of the permitted amount of residue present.
    (3) Add the percentages so obtained for all residues present.
    (4) The sum of the percentages shall not exceed 100 percent.


<R05>
Sec. 570.19  Pesticide chemicals in processed foods.

    When pesticide chemical residues occur in processed foods due to the 
use of raw agricultural commodities that bore or contained a pesticide 
chemical in conformity with an exemption granted or a tolerance 
prescribed under section 408 of the act, the processed food will not be 
regarded as adulterated so long as good manufacturing practice has been 
followed in removing any residue from the raw agricultural commodity in 
the processing (such as by peeling or washing) and so long as the 
concentration of the residue in the processed food when ready to eat is 
not greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural 
commodity. But when the concentration of residue in the processed food 
when ready to eat is higher than the tolerance prescribed for the raw 
agricultural commodity,

[[Page 531]]

the processed food is adulterated unless the higher concentration is 
permitted by a tolerance obtained under section 409 of the act. For 
example, if fruit bearing a residue of 7 parts per million of DDT 
permitted on the raw agricultural commodity is dried and a residue in 
excess of 7 parts per million of DDT results on the dried fruit, the 
dehydrated fruit is adulterated unless the higher tolerance for DDT is 
authorized by the regulations in this part. Food that is itself ready to 
eat, and which contains a higher residue than allowed for the raw 
agricultural commodity, may not be legalized by blending or mixing with 
other foods to reduce the residue in the mixed food below the tolerance 
prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity.


<R04>
                     Subpart B_Food Additive Safety


<R05>
Sec. 570.20  General principles for evaluating the safety of food
additives.

    (a) In reaching a decision on any petition filed under section 409 
of the act, the Commissioner will give full consideration to the 
specific biological properties of the compound and the adequacy of the 
methods employed to demonstrate safety for the proposed use, and the 
Commissioner will be guided by the principles and procedures for 
establishing the safety of food additives stated in current publications 
of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council. A 
petition will not be denied, however, by reason of the petitioner's 
having followed procedures other than those outlined in the publications 
of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council if, from 
available evidence, the Commissioner finds that the procedures used give 
results as reliable as, or more reliable than, those reasonably to be 
expected from the use of the outlined procedures. In reaching a 
decision, the Commissioner will give due weight to the anticipated 
levels and patterns of consumption of the additive specified or 
reasonably inferable. For the purposes of this section, the principles 
for evaluating safety of additives set forth in the above-mentioned 
publications will apply to any substance that may properly be classified 
as a food additive as defined in section 201(s) of the act.
    (b) Upon written request describing the proposed use of an additive 
and the proposed experiments to determine its safety, the Commissioner 
will advise a person who wishes to establish the safety of a food 
additive whether he believes the experiments planned will yield data 
adequate for an evaluation of the safety of the additive.


<R05>
Sec. 570.30  Eligibility for classification as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

    (a) General recognition of safety may be based only on the views of 
experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the 
safety of substances directly or indirectly added to food. The basis of 
such views may be either (1) scientific procedures or (2) in the case of 
a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, through experience 
based on common use in food. General recognition of safety requires 
common knowledge about the substance throughout the scientific community 
knowledgeable about the safety of substances directly or indirectly 
added to food.
    (b) General recognition of safety based upon scientific procedures 
shall require the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is 
required to obtain approval of a food additive regulation for the 
ingredient. General recognition of safety through scientific procedures 
shall ordinarily be based upon published studies which may be 
corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information.
    (c) General recognition of safety through experience based on common 
use in food prior to January 1, 1958, may be determined without the 
quantity or quality of scientific procedures required for approval of a 
food additive regulation. General recognition of safety through 
experience based on common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, shall 
ordinarily be based upon generally available data and information. An 
ingredient not in common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, may 
achieve general recognition of safety only through scientific 
procedures.
    (d) The food ingredients listed as GRAS in part 582 of this chapter 
do not

[[Page 532]]

include all substances that are generally recognized as safe for their 
intended use in food. Because of the large number of substances the 
intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, 
directly or indirectly, in their becoming a component or otherwise 
affecting the characteristics of food, it is impracticable to list all 
such substances that are GRAS. A food ingredient of natural biological 
origin that has been widely consumed for its nutrient properties in the 
United States prior to January 1, 1958, without known detrimental 
effects, which is subject only to conventional processing as practiced 
prior to January 1, 1958, and for which no known safety hazard exists, 
will ordinarily be regarded as GRAS without specific inclusion in part 
582 of this chapter.
    (e) A food ingredient that is not GRAS or subject to a prior 
sanction requires a food additive regulation promulgated under section 
409 of the act before it may be directly or indirectly added to food.
    (f) A food ingredient that is listed as GRAS in part 582 of this 
chapter shall be regarded as GRAS only if, in addition to all the 
requirements in the applicable regulation, it also meets all of the 
following requirements:
    (1) It complies with any applicable specifications, or in the 
absence of such specifications, shall be of a purity suitable for its 
intended use.
    (2) It performs an appropriate function in the food or food-contact 
article in which it is used.
    (3) It is used at a level no higher than necessary to achieve its 
intended purpose in that food or, if used as a component of a food-
contact article, at a level no higher than necessary to achieve its 
intended purpose in that article.
    (g) New information may at any time require reconsideration of the 
GRAS status of a food ingredient. Any change in status shall be 
accomplished pursuant to Sec. 570.38.
    (h) If a substance is affirmed as GRAS pursuant to Sec. 570.35 and 
listed in a regulation with no limitation other than good manufacturing 
practice, it shall be regarded as GRAS if its conditions of use are not 
significantly different from those reported in the regulation as the 
basis on which the GRAS status of the substance was affirmed. If the 
conditions of use are significantly different, such use of the substance 
may not be GRAS. In such case a manufacturer may not rely on the 
regulation as authorizing the use but must independently establish that 
the use is GRAS or must use the substance in accordance with a food 
additive regulation.
    (i) If an ingredient is affirmed as GRAS pursuant to Sec. 570.35 
and listed in a regulation with specific limitation(s), it may be used 
in food only within such limitation(s) (including the category of 
food(s), the functional use(s) of the ingredient, and the level(s) of 
use). Any use of such and ingredient not in full compliance with each 
such established limitation shall require a food additive regulation.
    (j) Pursuant to Sec. 570.35, a food ingredient may be affirmed as 
GRAS and listed in a regulation for a specific use(s) without a general 
evaluation of use of the ingredient. In addition to the use(s) specified 
in the regulation, other uses of such an ingredient may also be GRAS. 
Any affirmation of GRAS status for a specific use(s), without a general 
evaluation of use of the ingredient, is subject to reconsideration upon 
such evaluation.

[42 FR 55206, Oct. 14, 1977]


<R05>
Sec. 570.35  Affirmation of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status.

    (a) The Commissioner, either on his initiative or on the petition of 
an interested person, may affirm the GRAS status of substances that 
directly or indirectly become components of food.
    (b)(1) If the Commissioner proposes on his own initiative that a 
substance is entitled to affirmation as GRAS, he will place all of the 
data and information on which he relies on public file in the office of 
the Division of Dockets Management and will publish in the Federal 
Register a notice giving the name of the substance, its proposed uses, 
and any limitations proposed for purposes other than safety.
    (2) The Federal Register notice will allow a period of 60 days 
during which any interested person may review the data and information 
and/or file comments with the Division of Dockets

[[Page 533]]

Management. Copies of all comments received shall be made available for 
examination in the Division of Dockets Management's office.
    (3) The Commissioner will evaluate all comments received. If he 
concludes that there is convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS 
as defined in Sec. 570.3(k), he will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register listing the substance in this subchapter E as GRAS.
    (4) If, after evaluation of the comments, the Commissioner concludes 
that there is a lack of convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS 
and that it should be considered a food additive subject to section 409 
of the act, he shall publish a notice thereof in the Federal Register in 
accordance with Sec. 570.38.
    (c)(1) Persons seeking the affirmation of GRAS status of substances

days during which any interested person may review the petition and/or 
file comments with the Division of Dockets Management. Copies of all 
comments received shall be made available for examination in the 
Division of Dockets Management.
    (4) The Commissioner will evaluate the petition and all available 
information including all comments received. If the petition and such 
information provide convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS as 
defined in Sec. 570.3, he will publish an order in the Federal Register 
listing the substance in this subchapter E as GRAS.
    (5) If, after evaluation of the petition and all available 
information, the Commissioner concludes that there is a lack of 
convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS and that it should be 
considered a food additive subject to section 409 of the act, he shall 
publish a notice thereof in the Federal Register in accordance with 
Sec. 570.38.
    (6) The notice of filing in the Federal Register will request 
submission of proof of any applicable prior sanction for use of the 
ingredient under conditions different from those proposed to be 
determined to be GRAS. The failure of any person to come forward with 
proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to the notice of 
filing will constitute a waiver of the right to assert or rely on such 
sanction at any later time. The notice of filing will also constitute a 
proposal to establish a regulation under this subchapter E, 
incorporating the same provisions, in the event that such a regulation 
is determined to be appropriate as a result of submission of proof of 
such an applicable prior sanction in response to the notice of filing.

Sec. 570.38  Determination of food additive status.

    (a) The Commissioner may, in accordance with Sec. 570.35 (b)(4) or 
(c)(5), publish a notice in the Federal Register determining that a 
substance is not GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409 of 
the act.
    (b)(1) The Commissioner, on his own initiative or on the petition of 
any interested person, pursuant to part 10 of this chapter, may issue a 
notice in the Federal Register proposing to determine that a substance 
is not GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act. 
Any petition shall include all relevant data and information of the type 
described in Sec. 571.130(b) of this chapter. The Commissioner will 
place all of the data and information on which he relies on public file 
in the Division of Dockets Management and will include in the Federal 
Register notice the name of the substance, its known uses, and a summary 
of the basis for the determination.
    (2) The Federal Register notice will allow a period of 60 days 
during which any interested person may review the data and information 
and/or file comments with the Division of Dockets Management. Copies of 
all comments shall be made available for examination in the Division of 
Dockets Management.
    (3) The Commissioner will evaluate all comments received. If he 
concludes that there is a lack of convincing evidence that the substance 
is GRAS or is otherwise exempt from the definition of a food additive in 
section 201(s) of the act, he will publish a notice thereof in the 
Federal Register. If he concludes that there is convincing evidence that 
the substance is GRAS, he will publish an order in the Federal Register 
listing the substance in this subchapter E as GRAS.
    (c) A Federal Register notice determining that a substance is a food 
additive shall provide for the use of the additive in food or food-
contact surfaces as follows:
    (1) It may promulgate a food additive regulation governing use of 
the additive.
    (2) It may promulgate an interim food additive regulation governing 
use of the additive.
    (3) It may require discontinuation of the use of the additive.
    (4) It may adopt any combination of the above three approaches for 
different uses or levels of use of the additive.
    (d) If the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is aware of any prior 
sanction

[[Page 535]]

for use of the substance, he will concurrently propose a separate 
regulation covering such use of the ingredient under this subchapter E. 
If the Commissioner is unaware of any such applicable prior sanction, 
the proposed regulation will so state and will require any person who 
intends to assert or rely on such sanction to submit proof of its 
existence. Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this section 
constitutes a determination that excluded uses would result in 
adulteration of the food in violation of section 402 of the act, and the 
failure of any person to come forward with proof of such an applicable 
prior sanction in response to the proposal will constitute a waiver of 
the right to assert or rely on such sanction at any later time. The 
notice will also constitute a proposal to establish a regulation under 
this subchapter E., incorporating the same provisions, in the event that 
such a regulation is determined to be appropriate as a result of 
submission of proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to 
the proposal.

    Dear Sirs: The undersigned, --------

submits this petition pursuant to section 409(b)(1) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and

Cosmetic Act with respect to____________________________________________

(Name of the food additive and proposed use)
    Attached hereto, in triplicate, and constituting a part of this 
petition, are the following:
    A. The name and all pertinent information concerning the food 
additive, including chemical identity and composition of the

[[Page 536]]

food additive, its physical, chemical, and biological properties, and 
specifications prescribing the minimum content of the desired 
component(s) and identifying and limiting the reaction byproducts and 
other impurities. Where such information is not available, a statement 
as to the reasons why it is not should be submitted.
    When the chemical identity and composition of the food additive is 
not known, the petition shall contain information in sufficient detail 
to permit evaluation regarding the method of manufacture and the 
analytical controls used during the various stages of manufacturing, 
processing, or packing of the food additive which are relied upon to 
establish that it is a substance of reproducible composition. 
Alternative methods and controls and variations in methods and controls 
within reasonable limits that do not affect the characteristics of the 
substance or the reliability of the controls may be specified.
    If the food additive is a mixture of chemicals, the petition shall 
supply a list of all substances used in the synthesis, extraction, or 
other method of preparation, regardless of whether they undergo chemical 
change in the process. Each substance should be identified by its common 
English name and complete chemical name, using structural formulas when 
necessary for specific identification. If any proprietary preparation is 
used as a component, the proprietary name should be followed by a 
complete quantitative statement of composition. Reasonable alternatives 
for any listed substance may be specified.
    If the petitioner does not himself perform all the manufacturing, 
processing, and packing operations for a food additive, the petition 
shall identify each person who will perform a part of such operations 
and designate the part.
    The petition shall include stability data, and, if the data indicate 
that it is needed to ensure the identity, strength, quality, or purity 
of the additive, the expiration date that will be employed.
    B. The amount of the food additive proposed for use and the purposes 
for which it is proposed, together with all directions, recommendations, 
and suggestions regarding the proposed use, as well as specimens of the 
labeling proposed for the food additive and any labeling that will be 
required by applicable provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act on the finished food by reason of the use of the food 
additive. If the additive results or may reasonably be expected to 
result from the use of packaging material, the petitioner shall show how 
this may occur and what residues may reasonably be anticipated.
    (Typewritten or other draft-labeling copy will be accepted for 
consideration of the petition, provided a statement is made that final 
printed labeling identical in content to the draft copy will be 
submitted as soon as available and prior to the marketing of the food 
additive.
    If the food additive is one for which a tolerance limitation is 
required to assure its safety, the level of use proposed should be no 
higher than the amount reasonably required to accomplish the intended 
physical or other technical effect, even though the safety data may 
support a higher tolerance.)
    C. Data establishing that the food additive will have the intended 
physical or other technical effect or that it may reasonably be expected 
to become a component, or to affect the characteristics, directly or 
indirectly, of food and the amount necessary to accomplish this. These 
data should include information in sufficient detail to permit 
evaluation with control data.
    D. A description of practicable methods to determine the amount of 
the food additive in the raw, processed, and/or finished food and of any 
substance formed in or on such food because of its use. The test 
proposed shall be one that can be used for food-control purposes and 
that can be applied with consistent results by any properly equipped and 
trained laboratory personnel.
    E. Full reports of investigations made with respect to the safety of 
the food additive.
    (A petition may be regarded as incomplete unless it includes full 
reports of adequate tests reasonably applicable to show whether or not 
the food additive will be safe for its intended use. The reports 
ordinarily should include detailed data derived from appropriate animal 
and other biological experiments in which the methods used and the 
results obtained are clearly set forth. The petition shall not omit 
without explanation any reports of investigations that would bias an 
evaluation of the safety of the food additive.)
    F. Proposed tolerances for the food additive, if tolerances are 
required in order to ensure its safety. A petitioner may include a 
proposed regulation.
    G. If submitting petition to modify an existing regulation issued 
pursuant to section 409(c)(1)(A) of the act, full information on each 
proposed change that is to be made in the original regulation must be 
submitted. The petition may omit statements made in the original 
petition concerning which no change is proposed. A supplemental petition 
must be submitted for any change beyond the variations provided for in 
the original petition and the regulation issued on the basis of the 
original petition.
    H. The petitioner is required to submit either a claim for 
categorical exclusion under Sec. 25.30 or Sec. 25.32 of this chapter 
or an environmental assessment under Sec. 25.40 of this chapter.
Yours very truly,
     Petitioner --------
     By --------

    (d) The petitioner will be notified of the date on which his 
petition is filed, and an incomplete petition, or one that has not been 
submitted in triplicate, will usually be retained but not filed as a 
petition under section 409 of the act. The petitioner will be notified 
in what respects his petition is incomplete.
    (e) The petition must be signed by the petitioner or by his attorney 
or agent, or (if a corporation) by an authorized official.
    (f) The data specified under the several lettered headings should be 
submitted on separate sheets or sets of sheets, suitably identified. If 
such data have already been submitted with an earlier application, the 
present petition may incorporate it by specific reference to the 
earlier. If part of the data have been submitted by the manufacturer of 
the food additive as a master file, the petitioner may refer to the 
master file if and to the extent he obtains the manufacturer's written 
permission to do so. The manufacturer may authorize specific reference 
to the data without disclosure to the petitioner. Nothing herein shall 
prevent reference to published data.
    (g) A petition shall be retained but shall not be filed if any of 
the data prescribed by section 409(b) of the act are lacking or are not 
set forth so as to be readily understood.
    (h)(1) The following data and information in a food additive 
petition are available for public disclosure, unless extraordinary 
circumstances are shown, after the notice of filing of the petition is 
published in the Federal Register or, if the petition is not promptly 
filed because of deficiencies in it, after the petitioner is informed 
that it will not be filed because of the deficiencies involved:
    (i) All safety and functionality data and information submitted with 
or incorporated by reference in the petition.
    (ii) A protocol for a test or study, unless it is shown to fall 
within the exemption established for trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information in Sec. 20.61 of this chapter.

involved with the report, such as a physician or hospital or other 
institution.
    (iv) A list of all ingredients contained in a food additive, whether 
or not it is in descending order of predominance. A particular 
ingredient or group of ingredients shall be deleted from any such list 
prior to public disclosure if it is shown to fall within the exemption 
established in Sec. 20.61 of this chapter, and a notation shall be made 
that any such ingredient list is incomplete.
    (v) An assay method or other analytical method, unless it serves no 
regulatory or compliance purpose and is shown to fall within the 
exemption established in Sec. 20.61 of this chapter.
    (2) The following data and information in a food additive petition 
are not available for public disclosure unless they have been previously 
disclosed to the public as defined in Sec. 20.81 of this chapter or 
they relate to a product or ingredient that has been abandoned and they 
no longer represent a trade secret or confidential commercial or 
financial information as defined in Sec. 20.61 of this chapter:
    (i) Manufacturing methods or processes, including quality control 
procedures.
    (ii) Production, sales, distribution, and similar data and

provision is available for public disclosure.
    (iii) Quantitative or semiquantitative formulas.
    (3) All correspondence and written summaries of oral discussions 
relating to a food additive petition are available for public disclosure 
in accordance with the provisions of part 20 of this chapter when the 
food additive regulation is published in the Federal Register.
    (4) For purposes of this regulation, safety and functionality data 
include all studies and tests of a food additive on animals and humans 
and all studies

[[Page 538]]

and tests on a food additive for identity, stability, purity, potency, 
performance, and usefulness.
    (i)(1) Within 15 days after receipt, the Commissioner will notify 
the petitioner of acceptance or nonacceptance of a petition, and if not 
accepted the reasons therefor. If accepted, the date of the notification 
letter sent to petitioner becomes the date of filing for the purposes of 
section 409(b)(5) of the act. If the petitioner desires, he may 
supplement a deficient petition after being notified regarding 
deficiencies. If the supplementary material or explanation of the 
petition is deemed acceptable, petitioner shall be notified. The date of 
such notification becomes the date of filing. If the petitioner does not 
wish to supplement or explain the petition and requests in writing that 
it be filed as submitted, the petition shall be filed and the petitioner 
so notified. The date of such notification becomes the date of filing.
    (2) The Commissioner will publish in the Federal Register within 30 
days from the date of filing of such petition, a notice of the filing, 
the name of the petitioner, and a brief description of the proposal in 
general terms. In the case of a food additive which becomes a component 
of food by migration from packaging material, the notice shall include 
the name of the migratory substance, and where it is different from that 
of one of the original components, the name of the parent component, the 
maximum quantity of the migratory substance that is proposed for use in 
food, and the physical or other technical effect which the migratory 
substance or its parent component is intended to have in the packaging 
material. A copy of the notice will be mailed to the petitioner when the 
original is forwarded to the Federal Register for publication.
    (j) The Commissioner may request a full description of the methods 
used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the production of the 
food additive, or a sample of the food additive, articles used as 
components thereof, or of the food in which the additive is proposed to 
be used, at any time while a petition is under consideration. The 
Commissioner shall specify in the request for a sample of the food 
additive, or articles used as components thereof, or of the food in or 
on which the additive is proposed to be used, a quantity deemed adequate 
to permit tests of analytical methods to determine quantities of the 
food additive present in foods for which it is intended to be used or 
adequate for any study or investigation reasonably required with respect 
to the safety of the food additive or the physical or technical effect 
it produces. The date used for computing the 90-day limit for the 
purposes of section 409(c)(2) of the act shall be moved forward 1 day 
for each day after the mailing date of the request taken by the 
petitioner to submit the sample. If the information or sample is 
requested a reasonable time in advance of the 180 days, but is not 
submitted within such 180 days after filing of the petition, the 
petition will be considered withdrawn without prejudice.
    (k) If nonclinical laboratory studies are involved, petitions filed 
with the Commissioner under section 409(b) of the act shall include, 
with respect to each study, either a statement that the study was 
conducted in compliance with the requirements set forth in part 58 of 
this chapter, or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with such 
regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.

Sec. 571.6  Amendment of petition.

    After a petition has been filed, the petitioner may submit 
additional information or data in support thereof. In such cases, if the 
Commissioner determines that the additional information or data amounts 
to a substantive amendment, the petition as amended will be given a new 
filing date, and the time limitation will begin to run anew. If 
nonclinical laboratory studies are involved, additional information and 
data submitted in support of filed petitions shall include, with respect 
to each such study, either a statement that the study was conducted in 
compliance with the requirements set forth in part 58 of this chapter, 
or, if the study was not conducted in compliance

[[Page 539]]

with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason or the 
noncompliance.

<R05>
Sec. 571.7  Withdrawal of petition without prejudice.

    (a) In some cases the Commissioner will notify the petitioner that 
the petition, while technically complete, is inadequate to justify the 
establishment of a regulation or the regulation requested by petitioner. 
This may be due to the fact that the data are not sufficiently clear or 
complete. In such cases, the petitioner may withdraw the petition 
pending its clarification or the obtaining of additional data. This 
withdrawal will be without prejudice to a future filing. Upon refiling, 
the time limitation will begin to run anew from the date of refiling.
    (b) At any time before the order provided for in Sec. 571.100(a) 
has been forwarded to the Federal Register for publication, the 
petitioner may withdraw the petition without prejudice to a future 
filing. Upon refiling the time limitation will begin to run anew.

<R05>
Sec. 571.100  Regulation based on petition.

    (a) The Commissioner will forward for publication in the Federal 
Register, within 90 days after filing of the petition (or within 180 
days if the time is extended as provided for in section 409(c)(2) of the 
act), a regulation prescribing the conditions under which the food 
additive may be safely used (including, but not limited to, 
specifications as to the particular food or classes of food in or on 
which such additive may be used, the maximum quantity that may be used 
or permitted to remain in or on such food, the manner in which such 
additive may be added to or used in or on such food, and any directions 
or other labeling or packaging requirements for such additive deemed 
necessary by him to assure the safety of such use), and prior to the 
forwarding of the order to the Federal Register for publication shall 
notify the petitioner of such order and the reasons for such action; or 
by order deny the petition, and shall notify the petitioner of such 
order and of the reasons for such action.
    (b) If the Commissioner determines that additional time is needed to 
study and investigate the petition, he shall by written notice to the 
petitioner extend the 90-day period for not more than 180 days after the 
filing of the petition.


<R05>
Sec. 571.102  Effective date of regulation.

    A regulation published in accordance with Sec. 571.100(a) shall 
become effective upon publication in the Federal Register.

determined by calculating a ``t'' value according to the formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JA93.412

where:

xt and xc are the means of the logs of the pericardial fluid volumes of 
the test and control groups, respectively;
nt and nc are the number of chicks in the respective groups;
st\2\ and sc\2\ are the variances of the test and control groups, 
respectively.
The variances are calculated as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JA93.413

where:

[Sigma]x is the sum of the logs of the pericardial fluid volumes;
[Sigma]x\2\ is the sum of the squares of the logs of the pericardial 
fluid volumes for either the test t or control c group data.


The test sample is judged to contain chick-edema factor if the 
calculated ``t'' exceeds +1.3 and the mean log of the pericardial fluid 
volume obtained from the negative control group multiplied by 100 is 
less than 1.1461.

<R05>
Sec. 579.40  Ionizing radiation for the treatment of poultry feed and
poultry feed ingredients.

    Ionizing radiation for the treatment of complete poultry diets and 
poultry feed ingredients may be safely used as follows:
    (a) Energy sources. Ionizing radiation is limited to gamma rays from 
sealed units of cobalt-60.
    (b) Limitation. The ionizing radiation is used for feed or feed 
ingredients that do not contain drugs.
    (c) Use. Ionizing radiation is used as a single treatment for 
rendering complete poultry diets or poultry feed ingredients salmonella 
negative as follows:
    (1) Minimum dose 2.0 kiloGrays (kGy) (0.2 megarad (Mrad)); maximum 
dose 25 kGy (2.5 megarads Mrad). The absorbed dose of irradiation is to 
be based on initial concentration of salmonella using the relationship 
that 1.0 kGy (0.1 Mrad) reduces salmonella concentration by one log 
cycle (one decimal reduction).
    (2) Feeds treated by irradiation should be formulated to account for 
nutritional loss.
    (3) If an irradiated feed ingredient is less than 5 percent of the 
final product, the final product can be irradiated

<R05>
Sec. 582.1  Substances that are generally recognized as safe.

    (a) It is impracticable to list all substances that are generally 
recognized as safe for their intended use. However, by way of 
illustration, the Commissioner regards such common food ingredients as 
salt, pepper, sugar, vinegar, baking powder, and monosodium glutamate as 
safe for their intended use. The lists in subparts B through H of this 
part include additional substances that, when used for the purposes 
indicated, in accordance with good manufacturing or feeding practice, 
are regarded by the Commissioner as generally recognized as safe for 
such uses.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, good manufacturing or feeding 
practice shall be defined to include the following restrictions:
    (1) The quantity of a substance added to animal food does not exceed 
the amount reasonably required to accomplish its intended physical, 
nutritional, or other technical effect in food; and
    (2) The quantity of a substance that becomes a component of animal 
food as a result of its use in the manufacturing, processing, or 
packaging of food, and which is not intended to accomplish any physical 
or other technical effect in the food itself, shall be reduced to the 
extent reasonably possible.
    (3) The substance is of appropriate grade and is prepared and 
handled as a food ingredient. Upon request the Commissioner will offer 
an opinion, based on specifications and intended use, as to whether or 
not a particular grade or lot of the substance is of suitable purity for 
use in food and would generally be regarded as safe for the purpose 
intended, by experts qualified to evaluate its safety.
    (c) The inclusion of substances in the list of nutrients does not 
constitute a finding on the part of the Department that the substance is 
useful as a supplement to the diet for animals.
    (d) Substances that are generally recognized as safe for their 
intended use within the meaning of section 409 of the Act are listed in 
subparts B through H of this part. When the status of a substance has 
been reevaluated and affirmed as GRAS or deleted from subparts B through 
H of this part, an appropriate explanation will be noted, e.g., 
``affirmed as GRAS,'' ``food additive regulation,'' ``interim food 
additive regulation,'' or ``prohibited from use in food,'' with a 
reference to the appropriate new regulation. Such notation will apply 
only to the specific use covered by the review, e.g., direct animal food 
use and/or indirect animal food use and/or animal feed use and will not 
affect its status for other uses not specified in the referenced 
regulation, pending a specific review of such other uses.

    (6) Distributor includes persons who distribute or transport feeds 
or feed ingredients intended for animals.
    (7) Ruminant includes any member of the order of animals which has a 
stomach with four chambers (rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum) 
through which feed passes in digestion. The order includes, but is not 
limited to, cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, deer, elk, and antelopes.
    (b) Food additive status. The Food and Drug Administration has 
determined that protein derived from mammalian tissues for use in 
ruminant feed is a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The use or intended use in 
ruminant feed of any material that contains protein derived from 
mammalian tissues causes the feed to be adulterated and in violation of 
the act, unless it is the subject of an effective notice of claimed 
investigational exemption for a food additive under Sec. 570.17 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Requirements for renderers that are not included in paragraph 
(e) of this section. (1) Renderers that manufacture products that 
contain or may contain protein derived from mammalian tissues and that 
are intended for use in animal feed shall take the following measures to 
ensure that materials identified in paragraph (b) of this section are 
not used in the feed of ruminants:
    (i) Label the materials as follows: ``Do not feed to cattle or other 
ruminants''; and
    (ii) Maintain records sufficient to track the materials throughout 
their receipt, processing, and distribution, and make the copies 
available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug 
Administration.
    (2) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be 
exempted from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section if they:
    (i) Use exclusively a manufacturing method that has been validated 
by the Food and Drug Administration to deactivate the agent that causes 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) and whose design has been 
made available to the public;
    (ii) Use routinely a test method that has been validated by the Food 
and Drug Administration to detect the presence of the agent that causes 
TSE's and whose design has been made available to the public. Renderers 
whose products test positive for agents that cause TSE's must comply 
with paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section. Records of the 
test results shall be made available for inspection by the Food and Drug 
Administration; or
    (iii) Use exclusively a method for controlling the manufacturing 
process that minimizes the risk of the TSE agent entering the product 
and whose design has been made available to the public and validated by 
the Food and Drug Administration.
    (3) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be 
exempted from the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section 
if they use a permanent method, approved by FDA, to make a mark 
indicating that the product contains or may contain protein derived from 
mammalian tissue. If the marking is by the use of an agent that cannot 
be detected on visual inspection, the renderer must use an agent whose 
presence can be detected by a method that has been validated by the Food 
and Drug Administration and whose design has been made available to the 
public.
    (d) Requirements for protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and 
distributors that are not included in paragraph (e) of this section. (1) 
Protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors that manufacture, 
blend, process, and distribute products that contain or may contain 
protein derived from mammalian tissues shall comply with paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section.

[[Page 588]]

    (2) Protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors, shall be 
exempt from paragraphs (d)(1) of this section if they:
    (i) Purchase animal products from renderers that certified 
compliance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section or purchase such 
materials from parties that certify that the materials were purchased 
from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section; or
    (ii) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section where appropriate.
    (3) Protein blenders, feed manufacturers, and distributors, shall be 
exempt from paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they:
    (i) Purchase animal protein products that are marked in accordance 
with paragraph (c)(3) of this section or purchase such materials from 
renderers that certified compliance with paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, or purchase such materials from parties that certify that the 
materials were purchased from renderers that certified compliance with 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section; or
    (ii) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section where appropriate.
    (4) Pet food products that are sold or are intended for sale at 
retail and feeds for nonruminant laboratory animals are exempt from the 
labeling requirements in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. 
However, if the pet food products or feeds for nonruminant laboratory 
animals are sold or are intended for sale as distressed or salvage 
items, then such products shall be labeled in accordance with paragraph 
(c) or (d) of this section, as appropriate.
    (5) Copies of certifications as described in paragraphs (d)(2) and 
(d)(3) of this section, shall be made available for inspection and 
copying by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (e) Requirements for persons that intend to separate mammalian and 
nonmammalian materials. (1) Renderers, protein blenders, feed 
manufacturers, distributors, and others that manufacture, process, blend 
and distribute both products that contain or may contain protein derived 
from mammalian tissues or feeds containing such products, and protein 
products from other animal tissues or feeds containing such products, 
and that intend to keep those products separate shall:
    (i) Comply with paragraphs (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section as 
appropriate except that the labeling requirement shall apply only to 
products that contain or may contain protein derived from mammalian 
tissues or feeds containing such products;
    (ii) In the case of a renderer, obtain nonmammalian or pure porcine 
or pure equine materials only from single-species slaughter facilities;
    (iii) Provide for measures to avoid commingling or cross-
contamination;
    (A) Maintain separate equipment or facilities for the manufacture, 
processing, or blending of such materials; or
    (B) Use clean-out procedures or other means adequate to prevent

Sec. 589.2001  Cattle materials prohibited in animal food or feed
to prevent the transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

    (a) Purpose--The purpose of this section is to prohibit the use of 
certain cattle origin materials in the food or feed of all animals to 
further reduce the risk of the spread of bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy (BSE) within the United States.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Cattle materials prohibited in animal feed 
include:
    (i) The entire carcass of BSE-positive cattle;

    (C) Materials as defined in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(iii), 
(b)(1)(iv) (other than mechanically separated beef from the carcass of a 
BSE-positive cattle), and (b)(1)(v) of this section from cattle from a 
country that has been designated under paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) Cattle not inspected and passed for human consumption means 
cattle that did not pass antemortem inspection by the appropriate 
regulatory authority. This term includes nonambulatory disabled cattle. 
Nonambulatory disabled cattle are cattle that cannot rise from a 
recumbent position or that cannot walk, including, but not limited to, 
those with broken appendages, severed tendons or ligaments, nerve 
paralysis, fractured vertebral column, or metabolic conditions.
    (3) Mechanically separated beef means a finely comminuted meat food 
product, resulting from the mechanical separation and removal of most of 
the bone from attached skeletal muscle of cattle carcasses and parts of 
carcasses.
    (4) Renderer means any firm or individual that processes slaughter 
byproducts, animals unfit for human consumption, or meat scraps. The 
term includes persons who collect such materials and subject them to 
minimal processing, or distribute them to firms other than renderers (as 
defined in this paragraph) whose intended use for the products may 
include animal feed, industrial use, or other uses. The term includes 
renderers that also blend animal protein products.
    (5) Tallow means the rendered fat of cattle obtained by pressing or 
by applying any other extraction process to tissues derived directly 
from discrete adipose tissue masses or to other carcass parts and 
tissues.
    (6) Tallow derivative means any product obtained through initial 
hydrolysis, saponification, or trans-esterification of tallow; chemical 
conversion of material obtained by hydrolysis, saponification, or trans-
esterification may be applied to obtain the desired product.
    (c) Requirements. (1) No animal feed or feed ingredient shall be 
manufactured from, processed with, or otherwise contain, cattle 
materials prohibited in animal feed as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section.
    (2) Renderers that receive, manufacture, process, blend, or 
distribute cattle materials prohibited in animal feed as defined in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or products that contain or may 
contain cattle materials prohibited in animal feed, shall take the 
following measures to ensure that materials prohibited as defined in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not introduced into animal feed:
    (i) Exclude from use in animal feed the entire carcass of cattle not 
inspected and passed for human consumption as defined in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section if:
    (A) The brain and spinal cord are not effectively removed from such 
cattle or the brain and spinal cord from such cattle are not otherwise 
effectively excluded from animal feed; and
    (B) Such cattle are 30 months of age or older.
    (ii) If renderers remove brain and spinal cord from cattle not 
inspected and passed for human consumption, or separate such animals 
based on whether or not they are 30 months of age or older, renderers 
must maintain adequate written procedures specifying how these processes 
are carried out.
    (iii) Once cattle materials prohibited in animal feed have been 
separated from other cattle materials, provide for measures to avoid 
cross-contamination;
    (A) Use separate equipment while handling cattle materials 
prohibited in animal feed; or
    (B) Use separate containers that adequately prevent contact with 
animal feed, animal feed ingredients, or equipment surfaces;

[[Page 591]]

    (iv) Label the cattle materials prohibited in animal feed and 
products that contain or may contain cattle materials prohibited in 
animal feed in a conspicuous manner as follows: ``Do not feed to 
animals'';
    (v) Mark the cattle materials prohibited in animal feed and products 
that contain or may contain cattle materials prohibited in animal feed 
with an agent that can be readily detected on visual inspection; and
    (vi) Establish and maintain records sufficient to track cattle 
materials prohibited in animal feed to ensure such material is not 
introduced into animal feed, and make the records available for 
inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (3) Renderers that receive, manufacture, process, blend, or 
distribute any cattle materials shall take the following measures to 
ensure that materials prohibited as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section are not used in animal feed:
    (i) Establish and maintain records sufficient to demonstrate that 
material rendered for use in animal feed was not manufactured from, 
processed with, or does not otherwise contain, cattle materials 
prohibited in animal feed and make copies of all records available for 
inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration. With respect 
to cattle materials obtained from establishments which have segregated 
cattle materials prohibited in animal feed, such records must 
demonstrate that establishments supplying cattle materials to the 
renderers have adequate procedures in place to effectively exclude 
cattle materials prohibited in animal feed; and these records shall be 
considered sufficient to meet this requirement if they include either:
    (A) Certification or other documentation from the supplier that 
material supplied to the renderer does not include cattle materials 
prohibited in animal feed; such certification or documentation is 
acceptable, provided that it includes a description of the segregation 
procedures used, documentation that the supplier confirms that its 
segregation procedures are in place prior to supplying any cattle 
material to the renderer, and records of the renderer's periodic review 
of the suppliers' certification or other documentation; or
    (B) Documentation of another method acceptable to FDA, such as 
third-party certification, for verifying that suppliers have effectively 
excluded cattle materials prohibited in animal feed.
    (ii) Comply with all applicable requirements under Sec. 589.2000 
regarding animal proteins prohibited in ruminant feed.
    (d) Adulteration and misbranding. (1) Failure of a renderer to 
comply with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through 
(c)(2)(iii), (c)(2)(v) and (c)(2)(vi), or (c)(3)(i) of this section will 
render the animal feed or feed ingredients adulterated under section 
402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).
    (2) Animal feed or feed ingredients that are not in compliance with 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section are adulterated under section 
402(a)(2), 402(a)(3), or 402(a)(5) of the act.
    (3) Animal feed or feed ingredients that are not in compliance with 
the labeling requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section are 
misbranded under section 403(a)(1) or 403(f) of the act.
    (4) Failure of a renderer to comply with the requirements in 
paragraph (e) of this section will render the animal feed or feed 
ingredients adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act.
    (e) Inspection; records retention. Records required to be made 
available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug 
Administration, as required by this section, shall be kept for a minimum 
of 1 year.
    (f) Process for designating countries. A country seeking designation 
must send a written request to the Director, Office of the Center 
Director, Center for Veterinary Medicine, at the address designated in 
Sec. 5.1100 of this chapter. The request shall include information 
about that country's BSE case history, risk factors, measures to prevent 
the introduction and transmission of BSE, and any other information 
relevant to determining whether the cattle materials from the requesting 
country do or do not meet the definitions set forth in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section. FDA shall respond in writing to any such request and 
may impose conditions in

[[Page 592]]

granting any such request. Any grant by FDA of such a request under this 
paragraph will be subject to future review by FDA and may be revoked if 
FDA determines that the granted request is no longer appropriate.
