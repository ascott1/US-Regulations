                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2003), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R04>
        Subpart B--Specific Administrative Rulings and Decisions


<R05>
Sec.  500.23  Thermally processed low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers.

    The provisions of part 113 of this chapter shall apply to the 
manufacture, processing or packing of low-acid foods in hermetically 
sealed containers, and intended for use as food for animals.

[61 FR 37681, July 19, 1996]


<R05>
Sec.  500.24  Emergency permit control.

    The provisions of part 108 of this chapter shall apply to the 
issuance of emergency control permits for the manufacturer or packer of 
thermally processed low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed 
containers, and intended for use as food for animals.

[61 FR 37681, July 19, 1996]


<R05>
Sec.  500.25  Anthelmintic drugs for use in animals.

    (a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that, in order 
to assure that anthelmintic drugs, including animal feeds bearing or 
containing such drugs, which do not carry the prescription statement are 
labeled to provide adequate directions for their effective use, labeling 
of these anthelmintic drugs shall bear, in addition to other required 
information, a statement that a veterinarian should be consulted for 
assistance in the diagnosis, treatment, and control of parasitism.
    (b) The label and any labeling furnishing or purporting to furnish 
directions for use, shall bear conspicuously the following statement: 
``Consult your veterinarian for assistance in the diagnosis, treatment, 
and control of parasitism.''

[[Page 6]]

    (c) For drugs covered by approved new animal drug applications, the 
labeling revisions required for compliance with this section may be 
placed into effect without prior approval as provided for in Sec.  514.8 
(d) and (e) of this chapter. For animal feeds bearing or containing 
anthelmintic drugs covered by approved applications, the labeling 
revisions required for compliance with this section may be placed into 
effect without the submission of supplemental applications as provided 
for in Sec.  514.9 of this chapter.
    (d) Labeling revisions required for compliance with this section 
shall be placed into effect by February 25, 1975, following which, any 
such drugs that are introduced into interstate commerce and not in 
compliance with this section will be subject to regulatory proceedings.


<R05>
Sec.  500.26  Timed-release dosage form drugs.

    (a) Drugs are being offered in dosage forms that are designed to 
release the active ingredients over a prolonged period of time. There is 
a possibility of unsafe overdosage or ineffective dosage if such 
products are improperly made and the active ingredients are released at 
one time, over too short or too long a period of time, or not released 
at all. Drugs marketed in this form, which are referred to by such terms 
as timed-release, controlled-release, prolonged-release, sustained-
release, or delayed-release drugs, are regarded as new animal drugs 
within the meaning of section 201(v) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act.
    (b) Timed-release dosage form animal drugs that are introduced into 
interstate commerce are deemed to be adulterated within the meaning of 
section 501(a)(5) of the act and subject to regulatory action unless 
such animal drug is the subject of an approved new animal drug 
application as required by paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The fact that the labeling of this kind of drug may claim 
delayed, prolonged, controlled, or sustained-release of all or only some 
of the active ingredients does not affect the new animal drug status of 
such articles. A new animal drug application is required in any such 
case.
    (d) New animal drug applications for timed-release dosage form 
animal drugs must contain, among other things, data to demonstrate 
safety and effectiveness by establishing that the article is 
manufactured using procedures and controls to ensure release of the 
total dosage at a safe and effective rate. Data submitted in the new 
animal drug application must demonstrate that the formulation of the 
drug and the procedures used in its manufacture will ensure release of 
the active ingredient(s) of the drug at a safe and effective rate and 
that these release characteristics will be maintained until the 
expiration date of the drug. When the drug is intended for use in food-
producing animals, data submitted must also demonstrate that, with 
respect to possible residues of the drug, food derived from treated 
animals is safe for consumption.

[42 FR 8635, Feb. 11, 1977, as amended at 60 FR 38480, July 27, 1995]


<R05>
Sec.  500.27  Methylene blue-containing drugs for use in animals.

    (a) New information requires a re- evaluation of the status of drugs 
containing methylene blue (tetramethylthionine chloride) for oral use in 
cats or dogs.
    (1)(i) It has been demonstrated that two orally administered urinary 
antiseptic-antispasmodic preparations that contained methylene blue 
cause Heinz body hemolytic anemia in cats when used according to label 
directions. The specific cause of the reaction was determined to be the 
methylene blue contained in the preparations. The reaction can be severe 
enough to cause death of treated animals.
    (ii) The Heinz body hemolytic anemia reaction to methylene blue has 
also been demonstrated in dogs under laboratory conditions. The precise 
mechanism by which methylene blue produces the characteristic 
erythrocytic inclusion bodies (Heinz bodies) and associated hemolytic 
anemia is unclear.
    (2) The effectiveness of orally administered methylene blue as a 
urinary antiseptic is open to question. It appears that following oral 
administration, methylene blue is poorly and erratically absorbed and 
also slowly and erratically excreted in the urine. Studies

[[Page 7]]

in the dog indicate it is excreted in the urine essentially as 
leukomethylene blue stabilized in some manner. Methylene blue itself is 
stepwise demethylated in alkaline solutions (alkaline urine being a 
frequent consequence of urinary infection) to Azure B, Azure A, and 
Azure C. The antiseptic efficacy of all of these excretion products is 
unsubstantiated.
    (3) In view of the foregoing, the Commissioner has concluded that 
animal drugs containing methylene blue for oral use in cats or dogs are 
neither safe nor generally recognized as effective within the meaning of 
section 201(v) of the act and are therefore considered new animal drugs. 
Accordingly, all prior formal and informal opinions expressed by the 
Food and Drug Administration that such drugs are ``not new drugs'' or 
``no longer new drugs'' are hereby revoked.
    (b) Animal drugs that contain methylene blue for oral use in cats or 
dogs and not the subject of an approved new animal drug application

501(a) (5) and/or (6) and/or misbranded under section 502(a) of the act

Sec.  500.29  Gentian violet for use in animal feed.

    The Food and Drug Administration has determined that gentian violet 
is not generally recognized as safe for use in animal feed and is a food 
additive subject to section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (the act), unless it is intended for use as a new animal drug, in 
which case it is subject to section 512 of the act. The Food and Drug 
Administration has determined that gentian violet is not prior 
sanctioned for any use in animal feed.

Sec.  500.30  Gentian violet for animal drug use.

    The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that gentian 
violet is not generally recognized as safe and effective for any 
veterinary drug use in food animals and is a new animal drug subject to 
section 512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. FDA has 
determined that gentian violet is not exempted from new animal drug 
status under the ``grandfather'' provisions of the Drug Amendments of 
1962 (21 U.S.C. 342).

Sec.  500.35  Animal feeds contaminated with Salmonella microorganisms.

    (a) Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers 
for Disease Control of the U.S. Public Health Service, the Animal Health 
Division of the Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, and by various State public health agencies have revealed 
that processed fish meal, poultry meal, meat meal, tankage, and other 
animal byproducts intended for use in animal feed may be contaminated 
with Salmonella bacteria, an organism pathogenic to man and animals. 
Contamination of these products may occur through inadequate heat 
treatment of the product during its processing or through 
recontamination of the heat-treated product during a time of improper 
storage or handling subsequent to processing.
    (b) Articles used in food for animals are included within the 
definition of

[[Page 8]]

food in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. 
Further, Salmonella contamination of such animal feeds having the 
potentiality for producing infection and disease in animals must be 
regarded as an adulterant within the meaning of section 402(a) of the 
act. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration will regard as 
adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a) of the act shipments of 
the following when intended for animal feed and encountered in 
interstate commerce and found upon examination to be contaminated with 
Salmonella microorganisms: Bone meal, blood meal, crab meal, feather 
meal, fish meal, fish solubles, meat scraps, poultry meat meal, tankage, 
or other similar animal byproducts, or blended mixtures of these.

<R05>
Sec.  500.45  Use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in the production, handling, and storage of animal feed.

    (a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) represent a class of toxic 
industrial chemicals manufactured and sold under a variety of trade 
names, including: Aroclor (United States); Phenoclor (France); Colphen 
(Germany); and Kanaclor (Japan). PCB's are highly stable, heat 
resistant, and nonflammable chemicals. Industrial uses of PCB's include, 
or did include in the past, their use as electrical transformer and 
capacitor fluids, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic fluids, plasticizers, 
and in formulations of lubricants, coatings, and inks. Their unique 
physical and chemical properties and widespread, uncontrolled industrial 
applications have caused PCB's to be a persistent and ubiquitous 
contaminant in the environment, causing the contamination of certain 
foods. In addition, incidents have occurred in which PCB's have directly 
contaminated animal feeds as a result of industrial accidents (leakage 
or spillage of PCB fluids from plant equipment). These accidents in turn 
cause the contamination of food intended for human consumption (meat, 
milk, and eggs). Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration have 
revealed that heat exchange fluids for certain pasteurization equipment 
used in processing animal feed contain PCB's. Although heat exchange 
fluids in such equipment are considered to be in closed systems, leakage 
has occurred that resulted in direct contamination of animal feed with 
PCB's and subsequently resulted in the transfer of PCB's to human food 
produced by animals consuming the contaminated feed. The use of PCB-
containing coatings on the inner walls of silos has resulted in the 
contamination of silage which has in turn caused PCB residues in the 
milk of dairy cows consuming the contaminated silage. Since PCB's are 
toxic chemicals, the PCB contamination of food as a result of these and 
other incidents represent a hazard to public health. It is therefore 
necessary to place certain restrictions on the industrial uses of PCB's 
in the production, handling, and storage of animal feed.
    (b) The following special provisions are necessary to preclude 
accidental PCB contamination of animal feed:
    (1) Coatings or paints for use on the contact surfaces of feed 
storage areas may not contain PCB's or any other harmful or deleterious 
substances likely to contaminate feed.
    (2) New equipment or machinery for handling or processing feed in or 
around an establishment producing animal feed shall not contain PCB's.
    (3) On or before Sept. 4, 1973, the management of establishments 
producing animal feed shall:
    (i) Have the heat exchange fluid used in existing equipment or 
machinery for handling and processing feed sampled and tested to 
determine whether it contains PCB's, or verify the absence of PCB's in 
such formulations by other appropriate means. On or before Sept. 4, 
1973, any such fluid formulated with PCB's must to the fullest extent 
possible commensurate with current good manufacturing practices, be 
replaced with a heat exchange fluid that does not contain PCB's.
    (ii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with 
current good manufacturing practices from the animal feed producing 
establishment any PCB-containing lubricants for equipment or machinery 
used for handling or processing animal feed.

[[Page 9]]

    (iii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with 
current good manufacturing practices from the animal feed producing 
establishment any other PCB-containing materials, whenever there is a 
reasonable expectation that such materials could cause animal feed to 
become contaminated with PCB's either as a result of normal use or as a 
result of accident, breakage, or other mishap.
    (iv) The toxicity and other characteristics of fluids selected as 
PCB replacements must be adequately determined so that the least 
potentially hazardous replacement should be used. In making this 
determination with respect to a given fluid, consideration should be 
given to (a) its toxicity; (b) the maximum quantity that could be 
spilled onto a given quantity of food before it would be noticed, taking 
into account its color and odor; (c) possible signaling devices in the 
equipment to indicate a loss of fluid, etc.; (d) and its environmental 
stability and tendency to survive and be concentrated through the food 
chain. The judgment as to whether a replacement fluid is sufficiently 
non-hazardous is to be made on an individual installation and operation 
basis.
    (c) For the purpose of this section, the provisions do not apply to 
electrical transformers and condensers containing PCB's in sealed 
containers.
    (d) For the purpose of this section, the term animal feed includes 
all articles used for food or drink for animals other than man.

Sec.  500.46  Hexachlorophene in animal drugs.

    (a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has determined that there are 
no adequate data to establish that animal drugs containing 
hexachlorophene are safe and effective for any animal use other than in 
topical products for use on non-food-producing animals as part of a 
product preservative system at a level not to exceed 0.1 percent; that 
there is no information on the potential risk to humans from exposure to 
hexachlorophene by persons who apply animal products containing the drug 
at levels higher than 0.1 percent; and that there is likewise no 
information on human exposure to animals on which these animal drugs 
have been used and no information on possible residues of 
hexachlorophene in edible products of food-producing animals treated 
with new animal drugs that contain any quantity of hexachlorophene.
    (b) Animal drugs containing hexachlorophene for other than 
preservative use on non-food-producing animals at levels not exceeding 
0.1 percent are considered new animal drugs and shall be the subject of 
new animal drug applications (NADA's).
    (c) Any person currently marketing animal drugs that contain 
hexachlorophene other than as part of a product preservative system for 
products used on non-food-producing animals at a level not exceeding 0.1 
percent shall submit a new animal drug application, supplement an 
existing application, or reformulate the product by September 29, 1977. 
Each application or supplemental application shall include adequate data 
to establish that the animal drug is safe and effective. If the animal 
drug is currently subject to an approved new animal drug application, 
each reformulation shall require an approved supplemental application. 
The interim marketing of these animal drugs may continue until the 
application has been approved, until it has been determined that the 
application is not approvable under the provisions of Sec.  514.111 of 
this chapter, or until an existing approved application has been 
withdrawn.
    (d) After September 29, 1977, animal drugs that contain 
hexachlorophene other than for preservative use on non-food-producing 
animals at a level not exceeding 0.1 percent that are introduced into 
interstate commerce shall be deemed to be adulterated within the meaning 
of section 501(a)(5) of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5)) unless such animal 
drug is the subject of a new animal drug application submitted pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section. Action to withdraw approval of new 
animal drug applications will be initiated if supplemental new animal 
drug applications have not been submitted in accordance with this 
section.
    (e) New animal drug applications submitted for animal drugs 
containing hexachlorophene for use in or on food-

[[Page 10]]

producing animals shall include adequate data to assure that edible 
products from treated animals are safe for human consumption under the 
labeled conditions of use.

<R05>
Sec.  500.51  Labeling of animal drugs; misbranding.

    (a) Among the representations on the label or labeling of an animal 
drug which will render the drug misbranded are any broad statements 
suggesting or implying that the drug is not safe and effective for use 
when used in accordance with labeling direction, or suggesting or 
implying that the labeling does not contain adequate warnings or 
adequate directions for use. Such statements include, but are not 
limited to:
    (1) Any statement that disclaims liability when the drug is used in 
accordance with directions for use contained on the label or labeling.
    (2) Any statement that disclaims liability when the drug is used 
under ``abnormal'' or ``unforeseeable'' conditions.
    (3) Any statement limiting the warranty for the products to a 
warranty that the drug in the package contains the ingredients listed on 
the label.
    (b) This regulation is not intended to prohibit any liability 
disclaimer that purports to limit the amount of damages or that sets 
forth the legal theory under which damages are to be recovered.
    (c) Any person wishing to obtain an evaluation of an animal drug 
liability disclaimer under this regulation may submit it to Division of 
Compliance, (HFV-230), Center for Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug 
Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855. A supplemental 
NADA providing appropriately revised labeling shall be submitted for any 
approved new animal drug the labeling of which is not in compliance with 
this regulation.

FR 6475, Feb. 25, 1992]


<R05>
Sec.  500.52  Use of terms such as ``tonic'', ``tone'', ``toner'', or ``conditioner'' in the labeling of preparations intended for use in or on animals.

    (a) The use of terms such as tonic, tone, toner, and similar terms 
in the labeling of a product intended for use in or on animals implies 
that such product is capable of a therapeutic effect(s) and causes such 
a product to be a drug within the meaning of section 201(g) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The unqualified use of such terms 
in a product's labeling fails to provide adequate directions and 
indications for use of such product and causes it to be misbranded 
within the meaning of section 502(a) and (f)(1) of the act. The terms 
tonic, tone, toner, and similar terms may be used in labeling only when 
appropriately qualified so as to fully inform the user regarding the 
intended use(s) of the product.
    (b) The unqualified use of the term conditioner and similar terms in 
the labeling of a product intended for use in or on animals implies that 
such product is capable of a therapeutic effect(s) and causes such a 
product to be a drug within the meaning of section 201(g) of the act. 
The unqualified use of such terms in a product's labeling fails to 
provide adequate directions and indications for use of such product and 
causes it to be misbranded within the meaning of section 502(a) and 
(f)(1) of the act. The term conditioner and similar terms may be used in 
labeling only when appropriately qualified so as to fully inform the 
user regarding the intended use(s) of the product. A product labeled as 
a ``conditioner'' or with a similar term can be either a food or drug 
depending upon the manner in

[[Page 11]]

which the term is qualified in the labeling to reflect the product's 
intended use.
    (c) An article so qualified as to be represented as a drug must be 
the subject of an approved new animal drug application unless the use of 
the article under the conditions set forth in its labeling is generally 
recognized as safe and effective among experts qualified by scientific 
training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 
animal drugs.


<R05>
Sec.  500.55  Exemption from certain drug-labeling requirements.

    (a) Section 201.105(c) of this chapter provides that in the case of 
certain drugs for which directions, hazards, warnings, and use 
information are commonly known to practitioners licensed by law, such 
information may be omitted from the dispensing package. Under this 
proviso, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will offer an opinion, upon 
written request, stating reasonable grounds therefore on a proposal to 
omit such information from the dispensing package.
    (b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has considered submitted 
material covering a number of drug products and has offered the opinion 
that the following drugs when intended for those veterinary uses for 
which they are now generally employed by the veterinary medical 
profession, should be exempt from the requirements of Sec.  201.105(c) 
of this chapter, provided that they meet the conditions prescribed in 
this paragraph. Preparations that are not in dosage unit form (for 
example, solutions) will be regarded as meeting the conditions with 
respect to the maximum quantity of drug per dosage unit if they are 
prepared in a manner that enables accurate and ready administration of a 
quantity of drug not in excess of the stated maximum per dosage unit:

Atropine sulfate. As an injectable for cattle, goats, horses, pigs, and 
sheep, not in excess of 15 milligrams per dosage unit; as an injectable 
for cats and dogs, not in excess of 0.6 milligram per dosage unit.
Barbital sodium. For oral use in cats and dogs, not in excess of 300 
milligrams per dosage unit.
Epinephrine injection. 1:1,000. For cats, dogs, cattle, goats, horses, 
pigs, and sheep (except as provided in Sec.  500.65).
Morphine sulfate. As an injectable for dogs, not in excess of 15 
milligrams per dosage unit.
Pentobarbital sodium. For oral use in cats and dogs, not in excess of 
100 milligrams per dosage unit.
Phenobarbital sodium. For oral use in cats and dogs, not in excess of 
100 milligrams per dosage unit.
Procaine hydrochloride injection. Containing not in excess of 2 percent 
procaine hydrochloride, with or without epinephrine up to a 
concentration of 1:50,000. For use in cats, dogs, cattle, goats, horses, 
pigs, and sheep.
Thyroid. For oral use in dogs, not in excess of 60 milligrams per dosage 
unit.

<R05>
Sec.  500.65  Epinephrine injection 1:1,000 in 10-milliliter containers for emergency treatment of anaphylactoid shock in cattle, horses, sheep, and swine.

    (a) Anaphylactoid reactions in cattle, horses, sheep, and swine 
occur occasionally from the injection of antibiotics, bacterins, and 
vaccines. Adequate directions for use of these antibiotics, bacterins, 
and vaccines can generally be written for use by the laity and thus are 
available to livestock producers. Epinephrine injection is effective for 
the treatment of anaphylactoid reactions in animals and would be of 
value in saving lives of animals if it were readily available at the 
time of administration of the causative agents. In connection with this 
problem the Food and Drug Administration has obtained the views of the 
Advisory Committee on Veterinary Medicine, and other experts, and has 
concluded that adequate directions for over-the-counter sale of 
epinephrine injection 1:1,000 can be prepared.
    (b) In view of the above, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs has 
concluded that it is in the public interest to make epinephrine 
injection 1:1,000 available for sale without a prescription provided 
that it is packaged in vials not exceeding 10 milliliters and its label 
bears, in addition to other required information, the following 
statements in a prominent and conspicuous manner: ``For emergency use 
only in treating

[[Page 12]]

anaphylactoid shock. Usual Dosage: Cattle, horses, sheep, and swine--1 
cubic centimeter per 100 pounds of body weight. Inject subcutaneously''.
    (c) The labeling must also bear a description of the symptoms of 
anaphylactoid shock including glassy eyes, increased salivation, 
grinding of the teeth, rapid breathing, muscular tremors, staggering 
gait, and collapse with death following. These symptoms may appear 
shortly after injection of a bacterin, vaccine, or antibiotic.

<R05>
Sec.  500.80  Scope of this subpart.

    (a) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires that sponsored 
compounds intended for use in food-producing animals be shown to be safe 
and that food produced from animals exposed to these compounds be shown 
to be safe for consumption by people. The statute prohibits the use in 
food-producing animals of any compound found to induce cancer when 
ingested by people or animals unless it can be determined by methods of 
examination prescribed or approved by the Secretary (a function 
delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs under Sec.  5.10 of this 
chapter) that no residue of that compound will be found in the food 
produced from those animals under conditions of use reasonably certain 
to be followed in practice. This subpart identifies the steps a sponsor 
of a compound shall follow to secure the approval of the compound. FDA 
guidance documents contain the procedures and protocols FDA recommends 
for the implementation of this subpart. These guidance documents are 
available from the Dockets Management Branch (HFA-305), Food and Drug 
Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. 
Requests for these guidance documents should be identified with Docket 
No. 83D-0288.
    (b) If FDA concludes on the basis of the threshold assessment that a 
sponsor shall conduct carcinogenicity testing on the sponsored compound, 
FDA will also determine whether and to what extent the sponsor shall 
conduct carcinogenicity testing on metabolites of the sponsored 
compound. The bioassays that a sponsor conducts must be designed to 
assess carcinogenicity and to determine the quantitative aspects of any 
carcinogenic response.
    (c) If FDA concludes on the basis of the threshold assessment or at 
a later time during the approval process that the data show that the 
sponsored compound and its metabolites should not be subject to this 
subpart, FDA will continue to consider the compound for approval under 
the general safety provisions of the act for risks other than cancer.
    (d) This subpart does not apply to essential nutrients.

Sec.  500.82  Definitions.

    (a) The definitions and interpretations contained in section 201 of 
the act apply to those terms when used in this subpart.
    (b) The following definitions apply to this subpart:
    Act means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sections 201-
901, 52 Stat. 1040 et seq. as amended (21 U.S.C. 301-392)).
    Essential nutrients means compounds that are found in the tissues of 
untreated, healthy target animals and not produced in sufficient 
quantity to support the animal's growth, development, function, or 
reproduction, e.g., vitamins, essential minerals, essential amino acids, 
and essential fatty acids. These compounds must be supplied from 
external sources.
    FDA means the Food and Drug Administration.
    Limit of detection (LOD) means the lowest concentration of analyte 
that can be confirmed by the approved regulatory method.
    Marker residue means the residue selected for assay whose 
concentration is in a known relationship to the concentration of the 
residue of carcinogenic concern in the last tissue to deplete to its 
S<INF>m</INF>.

[[Page 13]]

    Preslaughter withdrawal period or milk discard time means the time 
after cessation of administration of the sponsored compound at which no 
residue is detectable in the edible product using the approved 
regulatory method (i.e., the marker residue is below the LOD).
    Regulatory method means the aggregate of all experimental procedures 
for measuring and confirming the presence of the marker residue of the 
sponsored compound in the target tissue of the target animal.
    R<INF>m</INF> means the concentration of the marker residue in the 
target tissue when the residue of carcinogenic concern is equal to 
S<INF>m</INF>.
    Residue means any compound present in edible tissues of the target 
animal which results from the use of the sponsored compound, including 
the sponsored compound, its metabolites, and any other substances formed 
in or on food because of the sponsored compound's use.
    Residue of carcinogenic concern means all compounds in the total 
residue of a demonstrated carcinogen excluding any compounds judged by 
FDA not to present a carcinogenic risk.
    S<INF>m</INF> means the concentration of residue in a specific 
edible tissue corresponding to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in the 
test animals of 1 in 1 million.
    S<INF>o</INF> means the concentration of the test compound in the 
total diet of test animals that corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk 
of cancer in the test animals of 1 in 1 million. For the purpose of this 
subpart, FDA will also assume that this S<INF>o</INF> will correspond to 
the concentration of residue of carcinogenic concern in the total human 
diet that represents no significant increase in the risk of cancer to 
people.
    Sponsor means the person or organization proposing or holding an 
approval by FDA for the use of a sponsored compound.
    Sponsored compound means any drug or food additive or color additive 
proposed for use, or used, in food-producing animals or in their feed.
    Target animals means the production class of animals in which a 
sponsored compound is proposed or intended for use.
    Target tissue means the edible tissue selected to monitor for 
residues in the target animals, including, where appropriate, milk or 
eggs.
    Test animals means the species selected for use in the toxicity 
tests.
    Threshold assessment means FDA's review of data and information 
about a sponsored compound to determine whether chronic bioassays in 
test animals are necessary to resolve questions concerning the 
carcinogenicity of the compound.

[52 FR 49586, Dec. 31, 1987, as amended at 67 FR 78174, Dec. 23, 2002]


<R05>
Sec.  500.84  Conditions for approval of the sponsored compound.

    (a) On the basis of the results of the chronic bioassays and other 
information, FDA will determine whether any of the substances tested are 
carcinogenic.
    (b) If FDA concludes that the results of the bioassays do not 
establish carcinogenicity, then FDA will not subject the sponsored 
compound to the remainder of the requirements of this subpart.
    (c) For each sponsored compound that FDA decides should be regulated 
as a carcinogen, FDA will analyze the data from the bioassays using a 
statistical extrapolation procedure.
    (1) For each substance tested in separate bioassays, FDA will 
calculate the concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern that 
corresponds to a maximum lifetime risk to the test animal of 1 in 1 
million. FDA will designate the lowest value obtained as S<INF>o</INF>. 
Because the total diet is not derived from food-producing animals, FDA 
will make corrections for food intake. FDA will designate as 
S<INF>m</INF> the concentration of residue in a specific edible tissue 
corresponding to a maximum lifetime risk of cancer in test animals of 1 
in 1 million.
    (2) From the appropriate residue chemistry data FDA will calculate 
the R<INF>m</INF> as described in Sec.  500.86(c). The sponsor must 
provide a regulatory method in accordance with Sec.  500.88(b). FDA will 
calculate the LOD of the method from data submitted by the sponsor under 
Sec.  500.88. The LOD must be less than or equal to R<INF>m</INF>.

[[Page 14]]

    (3) FDA will conclude that the provisions of this subpart are 
satisfied when no residue of the compound is detectable (that is, the 
marker residue is below the LOD) using the approved regulatory method 
under the conditions of use of the sponsored compound, including any 
required preslaughter withdrawal period or milk discard time.

[52 FR 49586, Dec. 31, 1987, as amended at 67 FR 78174, Dec. 23, 2002]


<R05>
Sec.  500.86  Marker residue and target tissue.

    (a) For each edible tissue, the sponsor shall measure the depletion 
of the residue of carcinogenic concern until its concentration is at or 
below S<INF>m</INF>.
    (b) In one or more edible tissues, the sponsor shall also measure 
the depletion of one or more potential marker residues until the 
concentration of the residue of carcinogenic concern is at or below 
S<INF>m</INF>.
    (c) From these data, FDA will select a target tissue and a marker 
residue and designate the concentration of marker residue 
(R<INF>m</INF>) that the regulatory method must be capable of measuring 
in the target tissue. FDA will select R<INF>m</INF> such that the 
absence of the marker residue in the target tissue above R<INF>m</INF> 
can be taken as confirmation that the residue of carcinogenic concern 
does not exceed S<INF>m</INF> in each of the edible tissues and, 
therefore, that the residue of carcinogenic concern in the diet of 
people does not exceed S<INF>o</INF>.
    (d) When a compound is to be used in milk- or egg-producing animals, 
milk or eggs must be the target tissue in addition to the tissue 
selected to monitor for residues in the edible carcass.

Sec.  500.88  Regulatory method.

    (a) The sponsor shall submit for evaluation and validation a 
regulatory method developed to monitor compliance with FDA's operational 
definition of no residue.
    (b) The regulatory method must be able to confirm the identity of 
the marker residue in the target tissue at a minimum concentration 
corresponding to the R<INF>m</INF>. FDA will determine the LOD from the 
submitted analytical method validation data.
    (c) FDA will publish in the Federal Register the complete regulatory 
method for ascertaining the marker residue in the target tissue in 
accordance with the provisions of sections 409(c)(3)(A), 512(d)(1)(I), 
and 721(b)(5)(B) of the act.

Sec.  500.90  Waiver of requirements.

    In response to a petition or on the Commissioner's own initiative, 
the Commissioner may waive, in whole or in part, the requirements of 
this subpart except those provided under Sec.  500.88. A petition for 
this waiver may be filed by any person who would be adversely affected 
by the application of the requirements to a particular compound. The 
petition shall explain and document why the requirements from which a 
waiver is requested are not reasonably applicable to the compound, and 
set forth clearly the reasons why the alternative procedures will 
provide the basis for concluding that approval of the compound satisfies 
the requirements of the anticancer provisions of the act. If the 
Commissioner determines that waiver of any of the requirements of this 
subpart is appropriate, the Commissioner will state the basis for that 
determination in the regulation approving marketing of the sponsored 
compound.

Sec.  500.92  Implementation.

    (a) This subpart E applies to all new animal drug applications, food 
additive petitions, and color additive petitions concerning any compound 
intended for use in food-producing animals (including supplemental 
applications and amendments to petitions).
    (b) This subpart E also applies in the following manner to compounds 
already approved:
    (1) For those compounds that FDA determines may induce cancer when 
ingested by man or animals, i.e., suspect

[[Page 15]]

carcinogens, Sec. Sec.  500.80(b), 500.82, and 500.90 apply.
    (2) For those compounds that FDA determines have been shown to 
induce cancer when ingested by man or animals, Sec. Sec.  500.82 through 
500.90 apply.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec.  501.1  Principal display panel of package form animal food.

    The term principal display panel as it applies to food in package 
form and as used in this part, means the part of a label that is most 
likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary 
conditions of display for retail sale. The principal display panel shall 
be large enough to accommodate all the mandatory label information 
required to be placed thereon by this part with clarity and 
conspicuousness and without obscuring design, vignettes, or crowding. 
Where packages bear alternate principal display panels, information 
required to be placed on the principal display panel shall be duplicated 
on each principal display panel. For the purpose of obtaining uniform 
type size in declaring the quantity of contents for all packages of 
substantially the same size, the term area of the principal display 
panel means the area of the side or surface that bears the principal 
display panel, which area shall be:
    (a) In the case of a rectangular package where one entire side 
properly can be considered to be the principal display panel side, the 
product of the height times the width of that side;
    (b) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container, 40 
percent of the product of the height of the container times the 
circumference;
    (c) In the case of any otherwise shaped container, 40 percent of the 
total surface of the container: Provided, however, That where such 
container presents an obvious principal display panel such as the top of 
a triangular or circular package, the area shall consist of the entire 
top surface. In determining the area of the principal display panel, 
exclude tops, bottoms, flanges at tops and bottoms of cans, and 
shoulders and necks of bottles or jars. In the case of cylindrical or 
nearly cylindrical containers, information required by this part to 
appear on the principal display panel shall appear within that 40 
percent of the circumference which is most likely to be displayed, 
presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for 
retail sale.

<R05>
Sec.  501.2  Information panel of package for animal food.

    (a) The term information panel as it applies to packaged food means 
that part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right of the 
principal display panel as observed by an individual facing the 
principal display panel with the following exceptions:
    (1) If the part of the label immediately contiguous and to the right 
of the principal display panel is too small to accommodate the necessary 
information or is otherwise unusable label space, e.g., folded flaps or 
can ends, the panel immediately contiguous and to the right of this part 
of the label may be used.
    (2) If the package has one or more alternate principal display 
panels, the information panel is immediately contiguous and to the right 
of any principal display panel.
    (3) If the top of the container is the principal display panel and 
the package has no alternate principal display panel, the information 
panel is any panel adjacent to the principal display panel.
    (b) All information required to appear on the label of any package 
of food pursuant to Sec. Sec.  501.4, 501.5, 501.8 and 501.17 shall 
appear either on the principal display panel or on the information 
panel, unless otherwise specified by regulations in this chapter.
    (c) All information appearing on the principal display panel or the 
information panel pursuant to this section shall appear prominently and 
conspicuously, but in no case may the letters and/or numbers be less 
than \1/16\ inch in height unless an exemption pursuant to paragraph (f) 
of this section is established. The requirements for conspicuousness and 
legibility shall include the specifications of Sec. Sec.  501.15 and 
501.105(h) (1) and (2).
    (1) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of 
this paragraph: Provided, That:
    (i) The package is designed such that it has a surface area that can 
bear an information panel and/or an alternate principal display panel.
    (ii) The area of surface available for labeling on the principal 
display panel of the package as this term is defined in Sec.  501.1 is 
less than 10 square inches.
    (iii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in 
accordance with regulations in this part.
    (iv) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section 
appears on the principal display panel or information panel label in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the 
type size is not less than \3/64\ inch in height.
    (2) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of 
this paragraph: Provided, That:
    (i) The package is designed such that it has a single obvious 
principal display panel as this term is defined in Sec.  501.1 and has 
no other available surface area for an information panel or alternate 
principal display panel.
    (ii) The area of surface available for labeling on the principal 
display panel of the package as this term is defined in Sec.  501.1 is 
less than 12 square inches and bears all labeling appearing on the 
package.
    (iii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in 
accordance with regulations in this part.
    (iv) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section 
appears on the single, obvious principal display panel in accordance 
with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the type size is 
not less than \1/32\ inch in height.
    (3) Packaged foods are exempt from the type size requirements of 
this paragraph: Provided, That:
    (i) The package is designed such that it has a total surface area 
available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches.
    (ii) The label information includes a full list of ingredients in 
accordance with regulations in this part.
    (iii) The information required by paragraph (b) of this section 
appears on the principal display panel or information panel label in 
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (c) except that the 
type size is not less than \1/32\ inch in height.
    (d) All information required to appear on the principal display 
panel or on the information panel pursuant to this section shall appear 
on the same panel unless there is insufficient space. In determining the 
sufficiency of the available space, any vignettes, design,

[[Page 17]]

and other nonmandatory label information shall not be considered. If 
there is insufficient space for all of this information to appear on a 
single panel, it may be divided between these two panels except that the 
information required pursuant to any given section or part shall all 
appear on the same panel. A food whose label is required to bear the 
ingredient statement on the principal display panel may bear all other 
information specified in paragraph (b) of this section on the 
information panel.
    (e) All information appearing on the information panel pursuant to 
this section shall appear in one place without other intervening 
material.
    (f) If the label of any package of food is too small to accommodate 
all of the information required by Sec. Sec.  501.4, 501.5, 501.8, and 
501.17, the Commissioner may establish by regulation an acceptable 
alternative method of disseminating such information to the public, 
e.g., a type size smaller than one-sixteenth inch in height, or labeling 
attached to or inserted in the package or available at the point of 
purchase. A petition requesting such a regulation, as an amendment to 
this paragraph shall be submitted pursuant to part 10 of this chapter.

[41 FR 38619, Sept. 10, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 4716, Jan. 25, 1977;

<R05>
Sec.  501.3  Identity labeling of animal food in package form.

    (a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear 
as one of its principal features a statement of the identity of the 
commodity.
    (b) Such statement of identity shall be in terms of:
    (1) The name now or hereafter specified in or required by any 
applicable Federal law or regulation; or, in the absence thereof,
    (2) The common or usual name of the food; or, in the absence 
thereof,
    (3) An appropriately descriptive term, or when the nature of the 
food is obvious, a fanciful name commonly used by the public for such 
food.
    (c) Where a food is marketed in various optional forms (whole, 
slices, diced, etc.), the particular form shall be considered to be a 
necessary part of the statement of identity and shall be declared in 
letters of a type size bearing a reasonable relation to the size of the 
letters forming the other components of the statement of identity; 
except that if the optional form is visible through the container or is 
depicted by an appropriate vignette, the particular form need not be 
included in the statement. This specification does not affect the 
required declarations of identity under definitions and standards for 
foods promulgated pursuant to section 401 of the act.
    (d) This statement of identity shall be presented in bold type on 
the principal display panel, shall be in a size reasonably related to 
the most prominent printed matter on such panel, and shall be in lines 
generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is 
designed to be displayed.
    (e) Under the provisions of section 403(c) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is 
an imitation of another food unless its label bears, in type of uniform 
size and prominence, the word imitation and, immediately thereafter, the 
name of the food imitated.
    (1) A food shall be deemed to be an imitation and thus subject to 
the requirements of section 403(c) of the act if it is a substitute for 
and resembles another food but is nutritionally inferior to that food.
    (2) A food that is a substitute for and resembles another food shall 
not be deemed to be an imitation provided it meets each of the following 
requirements:
    (i) It is not nutritionally inferior to the food for which it 
substitutes and which it resembles.
    (ii) Its label bears a common or usual name that complies with the 
provisions of Sec.  502.5 of this chapter and that is not false or 
misleading, or in the absence of an existing common or usual name, an 
appropriately descriptive term that is not false or misleading. The 
label may, in addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or 
misleading.
    (3) A food for which a common or usual name is established by 
regulation (e.g., in a standard of identity pursuant to section 401 of 
the act, in a common or usual name regulation and may, in

[[Page 18]]

addition, bear a fanciful name which is not false or misleading, and 
established pursuant to part 502 of this chapter), and which complies 
with all of the applicable requirements of such regulation(s), shall not 
be deemed to be an imitation.
    (4) Nutritional inferiority includes:
    (i) Any reduction in the content of an essential nutrient that is 
present in a measurable amount.
    (ii) If the Commissioner concludes that a food is a substitute for 
and resembles another food but is inferior to the food imitated for 
reasons other than those set forth in this paragraph, he may propose 
appropriate revisions to this regulation or he may propose a separate 
regulation governing the particular food.
    (f) A label may be required to bear the percentage(s) of a 
characterizing ingredient(s) or information concerning the presence or 
absence of an ingredient(s) or the need to add an ingredient(s) as part 
of the common or usual name of the food pursuant to part 502 of this 
chapter.

<R05>
Sec.  501.4  Animal food; designation of ingredients.

    (a) Ingredients required to be declared on the label of a food, 
including foods that comply with standards of identity that require 
labeling in compliance with this part 501, except those exempted by 
Sec.  501.100, shall be listed by common or usual name in descending 
order of predominance by weight on either the principal display panel or 
the information panel in accordance with the provisions of Sec.  501.2.
    (b) The name of an ingredient shall be a specific name and not a 
collective (generic) name, except that:
    (1) Spices, flavorings, colorings and chemical preservatives shall 
be declared according to the provisions of Sec.  501.22.
    (2) An ingredient which itself contains two or more ingredients and 
which has an established common or usual name, conforms to a standard 
established pursuant to the Meat Inspection or Poultry Products 
Inspection Acts by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or conforms to a 
definition and standard of identity established pursuant to section 401 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, shall be designated in the 
statement of ingredients on the label of such food by either of the 
following alternatives:
    (i) By declaring the established common or usual name of the 
ingredient followed by a parenthetical listing of all ingredients 
contained therein in descending order of predominance except that, if 
the ingredient is a food subject to a definition and standard of 
identity established in this subchapter E, only the ingredients required 
to be declared by the definition and standard of identity need be 
listed; or
    (ii) By incorporating into the statement of ingredients in 
descending order of predominance in the finished food, the common or 
usual name of every component of the ingredient without listing the 
ingredient itself.
    (3) Skim milk, concentrated skim milk, reconstituted skim milk, and 
nonfat dry milk may be declared as skim milk or nonfat milk.
    (4) Milk, concentrated milk, reconstituted milk, and dry whole milk 
may be declared as milk.
    (5) Bacterial cultures may be declared by the word cultured followed 
by the name of the substrate, e.g., made from cultured skim milk or 
cultured buttermilk.
    (6) Sweetcream buttermilk, concentrated sweetcream buttermilk, 
reconstituted sweetcream buttermilk, and dried sweetcream buttermilk may 
be declared as buttermilk.
    (7) Whey, concentrated whey, reconstituted whey, and dried whey may 
be declared as whey.
    (8) Cream, reconstituted cream, dried cream, and plastic cream 
(sometimes known as concentrated milkfat) may be declared as cream.
    (9) Butteroil and anhydrous butterfat may be declared as butterfat.
    (10) Dried whole eggs, frozen whole eggs, and liquid whole eggs may 
be declared as eggs.
    (11) Dried egg whites, frozen egg whites, and liquid egg whites may 
be declared as egg whites.
    (12) Dried egg yolks, frozen egg yolks, and liquid egg yolks may be 
declared as egg yolks.

[[Page 19]]

    (13) A livestock or poultry feed may be declared by a collective 
name listed in Sec.  501.110 if it is an animal feed within the meaning 
of section 201(w) of the act and meets the requirements for the use of a 
collective name as prescribed in Sec.  501.110 for certain feed 
ingredients.
    (14) [Reserved]
    (15) When all the ingredients of a wheat flour are declared in an 
ingredient statement, the principal ingredient of the flour shall be 
declared by the name(s) specified in Sec. Sec.  137.105, 137.200, 
137.220, 137.225 of this chapter, i.e., the first ingredient designated 
in the ingredient list of flour, or bromated flour, or enriched flour, 
or self-rising flour is flour, white flour, wheat flour, or plain flour; 
the first ingredient designated in the ingredient list of durum flour is 
durum flour; the first ingredient designated in the ingredient list of 
whole wheat flour, or bromated whole wheat flour is whole wheat flour, 
graham flour, or entire wheat flour; and the first ingredient designated 
in the ingredient list of whole durum wheat flour is whole durum wheat 
flour.
    (c) When water is added to reconstitute, completely or partially, an 
ingredient permitted by paragraph (b) of this section to be declared by 
a class name, the position of the ingredient class name in the 
ingredient statement shall be determined by the weight of the 
unreconstituted ingredient plus the weight of the quantity of water 
added to reconstitute that ingredient, up to the amount of water needed 
to reconstitute the ingredient to single strength. Any water added in 
excess of the amount of water needed to reconstitute the ingredient to 
single strength shall be declared as water in the ingredient statement.

<R05>
Sec.  501.5  Animal food; name and place of business of manufacturer, packer, or distributor.

    (a) The label of a food in packaged form shall specify conspicuously 
the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or 
distributor.
    (b) The requirement for declaration of the name of the manufacturer, 
packer, or distributor shall be deemed to be satisfied, in the case of a 
corporation, only by the actual corporate name, which may be preceded or 
followed by the name of the particular division of the corporation. In 
the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under 
which the business is conducted shall be used.
    (c) Where the food is not manufactured by the person whose name 
appears on the label, the name shall be qualified by a phrase that 
reveals the connection such person has with such food; such as 
``Manufactured for ------------,'' ``Distributed by ------------,'' or 
any other wording that expresses the facts.
    (d) The statement of the place of business shall include the street 
address, city, state, and ZIP Code; however, the street address may be 
omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone 
directory. The requirement for inclusion of the ZIP Code shall apply 
only to consumer commodity labels developed or revised after the 
effective date of this section. In the case of nonconsumer packages, the 
ZIP Code shall appear either on the label or the labeling (including 
invoice).
    (e) If a person manufactures, packs, or distributes a food at a 
place other than his principal place of business, the label may state 
the principal place of business in lieu of the actual place where such 
food was manufactured or packed or is to be distributed, unless such 
statement would be misleading.


<R05>
Sec.  501.8  Labeling of animal food with number of servings.

    (a) The label of any package of a food which bears a representation 
as to the number of servings contained in such package shall bear in 
immediate conjunction with such statement, and in the same size type as 
is used for such statement, a statement of the net quantity (in terms of 
weight, measure, or numerical count) of each such serving; however, such 
statement may be expressed in terms that differ from the terms used in 
the required statement of net quantity of contents (for example, 
cupfuls, tablespoonfuls, etc.) when such differing term is common to 
cookery and describes a constant quantity.

[[Page 20]]

Such statement may not be misleading in any particular. A statement of 
the number of units in a package is not in itself a statement of the 
number of servings.
    (b) If there exists a voluntary product standard promulgated 
pursuant to the procedures found in 15 CFR part 10 by the Department of 
Commerce, quantitatively defining the meaning of the term serving with 
respect to a particular food, then any label representation as to the 
number of servings in such packaged food shall correspond with such 
quantitative definition. (Copies of published standards are available 
upon request from the National Bureau of Standards, Department of 
Commerce, Washington, DC 20234.)


<R05>
Sec.  501.15  Animal food; prominence of required statements.

    (a) A word, statement, or other information required by or under 
authority of the act to appear on the label may lack that prominence and 
conspicuousness required by section 403(f) of the act by reason (among 
other reasons) of:
    (1) The failure of such word, statement, or information to appear on 
the part or panel of the label which is presented or displayed under 
customary conditions of purchase;
    (2) The failure of such word, statement, or information to appear on 
two or more parts or panels of the label, each of which has sufficient 
space therefor, and each of which is so designed as to render it likely 
to be, under customary conditions of purchase, the part or panel 
displayed;
    (3) The failure of the label to extend over the area of the 
container or package available for such extension, so as to provide 
sufficient label space for the prominent placing of such word, 
statement, or information;
    (4) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such 
word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space 
for any word, statement, design, or device which is not required by or 
under authority of the act to appear on the label;
    (5) Insufficiency of label space (for the prominent placing of such 
word, statement, or information) resulting from the use of label space 
to give materially greater conspicuousness to any other word, statement, 
or information, or to any design or device; or
    (6) Smallness or style of type in which such word, statement, or 
information appears, insufficient background contrast, obscuring designs 
or vignettes, or crowding with other written, printed, or graphic 
matter.
    (b) No exemption depending on insufficiency of label space, as 
prescribed in regulations promulgated under section 403(e) or (i) of the 
act, shall apply if such insufficiency is caused by:
    (1) The use of label space for any word, statement, design, or 
device which is not required by or under authority of the act to appear 
on the label;
    (2) The use of label space to give greater conspicuousness to any 
word, statement, or other information that is required by section 403(f) 
of the act; or
    (3) The use of label space for any representation in a foreign 
language.
    (c)(1) All words, statements, and other information required by or 
under authority of the act to appear on the label or labeling shall 
appear thereon in the English language: Provided, however, That in the 
case of articles distributed solely in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
or in a territory where the predominant language is one other than 
English, the predominant language may be substituted for English.
    (2) If the label contains any representation in a foreign language, 
all words, statements, and other information required by or under 
authority of the act to appear on the label shall appear thereon in the 
foreign language.
    (3) If any article of labeling (other than a label) contains any 
representation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other 
information required by or under authority of the act to appear on the 
label or labeling shall appear on such article of labeling.


<R05>
Sec.  501.17  Animal food labeling warning statements.

    (a) Self-pressurized containers. (1) The label of a food packaged in 
a self-pressurized container and intended to be expelled from the 
package under pressure shall bear the following warning:

[[Page 21]]

    Warning Avoid spraying in eyes. Contents under pressure. Do not 
puncture or incinerate. Do not store at temperature above 120 [deg]F. 
Keep out of reach of children.
    (2) In the case of products intended for use by children, the phrase 
``except under adult supervision'' may be added at the end of the last 
sentence in the warning required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (3) In the case of products packaged in glass containers, the word 
``break'' may be substituted for the word ``puncture'' in the warning 
required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (4) The words ``Avoid spraying in eyes'' may be deleted from the 
warning required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section in the case of a 
product not expelled as a spray.
    (b) Self-pressurized containers with halocarbon or hydrocarbon 
propellants. (1) In addition to the warning required by paragraph (a) of 
this section, the label of a food packaged in a self-pressurized 
container in which the propellant consists in whole or in part of a 
halocarbon or a hydrocarbon shall bear the following warning:
    Warning Use only as directed. Intentional misuse by deliberately 
concentrating and inhaling the contents can be harmful or fatal.
    (2) The warning required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not 
required for the following products:
    (i) Products expelled in the form of a foam or cream, which contain 
less than 10 percent propellant in the container.
    (ii) Products in a container with a physical barrier that prevents 
escape of the propellant at the time of use.
    (iii) Products of a net quantity of contents of less than 2 ozs that 
are designed to release a measured amount of product with each valve 
actuation.
    (iv) Products of a net quantity of contents of less than \1/2\ oz.
    (c) Animal food containing or manufactured with a chlorofluorocarbon 
or other ozone-depleting substance. Labeling requirements for animal 
foods that contain or are manufactured with a chlorofluorocarbon or 
other ozone-depleting substance designated by the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) are set forth in 40 CFR part 82.

<R05>
Sec.  501.18  Misbranding of animal food.

    (a) Among representations in the labeling of a food which render 
such food misbranded is a false or misleading representation with 
respect to another food or a drug, device, or cosmetic.
    (b) The labeling of a food which contains two or more ingredients 
may be misleading by reason (among other reasons) of the designation of 
such food in such labeling by a name which includes or suggests the name 
of one or more but not all such ingredients, even though the names of 
all such ingredients are stated elsewhere in the labeling.
    (c) Among representations in the labeling of a food which render 
such food misbranded is any representation that expresses or implies a 
geographical origin of the food or any ingredient of the food except 
when such representation is either:
    (1) A truthful representation of geographical origin.
    (2) A trademark or trade name provided that as applied to the 
article in question its use is not deceptively misdescriptive. A 
trademark or trade name comprised in whole or in part of geographical 
words shall not be considered deceptively misdescriptive if it:
    (i) Has been so long and exclusively used by a manufacturer or 
distributor that it is generally understood by the consumer to mean the 
product of a particular manufacturer or distributor; or
    (ii) Is so arbitrary or fanciful that it is not generally understood 
by the consumer to suggest geographic origin.
    (3) A part of the name required by applicable Federal law or 
regulation.
    (4) A name whose market significance is generally understood by the 
consumer to connote a particular class, kind, type, or style of food 
rather than to indicate geographical origin.

          Subpart B--Specific Animal Food Labeling Requirements


<R05>
Sec.  501.22  Animal foods; labeling of spices, flavorings, colorings, and chemical preservatives.

    (a)(1) The term artificial flavor or artificial flavoring means any 
substance, the function of which is to impart flavor, which is not 
derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable 
juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant 
material, meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation 
products thereof. Artificial flavor includes the substances listed in 
Sec. Sec.  172.515(b) and 582.60 of this chapter except where these are 
derived from natural sources.
    (2) The term spice means any aromatic vegetable substance in the 
whole, broken, or ground form, except for those substances which have 
been traditionally regarded as foods, such as onions, garlic and celery; 
whose significant function in food is seasoning rather than nutritional; 
that is true to name; and from which no portion of any volatile oil or 
other flavoring principle has been removed. Spices include the spices 
listed in subpart A of part 582 of this chapter, such as the following:

Allspice, Anise, Basil, Bay leaves, Caraway seed, Cardamon, Celery seed, 
Chervil, Cinnamon, Cloves, Coriander, Cumin seed, Dill seed, Fennel 
seed, Fenugreek, Ginger, Horseradish, Mace, Marjoram, Mustard flour, 
Nutmeg, Oregano, Paprika, Parsley, Pepper, black; Pepper, white; Pepper, 
red; Rosemary, Saffron, Sage, Savory, Star aniseed, Tarragon, Thyme, 
Turmeric.


Paprika, turmeric, and saffron or other spices which are also colors, 
shall be declared as spice and coloring unless declared by their common 
or usual name.
    (3) The term natural flavor or natural flavoring means the essential 
oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, 
or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the 
flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, 
vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf 
or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, 
or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is 
flavoring rather than nutritional. Natural flavors, include the natural 
essence or extractives obtained from plants listed in subpart A of part 
582 of this chapter, and the substances listed in Sec.  172.510 of this 
chapter.
    (4) The term artificial color or artificial coloring means any color 
additive as defined in Sec.  70.3(f) of this chapter.
    (5) The term chemical preservative means any chemical that, when 
added to food, tends to prevent or retard deterioration thereof, but 
does not include common salt, sugars, vinegars, spices, or oils 
extracted from spices, substances added to food by direct exposure 
thereof to wood smoke, or chemicals applied for their insecticidal or 
herbicidal properties.
    (b) A food which is subject to the requirements of section 403(k) of 
the act shall bear labeling, even though such food is not in package 
form.
    (c) A statement of artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or 
chemical preservative shall be placed on the food, or on its container 
or wrapper, or on any two or all of these, as may be necessary to render 
such statement likely to be read by the ordinary individual under 
customary conditions of purchase and use of such food.
    (d) A food shall be exempt from compliance with the requirements of 
section 403(k) of the act if it is not in package form and the units 
thereof are so small that a statement of artificial flavoring, 
artificial coloring, or chemical preservative, as the case may be, 
cannot be placed on such units with such conspicuousness as to render it 
likely to be read by the ordinary individual under customary conditions 
of purchase and use.
    (e) A food shall be exempt while held for sale from the requirements 
of section 403(k) of the act (requiring label statement of any 
artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservatives) if 
said food, having been received in bulk containers at a retail 
establishment, is displayed to the purchaser with either (1) the 
labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (2) a counter card, 
sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously 
the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 
403(k) of the act.

[[Page 23]]

    (f) A fruit or vegetable shall be exempt from compliance with the 
requirements of section 403(k) of the act with respect to a chemical 
preservative applied to the fruit or vegetable as a pesticide chemical 
prior to harvest.
    (g) A flavor shall be labeled in the following way when shipped to a 
food manufacturer or processor (but not a consumer) for use in the 
manufacture of a fabricated food, unless it is a flavor for which a 
standard of identity has been promulgated, in which case it shall be 
labeled as provided in the standard:
    (1) If the flavor consists of one ingredient, it shall be declared 
by its common or usual name.
    (2) If the flavor consists of two or more ingredients, the label 
either may declare each ingredient by its common or usual name or may 
state ``All flavor ingredients contained in this product are approved 
for use in a regulation of the Food and Drug Administration.'' Any 
flavor ingredient not contained in one of these regulations, and any 
nonflavor ingredient, shall be separately listed on the label.
    (3) In cases where the flavor contains a solely natural flavor(s), 
the flavor shall be so labeled, e.g., strawberry flavor, banana flavor, 
or natural strawberry flavor. In cases where the flavor contains both a 
natural flavor and an artificial flavor, the flavor shall be so labeled, 
e.g., natural and artificial strawberry flavor. In cases where the 
flavor contains a solely artificial flavor(s), the flavor shall be so 
labeled, e.g., artificial strawberry flavor.
    (h) The label of a food to which flavor is added shall declare the 
flavor in the statement of ingredients in the following way:
    (1) Spice, natural flavor, and artificial flavor may be declared as 
spice, natural flavor, or artificial flavor, or any combination thereof, 
as the case may be.
    (2) An incidental additive in a food, originating in a spice or 
flavor used in the manufacture of the food, need not be declared in the 
statement of ingredients if it meets the requirements of Sec.  
501.100(a)(3).
    (3) Substances obtained by cutting, grinding, drying, pulping, or 
similar processing of tissues derived from fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, 
or poultry, e.g., powdered or granulated onions, garlic powder, and 
celery powder, are commonly understood by consumers to be food rather 
than flavor and shall be declared by their common or usual name.
    (4) Any salt (sodium chloride) used as an ingredient in food shall 
be declared by its common or usual name salt.
    (5) Any monosodium glutamate used as an ingredient in food shall be 
declared by its common or usual name monosodium glutamate.
    (6) Any pyroligneous acid or other artificial smoke flavors used as 
an ingredient in a food may be declared as artificial flavor or 
artificial smoke flavor. No representation may be made, either directly 
or implied, that a food flavored with pyroligneous acid or other 
artificial smoke flavor has been smoked or has a true smoked flavor, or 
that a seasoning sauce or similar product containing pyroligneous acid 
or other artificial smoke flavor and used to season or flavor other 
foods will result in a smoked product or one having a true smoked 
flavor.
    (i) If the label, labeling, or advertising of a food makes any 
direct or indirect representations with respect to the primary 
recognizable flavor(s), by word, vignette, e.g., depiction of a fruit, 
or other means, or if for any other reason the manufacturer or 
distributor of a food wishes to designate the type of flavor in the food 
other than through the statement of ingredients, such flavor shall be 
considered the characterizing flavor and shall be declared in the 
following way:
    (1) If the food contains no artificial flavor which simulates, 
resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food 
on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be 
accompanied by the common or usual name of the characterizing flavor in 
letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the 
name of the food, except that:
    (i) If the food is one that is commonly expected to contain a 
characterizing food ingredient, and the food contains natural flavor 
derived from such ingredient and an amount of characterizing ingredient 
insufficient to independently characterize the food, or the food 
contains no such ingredient, the

[[Page 24]]

name of the characterizing flavor may be immediately preceded by the 
word natural and shall be immediately followed by the word flavored in 
letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of 
the characterizing flavor.
    (ii) If none of the natural flavor used in the food is derived from 
the product whose flavor is simulated, the food in which the flavor is 
used shall be labeled either with the flavor of the product from which 
the flavor is derived or as artificially flavored.
    (iii) If the food contains both a characterizing flavor from the 
product whose flavor is simulated and other natural flavor which 
simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the food 
shall be labeled in accordance with the introductory text and paragraph 
(i)(1)(i) of this section and the name of the food shall be immediately 
followed by the words with other natural flavor in letters not less than 
one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the 
characterizing flavor.
    (2) If the food contains any artificial flavor which simulates, 
resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food 
on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be 
accompanied by the common or usual name(s) of the characterizing flavor, 
in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the 
name of the food and the name of the characterizing flavor shall be 
accompanied by the word(s) artificial or artificially flavored, in 
letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of 
the characterizing flavor.
    (3) Wherever the name of the characterizing flavor appears on the 
label (other than in the statement of ingredients) so conspicuously as 
to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the words 
prescribed by this paragraph shall immediately and conspicuously precede 
or follow such name, without any intervening written, printed, or 
graphic matter, except:
    (i) Where the characterizing flavor and a trademark or brand are 
presented together, other written, printed, or graphic matter that is a 
part of or is associated with the trademark or brand may intervene if 
the required words are in such relationship with the trademark or brand 
as to be clearly related to the characterizing flavor; and
    (ii) If the finished product contains more than one flavor subject 
to the requirements of this paragraph, the statements required by this 
paragraph need appear only once in each statement of characterizing 
flavors present in such food.
    (iii) If the finished product contains three or more distinguishable 
characterizing flavors, or a blend of flavors with no primary 
recognizable flavor, the flavor may be declared by an appropriately 
descriptive generic term in lieu of naming each flavor.
    (4) A flavor supplier shall certify, in writing, that any flavor he 
supplies which is designated as containing no artificial flavor does 
not, to the best of his knowledge and belief, contain any artificial 
flavor, and that he has added no artificial flavor to it. The 
requirement for such certification may be satisfied by a guarantee under 
section 303(c)(2) of the act which contains such a specific statement. A 
flavor used shall be required to make such a written certification only 
where he adds to or combines another flavor with a flavor which has been 
certified by a flavor supplier as containing no artificial flavor, but 
otherwise such user may rely upon the supplier's certification and need 
make no separate certification. All such certifications shall be 
retained by the certifying party throughout the period in which the 
flavor is supplied and for a minimum of 3 years thereafter, and shall be 
subject to the following conditions:
    (i) The certifying party shall make such certifications available 
upon request at all reasonable hours to any duly authorized officer, or 
employee of the Food and Drug Administration or any other employee 
acting on behalf of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Such 
certifications are regarded by the Food and Drug Administration as 
reports to the government and as guarantees or other undertakings within 
the meaning of section 301(h) of the act and subject the certifying 
party to the penalties for making any false report to the government 
under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and any false guarantee or undertaking under 
section

[[Page 25]]

303(a) of the act. The defenses provided under section 303(c)(2) of the 
act shall be applicable to the certifications provided for in this 
section.
    (ii) Wherever possible, the Food and Drug Administration shall 
verify the accuracy of a reasonable number of certifications made 
pursuant to this section, constituting a representative sample of such 
certifications, and shall not request all such certifications.
    (iii) Where no person authorized to provide such information is 
reasonably available at the time of inspection, the certifying party 
shall arrange to have such person and the relevant materials and records 
ready for verification as soon as practicable; provided that, whenever 
the Food and Drug Administration has reason to believe that the supplier 
or user may utilize this period to alter inventories or records, such 
additional time shall not be permitted. Where such additional time is 
provided, the Food and Drug Administration may require the certifying 
party to certify that relevant inventories have not been materially 
disturbed and relevant records have not been altered or concealed during 
such period.
    (iv) The certifying party shall provide, to an officer or 
representative duly designated by the Secretary, such qualitative 
statement of the composition of the flavor or product covered by the 
certification as may be reasonably expected to enable the Secretary's 
representatives to determine which relevant raw and finished materials 
and flavor ingredient records are reasonably necessary to verify the 
certifications. The examination conducted by the Secretary's 
representative shall be limited to inspection and review of inventories 
and ingredient records for those certifications which are to be 
verified.
    (v) Review of flavor ingredient records shall be limited to the 
qualitative formula and shall not include the quantitative formula. The 
person verifying the certifications may make only such notes as are 
necessary to enable him to verify such certification. Only such notes or 
such flavor ingredient records as are necessary to verify such 
certification or to show a potential or actual violation may be removed 
or transmitted from the certifying party's place of business: Provided, 
That, where such removal or transmittal is necessary for such purposes 
the relevant records and notes shall be retained as separate documents 
in Food and Drug Administration files, shall not be copied in other 
reports, and shall not be disclosed publicly other than in a judicial 
proceeding brought pursuant to the act or 18 U.S.C. 1001.
    (j) A food to which a chemical preservative(s) is added shall, 
except when exempt pursuant to Sec.  501.100, bear a label declaration 
stating both the common or usual name of the ingredient(s) and a 
separate description of its function, e.g., preservative, to retard 
spoilage, a mold inhibitor, to help protect flavor or to promote color 
retention.

<R04>
      Subpart F--Exemptions From Animal Food Labeling Requirements


<R05>
Sec.  501.100  Animal food; exemptions from labeling.

    (a) The following foods are exempt from compliance with the 
requirements of section 403(i)(2) of the act (requiring a declaration on 
the label of the common or usual name of each ingredient when the food 
is fabricated from two or more ingredients).
    (1) An assortment of different items of food, when variations in the 
items that make up different packages packed from such assortment 
normally occur in good packing practice and when such variations result 
in variations in the ingredients in different packages, with respect to 
any ingredient that is not common to all packages. Such exemption, 
however, shall be on the condition that the label shall bear, in 
conjunction with the names of such ingredients as are common to all 
packages, a statement (in terms that are as informative as practicable 
and that are not misleading) indicating by name other ingredients which 
may be present.

[[Page 26]]

    (2) A food having been received in bulk containers at a retail 
establishment, if displayed to the purchaser with either (i) the 
labeling of the bulk container plainly in view or (ii) a counter card, 
sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and conspicuously 
the information required to be stated on the label pursuant to section 
403(i)(2) of the act.
    (3) Incidental additives that are present in a food at insignificant 
levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food. 
For the purposes of this paragraph (a)(3), incidental additives are:
    (i) Substances that have no technical or functional effect but are 
present in a food by reason of having been incorporated into the food as 
an ingredient of another food, in which the substance did have a 
functional or technical effect.
    (ii) Processing aids, which are as follows:
    (a) Substances that are added to a food during the processing of 
such food but are removed in some manner from the food before it is 
packaged in its finished form.
    (b) Substances that are added to a food during processing, are 
converted into constituents normally present in the food, and do not 
significantly increase the amount of the constituents naturally found in 
the food.
    (c) Substances that are added to a food for their technical or 
functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food 
at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional 
effect in that food.
    (iii) Substances migrating to food from equipment or packaging or 
otherwise affecting food that are not food additives as defined in 
section 201(s) of the act; or if they are food additives as so defined, 
they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to 
section 409 of the act.
    (b) A food repackaged in a retail establishment is exempt from the 
following provisions of the act if the conditions specified are met.
    (1) Section 403(e)(1) of the act (requiring a statement on the label 
of the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or 
distributor).
    (2) Section 403(g)(2) of the act (requiring the label of a food 
which purports to be or is represented as one for which a definition and 
standard of identity has been prescribed to bear the name of the food 
specified in the definition and standard and, insofar as may be required 
by the regulation establishing the standard the common names of the 
optional ingredients present in the food), if the food is displayed to 
the purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a 
counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and 
conspicuously the information required by these provisions.
    (3) Section 403(i)(1) of the act (requiring the label to bear the 
common or usual name of the food), if the food is displayed to the 
purchaser with its interstate labeling clearly in view, or with a 
counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing prominently and 
conspicuously the common or usual name of the food, or if the common or 
usual name of the food is clearly revealed by its appearance.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Except as provided by paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, a 
shipment or other delivery of a food which is, in accordance with the 
practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in 
substantial quantity at an establishment other than that where 
originally processed or packed, shall be exempt, during the time of 
introduction into and movement in interstate commerce and the time of 
holding in such establishment, from compliance with the labeling 
requirements of section 403 (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j) and (k) of the 
act if:
    (1) The person who introduced such shipment or delivery into 
interstate commerce is the operator of the establishment where such food 
is to be processed, labeled, or repacked; or
    (2) In case such person is not such operator, such shipment or 
delivery is made to such establishment under a written agreement, signed 
by and containing the post office addresses of such person and such 
operator, and containing such specifications for the processing, 
labeling, or repacking, as the case may be, of such food in such 
establishment as will ensure, if such specifications are followed, that 
such

[[Page 27]]

food will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act 
upon completion of such processing, labeling, or repacking. Such person 
and such operator shall each keep a copy of such agreement until 2 years 
after the final shipment or delivery of such food from such 
establishment, and shall make such copies available for inspection at 
any reasonable hour to any officer or employee of the Department who 
requests them.
    (e) Conditions affecting expiration of exemptions.
    (1) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall, at the beginning of the act of 
removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such 
establishment become void ab initio if the food comprising such 
shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the 
meaning of the act when so removed.
    (2) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall become void ab initio with 
respect to the person who introduced such shipment or delivery into 
interstate commerce upon refusal by such person to make available for 
inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section.
    (3) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a food under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall expire:
    (i) At the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or 
delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment if the food 
comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded 
within the meaning of the act when so removed; or
    (ii) Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such 
food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for 
inspection a copy of the agreement as required by such paragraph.
    (f) [Reserved]
    (g) The label declaration of a harmless marker used to identify a 
particular manufacturer's product may result in unfair competition 
through revealing a trade secret. Exemption from the label declaration 
of such a marker is granted, therefore, provided that the following 
conditions are met:
    (1) The person desiring to use the marker without label declaration 
of its presence has submitted to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs full 
information concerning the proposed usage and the reasons why he 
believes label declaration of the marker should be subject to this 
exemption; and
    (2) The person requesting the exemption has received from the 
Commissioner of Food and Drugs a finding that the marker is harmless and 
that the exemption has been granted.


<R05>
Sec.  501.103  Petitions requesting exemptions from or special requirements for label declaration of ingredients.

    The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, either on his own initiative or 
on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a petition pursuant 
to part 10 of this chapter may issue a proposal to amend Sec.  501.4 to 
specify the manner in which an ingredient(s) shall be declared, i.e., by 
specific or class name, or Sec.  501.100 to exempt an ingredient(s) from 
the requirements for label declaration.

[41 FR 38619, Sept. 10, 1976, as amended at 42 FR 15675, Mar. 22, 1977]


<R05>
Sec.  501.105  Declaration of net quantity of contents when exempt.

    (a) The principal display panel of a food in package form shall bear 
a declaration of the net quantity of contents. This shall be expressed 
in the terms of weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination of 
numerical count and weight or measure. The statement shall be in terms 
of fluid measure if the food is liquid, or in terms of weight if the 
food is solid, semisolid, or viscous, or a mixture of solid and liquid; 
except that such statement may be in terms of dry measure if the food is 
a fresh fruit, fresh vegetable, or other dry commodity that is 
customarily sold by dry measure. If there is a firmly established 
general consumer usage and trade custom of declaring the contents of a 
liquid by weight, or a solid, semisolid, or viscous product by fluid 
measure, it may be used. Whenever the Commissioner determines that an 
existing practice of declaring net quantity of contents by

[[Page 28]]

weight, measure, numerical count, or a combination in the case of a 
specific packaged food does not facilitate value comparisons by 
consumers and offers opportunity for consumer confusion, he will by 
regulation designate the appropriate term or terms to be used for such 
commodity.
    (b)(1) Statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound 
and ounce.
    (2) Statements of fluid measure shall be in terms of the U.S. gallon 
of 231 cubic inches and quart, pint, and fluid ounce subdivisions 
thereof, and shall:
    (i) In the case of frozen food that is sold and consumed in a frozen 
state, express the volume at the frozen temperature.
    (ii) In the case of refrigerated food that is sold in the 
refrigerated state, express the volume at 40 [deg]F (4 [deg]C).
    (iii) In the case of other foods, express the volume at 68 [deg]F 
(20 [deg]C).
    (3) Statements of dry measure shall be in terms of the U.S. bushel 
of 2,150.42 cubic inches and peck, dry quart, and dry pint subdivisions 
thereof.
    (c) When the declaration of quantity of contents by numerical count 
does not give adequate information as to the quantity of food in the 
package, it shall be combined with such statement of weight, measure, or 
size of the individual units of the foods as will provide such 
information.
    (d) The declaration may contain common or decimal fractions. A 
common fraction shall be in terms of halves, quarters, eighths, 
sixteenths, or thirty-seconds; except that if there exists a firmly 
established general consumer usage and trade custom of employing 
different common fractions in the net quantity declaration of a 
particular commodity, they may be employed. A common fraction shall be 
reduced to its lowest terms; a decimal fraction shall not be carried out 
to more than two places. A statement that includes small fractions of an 
ounce shall be deemed to permit smaller variations than one which does 
not include such fractions.
    (e) The declaration shall be located on the principal display panel 
of the label, and with respect to packages bearing alternate principal 
panels it shall be duplicated on each principal display panel.
    (f) The declaration shall appear as a distinct item on the principal 
display panel, shall be separated (by at least a space equal to the 
height of the lettering used in the declaration) from other printed 
label information appearing above or below the declaration and (by at 
least a space equal to twice the width of the letter ``N'' of the style 
of type used in the quantity of contents statement) from other printed 
label information appearing to the left or right of the declaration. It 
shall not include any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or 
count (such as jumbo quart and full gallon) that tends to exaggerate the 
amount of the food in the container. It shall be placed on the principal 
display panel within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label 
panel in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests 
as it is designed to be displayed: Provided, That on packages having a 
principal display panel of 5 square inches or less, the requirement for 
placement within the bottom 30 percent of the area of the label panel 
shall not apply when the declaration of net quantity of contents meets 
the other requirements of this part.
    (g) The declaration shall accurately reveal the quantity of food in 
the package exclusive of wrappers and other material packed therewith; 
provided that in the case of foods packed in containers designed to 
deliver the food under pressure, the declaration shall state the net 
quantity of the contents that will be expelled when the instructions for 
use as shown on the container are followed. The propellant is included 
in the net quantity declaration.
    (h) The declaration shall appear in conspicuous and easily legible 
boldface print or type in distinct contrast (by typography, layout, 
color, embossing, or molding) to other matter on the package; except 
that a declaration of net quantity blown, embossed, or molded on a glass 
or plastic surface is permissible when all label information is so 
formed on the surface. Requirements of conspicuousness and legibility 
shall include the specifications that:

[[Page 29]]

    (1) The ratio of height to width (of the letter) shall not exceed a 
differential of 3 units to 1 unit (no more than 3 times as high as it is 
wide).
    (2) Letter heights pertain to upper case or capital letters. When 
upper and lower case or all lower case letters are used, it is the lower 
case letter ``o'' or its equivalent that shall meet the minimum 
standards.
    (3) When fractions are used, each component numeral shall meet one-
half the minimum height standards.
    (i) The declaration shall be in letters and numerals in a type size 
established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel 
of the package and shall be uniform for all packages of substantially 
the same size by complying with the following type specifications:
    (1) Not less than \1/16\ inch in height on packages the principal 
display panel of which has an area of 5 square inches or less.
    (2) Not less than \1/8\ inch in height on packages the principal 
display panel of which has an area of more than 5 but not more than 25 
square inches.
    (3) Not less than \3/16\ inch in height on packages the principal 
display panel of which has an area of more than 25 but not more than 100 
square inches.
    (4) Not less than \1/4\ inch in height on packages the principal 
display panel of which has an area of more than 100 square inches, 
except not less than \1/2\ inch in height if the area is more than 400 
square inches.

Where the declaration is blown, embossed, or molded on a glass or 
plastic surface rather than by printing, typing, or coloring, the 
lettering sizes specified in paragraphs (i) (1) through (4) of this 
section shall be increased by \1/16\ of an inch.
    (j) On packages containing less than 4 pounds or 1 gallon and 
labeled in terms of weight or fluid measure:
    (1) The declaration shall be expressed both in ounces, with 
identification by weight or by liquid measure and, if applicable (1 
pound or 1 pint or more) followed in parentheses by a declaration in 
pounds for weight units, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common 
or decimal fractions of the pound (see examples set forth in paragraphs 
(m) (1) and (2) of this section), or in the case of liquid measure, in 
the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints, as 
appropriate) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or 
decimal fractions of the pint or quart (see examples in paragraphs (m) 
(3) and (4) of this section).
    (2) If the net quantity of contents declaration appears on a random 
package, that is a package which is one of a lot, shipment, or delivery 
of packages of the same consumer commodity with varying weights and with 
no fixed weight pattern, it may, when the net weight exceeds 1 pound, be 
expressed in terms of pounds and decimal fractions of the pound carried 
out to not more than two decimal places. When the net weight does not 
exceed 1 pound, the declaration on the random package may be in decimal 
fractions of the pound in lieu of ounces (see example in paragraph 
(m)(5) of this section).
    (3) The declaration may appear in more than one line. The term net 
weight shall be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms 
of weight. Use of the terms net or net contents in terms of fluid 
measure or numerical count is optional. It is sufficient to distinguish 
avoirdupois ounce from fluid ounce through association of terms; for 
example, Net wt. 6 oz. or 6 oz. net wt. and 6 fl. oz. or net contents 6 
fl. oz.
    (k) On packages containing 4 pounds or 1 gallon or more and labeled 
in terms of weight or fluid measure, the declaration shall be expressed 
in pounds for weight units with any remainder in terms of ounces or 
common or decimal fraction of the pound, or in the case of fluid 
measure, it shall be expressed in the largest whole unit (gallons 
followed by common or decimal fraction of a gallon or by the next 
smaller whole unit or units (quarts, or quarts and pints)) with any 
remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the 
pint or quart (see paragraph (m)(6) of this section).
    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) Examples: (1) A declaration of 1\1/2\ pounds weight shall be 
expressed as Net Wt. 24 oz. (1 lb. 8 oz.), Net Wt. 24 oz. (1\1/2\ lb.), 
or Net Wt. 24 oz. (1.5 lb.).
    (2) A declaration of \3/4\ pound avoirdupois weight shall be 
expressed as Net Wt. 12 oz.

[[Page 30]]

    (3) A declaration of 1 quart liquid measure shall be expressed as 
Net 32 fl. oz. (1 qt.).
    (4) A declaration of 1\3/4\ quarts liquid measure shall be expressed 
as Net contents 56 fluid ounces (1 quart 1\1/2\ pints) or as Net 56 
fluid oz. (1 qt. 1 pt. 8 oz.), but not in terms of quart and ounce such 
as Net 56 fluid oz. (1 quart 24 ounces).
    (5) On a random package, declaration of \3/4\ pound avoirdupois may 
be expressed as Net Wt. .75 lb.
    (6) A declaration of 2\1/2\ gallons liquid measure shall be 
expressed as Net contents 2\1/2\ gallons, Net contents 2.5 gallons, or 
Net contents 2 gallons 2 quarts and not as 2 gallons 4 pints.
    (n) For quantities, the following abbreviations and none other may 
be employed (periods and plural forms are optional):

weight wt.                            pint pt.
ounce oz.                             quart qt.
pound lb.                             fluid fl.
gallon gal.
 

    (o) Nothing in this section shall prohibit supplemental statements 
at locations other than the principal display panel(s) describing in 
nondeceptive terms the net quantity of contents; provided, that such 
supplemental statements of net quantity of contents shall not include 
any term qualifying a unit of weight, measure, or count that tends to 
exaggerate the amount of the food contained in the package; for example, 
jumbo quart and full gallon. Dual or combination declarations of net 
quantity of contents as provided for in paragraphs (a), (c), and (j) of 
this section (for example, a combination of net weight plus numerical 
count, net contents plus dilution directions of a concentrate, etc.) are 
not regarded as supplemental net quantity statements and may be located 
on the principal display panel.
    (p) A separate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of 
the metric system is not regarded as a supplemental statement and an 
accurate statement of the net quantity of contents in terms of the 
metric system of weight or measure may also appear on the principal 
display panel or on other panels.
    (q) The declaration of net quantity of contents shall express an 
accurate statement of the quantity of contents of the package. 
Reasonable variations caused by loss or gain of moisture during the 
course of good distribution practice or by unavoidable deviations in 
good manufacturing practice will be recognized. Variations from stated 
quantity of contents shall not be unreasonably large.
    (r) [Reserved]
    (s) On a multiunit retail package, a statement of the quantity of 
contents shall appear on the outside of the package and shall include 
the number of individual units, the quantity of each individual unit, 
and, in parentheses, the total quantity of contents of the multiunit 
package in terms of avoirdupois or fluid ounces, except that such 
declaration of total quantity need not be followed by an additional 
parenthetical declaration in terms of the largest whole units and 
subdivisions thereof, as required by paragraph (j)(1) of this section. A 
multiunit retail package may thus be properly labeled: 6-16 oz. 
bottles--(96 fl. oz.) or 3-16 oz. cans--(net wt. 48 oz). For the 
purposes of this section, multiunit retail package means a package 
containing two or more individually packaged units of the identical 
commodity and in the same quantity, intended to be sold as part of the 
multiunit retail package but capable of being individually sold in full 
compliance with all requirements of the regulations in this part. Open 
multiunit retail packages that do not obscure the number of units nor 
prevent examination of the labeling on each of the individual units are 
not subject to this paragraph if the labeling of each individual unit 
complies with the requirements of paragraphs (f) and (i) of this 
section.
    (t) Where the declaration of net quantity of contents is in terms of 
net weight and/or drained weight or volume and does not accurately 
reflect the actual quantity of the contents or the product falls below 
the applicable standard of fill of container because of equipment 
malfunction or otherwise unintentional product variation, and the label 
conforms in all other respects to the requirements of this chapter 
(except the requirement that food falling below the applicable standard 
of fill of container shall bear the general statement of substandard 
fill specified in

[[Page 31]]

Sec.  564.14(b) of this chapter), the mislabeled food product, including 
any food product that fails to bear the general statement of substandard 
fill specified in Sec.  564.14(b) of this chapter, may be sold by the 
manufacturer or processor directly to institutions operated by Federal, 
State or local governments: Provided, That:
    (1) The purchaser shall sign a statement at the time of sale stating 
that he is aware that the product is mislabeled to include 
acknowledgement of the nature and extent of the mislabeling, e.g., 
``Actual net weight may be as low as ----% below labeled quantity'' and 
that any subsequent distribution by him of said product except for his 
own institutional use is unlawful. This statement shall be kept on file 
at the principal place of business of the manufacturer or processor for 
2 years subsequent to the date of shipment of the product and shall be 
available to the Food and Drug Administration upon request.
    (2) The product shall be labeled on the outside of its shipping 
container with the statement(s):
    (i) When the variation concerns net weight and/or drained weight of 
volume--``Product Mislabeled. Actual net weight (drained weight or 
volume where appropriate) may be as low as ----% below labeled quantity. 
This Product Not for Retail Distribution,'' the blank to be filled in 
with the maximum percentage variance between the labeled and actual 
weight or volume of contents of the individual packages in the shipping 
container, and
    (ii) When the variation is in regard to a fill of container 
standard--``Product Mislabeled. Actual fill may be as low as ----% below 
standard of fill. This Product Not for Retail Distribution.''
    (3) The statements required by paragraphs (t)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section, which may be consolidated where appropriate, shall appear 
prominently and conspicuously as compared to other printed matter on the 
shipping container and in boldface print or type on a clear, contrasting 
background in order to render them likely to be read and understood by 
the purchaser under ordinary conditions of purchase.

<R05>
Sec.  502.5  General principles.

    (a) The common or usual name of a food, which may be a coined term, 
shall accurately identify or describe, in as simple and direct terms as 
possible, the basic nature of the food or its characterizing properties 
or ingredients. The name shall be uniform among all identical or similar 
products and may not be confusingly similar to the name of any other 
food that is not reasonably encompassed within the same name. Each class 
or subclass of food shall be given its own common or usual name that 
states, in clear terms, what it is in a way that distinguishes it from 
different foods.
    (b) The common or usual name of a food shall include the 
percentage(s) of any characterizing ingredient(s) or component(s) when 
the proportion of such ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food has a 
material bearing on price or consumer acceptance or when the labeling or 
the appearance of the food may otherwise create an erroneous impression 
that such ingredient(s) or component(s) is present in an amount greater 
than is actually the case. The following requirements shall apply unless 
modified by a specific regulation in this part.
    (1) The percentage of a characterizing ingredient or component shall 
be declared on the basis of its quantity in the finished product (i.e., 
weight/weight in the case of solids, or volume/volume in the case of 
liquids).
    (2) The percentage of a characterizing ingredient or component shall 
be declared by the words ``containing (or contains) ---- percent (or %) 
----'' or ``---- percent (or %) ----'' with the first blank filled in 
with the percentage expressed as a whole number not greater than the 
actual percentage of the ingredient or component named and the second 
blank filled in with the common or usual name of the ingredient or 
component. The word ``containing'' (or ``contains''), when used, shall 
appear on a line immediately below the part of the common or usual name 
of the food required by paragraph (a) of this section. For each 
characterizing ingredient or component, the words ``---- percent (or %) 
----''shall appear following or directly below the word ``containing'' 
(or ``contains''), or directly below the part of the common or usual 
name of the food required by paragraph (a) of this section when the word 
``containing'' (or ``contains'') is not used, in easily legible boldface 
print or type in distinct contrast to other printed or graphic matter, 
and in a height not less than the larger of the following alternatives:
    (i) Not less than one-sixteenth inch in height on packages having a 
principal display panel with an area of 5 square inches or less and not 
less than one-eighth inch in height if the area of the principal display 
panel is greater than 5 square inches; or
    (ii) Not less than one-half the height of the largest type appearing 
in the part of the common or usual name of the food required by 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The common or usual name of a food shall include a statement of 
the presence or absence of any characterizing ingredient(s) or 
component(s) and/or the need for the user to add any characterizing 
ingredient(s) or component(s) when the presence or absence of such 
ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food has a material bearing on 
price or consumer acceptance or when the labeling or the appearance of 
the food may otherwise create an erroneous impression that such 
ingredient(s) or component(s) is present when it is not, and consumers 
may otherwise be misled about the presence or absence of the 
ingredient(s) or component(s) in the food. The following requirements 
shall apply unless modified by a specific regulation in this part.

[[Page 33]]

    (1) The presence or absence of a characterizing ingredient or 
component shall be declared by the words ``containing (or contains) ----
----'' or ``containing (or contains) ----------'' or ``no ----------'' 
or ``does not contain ----------'', with the blank being filled in with 
the common or usual name of the ingredient or component.
    (2) The need for the user of a food to add any characterizing 
ingredient(s) or component(s) shall be declared by an appropriate 
informative statement.
    (3) The statement(s) required under paragraph (c) (1) and/or (2) of 
this section shall appear following or directly below the part of the 
common or usual name of the food required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section, in easily legible boldface print or type in distinct 
contrast to other printed or graphic matter, and in a height not less 
than the larger of the alternatives established under paragraph (b)(2) 
(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (d) A common or usual name of a food may be established by common 
usage or by establishment of a regulation in this part, in a standard of 
identity, or in other regulations in this chapter.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec.  509.3  Definitions and interpretations.

    (a) Act means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
    (b) The definitions of terms contained in section 201 of the act are 
applicable to such terms when used in this part unless modified in this 
section.
    (c) A naturally occurring poisonous or deleterious substance is a 
poisonous or deleterious substance that is an inherent natural 
constituent of a food and is not the result of environmental, 
agricultural, industrial, or other contamination.
    (d) An added poisonous or deleterious substance is a poisonous or 
deleterious substance that is not a naturally occurring poisonous or 
deleterious substance. When a naturally occurring poisonous or 
deleterious substance is increased to abnormal levels through

[[Page 34]]

mishandling or other intervening acts, it is an added poisonous or 
deleterious substance to the extent of such increase.
    (e) Food includes pet food, animal feed, and substances migrating to 
food from food-contact articles.


<R05>
Sec.  509.4  Establishment of tolerances, regulatory limits, and action levels.

    (a) When appropriate under the criteria of Sec.  509.6, a tolerance 
for an added poisonous or deleterious substance, which may be a food 
additive, may be established by regulation in subpart B of this part 
under the provisions of section 406 of the act. A tolerance may prohibit 
any detectable amount of the substance in food.
    (b) When appropriate under the criteria of Sec.  509.6, and under 
section 402(a)(1) of the act, a regulatory limit for an added poisonous 
or deleterious substance, which may be a food additive, may be 
established by regulation in subpart C of this part under the provisions 
of sections 402(a)(1) and 701(a) of the act. A regulatory limit may 
prohibit any detectable amount of the substance in food. The regulatory 
limit established represents the level at which food is adulterated 
within the meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act.
    (c)(1) When appropriate under the criteria of Sec.  509.6, an action 
level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance, which may be a 
food additive, may be established to define a level of contamination at 
which a food may be regarded as adulterated.
    (2) Whenever an action level is established or changed, a notice 
shall be published in the Federal Register as soon as practicable 
thereafter. The notice shall call attention to the material supporting 
the action level which shall be on file with the Dockets Management 
Branch before the notice is published. The notice shall invite public 
comment on the action level.
    (d) A regulation may be established in subpart D of this part to 
identify a food containing a naturally occurring poisonous or 
deleterious substance which will be deemed to be adulterated under 
section 402(a)(1) of the act. These regulations do not constitute a 
complete list of such foods.

<R05>
Sec.  509.5  Petitions.

    The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, either on his own initiative or 
on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a petition, may 
issue a proposal to establish, revoke, or amend a regulation under this 
part. Any such petition shall include an adequate factual basis to 
support the petition, shall be in the form set forth in Sec.  10.30 of 
this chapter, and will be published in the Federal Register for comment 
if it contains reasonable grounds for the proposed regulation.

[42 FR 52821, Sept. 30, 1977, as amended at 54 FR 18280, Apr. 28, 1989]


<R05>
Sec.  509.6  Added poisonous or deleterious substances.

    (a) Use of an added poisonous or deleterious substance, other than a 
pesticide chemical, that is also a food additive will be controlled by a 
regulation issued under section 409 of the act when possible. When such 
a use cannot be approved under the criteria of section 409 of the act, 
or when the added poisonous or deleterious substance is not a food 
additive, a tolerance, regulatory limit, or action level may be 
established pursuant to the criteria in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of 
this section. Residues resulting from the use of an added poisonous or 
deleterious substance that is also a pesticide chemical will ordinarily 
be controlled by a tolerance established in a regulation issued under 
sections 406, 408, or 409 of the act by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA). When such a regulation has not been issued, an 
action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance that is 
also a pesticide chemical may be established by the Food and Drug 
Administration. The Food and Drug Administration will request EPA to 
recommend such an action level pursuant to the criteria established in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) A tolerance for an added poisonous or deleterious substance in 
any food may be established when the following criteria are met:

[[Page 35]]

    (1) The substance cannot be avoided by good manufacturing practice.
    (2) The tolerance established is sufficient for the protection of 
the public health, taking into account the extent of which the presence 
of the substance cannot be avoided and the other ways in which the 
consumer may be affected by the same or related poisonous or deleterious 
substances.
    (3) No technological or other changes are foreseeable in the near 
future that might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance 
established. Examples of changes that might affect the appropriateness 
of the tolerance include anticipated improvements in good manufacturing 
practice that would change the extent to which use of the substance is 
unavoidable and anticipated studies expected to provide significant new 
toxicological or use data.
    (c) A regulatory limit for an added poisonous or deleterious 
substance in any food may be established when each of the following 
criteria is met:
    (1) The substance cannot be avoided by current good manufacturing 
practices.
    (2) There is no tolerance established for the substance in the 
particular food under sections 406, 408, or 409 of the act.
    (3) There is insufficient information by which a tolerance may be 
established for the substance under section 406 of the act or 
technological changes appear reasonably possible that may affect the 
appropriateness of a tolerance. The regulatory limit established 
represents the level at which food is adulterated within the meaning of 
section 402(a)(1) of the act.
    (d) An action level for an added poisonous or deleterious substance 
in any food may be established when the criteria in paragraph (b) of 
this section are met, except that technological or other changes that 
might affect the appropriateness of the tolerance are foreseeable in the 
near future. An action level for an added poisonous or deleterious 
substance in any food may be established at a level at which the Food 
and Drug Administration may regard the food as adulterated within the 
meaning of section 402(a)(1) of the act, without regard to the criteria 
in paragraph (b) of this section or in section 406 of the act. An action 
level will be withdrawn when a tolerance or regulatory limit for the 
same substance and use has been established.
    (e) Tolerances will be established under authority appropriate for 
action levels (sections 306, 402(a), and 701(a) of the act, together 
with section 408 or 409 of the act, if appropriate) as well as under 
authority appropriate for tolerances (sections 406 and 701 of the act). 
In the event the effectiveness of a tolerance is stayed pursuant to 
section 701(e)(2) of the act by the filing of an objection, the order 
establishing the tolerance shall be deemed to be an order establishing 
an action level until final action is taken upon such objection.

Sec.  509.7  Unavoidability.

    (a) Tolerances and action levels in this part are established at 
levels based on the unavoidability of the poisonous or deleterious 
substance concerned and do not establish a permissible level of 
contamination where it is avoidable.
    (b) Compliance with tolerances, regulatory limits, and action levels 
does not excuse failure to observe either the requirement in section 
402(a)(4) of the act that food may not be prepared, packed, or held 
under insanitary conditions or the other requirements in this chapter 
that food manufacturers must observe current good manufacturing 
practices. Evidence obtained through factory inspection or otherwise 
indicating such a violation renders the food unlawful, even though the 
amounts of poisonous or deleterious substances are lower than the 
currently established tolerances, regulatory limits, or action levels. 
The manufacturer of food must at all times utilize quality control 
procedures which will reduce contamination to the lowest level currently 
feasible.

Sec.  509.15  Use of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) in establishments manufacturing food-packaging materials.

    (a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) represent a class of toxic 
industrial chemicals manufactured and sold under

[[Page 36]]

a variety of trade names, including: Aroclor (United States); Phenoclor 
(France); Colphen (Germany); and Kanaclor (Japan). PCB's are highly 
stable, heat resistant, and nonflammable chemicals. Industrial uses of 
PCB's include, or did include in the past, their use as electrical 
transformer and capacitor fluids, heat transfer fluids, hydraulic 
fluids, and plasticizers, and in formulations of lubricants, coatings, 
and inks. Their unique physical and chemical properties and widespread, 
uncontrolled industrial applications have caused PCB's to be a 
persistent and ubiquitous contaminant in the environment, causing the 
contamination of certain foods. In addition, incidents have occurred in 
which PCB's have directly contaminated animal feeds as a result of 
industrial accidents (leakage or spillage of PCB fluids from plant 
equipment). These accidents in turn caused the contamination of food 
products intended for human consumption (meat, milk and eggs). 
Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration have revealed that a 
significant percentage of paper food-packaging material contains PCB's 
which can migrate to the packaged food. The origin of PCB's in such 
material is not fully understood. Reclaimed fibers containing carbonless 
copy paper (contains 3 to 5 percent PCB's) have been identified as a 
primary source of PCB's in paper products. Some virgin paper products 
have also been found to contain PCB's, the source of which is generally 
attributed to direct contamination from industrial accidents from the 
use of PCB-containing equipment and machinery in food-packaging 
manufacturing establishments. Since PCB's are toxic chemicals, the PCB 
contamination of food-packaging materials as a result of industrial 
accidents, which can cause the PCB contamination of food, represents a 
hazard to public health. It is therefore necessary to place certain 
restrictions on the industrial uses of PCB's in establishments 
manufacturing food-packaging materials.
    (b) The following special provisions are necessary to preclude the 
accidental PCB contamination of food-packaging materials:
    (1) New equipment or machinery for manufacturing food-packaging 
materials shall not contain or use PCB's.
    (2) On or before September 4, 1973, the management of establishments 
manufacturing food-packaging materials shall:
    (i) Have the heat exchange fluid used in existing equipment for 
manufacturing food-packaging materials sampled and tested to determine 
whether it contains PCB's or verify the absence of PCB's in such 
formulations by other appropriate means. On or before Sept. 4, 1973, any 
such fluid formulated with PCB's must to the fullest extent possible 
commensurate with current good manufacturing practices be replaced with 
a heat exchange fluid that does not contain PCB's.
    (ii) Eliminate to the fullest extent possible commensurate with 
current good manufacturing practices from the establishment any other 
PCB-containing equipment, machinery and materials wherever there is a 
reasonable expectation that such articles could cause food-packaging 
materials to become contaminated with PCB's either as a result of normal 
use or as a result of accident, breakage, or other mishap.
    (iii) The toxicity and other characteristics of fluids selected as 
PCB replacements must be adequately determined so that the least 
potentially hazardous replacement is used. In making this determination 
with respect to a given fluid, consideration should be given to (a) its 
toxicity; (b) the maximum quantity that could be spilled onto a given 
quantity of food before it would be noticed, taking into account its 
color and odor; (c) possible signaling devices in the equipment to 
indicate a loss of fluid, etc.; and (d) its environmental stability and 
tendency to survive and be concentrated through the food chain. The 
judgment as to whether a replacement fluid is sufficiently non-hazardous 
is to be made on an individual installation and operation basis.
    (c) The provisions of this section do not apply to electrical 
transformers and condensers containing PCB's in sealed containers.

<R05>
Sec.  509.30  Temporary tolerances for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's).

    (a) Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) are toxic, industrial 
chemicals. Because of their widespread, uncontrolled industrial 
applications, PCB's have become a persistent and ubiquitous contaminant 
in the environment. As a result, certain foods and animal feeds, 
principally those of animal and marine origin, contain PCB's as 
unavoidable, environmental contaminants. PCB's are transmitted to the 
food portion (meat, milk, and eggs) of food producing animals ingesting 
PCB contaminated animal feed. In addition, a significant percentage of 
paper food-packaging materials contain PCB's which may migrate to the 
packaged food. The source of PCB's in paper food-packaging materials is 
primarily of certain types of carbonless copy paper (containing 3 to 5 
percent PCB's) in waste paper stocks used for manufacturing recycled 
paper. Therefore, temporary tolerances for residues of PCB's as 
unavoidable environmental or industrial contaminants are established for 
a sufficient period of time following the effective date of this 
paragraph to permit the elimination of such contaminants at the earliest 
practicable time. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) is applicable to mixtures of 
chlorinated biphenyl compounds, irrespective of which mixture of PCB's 
is present as the residue. The temporary tolerances for residues of 
PCB's are as follows:
    (1) 0.2 part per million in finished animal feed for food-producing 
animals (except the following finished animal feeds: feed concentrates, 
feed supplements, and feed premixes).
    (2) 2 parts per million in animal feed components of animal origin, 
including fishmeal and other by-products of marine origin and in 
finished animal feed concentrates, supplements, and premixes intended 
for food-producing animals.
    (3) 10 parts per million in paper food-packaging material intended 
for or used with finished animal feed and any components intended for 
animal feeds. The tolerance shall not apply to paper food-packaging 
material separated from the food therein by a functional barrier which 
is impermeable to migration of PCB's.
    (b) A compilation entitled ``Analytical Methodology for 
Polychlorinated Biphenyls, February 1973'' for determining compliance 
with the tolerances established in this section is available from the 
Dockets Management Branch, Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1-23, 12420 
Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857.

Sec.  510.105  Labeling of drugs for use in milk-producing animals.

    (a) Part 526 of this chapter provides for new animal drugs intended 
for intramammary use in animals and includes conditions of use intended 
to prevent the contamination of milk from the use of such drugs.
    (b) Preparations containing antibiotics and other potent drugs 
labeled with directions for use in milk-producing animals will be 
misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the act unless their labeling 
bears appropriate warnings and directions for use to avoid adulteration 
of milk under section 402(a)(2)(c)(ii) of the act.
    (c) It is the position of the Food and Drug Administration that the 
labeling for such preparations should bear a clear warning that either:
    (1) The article should not be administered to animals producing 
milk, since to do so would result in contamination of the milk; or
    (2) The label should bear the following statement: ``Warning: Milk 
that has been taken from animals during

[[Page 40]]

treatment and for ---- hours after the latest treatment must not be used 
for food'', the blank being filled in with the figure that the 
manufacturer has determined by appropriate investigation is needed to 
insure that the milk will not carry violative residues resulting from 
use of the preparation. If the use of the preparation as recommended 
does not result in contamination of the milk, neither of the above 
warning statements is required.

Sec.  510.106  Labeling of antibiotic and antibiotic-containing drugs intended for use in milk-producing animals.

    Whenever the labeling of an antibiotic drug included in the 
regulations in this chapter suggests or recommends its use in milk-
producing animals, the label of such drugs shall bear either the 
statement ``Warning: Not for use in animals producing milk, since this 
use will result in contamination of the milk'' or the statement 
``Warning: Milk that has been taken from animals during treatment and 
for ----hours after the latest treatment must not be used for food'', 
the blank being filled in with the figure that the Commissioner has 
authorized the manufacturer of the drug to use. The Commissioner shall 
determine what such figures shall be from information submitted by the 
manufacturer and which the Commissioner considers is adequate to prove 
that period of time after the latest treatment that the milk from 
treated animals will contain no violative residues from use of the 
preparation. If the Commissioner determines from the information 
submitted that the use of the antibiotic drug as recommended does not 
result in its appearance in the milk, the Commissioner may exempt the 
drug from bearing either of the above warning statements.

Sec.  510.110  Antibiotics used in food-producing animals.

    (a) The Food and Drug Administration in the interest of fulfilling 
its responsibilities with regard to protection of the public health has 
requested an evaluation of the public health aspects of the use of 
antibiotics in veterinary medical and nonmedical uses. There is 
particular concern with regard to the potential hazards associated with 
the extensive use of antibiotics administered to food-producing animals. 
Accordingly, an ad hoc committee on the Veterinary Medical and 
Nonmedical Uses of Antibiotics was established by the Food and Drug 
Administration to study and advise the Commissioner of Food and Drugs on 
the uses of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and for various 
nonmedical purposes as such uses may affect the enforcement of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to their safety and 
effectiveness.
    (b) Based upon an evaluation of the conclusions of said Committee 
and other relevant material, Sec.  510.112 was published in the Federal 
Register of August 23, 1966 (31 FR 11141), asking sponsors of drugs 
containing any antibiotic intended for use in food-producing animals to 
submit data to establish whether such antibiotic and its metabolites are 
present as residues in edible tissues, milk, and eggs from treated 
animals. The data on the residues of antibiotics in milk from 
intramammary infusion preparations were requested within 60 days and the 
data on all other products were requested within 180 days following the 
date of publication of Sec.  510.112 in the Federal Register.
    (c) An evaluation of the data now available shows that use of many 
antibiotic preparations cause residues in edible products of treated 
animals for varying and, in some cases, for long periods of time 
following the last administration. Because of the accumulation of new 
information with regard to the development of resistance of bacteria to 
antibiotics, the ability of bacteria to transfer this resistance, and 
the development of sensitivity to antibiotics in humans, unauthorized 
and unsafe residues of antibiotics cannot be permitted in food obtained 
from treated animals.
    (d) Based on evaluation of information available, including the 
conclusions of the aforementioned ad hoc

[[Page 41]]

Committee, the Commissioner concludes that antibiotic preparations 
intended for use in food-producing animals, other than topical and 
ophthalmic preparations, are not generally recognized among qualified 
experts as having been shown to be safe for their intended use(s) within 
the meaning of section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act.
    (e) Therefore, all exemptions from the provisions of section 409 of 
the act for use of antibiotics in food-producing animals based on 
sanctions or approvals granted prior to enactment of the Food Additives 
Amendment of 1958 (Pub. L. 85-929; 72 Stat. 1784) will be revoked and 
the uses which are concluded to be safe will be covered by food additive 
regulations. On those products for which there are inadequate residue 
data, actions will be initiated to withdraw approval of new-drug 
applications under the provisions of section 505 of the act. Antibiotic 
preparations, other than those for topical and ophthalmic application in 
food-producing animals, which are not covered by food additive 
regulations will be subject to regulatory action within 180 days after 
publication of the forthcoming revocation order.
    (f) Because of the variation in the period of time that antibiotic 
residues may remain in edible products from treated animals, all 
injectable, intramammary infusion, intrauterine, and oral preparations, 
including medicated premixes intended for use in food-producing animals, 
are deemed to be new drugs as well as food additives.

Sec.  510.112  Antibiotics used in veterinary medicine and for nonmedical purposes; required data.

    (a) An ad hoc committee, Committee on the Veterinary Medical and 
Nonmedical Uses of Antibiotics, was formed by the Food and Drug 
Administration to study, and advise the Commissioner on, the use of 
antibiotics in veterinary medicine and for various nonmedical purposes 
as such uses may affect the enforcement of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act with respect to the safety and effectiveness of such 
substances. A copy of the report may be obtained from the Food and Drug 
Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Room 15-05, Parklawn Building, 
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.
    (b) On the basis of the report of the Committee and other 
information, sponsors of drugs containing any antibiotic intended for 
use in food-producing animals shall submit data for determining whether 
or not such antibiotics and their metabolites are present as residues in 
edible tissues, milk, and eggs from treated animals; however, in the 
case of a drug for which such data have already been submitted and for 
which a regulation has been promulgated under section 409 of the act, 
only such data as has been accumulated since the issuance of the 
regulation need be submitted.
    (c) The required data shall be submitted within 180 days of the date 
of publication of this section in the Federal Register; except that in 
the case of data on intramammary infusion preparations the data shall be 
submitted within 60 days of such publication. Data demonstrating the 
absence in milk of residues of intramammary infusion preparations when 
used as directed in their labeling are needed within the 60-day period 
because of the importance of milk in the human diet.
    (d) Regulatory proceedings including revocation of prior sanctions, 
or actions to suspend or amend new drug or antibiotic approvals granted 
prior to passage of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (72 Stat. 
1784), may be initiated with regard to the continued marketing of any 
antibiotic preparation on which the required information is not 
submitted within the period of time prescribed by paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (e) Questions relating to the acceptability of proposed research 
protocols and assay methods for determining the amount of antibiotic 
residues in food should be directed to the Director, Center for 
Veterinary Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., 
Rockville, MD 20855.

          Subpart E--Requirements for Specific New Animal Drugs


<R05>
Sec.  510.410  Corticosteroids for oral, injectable, and ophthalmic use in animals; warnings and labeling requirements.

    (a) The Food and Drug Administration has received reports of side 
effects associated with the oral, injectable, and ophthalmic use of 
corticosteroid animal drugs. The use of these drugs administered orally 
or by injection has resulted in premature parturition when administered 
during the last trimester of pregnancy. Premature parturition may be 
followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. 
Additionally, corticosteroids used in dogs, rabbits, and rodents during 
pregnancy have produced cleft palate in offspring. Use in dogs has 
resulted in other congenital anomalies, including deformed forelegs, 
phocomelia, and anasarca. Drugs subject to this section are required to 
carry the veterinary prescription legend and are subject to the labeling 
requirements of Sec.  201.105 of this chapter.
    (b) In view of these potentially serious side effects, the Food and 
Drug Administration has concluded that the labeling on or within 
packaged corticosteroid-containing preparations intended for animal use 
shall bear conspicuously the following warning statement:

    Warning: Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that 
corticosteroids administered orally or by injection to animals may 
induce the first stage of parturition if used during the last trimester 
of pregnancy and may precipitate premature parturition followed by 
dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis.
    Additionally, corticosteroids administered to dogs, rabbits, and 
rodents during pregnancy have resulted in cleft palate in offspring. 
Corticosteroids administered to dogs during pregnancy have also resulted 
in other congenital anomalies, including deformed forelegs, phocomelia, 
and anasarca.

[49 FR 48535, Dec. 13, 1984]


<R05>
Sec.  510.440  Injectable iron preparations.

    There has been an increasing interest in the use of injectable iron 
compounds for the prevention or treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in 
animals. Although some such preparations have been shown to be safe, 
such articles are regarded as new animal drugs within the meaning of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Accordingly, an approved new 
animal drug application is required prior to the marketing of such 
preparations within the jurisdiction of the act. In addition to the need 
for demonstrating the safety of such articles, the labeling of such 
preparations should not only recommend appropriate dosages of iron but 
also declare the amount (in milligrams) of available iron (Fe) per 
milliliter of the subject product.


<R05>
Sec.  510.455  New animal drug requirements regarding free-choice administration in feeds.

    (a) For the purpose of this section, free-choice administration of 
animal drugs in feeds involves feeds that are placed in feeding or 
grazing areas and are not intended to be consumed fully at a single 
feeding or to constitute the entire diet of the animal. Such methods of 
administering drugs include, but

[[Page 46]]

are not limited to, medicated blocks (agglomerated feed compressed or 
rendered into a solid mass and cohesive enough to hold its form), 
mineral mixes, and liquid feed tank supplements (``lick tank'' 
supplements) containing one or more animal drugs. The manufacture of 
medicated free-choice feeds is subject to the current good manufacturing 
practice regulations for medicated feeds.
    (b) The Food and Drug Administration has concluded that there are 
questions about the safety and effectiveness of drugs when administered 
in free-choice feeds. Therefore, such methods of administration cause 
the drugs so administered to be new animal drugs, for which approved new 
animal drug applications (NADA's) are required. (See Sec.  510.3(i)). In 
addition, the exemption from the requirement of an approved medicated 
feed application provided in Sec.  558.4 of this chapter does not apply 
to any free-choice medicated feed.
    (c) An NADA or supplemental NADA for products for free-choice 
feeding submitted for approval under section 512(b) of the act shall 
provide for:
    (1) The manufacture of a finished product for the free-choice 
administration of a new animal drug. Such an approval will not provide a 
basis upon which an application can be approved under section 512(m) of 
the act; or
    (2) The manufacture of a Type A medicated article for use in the 
subsequent manufacture of a free-choice medicated feed. The approved 
NADA will provide a basis upon which an application can be approved 
under section 512(m) of the act. Data for a specific free-choice product 
may, if desired, be generated and submitted to the Food and Drug 
Administration by the manufacturer of the free-choice feed in the form 
of a master file which can be referenced in the NADA or supplemental 
NADA submitted by the new animal drug sponsor.
    (d) Approval of the NADA or supplemental NADA submitted under 
paragraph (c) of this section will be reflected in a regulation in part 
558 of this chapter published under section 512(i) of the act. The 
regulation will either state the formulation of the approved free-choice 
product or specify the specific free-choice administration products in 
which the drug is approved for use. If the approval is for a Type A 
medicated article, the regulation in part 558 of this chapter will 
indicate that each use of the Type A medicated article in a free-choice 
product must be the subject of an approved supplemental NADA.
    (e) An application submitted under section 512(m) of the act to 
provide for manufacture of a specific free-choice feed from an approved 
Type A medicated article will be approved if, in addition to the 
information required by the medicated feed application, it includes a 
reference to the exact formula of the product to be manufactured as 
follows:
    (1) The formula is the same as the one published in the new animal 
drug regulations; or
    (2) The data in a master file have been referenced in an NADA or 
supplemental NADA; and
    (3) Use of the Type A medicated article in the specific formulation 
has been approved on the basis that:
    (i) The formula is the same as the one for which acceptable data 
have been submitted in a master file by the medicated feed applicant; or
    (ii) The medicated feed applicant has written authority to reference 
a master file that has acceptable data for the formula in question.

PART 511--NEW ANIMAL DRUGS FOR INVESTIGATIONAL USE--Table of Contents

<R05>


    Authority: 21 U.S.C. 321, 351, 352, 353, 360b, 371.


<R05>
Sec.  511.1  New animal drugs for investigational use exempt from section 512(a) of the act.

    (a) New animal drugs for tests in vitro and in laboratory research 
animals. (1) A shipment or other delivery of a new animal drug or animal 
feed bearing or containing a new animal drug intended solely for tests 
in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory research purposes shall 
be exempt from section 512 (a) and (m) of the act if it is labeled as 
follows:

    Caution. Contains a new animal drug for investigational use only in 
laboratory research animals or for tests in vitro. Not for use in 
humans.

    (2) The person distributing or causing the distribution of new 
animal drugs for tests in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory 
research purposes under this exemption shall use due diligence to assure 
that the consignee is regularly engaged in conducting such tests and 
that the shipment of the new animal drug will actually be used for tests 
in vitro or in animals used only for laboratory research.
    (3) The person who introduced such shipment or who delivered the new 
animal drug for introduction into interstate commerce shall maintain 
adequate records showing the name and post office address of the expert 
or expert organization to whom the new animal drug is shipped and the 
date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and delivery for 
a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon the request 
of a properly authorized employee of the Department at reasonable times, 
he shall make such records available for inspection and copying.
    (4) The exemption allowed in this paragraph shall not apply to any 
new animal drug intended for in vitro use in the regular course of 
diagnosing or treating disease, including antibacterial sensitivity 
discs impregnated with any new animal drug or drugs,

[[Page 53]]

which discs are intended for use in determining susceptibility of 
microorganisms to the new animal drug or drugs.
    (b) New animal drugs for clinical investigation in animals. A 
shipment or other delivery of a new animal drug or an animal feed 
containing a new animal drug intended for clinical investigational use 
in animals shall be exempt from section 512(a) and (m) of the act if all 
the following conditions are met:
    (1) The label shall bear the statements:

    Caution. Contains a new animal drug for use only in investigational 
animals in clinical trials. Not for use in humans. Edible products of 
investigational animals are not to be used for food unless authorization 
has been granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or by the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture.

    In the case of containers too small or otherwise unable to 
accommodate a label with sufficient space to bear the caution statements 
required by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the statements may be 
included on the carton label and other labeling on or within the package 
from which the new animal drug is to be dispensed.
    (2) The person or firm distributing or causing the distribution of 
the new animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug shall 
use due diligence to assure that the new animal drug or animal feed 
containing a new animal drug will actually be used for tests in animals 
and is not used in humans.
    (3) The person who introduced such shipment or who delivered the new 
animal drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug for introduction 
into interstate commerce shall maintain adequate records showing the 
name and post office address of the investigator to whom the new animal 
drug or animal feed containing a new animal drug is shipped and the 
date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and delivery for 
a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon the request 
of a properly authorized employee of the Department at reasonable times, 
such records shall be made available for inspection and copying.
    (4) Prior to shipment of the new animal drug for clinical tests in 
animals, the sponsor of the investigation shall submit in triplicate to 
the Food and Drug Administration a ``Notice of Claimed Investigational 
Exemption for a New Animal Drug'' including a signed statement 
containing the following information:
    (i) The identity of the new animal drug.
    (ii) All labeling and other pertinent information to be supplied to 
the investigators. When such pertinent information includes nonclinical 
laboratory studies, the information shall include, with respect to each 
nonclinical study, either a statement that the study was conducted in 
compliance with the requirements set forth in part 58 of this chapter, 
or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with such regulations, 
a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.
    (iii) The name and address of each clinical investigator.
    (iv) The approximate number of animals to be treated (or if not 
available, the amount of new animal drug to be shipped).
    (v) If the new animal drug is given to food-producing animals, the 
statement shall contain the following additional information:
    (a) A commitment that the edible products from such animals shall 
not be used for food without prior authorization in accordance with the 
provisions prescribed in this section.
    (b) Approximate dates of the beginning and end of the experiment or 
series of experiments.
    (c) The maximum daily dose(s) to be administered to a given species, 
the size of animal, maximum duration of administration, method(s) of 
administration, and proposed withdrawal time, if any.
    (vi) If a sponsor has transferred any obligations for the conduct of 
any clinical study to a contract research organization, a statement 
containing the name and address of the contract research organization, 
identification of the clinical study, and a listing of the obligations 
transferred. If all obligations governing the conduct of the study have 
been transferred, a general statement of this transfer--in lieu of a 
listing of the specific obligations transferred--may be submitted.

[[Page 54]]

    (5) Authorization for use of edible products derived from a treated 
food-producing animal may be granted under the provisions of this 
section and when the following specified conditions are met, except that 
in the case of an animal administered any unlicensed experimental 
veterinary biological product regulated under the viruses, serums, 
toxins statute (21 U.S.C., chapter V, sec. 151 et seq.) the product 
shall be exempt from the requirements of this section when U.S. 
Department of Agriculture approval has been obtained as provided in 9 
CFR 103.2. Conditional authorization may be granted in advance of 
identification of the name(s) and address(es) of the clinical 
investigator(s) as required by paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. 
Information required for authorization shall include, in addition to all 
other requirements of this section, the following:
    (i) Data to show that consumption of food derived from animals 
treated at the maximum levels with the minimum withdrawal periods, if 
any, specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v)(c) of this 
section, will not be inconsistent with the public health; or
    (ii) Data to show that food derived from animals treated at the 
maximum levels and with the minimum withdrawal periods, if any, 
specified in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(v)(c) of this section, 
does not contain drug residues or metabolites.
    (iii) The name and location of the packing plant where the animals 
will be processed, except that this requirement may be waived, on 
request, by the terms of the authorization.

Authorizations granted under this paragraph do not exempt 
investigational animals and their products from compliance with other 
applicable inspection requirements. Any person who contests a refusal to 
grant such authorization shall have an opportunity for a regulatory 
hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of 
this chapter.
    (6) On written request of the Food and Drug Administration, the 
sponsor shall submit any additional information reported to or otherwise 
received by him with respect to the investigation deemed necessary to 
facilitate a determination whether there are grounds in the interest of 
public health for terminating the exemption.
    (7) The sponsor shall assure himself that the new animal drug is 
shipped only to investigators who:
    (i) Are qualified by scientific training and/experience to evaluate 
the safety and/or effectiveness of the new animal drug.
    (ii) Shall maintain complete records of the investigations, 
including complete records of the receipt and disposition of each 
shipment or delivery of the new animal drug under investigation. Copies 
of all records of the investigation shall be retained by the 
investigator for 2 years after the termination of the investigation or 
approval of a new animal drug application.
    (iii) Shall furnish adequate and timely reports of the investigation 
to the sponsor.
    (8) The sponsor:
    (i) Shall retain all reports received from investigators for 2 years 
after the termination of the investigation or approval of a new animal 
drug application and make such reports available to a duly authorized 
employee of the Department for inspection at all reasonable times.
    (ii) Shall provide for current monitoring of the investigation by a 
person qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate 
information obtained from the investigation, and shall promptly 
investigate and report to the Food and Drug Administration and to all 
investigators any findings associated with use of the new animal drug 
that may suggest significant hazards pertinent to the safety of the new 
animal drug.
    (iii) Shall not unduly prolong distribution of the new animal drug 
for investigational use.
    (iv) Shall not, nor shall any person acting for or on behalf of the 
sponsor, represent that the new animal drug is safe or effective for the 
purposes for which it is under investigation. This requirement is not 
intended to restrict the full exchange of scientific information.
    (v) Shall not commercially distribute nor test-market the new animal 
drug until a new animal drug application is approved pursuant to section 
512(c) of the act.

[[Page 55]]

    (9) If the shipment or other delivery of the new animal drug is 
imported or offered for importation into the United States for clinical 
investigational use in animals, it shall also meet the following 
conditions:
    (i) The importer of all such shipments or deliveries is an agent of 
the foreign exporter residing in the United States or the ultimate 
consignee, which person has, prior to such shipments and deliveries, 
informed the Food and Drug Administration of his intention to import the 
new animal drug as sponsor in compliance with the conditions prescribed 
in this subdivision; or
    (ii) The new animal drug is shipped directly to a scientific 
institution with adequate facilities and qualified personnel to conduct 
laboratory or clinical investigations and is intended solely for use in 
such institutions and which institution has submitted a statement as 
sponsor of the investigation.
    (10) The sponsor shall submit either a claim for categorical 
exclusion under Sec.  25.30 or Sec.  25.33 of this chapter or an 
environmental assessment under Sec.  25.40 of this chapter.
    (c) Withdrawal of eligibility to receive investigational-use new 
animal drugs. (1) Whenever the Food and Drug Administration has 
information indicating that an investigator has repeatedly or 
deliberately failed to comply with the conditions of these exempting 
regulations or has submitted false information either to the sponsor of 
the investigation or in any required report, the Center for Veterinary 
Medicine will furnish the investigator written notice of the matter 
complained of in general terms and offer him an opportunity to explain 
the matter in an informal conference and/or in writing. If an 
explanation is offered but not accepted by the Center for Veterinary 
Medicine, the investigator shall have an opportunity for a regulatory 
hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of 
this chapter on the question of whether the investigator is entitled to 
receive investigational new animal drugs.
    (2) If, after evaluating all available information, including any 
explanation presented by the investigator, the Commissioner determines 
that the investigator has repeatedly or deliberately failed to comply 
with the conditions of the exempting regulations in this section or has 
repeatedly or deliberately submitted false information to the sponsor of 
an investigation, the Commissioner will notify the investigator and the 
sponsor of any investigation in which he has been named as a participant 
that the investigator is not entitled to receive investigational use new 
animal drugs with a statement of the basis for such determination.
    (3) Each ``Notice of Claimed Investigational Exemption for a New 
Animal Drug'' and each approved new animal drug application containing 
data reported by an investigator who has been determined to be 
ineligible to receive investigational-use new animal drugs will be 
examined to determine whether he has submitted unreliable data that are 
essential to the continuation of the investigation or essential to the 
approval of any new animal drug application.
    (4) If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data 
submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that 
the data remaining are inadequate to support a conclusion that it is 
reasonably safe to continue the investigation, he shall first notify the 
sponsor, who shall have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before 
the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of this chapter on 
whether the exemption should be terminated. If a danger to the public 
health exists, however, he shall terminate the exemption forthwith and 
notify the sponsor of the termination. In such event the sponsor shall 
have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug 
Administration pursuant to part 16 (see 42 FR 15675, March 22, 1977) of 
this chapter on the question of whether the exemption should be 
reinstated.
    (5) If the Commissioner determines, after the unreliable data 
submitted by the investigator are eliminated from consideration, that 
the data remaining are such that a new animal drug application would not 
have been approved, he will proceed to withdraw approval of the 
application in accordance with section 512(e) of the act.

[[Page 56]]

    (6) An investigator who has been determined to be ineligible may be 
reinstated as eligible to receive investigational-use new animal drugs 
when the Commissioner determines that he has presented adequate 
assurance that he will employ such new animal drugs solely in compliance 
with the exempting regulations in this section for investigational-use 
new animal drugs.
    (d) Termination of exemption. If the Commissioner finds that:
    (1) The sponsor of the investigation has failed to comply with any 
of the conditions for the exemption established under this section, or
    (2) The continuance of the investigation is unsafe or otherwise 
contrary to the public interest or the drug is being or has been used 
for purposes other than bona fide scientific investigation, he shall 
first notify the sponsor and invite his immediate correction. If the 
conditions of the exemption are not immediately met, the sponsor shall 
have an opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug 
Administration pursuant of part 16 of this chapter on whether the 
exemption should be terminated. If the exemption is terminated the 
sponsor shall recall or have destroyed the unused supplies of the new 
animal drug.
    (e) Statements and requests. ``Notice(s) of Claimed Investigational 
Exemption for a New Animal Drug'' and requests for authorization to use 
investigational animals and their products for food should be addressed

    (f) Contract research organizations. (1) For purposes of this part 
and part 514, contract research organization means a person that 
assumes, as an independent contractor with the sponsor, one or more of 
the obligations of a sponsor, e.g., design of a protocol, selection or 
monitoring of investigations, evaluation of reports, and preparation of 
materials to be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.
    (2) A sponsor may transfer responsibility for any or all of the 
obligations set forth in this part to a contract research organization. 
Any such transfer shall be in writing and, if not all obligations are 
transferred, shall describe each of the obligations being assumed by the 
contract research organization. If all obligations are transferred, a 
general statement that all obligations have been transferred is 
acceptable. Any obligation not covered by the written description shall 
be deemed not to have been transferred.
    (3) A contract research organization that assumes any obligation of 
a sponsor shall comply with the specific regulations in this chapter 
applicable to this obligation and shall be subject to the same 
regulatory action as a sponsor for failure to comply with any obligation 
assumed under these regulations. Thus, all references to sponsor in this 
part apply to a contract research organization to the extent that it 
assumes one or more obligations of the sponsor.

subdivisions, each containing at least three

[[Page 61]]

times the amount required to perform the laboratory test procedures 
described in the application to determine compliance with its control 
specifications for identity and assays. Each of the samples submitted 
shall be appropriately packaged and labeled to preserve its 
characteristics, to identify the material and the quantity in each 
subdivision of the sample, and to identify each subdivision with the 
name of the applicant and the new animal drug application to which it 
relates. Included are:
    (a) A sample or samples of any reference standard and blank used in 
the procedures described in the application for assaying each new animal 
drug and other assayed components of the finished new animal drug.
    (b) A representative sample or samples of each strength of the 
finished dosage form proposed in the application and employed in the 
clinical investigations and a representative sample or samples of each 
new animal drug from the batch(es) employed in the production of such 
dosage form.
    (c) A representative sample or samples of finished market packages 
of each strength of the dosage form of the new animal drug prepared for 
initial marketing and, if any such sample is not from a representative 
commercial-scale production batch, such a sample from a representative 
commercial-scale production batch, and a representative sample or 
samples of each new animal drug from the batch(es) employed in the 
production of such dosage form, provided that in the case of new animal 
drugs marketed in large packages the sample should contain only three 
times a sufficient quantity of the new animal drug to allow for 
performing the control tests for drug identity and assays.
    (ii) The following information shall be included for the samples 
when requested:
    (a) For each sample submitted, full information regarding its 
identity and the origin of any new animal drug contained therein 
(including a statement whether it was produced on a laboratory, pilot-
plant, or full-production scale) and detailed results of all laboratory 
tests made to determine the identity, strength, quality, and purity of 
the batch represented by the sample, including assays.
    (b) For any reference standard submitted, a complete description of 
its preparation and the results of all laboratory tests on it. If the 
test methods used differed from those described in the application, full 
details of the methods employed in obtaining the reporting results.
    (7) Analytical methods for residues. Applications shall include a 
description of practicable methods for determining the quantity, if any, 
of the new animal drug in or on food, and any substance formed in or on 
food because of its use, and the proposed tolerance or withdrawal period 
or other use restrictions to ensure that the proposed use of this drug 
will be safe. When data or other adequate information establish that it 
is not reasonable to expect the new animal drug to become a component of 
food at concentrations considered unsafe, a regulatory method is not 
required.
    (i) The kind of information required by this subdivision may 
include: Complete experimental protocols for determining drug residue 
levels in the edible products, and the length of time required for 
residues to be eliminated from such products following the drug's use; 
residue studies conducted under appropriate (consistent with the 
proposed usage) conditions of dosage, time, and route of administration 
to show levels, if any, of the drug and/or its metabolites in test 
animals during and upon cessation of treatment and at intervals 
thereafter in order to establish a disappearance curve; if the drug is 
to be used in combination with other drugs, possible effects of 
interaction demonstrated by the appropriate disappearance curve or 
depletion patterns after drug withdrawal under appropriate (consistent 
with the proposed usage) conditions of dosage, time, and route of 
administration; if the drug is given in the feed or water, appropriate 
consumption records of the medicated feed or water and appropriate 
performance data in the treated animal; if the drug is to be used in 
more than one species, drug residue studies or appropriate metabolic 
studies conducted for each species that is food-producing. To provide 
these data, a sufficient number

[[Page 62]]

of birds or animals should be used at each sample interval. Appropriate 
use of labeled compounds (e.g. radioactive tracers), may be utilized to 
establish metabolism and depletion curves. Drug residue levels 
ordinarily should be determined in muscle, liver, kidney, and fat and 
where applicable, in skin, milk, and eggs (yolk and egg white). As a 
part of the metabolic studies, levels of the drug or metabolite should 
be determined in blood where feasible. Samples may be combined where 
necessary. Where residues are suspected or known to be present in litter 
from treated animals, it may be necessary to include data with respect 
to such residues becoming components of other agricultural commodities 
because of use of litter from treated animals.
    (ii) A new animal drug that has the potential to contaminate human 
food with residues whose consumption could present a risk of cancer to 
people must satisfy the requirements of subpart E of part 500 of this 
chapter.
    (8) Evidence to establish safety and effectiveness. (i) An 
application may be refused unless it contains full reports of adequate 
tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not the 
new animal drug is safe and effective for use as suggested in the 
proposed labeling.

evidence of the effectiveness of the new animal drug as defined in Sec.  
514.4.
    (iii) An application may be refused unless it contains detailed 
reports of the investigations, including studies made on laboratory 
animals, in which the purpose, methods, and results obtained are clearly 
set forth of acute, subacute, and chronic toxicity, and unless it 
contains appropriate clinical laboratory results related to safety and 
efficacy. Such information should include identification of the person 
who conducted each investigation, a statement of where the 
investigations were conducted, and where the raw data are available in 
the application.
    (iv) All information pertinent to an evaluation of the safety and 
effectiveness of the new animal drug received or otherwise obtained by 
the applicant from any source, including information derived from other 
investigations or commercial marketing (for example, outside the United 
States), or reports in the scientific literature, both favorable and 
unfavorable, involving the new animal drug that is the subject of the 
application and related new animal drugs shall be submitted. An adequate 
summary may be acceptable in lieu of a reprint of a published report 
that only supports other data submitted. Include any evaluation of the 
safety or effectiveness of the new animal drug that has been made by the 
applicant's veterinary or medical department, expert committee, or 
consultants.
    (v) If the new animal drug is a combination of active ingredients or 
animal drugs, an application may be refused unless it includes 
substantial evidence of the effectiveness of the combination new animal 
drug as required in Sec.  514.4.
    (vi) An application shall include a complete list of the names and 
post office addresses of all investigators who received the new animal 
drug. This may be incorporated in whole or in part by reference to 
information submitted under the provisions of Sec.  511.1 of this 
chapter.
    (vii) Explain any omission of reports from any investigator to whom 
the investigational new animal drug has been made available. The 
unexplained omission of any reports of investigations made with the new 
animal drug by the applicant or submitted to him by an investigator or 
the unexplained omission of any pertinent reports of investigations or 
clinical experience received or otherwise obtained by the applicant from 
published literature or other sources that would bias an evaluation of 
the safety of the new animal drug or its effectiveness in use, 
constitutes grounds for the refusal or withdrawal of the approval of an 
application.
    (viii) If a sponsor has transferred any obligations for the conduct 
of any clinical study to a contract research organization, the 
application is required to include a statement containing the name and 
address of the contract research organization, identifying the clinical 
study, and listing the obligations transferred. If all obligations 
governing the conduct of the study have been transferred, a general 
statement of this transfer--in lieu of a listing of

[[Page 63]]

the specific obligations transferred--may be submitted.
    (ix) If original subject records were audited or reviewed by the 
sponsor in the course of monitoring any clinical study to verify the 
accuracy of the case reports submitted to the sponsor, a list

    (v) Include complete labeling in each of the copies. It is suggested 
that labeling be identified by date of printing or date of preparation.
    (vi) Submit separate applications for each different dosage form of 
the drug proposed. Repeating basic information pertinent to all dosage 
forms in each application is unnecessary if reference is made to the 
application containing such information. Include in each application 
information applicable to the specific dosage form, such as labeling, 
composition, stability data, and method of manufacture.
    (vii) Submit in folders amendments, supplements, and other 
correspondence sent after submission of an original application. The 
front cover of these submissions should be identified with the name of 
the applicant, new animal

[[Page 64]]

drug, copy number, and the new animal drug application number, if known.
    (c) When a new animal drug application is submitted for a new animal 
drug which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the 
central nervous system, if it appears that the drug has a potential for 
abuse, the Commissioner shall forward that information to the Attorney 
General of the United States.
    (d) Minor use applications. Applications for minor use new animal 
drugs:
    (1) Definitions. For the purpose of this section:
    (i) Minor use means the use of: (a) New animal drugs in minor animal 
species, or (b) new animal drugs in any animal species for the control 
of a disease that (1) occurs infrequently or (2) occurs in limited 
geographic areas.
    (ii) Minor species means animals other than cattle, horses, swine, 
chickens, turkeys, dogs, and cats.
    (2) Animal safety, effectiveness, human food safety, and 
environmental considerations. Guidance documents for the preparation and 
submission of data to satisfy the requirements of section 512 of the act 
regarding animal safety, effectiveness, human food safety, and 
environmental considerations for new animal drugs intended for a minor 
use (as defined in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) are available 
from the Industry Information Staff (HFV-11), Center for Veterinary 
Medicine, Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 
20855.
    (i) Animal safety and effectiveness. Where the guidance documents do 
not specifically provide for a particular minor use, the Center for 
Veterinary Medicine, upon request, will advise interested persons on the 
effectiveness and animal safety data regarding the minor use that will 
be needed to satisfy the requirements of section 512 of the act. Where 
scientifically appropriate, the Center for Veterinary Medicine will 
allow the use of animal models and the extrapolation of data from a 
major species to a minor species to satisfy the requirements of the act.
    (ii) Human food safety and environmental considerations. These 
guidance documents do not specifically provide for a particular minor 
use. Therefore, the Center for Veterinary Medicine will, upon request, 
advise interested persons of the data that will be needed. Where 
scientifically appropriate, the Center for Veterinary Medicine will 
allow the extrapolation of data from a major species to a minor species 
to satisfy the requirements of the act.

Sec.  514.3  Definitions.

    The definition and interpretation of terms contained in this section 
apply to those terms as used throughout subchapter E.
    Adverse drug experience is any adverse event associated with the use 
of a new animal drug, whether or not considered to be drug related, and 
whether or not the new animal drug was used in accordance with the 
approved labeling (i.e., used according to label directions or used in 
an extralabel manner, including but not limited to different route of 
administration, different species, different indications, or other than 
labeled dosage). Adverse drug experience includes, but is not limited 
to:
    (1) An adverse event occurring in animals in the course of the use 
of an animal drug product by a veterinarian or by a livestock producer 
or other animal owner or caretaker.
    (2) Failure of a new animal drug to produce its expected 
pharmacological or clinical effect (lack of expected effectiveness).
    (3) An adverse event occurring in humans from exposure during 
manufacture, testing, handling, or use of a new animal drug.
    ANADA is an abbreviated new animal drug application including all 
amendments and supplements.
    Applicant is a person or entity who owns or holds on behalf of the 
owner the approval for an NADA or an ANADA, and is responsible for 
compliance with applicable provisions of the act and regulations.
    Increased frequency of adverse drug experience is an increased rate 
of occurrence of a particular serious adverse drug event, expected or 
unexpected,

[[Page 65]]

after appropriate adjustment for drug exposure.
    NADA is a new animal drug application including all amendments and 
supplements.
    Nonapplicant is any person other than the applicant whose name 
appears on the label and who is engaged in manufacturing, packing, 
distribution, or labeling of the product.
    Product defect/manufacturing defect is the deviation of a 
distributed product from the standards specified in the approved 
application, or any significant chemical, physical, or other change, or 
deterioration in the distributed drug product, including any microbial 
or chemical contamination. A manufacturing defect is a product defect 
caused or aggravated by a manufacturing or related process. A 
manufacturing defect may occur from a single event or from deficiencies 
inherent to the manufacturing process. These defects are generally 
associated with product contamination, product deterioration, 
manufacturing error, defective packaging, damage from disaster, or 
labeling error. For example, a labeling error may include any incident 
that causes a distributed product to be mistaken for, or its labeling 
applied to, another product.
    Serious adverse drug experience is an adverse event that is fatal, 
or life-threatening, or requires professional intervention, or causes an 
abortion, or stillbirth, or infertility, or congenital anomaly, or 
prolonged or permanent disability, or disfigurement.
    Unexpected adverse drug experience is an adverse event that is not 
listed in the current labeling for the new animal drug and includes any 
event that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an 
event listed on the labeling, but differs from the event because of 
greater severity or specificity. For example, under this definition 
hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the labeling referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.

<R05>
Sec.  514.4  Substantial evidence.

    (a) Definition of substantial evidence. Substantial evidence means 
evidence consisting of one or more adequate and well-controlled studies, 
such as a study in a target species, study in laboratory animals, field 
study, bioequivalence study, or an in vitro study, on the basis of which 
it could fairly and reasonably be concluded by experts qualified by 
scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
new animal drug involved that the new animal drug will have the effect 
it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use 
prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed 
labeling thereof. Substantial evidence shall include such adequate and 
well-controlled studies that are, as a matter of sound scientific 
judgment, necessary to establish that a new animal drug will have its 
intended effect.
    (b) Characteristics of substantial evidence--(1) Qualifications of 
experts. Any study that is intended to be part of substantial evidence 
of the effectiveness of a new animal drug shall be conducted by experts 
qualified by scientific training and experience.
    (2) Intended uses and conditions of use. Substantial evidence of 
effectiveness of a new animal drug shall demonstrate that the new animal 
drug is effective for each intended use and associated conditions of use 
for and under which approval is sought.
    (i) Dose range labeling. Sponsors should, to the extent possible, 
provide for a dose range because it increases the utility of the new 
animal drug by providing the user flexibility in the selection of a safe 
and effective dose. In general, substantial evidence to support dose 
range labeling for a new animal drug intended for use in the diagnosis, 
cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease must consist of at 
least one adequate and well-controlled study on the basis of which 
qualified experts could fairly and reasonably conclude that the new 
animal drug will be effective for the intended use at the lowest dose of 
the dose range suggested in the proposed labeling for that intended use. 
Substantial evidence to support dose range labeling for a new animal 
drug intended to affect the

[[Page 66]]

structure or function of the body of an animal generally must consist of 
at least one adequate and well-controlled study on the basis of which 
qualified experts could fairly and reasonably conclude that the new 
animal drug will be effective for the intended use at all doses within 
the range suggested in the proposed labeling for the intended use.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) Studies--(i) Number. Substantial evidence of the effectiveness 
of a new animal drug for each intended use and associated conditions of 
use shall consist of a sufficient number of current adequate and well-
controlled studies of sufficient quality and persuasiveness to permit 
qualified experts:
    (A) To determine that the parameters selected for measurement and 
the measured responses reliably reflect the effectiveness of the new 
animal drug;
    (B) To determine that the results obtained are likely to be 
repeatable, and that valid inferences can be drawn to the target animal 
population; and
    (C) To conclude that the new animal drug is effective for the 
intended use at the dose or dose range and associated conditions of use 
prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling.
    (ii) Types. Adequate and well-controlled studies that are intended 
to provide substantial evidence of the effectiveness of a new animal 
drug may include, but are not limited to, published studies, foreign 
studies, studies using models, and studies conducted by or on behalf of 
the sponsor. Studies using models shall be validated to establish an 
adequate relationship of parameters measured and effects observed in the 
model with one or more significant effects of treatment.
    (c) Substantial evidence for combination new animal drugs--(1) 
Definitions. The following definitions of terms apply to this section:
    (i) Combination new animal drug means a new animal drug that 
contains more than one active ingredient or animal drug that is applied 
or administered simultaneously in a single dosage form or simultaneously 
in or on animal feed or drinking water.
    (ii) Dosage form combination new animal drug means a combination new 
animal drug intended for use other than in animal feed or drinking 
water.
    (iii) Antibacterial with respect to a particular target animal 
species means an active ingredient or animal drug: That is approved in 
that species for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or 
prevention of bacterial disease; or that is approved for use in that 
species for any other use that is attributable to its antibacterial 
properties. But, antibacterial does not include ionophores or arsenicals 
intended for use in combination in animal feed or drinking water.
    (iv) Appropriate concurrent use exists when there is credible 
evidence that the conditions for which the combination new animal drug 
is intended can occur simultaneously.
    (2) Combination new animal drugs that contain only active 
ingredients or animal drugs that have previously been separately 
approved.
    (i) For dosage form combination new animal drugs, except for those 
that contain a nontopical antibacterial, that contain only active 
ingredients or animal drugs that have previously been separately 
approved for the particular uses and conditions of use for which they 
are intended in combination, a sponsor shall demonstrate:
    (A) By substantial evidence, as defined in this section, that any 
active ingredient or animal drug intended only for the same use as 
another active ingredient or animal drug in the combination makes a 
contribution to the effectiveness of the combination new animal drug;
    (B) That each active ingredient or animal drug intended for at least 
one use that is different from all the other active ingredients or 
animal drugs used in the combination provides appropriate concurrent use 
for the intended target animal population; and
    (C) That the active ingredients or animal drugs are physically 
compatible and do not have disparate dosing regimens if FDA, based on 
scientific information, has reason to believe the active ingredients or 
animal drugs are physically incompatible or have disparate dosing 
regimens.
    (ii) For combination new animal drugs intended for use in animal 
feed

[[Page 67]]

or drinking water that contain only active ingredients or animal drugs 
that have previously been separately approved for the particular uses 
and conditions of use for which they are intended in combination, the 
sponsor shall demonstrate:
    (A) By substantial evidence, as defined in this section, that any 
active ingredient or animal drug intended only for the same use as 
another active ingredient or animal drug in the combination makes a 
contribution to the effectiveness of the combination new animal drug;
    (B) For such combination new animal drugs that contain more than one 
antibacterial ingredient or animal drug, by substantial evidence, as 
defined in this section, that each antibacterial makes a contribution to 
labeled effectiveness;
    (C) That each active ingredient or animal drug intended for at least 
one use that is different from all other active ingredients or animal 
drugs used in the combination provides appropriate concurrent use for 
the intended target animal population; and
    (D) That the active ingredients or animal drugs intended for use in 
drinking water are physically compatible if FDA, based on scientific 
information, has reason to believe the active ingredients or animal 
drugs are physically incompatible.
    (3) Other combination new animal drugs. For all other combination 
new animal drugs, the sponsor shall demonstrate by substantial evidence, 
as defined in this section, that the combination new animal drug will 
have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the 
conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed 
labeling and that each active ingredient or animal drug contributes to 
the effectiveness of the combination new animal drug.

[64 FR 40756, July 28, 1999]


<R05>
Sec.  514.6  Amended applications.

    The applicant may submit an amendment to an application that is 
pending, including changes that may alter the conditions of use, the 
labeling, safety, effectiveness, identity, strength, quality, or purity 
of the drug or the adequacy of the manufacturing methods, facilities, 
and controls to preserve them, in which case the unamended application 
may be considered as withdrawn and the amended application may be 
considered resubmitted on the date on which the amendment is received by 
the Food and Drug Administration. The applicant will be notified of such 
date.


<R05>
Sec.  514.7  Withdrawal of applications without prejudice.

    The sponsor may withdraw his pending application from consideration 
as a new animal drug application upon written notification to the Food 
and Drug Administration. Such withdrawal may be made without prejudice 
to a future filing. Upon resubmission, the time limitation will begin to 
run from the date the resubmission is received by the Food and Drug 
Administration. The original application will be retained by the Food 
and Drug Administration although it is considered withdrawn. The 
applicant shall be furnished a copy at cost on request.


<R05>
Sec.  514.8  Supplemental new animal drug applications.

    (a)(1) After a new animal drug application is approved, a 
supplemental new animal drug application may propose changes. A 
supplemental application may omit statements made in the approved 
application concerning which no change is proposed. Each supplemental 
application shall include up-to-date reports of any of the kinds of 
information required by Sec.  510.300(a) of this chapter that has not 
previously been submitted. A supplemental application shall be 
accompanied by either a claim for categorical exclusion under Sec.  
25.30 or Sec.  25.33 of this chapter or an environmental assessment 
under Sec.  25.40 of this chapter.
    (2) A supplemental new animal drug application shall be submitted 
for any change beyond the variations provided for in the application, 
including changes in the scale of production such as from pilot-plant to 
production batch, that may alter the conditions of use, the labeling, 
safety, effectiveness, identity, strength, quality, or purity of the new 
animal drug, or the adequacy of the manufacturing methods, facilities, 
or controls to preserve them.

[[Page 68]]

    (3) If it is a prescription drug, any mailing or promotional piece 
used after the drug is placed on the market is labeling requiring a 
supplemental application, unless:
    (i) The parts of the labeling furnishing directions, warnings, and 
information for use of the drug are the same in language and emphasis as 
labeling approved or permitted; and
    (ii) Any other parts of the labeling are consistent with and not 
contrary to such approved or permitted labeling.
    (4) The supplemental application shall be submitted as follows. A 
communication proposing a change in a new animal drug application should 
provide for any one of the following kinds of changes:
    (i) Revision in labeling, such as updating information pertaining to 
effects, dosages, and side effects and contraindications, which includes 
information headed ``side effects,'' ``warnings,'' ``precautions,'' and 
``contraindications.''
    (ii) Addition of claim.
    (iii) Revision in manufacturing or control procedures; for example, 
changes in components, composition, method of manufacture, analytical 
control procedures, package or tablet size, etc.
    (iv) Change in manufacturing facilities.
    (v) Provision for outside firm to participate in the preparation, 
distribution, or packaging of a new animal drug (new distributor, 
packer, supplier, manufacturer, etc.); one firm per submission.

Any number of changes may be submitted at any one time; but if they fall 
into different categories as listed in paragraphs (a)(4) (i) through (v) 
of this section, the proposed changes should be covered by separate 
communications. Where, however, a change necessitates an overlap in 
categories, it should be submitted in a single communication. For 
example, a change in tablet potency would require other changes such as 
in components, composition, and labeling and should be submitted in a 
single communication.
    (5) The following kinds of changes may be placed into effect without 
the approval of a supplemental application, if such change is fully 
described in the next periodic report required under Sec.  510.300(b)(4) 
of this chapter or, when such a report is not required, in a written 
communication to the Food and Drug Administration within 60 days of the 
effective date of the change (this does not apply to a change proposed 
because of any mixup or any bacteriological or significant chemical, 
physical, or other change or deterioration in the drug or any failure of 
one or more distributed batches of the drug to meet its specifications):
    (i) A different container size for solid oral dosage forms where 
container and closure are of the same materials as those provided for in 
the approved application.
    (ii) Change in personnel not involving new facilities.
    (iii) Change in equipment that does not alter the method of 
manufacture of a new animal drug.
    (iv) Change from one commercial batch size to another without any 
change in manufacturing procedure.
    (v) Change to more stringent specification without altering the 
method described in the approved application.
    (vi) Inclusion of additional specifications and methods without 
deletion of those described in the approved application.
    (vii) Alteration of specifications or methods for inactive 
ingredients to bring them into compliance with new or revised 
specifications or methods in an official compendium.
    (viii) Initiation of a product identification coding system.
    (ix) Addition to labeling of a reasonable expiration date where none 
was previously used, with related conditions of drug storage when 
appropriate, except when evidence shows that a significant deterioration 
of the drug under marketing conditions has occurred which necessitates 
the immediate submission of a report under Sec.  510.300(b)(1) of this 
chapter. The report or written communication describing such change in 
labeling should include stability data justifying the expiration date 
and recommended conditions of storage.
    (x) Change from paper labels to direct printing on glass or other 
kinds of immediate containers without a change in text.

[[Page 69]]

    (6) Approval of a supplemental new animal drug application will not 
be required to provide for an additional distributor to distribute a 
drug which is the subject of an approved new animal drug application if 
the conditions described below are met prior to putting such a change 
into effect. An order may issue refusing approval if any condition is 
not met or if any of the reasons for refusing or withdrawing approval, 
as stated in section 512(d) and (e) of the act or Sec.  514.110 applies. 
For the purposes of maintaining records and making reports under the 
requirements of Sec.  510.300 of this chapter, a distributor provided 
for under this section shall be considered an applicant within the 
meaning of Sec.  510.300(b) of this chapter. Said conditions are:
    (i) A supplemental application is furnished to the Food and Drug 
Administration to provide for a designated distributor.
    (ii) There are no changes from the conditions of the approved 
application except for a different and suitable proprietary name of the 
new animal drug (if one is used) and the name and address of the 
distributor as used on the label and labeling. The name of the 
distributor shall be accompanied by an appropriate qualifying phrase 
such as ``manufactured for'' or ``distributed by.''
    (iii) A distributor's statement is furnished to the Food and Drug 
Administration identifying the category of his operations (for example, 
wholesaler, retailer) and stating: That he will distribute the new 
animal drug only under the labeling provided for in the new animal drug 
application; that any other labeling or advertising for the drug will 
prescribe, recommend, or suggest its use only under the conditions 
stated in the labeling provided for in the application; and, if the drug 
is a prescription article, that he is regularly and lawfully engaged in 
the distribution or dispensing of prescription drugs.
    (iv) Nine copies of the printed labels and other labeling to be used 
by the distributor are submitted, identified with the new animal drug 
application number.
    (b) When necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the drug, a 
supplemental new animal drug application shall specify a period of time 
within which the proposed change will be made.
    (c) If a material change is made in the components' composition, 
manufacturing methods, facilities, or controls, or in the labeling or 
advertising, from the representations in an approved application for a 
new animal drug (except changes conforming to the conditions set forth 
in paragraph (a)(5) and (6) and/or paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of 
this section), and the drug is marketed before a supplement is approved 
for such change, approval of the application may be suspended or 
withdrawn as provided in section 512(e) of the act.
    (d) Changes of the following kinds proposed in supplemental new 
animal drug applications should be placed into effect at the earliest 
possible time:
    (1) The addition to package labeling, promotional labeling, and 
prescription drug advertising of additional warning, contraindication, 
side effect, and precaution information.
    (2) The deletion from package labeling, promotional labeling, and 
drug advertising of false, misleading, or unsupported indications for 
use or claims for effectiveness.
    (3) Changes in the methods, facilities, or controls used for the 
manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of the new animal drug 
(other than utilization of establishments not covered by the approval 
that is in effect) that give increased assurance that the drug will have 
the characteristics of identity, strength, quality, and purity which it 
purports or is represented to possess.
    (e) The Food and Drug Administration will take no action against a 
new animal drug or applicant solely because changes of the kinds 
described in paragraph (d) of this section are placed into effect by the 
applicant prior to his receipt of a written notice of approval of the 
supplemental new animal drug application if all the following conditions 
are met:
    (1) The supplemental new animal drug application providing a full 
explanation of the basis for the changes has been submitted, plainly 
marked on the mailing cover and on the supplement,

[[Page 70]]

``Special new animal drug application Supplement--changes being 
effected.''
    (2) The applicant specifically informs the Food and Drug 
Administration of the date on which such changes are being effected and 
submits to the Administration nine printed copies of any revised 
labeling to be placed in use, identified with the new animal drug 
application number.
    (3) All promotional labeling and all drug advertising are promptly 
revised consistent with the changes made in the labeling on or within 
the new animal drug package.
    (f) When a supplemental new animal drug application proposes changes 
only of the kinds described in paragraph (d) of this section, and the 
applicant informs the Food and Drug Administration that the changes are 
being put into effect, such notification will be regarded as an 
agreement by the applicant to an extension of the time for formal action 
on the application.
    (g) In addition to changes as permitted by paragraphs (d) and (e) of 
this section, an applicant may place into effect changes proposed in a 
supplement to a new animal drug application that became effective prior 
to October 10, 1962, upon written notification from the Food and Drug 
Administration that such action is permitted, without approval of the 
supplemental application, pending the completion of the review of the 
effectiveness of such drug by the National Academy of Sciences-National 
Research Council and a determination as to whether there are grounds for 
refusing approval under section 512(d) of the act or for invoking 
section 512(e) of the act. The Food and Drug Administration will take no 
action against a new animal drug or an applicant solely because changes 
that have been permitted in a written communication are placed into 
effect by the applicant prior to his receipt of a written notice of 
approval of the supplemental new animal drug application.
    (h) Except as provided in paragraphs (e) and (g) of this section, no 
provision of this section shall limit the authority of the Secretary or 
of the Commissioner to suspend or withdraw approval of a new animal drug 
application in accord with the provisions of section 512(e) of the act 
or to initiate any other regulatory proceedings with respect to a drug 
or applicant under provisions of the act.
    (i) Changes from the conditions of an approved new animal drug 
application in accord with the provisions of paragraphs (d), (e), and 
(g) of this section are permitted on the basis of a temporary deferral 
of final action on the supplemental application under the provisions of 
section 512 (c), (d), or (e) of the act.
    (j) When an applicant receives written notification from the Food 
and Drug Administration, under the provisions of paragraph (g) of this 
section, that he may place into effect changes proposed in a 
supplemental application without approval of the supplemental 
application, he may within 30 days submit a written request that the 
Food and Drug Administration process the supplemental application. In 
such case, the change shall not be put into effect until approved. 
Within 180 days of the receipt of such written request, the Food and 
Drug Administration will approve the supplemental application or furnish 
notice of an opportunity for a hearing under the provisions of section 
512 (d) or (e), or both, of the act on a proposal to refuse approval of 
the supplemental application or to withdraw approval of the application 
and supplements thereto.
    (k) A supplement to an application that became effective prior to 
October 10, 1962, may include a written statement to the effect that a 
temporary deferral of final action under the provisions of paragraph 
(d), (e), or (g) of this section is unacceptable to the applicant and 
that the applicant requests action as provided in section 512(c) of the 
act. Final action on such supplemental applications will be expedited in 
accord with applicable provisions of section 512 of the act and 
regulations in this subchapter E. In such cases, if the applicant places 
into effect any of the proposed changes prior to his receipt of a 
written notice of approval of the supplemental new animal drug 
application, such action may be regarded by the Food and Drug 
Administration as a basis for invoking the provisions of section 
512(e)(1)(D) of the act; that

[[Page 71]]

is, the applicant may be furnished notice of an opportunity for a 
hearing on a proposal to withdraw approval of the application on the 
ground that the application contains an untrue statement of a material 
fact related to the changes from the conditions approved in the 
application.
    (l) A supplemental application that contains nonclinical laboratory 
studies shall include, with respect to each nonclinical study, either a 
statement that the study was conducted in compliance with the 
requirements set forth in part 58 of this chapter, or, if the study was 
not conducted in compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of 
the reason for the noncompliance.

    (a) For purposes of this section the NADA file includes all data and 
information submitted with or incorporated by reference in the NADA, 
INAD's incorporated into the NADA, supplemental NADA's, reports under 
Sec. Sec.  510.300 and 510.301 of this chapter, master files, and other 
related submissions. The availability for public disclosure of any 
record in the NADA file shall be handled in accordance with the 
provisions of this section.
    (b) The existence of an NADA file will not be disclosed by the Food 
and Drug Administration before an approval has been published in the 
Federal Register, unless it has previously been publicly disclosed or 
acknowledged.
    (c) If the existence of an NADA file has not been publicly disclosed 
or acknowledged, no data or information in the NADA file is available 
for public disclosure.
    (d) If the existence of an NADA file has been publicly disclosed or 
acknowledged before an approval has been published in the Federal 
Register, no data or information contained in the file is available for 
public disclosure before such approval is published, but the 
Commissioner may, in his discretion, disclose a summary of such selected 
portions of the safety and effectiveness data as are appropriate for 
public consideration of a specific pending issue, e.g., at an open 
session of a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee or pursuant 
to an exchange of important regulatory information with a foreign 
government.
    (e) After an approval has been published in the Federal Register, 
the following data and information in the NADA file are immediately 
available for public disclosure unless extraordinary circumstances are 
shown:
    (1) All safety and effectiveness data and information previously 
disclosed to the public, as defined in Sec.  20.81 of this chapter.
    (2) A summary or summaries of the safety and effectiveness data and 
information submitted with or incorporated by reference in the NADA 
file. Such summaries do not constitute the full reports of 
investigations under section 512(b)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360b(b)(1)) 
on which the safety or effectiveness of the drug may be approved. Such 
summaries shall consist of the following:
    (i) For an NADA approved prior to July 1, 1975, internal agency 
records that describe such data and information, e.g., a summary of 
basis for approval or internal reviews of the data and information, 
after deletion of:
    (a) Names and any information that would identify the investigators.

[[Page 72]]

    (b) Any inappropriate gratuitous comments unnecessary to an 
objective analysis of the data and information.
    (ii) For an NADA approved on or after July 1, 1975, a summary of 
such data and information prepared in one of the following two 
alternative ways shall be publicly released when the approval is 
published in the Federal Register.
    (a) The Center for Veterinary Medicine may at an appropriate time 
prior to approval of the NADA require the applicant to prepare a summary 
of such data and information, which will be reviewed and, where 
appropriate, revised by the Center.
    (b) The Center for Veterinary Medicine may prepare its own summary 
of such data and information.
    (3) A protocol for a test or study, unless it is shown to fall 
within the exemption established for trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information in Sec.  20.61 of this chapter.
    (4) Adverse reaction reports, product experience reports, consumer 
complaints, and other similar data and information, after deletion of:
    (i) Names and any information that would identify the person using 
the product.
    (ii) Names and any information that would identify any third party 
involved with the report, such as a physician, hospital, or other 
institution.
    (5) A list of all active ingredients and any inactive ingredients 
previously disclosed to the public as defined in Sec.  20.81 of this 
chapter.
    (6) An assay method or other analytical method, unless it serves no 
regulatory or compliance purpose and is shown to fall within the 
exemption established in Sec.  20.61 of this chapter.
    (7) All correspondence and written summaries of oral discussions 
relating to the NADA, in accordance with the provisions of part 20 of 
this chapter.
    (f) All safety and effectiveness data and information not previously 
disclosed to the public are available for public disclosure at the time 
any one of the following events occurs unless extraordinary 
circumstances are known:
    (1) The NADA has been abandoned and no further work is being 
undertaken with respect to it.
    (2) A final determination is made that the NADA is not approvable, 
and all legal appeals have been exhausted.
    (3) Approval of the NADA is withdrawn, and all legal appeals have 
been exhausted.
    (4) A final determination has been made that the animal drug is not 
a new animal drug.
    (5) A final determination has been made that the animal drug may be 
marketed without submission of such safety and/or effectiveness data and 
information.
    (g) The following data and information in an NADA file are not 
available for public disclosure unless they have been previously 
disclosed to the public as defined in Sec.  20.81 of this chapter or 
they relate to a product or ingredient that has been abandoned and they 
no longer represent a trade secret or confidential commercial or 
financial information as defined in Sec.  20.61 of this chapter:
    (1) Manufacturing methods or processes, including quality control 
procedures.
    (2) Production, sales, distribution, and similar data and 
information, except that any compilation of such data and information 
aggregated and prepared in a way that does not reveal data or 
information which is not available for public disclosure under this 
provision is available for public disclosure.
    (3) Quantitative or semiquantitative formulas.
    (h) For purposes of this regulation, safety and effectiveness data 
include all studies and tests of an animal drug on animals and all 
studies and tests on the animal drug for identity, stability, purity, 
potency, and bioavailability.

Sec.  514.15  Untrue statements in applications.

    Among the reasons why an application for a new animal drug or animal 
feed bearing or containing a new animal drug may contain an untrue 
statement of a material fact are:
    (a) Differences in:
    (1) Conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested by the 
applicant for the product from the conditions of such use stated in the 
application;
    (2) Articles used as components of the product from those listed in 
the application;
    (3) Composition of the product from that stated in the application;
    (4) Methods used in or the facilities and controls used for the 
manufacture, processing, or packing of the product from such methods, 
facilities, and controls described in the application;
    (5) Labeling from the specimens contained in the application; or
    (b) The unexplained omission in whole or in part from an application 
or from an amendment or supplement to an application or from any record 
or report required under the provisions of section 512 of the act and 
Sec.  510.300 or Sec.  510.301 of this chapter of any information 
obtained from:
    (1) Investigations as to the safety, effectiveness, identity, 
strength, quality, or purity of the drug, made by the applicant on the 
drug, or
    (2) Investigations or experience with the product that is the 
subject of the application, or any related product, available to the 
applicant from any source if such information is pertinent to an 
evaluation of the safety, effectiveness, identity, strength, quality, or 
purity of the drug, when such omission would bias an evaluation of the 
safety or effectiveness of the product.
    (c) Any nonclinical laboratory study contained in the application 
was not conducted in compliance with the good laboratory practice 
regulations as set forth in part 58 of this chapter, and the application 
fails to include a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (a) Applicability. (1) Each applicant must establish and maintain 
indexed and complete files containing full records of all information 
pertinent to safety or effectiveness of a new animal drug that has not 
been previously submitted as part of the NADA or ANADA. Such records 
must include information from domestic as well as foreign sources. Each 
nonapplicant must establish and maintain indexed and complete files 
containing full records of all information pertinent to safety or 
effectiveness of a new animal drug that is received or otherwise 
obtained by the nonapplicant. Such records must include information from 
domestic as well as foreign sources.
    (2) Each applicant must submit reports of data, studies, and other 
information concerning experience with new animal drugs to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) for each approved NADA and ANADA, as required 
in this section. A nonapplicant must submit data, studies, and other 
information concerning experience with new animal drugs to the 
appropriate applicant, as required in this section. The applicant, in 
turn, must report the nonapplicant's data, studies, and other 
information to FDA. Applicants and nonapplicants must submit data, 
studies, and other information described in this section from domestic, 
as well as foreign sources.
    (3) FDA reviews the records and reports required in this section to 
facilitate a determination under section 512(e) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(e)) as to whether there may be 
grounds for suspending or withdrawing approval of the NADA or ANADA.
    (4) The requirements of this section also apply to any approved Type 
A medicated article. In addition, the requirements contained in Sec.  
514.80(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(4)(iv), and (b)(4)(v) apply to any approved 
Type A medicated article incorporated in animal feeds.
    (5) The records and reports referred to in this section are in 
addition to those required by the current good manufacturing practice 
regulations in parts 211, 225, and 226 of this chapter.
    (b) Reporting requirements--(1) Three-day NADA/ANADA field alert 
report. This report provides information pertaining to product and 
manufacturing defects that may result in serious adverse drug events. 
The applicant (or nonapplicant through the applicant)

[[Page 76]]

must submit the report to the appropriate FDA District Office or local 
FDA resident post within 3 working days of first becoming aware that a 
defect may exist. The information initially may be provided by telephone 
or other telecommunication means, with prompt written followup using 
Form FDA 1932 ``Veterinary Adverse Drug Reaction, Lack of Effectiveness, 
Product Defect Report.'' The mailing cover for these reports must be 
plainly marked ``3-Day NADA/ANADA Field Alert Report.''
    (2) Fifteen-day NADA/ANADA alert report--(i) Initial report. This 
report provides information on each serious, unexpected adverse drug 
event, regardless of the source of the information. The applicant (or 
nonapplicant through the applicant) must submit the report to FDA within 
15 working days of first receiving the information. The report must be 
submitted on Form FDA 1932, and its mailing cover must be plainly marked 
``15-Day NADA/ANADA Alert Report.''
    (ii) Followup report. The applicant must promptly investigate all 
adverse drug events that are the subject of 15-day NADA/ANADA alert 
reports. If this investigation reveals significant new information, a 
followup report must be submitted within 15 working days of receiving 
such information. A followup report must be submitted on Form FDA 1932, 
and its mailing cover must be plainly marked ``15-Day NADA/ANADA Alert 
Report Followup.'' The followup report must state the date of the 
initial report and provide the additional information. If additional 
information is sought but not obtained within 3 months of the initial 
report, a followup report is required describing the steps taken and why 
additional information was not obtained.
    (3) Nonapplicant report. Nonapplicants must forward reports of 
adverse drug experiences to the applicant within 3 working days of first 
receiving the information. The applicant must then submit the report(s) 
to FDA as required in this section. The nonapplicant must maintain 
records of all nonapplicant reports, including the date the nonapplicant 
received the information concerning adverse drug experiences, the name 
and address of the applicant, and a copy of the adverse drug experience 
report including the date such report was submitted to the applicant. If 
the nonapplicant elects to also report directly to FDA, the nonapplicant 
should submit the report on Form FDA 1932 within 15 working days of 
first receiving the information.
    (4) Periodic drug experience report. This report must be accompanied 
by a completed Form FDA 2301 ``Transmittal of Periodic Reports and 
Promotional Materials for New Animal Drugs.'' It must be submitted every 
6 months for the first 2 years following approval of an NADA or ANADA 
and yearly thereafter. Reports required by this section must contain 
data and information for the full reporting period. The 6-month periodic 
drug experience reports must be submitted within 30 days following the 
end of the 6-month reporting period. The yearly periodic drug experience 
reports must be submitted within 60 days of the anniversary date of the 
approval of the NADA or ANADA. Any previously submitted information 
contained in the report must be identified as such. For yearly (annual) 
periodic drug experience reports, the applicant may petition FDA to 
change the date of submission or frequency of reporting, and after 
approval of such petition, file such reports on the new filing date or 
at the new reporting frequency. Also, FDA may require a report at 
different times or more frequently. The periodic drug experience report 
must contain the following:
    (i) Distribution data. Information about the distribution of each 
new animal drug product, including information on any distributor-
labeled product. This information must include the total number of 
distributed units of each size, strength, or potency (e.g., 100,000 
bottles of 100 5-milligram tablets; 50,000 10-milliliter vials of 5-
percent solution). This information must be presented in two categories: 
Quantities distributed domestically and quantities exported.
    (ii) Labeling. Applicant and distributor current package labeling, 
including package inserts (if any). For large-size package labeling or 
large shipping cartons, a representative copy must be submitted (e.g., a 
photocopy of

[[Page 77]]

pertinent areas of large feed bags). A summary of any changes in 
labeling made since the last report (listed by date of implementation) 
must be included with the labeling or if there have been no changes, a 
statement of such fact must be included with the labeling.
    (iii) Nonclinical laboratory studies and clinical data not 
previously reported.
    (A) Copies of in vitro studies (e.g., mutagenicity) and other 
nonclinical laboratory studies conducted by or otherwise obtained by the 
applicant.
    (B) Copies of published clinical trials of the new animal drug (or 
abstracts of them) including clinical trials on safety and 
effectiveness, clinical trials on new uses, and reports of clinical 
experience pertinent to safety conducted by or otherwise obtained by the 
applicant. Review articles, papers, and abstracts in which the drug is 
used as a research tool, promotional articles, press clippings, and 
papers that do not contain tabulations or summaries of original data are 
not required to be reported.
    (C) Descriptions of completed clinical trials conducted by or for 
the applicant must be submitted no later than 1 year after completion of 
research. Supporting information is not to be reported.
    (iv) Adverse drug experiences. (A) Product/manufacturing defects and 
adverse drug experiences not previously reported under Sec.  
514.80(b)(1) and (b)(2) must be reported individually on Form FDA 1932.
    (B) Reports of adverse drug experiences in the literature must be 
noted in the periodic drug experience report. A bibliography of 
pertinent references must be included with the report. Upon FDA's 
request, the applicant must provide a full text copy of these 
publications.
    (C) Reports of previously not reported adverse drug experiences that 
occur in postapproval studies must be reported separately from other 
experiences in the periodic drug experience report and clearly marked or 
highlighted.
    (v) Summary report of increased frequency of adverse drug 
experience. The applicant must periodically review the incidence of 
reports of adverse drug experiences to determine if there has been an 
increased frequency of serious (expected and unexpected) adverse drug 
events. The applicant must evaluate the increased frequency of serious 
(expected or unexpected) adverse drug events at least as often as 
reporting of periodic drug experience reports. The applicant must report 
the increased frequency of serious (expected and unexpected) adverse 
drug events in the periodic drug experience report. Summaries of reports 
of increased frequency of adverse drug events must be submitted in 
narrative form. The summaries must state the time period on which the 
increased frequency is based, time period comparisons in determining 
increased frequency, references to any previously submitted Form FDA 
1932, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results. The 
summaries must be submitted in a separate section within the periodic 
drug experience report.
    (5) Other reporting--(i) Special drug experience report. Upon 
written request, FDA may require that the applicant submit a report 
required under Sec.  514.80 at different times or more frequently than 
the timeframes stated in Sec.  514.80.
    (ii) Advertisements and promotional labeling. The applicant must 
submit at the time of initial dissemination one set of specimens of 
mailing pieces and other labeling for prescription and over-the-counter 
new animal drugs. For prescription new animal drugs, the applicant must 
also submit one set of specimens of any advertisement at the time of

Sec.  514.100  Evaluation and comment on applications.

    (a) After the filed application has been evaluated, the applicant 
will be furnished written comment on any apparent deficiencies in the 
application.
    (b) When the description of the methods used in, and the facilities 
and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and packing of such 
new animal drug appears adequate on its face, but it is not feasible to 
reach a conclusion as to the safety and effectiveness of the new animal 
drug solely from consideration of this description, the applicant may be 
notified that an establishment inspection is required to verify their 
adequacy.
    (c) A request for samples of a new animal drug or any edible tissues 
and byproducts of animals treated with such a drug, shall specify the 
quantity deemed adequate to permit tests of analytical methods to 
determine their adequacy for regulatory purposes. The request should be 
made as early in the 180-day period as possible to assure timely 
completion. The date used for computing the 180-day limit for the 
purposes of section 512(c) of the act shall be moved forward 1 day for 
each day after the mailing date of the request until all of the 
requested samples are received. If the samples are not received within 
90 days after the request, the application will be considered withdrawn 
without prejudice.
    (d) The information contained in an application may be insufficient 
to determine whether a new animal drug is safe or effective in use if it 
fails to include (among other things) a statement showing whether such 
drug is to be limited to prescription sale and exempt under section 
502(f) of the act from the requirement that its labeling bear adequate 
directions for lay use. If such drug is to be exempt, the information 
may also be insufficient if:
    (1) The specimen labeling proposed fails to bear adequate 
information for professional use including indications, effects, 
dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of administration 
and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and 
precautions under which practitioners licensed by law to administer such 
drug can use the drug for the purposes for which it is intended, 
including all purposes for which it is to be advertised, or represented, 
in accordance with Sec.  201.105 of this chapter, and information 
concerning hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions 
relevant with respect to any uses for which such drug is to be 
prescribed.
    (2) The application fails to show that the labeling and advertising 
of such drug will offer the drug for use only under those conditions for 
which it is offered in the labeling that is part of the application.
    (3) The application fails to show that all labeling that furnishes 
or purports to furnish information for professional use of such drug 
will contain, in the same language and emphasis, the information for use 
including indications,

[[Page 80]]

effects, dosages, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of 
administration and any relevant warnings, hazards, contraindications, 
side effects, and precautions, which is contained in the labeling that 
is part of the application in accordance with Sec.  201.105 of this 
chapter.
    (e) The information contained in an application will be considered 
insufficient to determine whether a new animal drug is safe and 
effective for use when there is a refusal or failure upon written notice 
to furnish inspectors authorized by the Food and Drug Administration an 
adequate opportunity to inspect the facilities, controls, and records 
pertinent to the application.
    (f) On the basis of preliminary consideration of an application or 
supplemental application containing typewritten or other draft labeling 
in lieu of final printed labeling, an applicant may be informed that 
such application is approvable when satisfactory final printed labeling 
identical in content to such draft copy is submitted.
    (g) When an application has been found incomplete on the basis of a 
need for the kind of information described in Sec.  514.6, such 
application shall be considered withdrawn without prejudice to future 
filing on the date of issuance of the letter citing the inadequacies 
contained in the application, unless within 30 days the sponsor chooses 
to avail himself of the opportunity for hearing as prescribed by Sec.  
514.111.


<R05>
Sec.  514.105  Approval of applications.

    (a) The Commissioner shall forward for publication in the Federal 
Register a regulation prescribing the conditions under which the new 
animal drug may be used, including the name and address of the 
applicant; the conditions and indications for use covered by the 
application; any tolerance, withdrawal period, or other use 
restrictions; any tolerance required for the new animal drug substance 
or its metabolites in edible products of food-producing animals; and, if 
such new animal drug is intended for use in animal feed, appropriate 
purposes and conditions of use (including special labeling requirements) 
applicable to any animal feed; and such other information the 
Commissioner deems necessary to assure safe and effective use.
    (b) He shall notify the applicant by sending him a copy of the 
proposed publication as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

Sec.  514.111  Refusal to approve an application.

    (a) The Commissioner shall, within 180 days after the filing of the 
application, inform the applicant in writing of his intention to issue a 
notice of opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to refuse to approve 
the application, if the Commissioner determines upon the basis of the 
application, or upon the basis of other information before him with 
respect to a new animal drug, that:
    (1) The reports of investigations required to be submitted pursuant 
to section 512(b) of the act do not include adequate tests by all 
methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not such drug is safe 
for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in 
the proposed labeling thereof; or
    (2) The results of such tests show that such drug is unsafe for use 
under such conditions or do not show that such drug is safe for use 
under such conditions; or
    (3) The methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the 
manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug are inadequate to 
preserve its identity, strength, quality, and purity; or
    (4) Upon the basis of the information submitted to the Food and Drug 
Administration as part of the application, or upon the basis of any 
other information before it with respect to such drug, it has 
insufficient information to determine whether such drug is safe for use 
under such conditions. In making this determination the Commissioner 
shall consider, among other relevant factors:
    (i) The probable consumption of such drug and of any substance 
formed in or on food because of the use of such drug;
    (ii) The cumulative effect on man or animal of such drug, taking 
into account any chemically or pharmacologically related substances;
    (iii) Safety factors which, in the opinion of experts qualified by 
scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of such drugs, 
are appropriate for the use of animal experimentation data; and
    (iv) Whether the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or 
suggested in the proposed labeling are reasonably certain to be followed 
in practice; or
    (5) Evaluated on the basis of information submitted as part of the 
application and any other information before the Food and Drug 
Administration with respect to such drug, there is lack of substantial 
evidence as defined in Sec.  514.4.
    (6) Failure to include an appropriate proposed tolerance for 
residues in edible products derived from animals or a withdrawal period 
or other restrictions for use of such drug if any tolerance or 
withdrawal period or other restrictions for use are required in order to 
assure that the edible products derived from animals treated with such 
drug will be safe.
    (7) Based on a fair evaluation of all material facts, the labeling 
is false or misleading in any particular; or

[[Page 83]]

    (8) Such drug induces cancer when ingested by man or animal or, 
after appropriate tests for evaluation of the safety of such drug, 
induces cancer in man or animal, except that this subparagraph shall not 
apply with respect to such drug if the Commissioner finds that, under 
the conditions of use specified in proposed labeling and reasonably 
certain to be followed in practice:
    (i) Such drug will not adversely affect the animal for which it is 
intended; and
    (ii) No residue of such drug will be found (by methods of 
examination prescribed or approved by the Commissioner by regulations) 
in any edible portion of such animal after slaughter or in any food 
yielded by, or derived from the living animals.
    (9) The applicant fails to submit an adequate environmental 
assessment under Sec.  25.40 of this chapter or fails to provide 
sufficient information to establish that the requested action is subject 
to categorical exclusion under Sec.  25.30 or Sec.  25.33 of this 
chapter.
    (10) The drug fails to satisfy the requirements of subpart E of part 
500 of this chapter.
    (11) Any nonclinical laboratory study that is described in the 
application and that is essential to show that the drug is safe for use 
under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its 
proposed labeling, was not conducted in compliance with the good 
laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of this chapter 
and no reason for the noncompliance is provided or, if it is, the 
differences between the practices used in conducting the study and the 
good laboratory practice regulations do not support the validity of the 
study.
    (b) The Commissioner, as provided in Sec.  514.200 of this chapter, 
shall expeditiously notify the applicant of an opportunity for a hearing 
on the question of whether such application is approvable, unless by the 
30th day following the date of issuance of the letter informing the 
applicant of the intention to issue a notice of opportunity for a 
hearing the applicant:
    (1) Withdraws the application; or
    (2) Waives the opportunity for a hearing; or
    (3) Agrees with the Commissioner on an additional period to precede 
issuance of such notice of hearing.

Sec.  514.115  Withdrawal of approval of applications.

    (a) The Secretary may suspend approval of an application approved 
pursuant to section 512(c) of the act and give the applicant prompt 
notice of his action and afford the applicant the opportunity for an 
expedited hearing on a finding that there is an imminent hazard to the 
health of man or of the animals for which such new animal drug or animal 
feed is intended.
    (b) The Commissioner shall notify in writing the person holding an 
application approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act and afford an 
opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to withdraw approval of such 
application if he finds:
    (1) That the application contains any untrue statement of a material 
fact; or
    (2) That the applicant has made any changes from the standpoint of 
safety or effectiveness beyond the variations provided for in the 
application unless he has supplemented the application by filing with 
the Secretary adequate information respecting all such changes and 
unless there is in effect an approval of the supplemental application, 
or such changes are those for which written authorization or approval is 
not required as provided for in Sec.  514.8. The supplemental 
application shall be treated in the same manner as the original 
application.
    (3) That in the case of an application for use of a new animal drug 
approved or deemed approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act:
    (i) Experience or scientific data show that such drug is unsafe for 
use under the conditions of use upon the basis of which the application 
was approved; or
    (ii) New evidence not contained in such application or not available 
to the Secretary until after such application was approved, or tests by 
new methods,

[[Page 84]]

or tests by methods not deemed reasonably applicable when such 
application was approved, evaluated together with the evidence available 
to the Secretary when the application was approved, shows that such drug 
is not shown to be safe for use under the conditions of use upon the 
basis of which the application was approved or that section 512 
(d)(1)(H) of the act applies to such drug; or
    (iii) On the basis of new information before him with respect to 
such drug, evaluated together with the evidence available to him when 
the application was approved, there is a lack of substantial evidence 
that such drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to 
have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested 
in the labeling thereof.
    (4) That any nonclinical laboratory study that is described in the 
application and that is essential to show that the drug is safe for use 
under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its 
proposed labeling, was not conducted in compliance with the good 
laboratory practice regulations as set forth in part 58 of this chapter 
and no reason for the noncompliance is provided or, if it is, the 
differences between the practices used in conducting the study and the 
good laboratory practice regulations do not support the validity of the 
study.
    (c) The Commissioner may notify in writing the person holding an 
application approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act and afford an 
opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to withdraw approval of such 
application if he finds:
    (1) That the applicant has failed to establish a system for 
maintaining required records, or has repeatedly or deliberately failed 
to maintain such records or to make required reports in accordance with 
a regulation or order under section 512(l)(1) of the act, or the 
applicant has refused to permit access to, or copying, or verification 
of, such records as required by section 512(l)(2) of the act; or
    (2) That on the basis of new information before him evaluated 
together with the evidence before him when the application was approved, 
the methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the 
manufacture, processing, and packing of such drug or animal feed are 
inadequate to assure and preserve its identity, strength, quality, and 
purity and were not made adequate within a reasonable time after receipt 
of written notice from the Secretary specifying the matter complained 
of; or
    (3) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated 
together with the evidence before him when the application was approved, 
the labeling of such drug, based on a fair evaluation of all material 
facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected 
within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the 
Secretary specifying the matter complained of.
    (d) Approval of an application pursuant to section 512(c) of the act 
will be withdrawn on the basis of a request for its withdrawal submitted 
in writing by a person holding an approved new animal drug application 
on the grounds that the drug subject to such application is no longer 
being marketed and information is included in support of this finding, 
provided none of the conditions cited in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of 
this section pertain to the subject drug. A written request for such 
withdrawal shall be construed as a waiver of the opportunity for a 
hearing as otherwise provided for in this section. Withdrawal of 
approval of an application under the provisions of this paragraph shall 
be without prejudice.
    (e) On the basis of the withdrawal of approval of an application for 
a new animal drug approved pursuant to section 512(c) of the act, the 
regulation published pursuant to section 512(i) of the act covering the 
conditions of use of such drug as provided for in the application shall

<R05>
Sec.  514.117  Adequate and well-controlled studies.

    (a)  Purpose. The primary purpose of conducting adequate and well-
controlled studies of a new animal drug is to distinguish the effect of 
the new animal drug from other influences, such as spontaneous change in 
the course of the disease, normal animal production performance, or 
biased observation. One or more adequate and well-controlled studies are 
required to establish, by substantial evidence, that a new animal drug 
is effective. The characteristics described in paragraph (b) of this 
section have been developed over a period of years and are generally 
recognized as the essentials of an adequate and well-controlled study. 
Well controlled, as used in the phrase adequate and well controlled, 
emphasizes an important aspect of adequacy. The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) considers these characteristics in determining 
whether a study is adequate and well controlled for purposes of section 
512 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 
360b). Adequate and well-controlled studies, in addition to providing a 
basis for determining whether a new animal drug is effective, may also 
be relied upon to support target animal safety. The report of an 
adequate and well-controlled study should provide sufficient details of 
study design, conduct, and analysis to allow critical evaluation and a 
determination of whether the characteristics of an adequate and well-
controlled study are present.
    (b) Characteristics. An adequate and well-controlled study has the 
following characteristics:
    (1) The protocol for the study (protocol) and the report of the 
study results (study report) must include a clear statement of the study 
objective(s).
    (2) The study is conducted in accordance with an appropriate 
standard of conduct that addresses, among other issues, study conduct, 
study personnel, study facilities, and study documentation. The protocol 
contains a statement acknowledging the applicability of, and intention 
to follow, a standard of conduct acceptable to FDA. The study report 
contains a statement describing adherence to the standard.
    (3) The study is conducted with a new animal drug that is produced 
in accordance with appropriate manufacturing practices, which include, 
but are not necessarily limited to, the manufacture, processing, 
packaging, holding, and labeling of the new animal drug such that the 
critical characteristics of identity, strength, quality, purity, and 
physical form of the new animal drug are known, recorded, and 
reproducible, to permit meaningful evaluations of and comparisons with 
other studies conducted with the new animal drug. The physical form of a 
new animal drug includes the formulation and physical characterization 
(including delivery systems thereof, if any) of the new animal drug as 
presented to the animal. The protocol and study report must include an 
identification number which can be correlated with the specific 
formulation and production process used to manufacture the new animal 
drug used in the study.
    (4) The study uses a design that permits a valid comparison with one 
or more controls to provide a quantitative evaluation of drug effects. 
The protocol and the study report must describe the precise nature of 
the study design, e.g., duration of treatment periods, whether 
treatments are parallel, sequential, or crossover, and the determination 
of sample size. Within the broad range of studies conducted to support a 
determination of the effectiveness of a new animal drug, certain of the 
controls listed below would be appropriate and preferred depending on 
the study conducted:
    (i) Placebo concurrent control. The new animal drug is compared with 
an inactive preparation designed to resemble the new animal drug as far 
as possible.
    (ii) Untreated concurrent control. The new animal drug is compared 
with the absence of any treatment. The use of this control may be 
appropriate when objective measurements of effectiveness, not subject to 
observer bias, are available.
    (iii) Active treatment concurrent control. The new animal drug is 
compared with known effective therapy. The use of this control is 
appropriate when the use of a placebo control or of an untreated 
concurrent control would unreasonably compromise the welfare of

[[Page 86]]

the animals. Similarity of the new animal drug and the active control 
drug can mean either that both drugs were effective or that neither was 
effective. The study report should assess the ability of the study to 
have detected a difference between treatments. The evaluation of the 
study should explain why the new animal drugs should be considered 
effective in the study, for example, by reference to results in previous 
placebo-controlled studies of the active control.
    (iv) Historical control. The results of treatment with the new 
animal drug are quantitatively compared with experience historically 
derived from the adequately documented natural history of the disease or 
condition, or with a regimen (therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic) 
whose effectiveness is established, in comparable animals. Because 
historical control populations usually cannot be as well assessed with 
respect to pertinent variables as can concurrent control populations, 
historical control designs are usually reserved for special 
circumstances. Examples include studies in which the effect of the new 
animal drug is self-evident or studies of diseases with high and 
predictable mortality, or signs and symptoms of predictable duration or 
severity, or, in the case of prophylaxis, predictable morbidity.
    (5) The study uses a method of selecting animals that provides 
adequate assurances that the animals are suitable for the purposes of 
the study. For example, the animals can reasonably be expected to have 
animal production characteristics typical of the class(es) of animals 
for which the new animal drug is intended, there is adequate assurance 
that the animals have the disease or condition being studied, or, in the 
case of prophylactic agents, evidence of susceptibility and exposure to 
the condition against which prophylaxis is desired has been provided. 
The protocol and the study report describe the method of selecting 
animals for the study.
    (6) The study uses a method to assign a treatment or a control to 
each experimental unit of animals that is random and minimizes bias. 
Experimental units of animals are groups of animals that are comparable 
with respect to pertinent variables such as age, sex, class of animal, 
severity of disease, duration of disease, dietary regimen, level of 
animal production, and use of drugs or therapy other than the new animal 
drug. The protocol and the study report describe the method of 
assignment of animals to an experimental unit to account for pertinent 
variables and method of assignment of a treatment or a control to the 
experimental units. When the effect of such variables is accounted for 
by an appropriate design, and when, within the same animal, effects due 
to the test drug can be obtained free of the effects of such variables, 
the same animal may be used for both the test drug and the control using 
the controls set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (7) The study uses methods to minimize bias on the part of observers 
and analysts of the data that are adequate to prevent undue influences 
on the results and interpretation of the study data. The protocol and 
study report explain the methods of observation and recording of the 
animal response variables and document the methods, such as ``blinding'' 
or ``masking,'' used in the study for excluding or minimizing bias in 
the observations.
    (8) The study uses methods to assess animal response that are well 
defined and reliable. The protocol and study report describe the methods 
for conducting the study, including any appropriate analytical and 
statistical methods, used to collect and analyze the data resulting from 
the conduct of the study, describe the criteria used to assess response, 
and, when appropriate, justify the selection of the methods to assess 
animal response.
    (9) There is an analysis and evaluation of the results of the study 
in accord with the protocol adequate to assess the effects of the new 
animal drug. The study report evaluates the methods used to conduct, and 
presents and evaluates the results of, the study as to their adequacy to 
assess the effects of the new animal drug. This evaluation of the 
results of the study assesses, among other items, the comparability of 
treatment and control groups with respect to pertinent variables and the 
effects of any interim analyses performed.

[[Page 87]]

    (c) Field studies. (1) Field conditions as used in this section 
refers to conditions which closely approximate the conditions under 
which the new animal drug, if approved, is intended to be applied or 
administered.
    (2) Studies of a new animal drug conducted under field conditions 
shall, consistent with generally recognized scientific principles and 
procedures, use an appropriate control that permits comparison, employ 
procedures to minimize bias, and have the characteristics generally 
described in paragraph (b) of this section. However, because field 
studies are conducted under field conditions, it is recognized that the 
level of control over some study conditions need not or should not be 
the same as the level of control in laboratory studies. While not all 
conditions relating to a field study need to be or should be controlled, 
observations of the conditions under which the new animal drug is tested 
shall be recorded in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the 
study. Adequate and well-controlled field studies shall balance the need 
to control study conditions with the need to observe the true effect of 
the new animal drug under closely approximated actual use conditions.
    (d) Waiver. The Director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine (the 
Director) may, on the Director's own initiative or on the petition of an 
interested person, waive in whole or in part any of the criteria in 
paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a specific study. A 
petition for a waiver is required to set forth clearly and concisely the 
specific criteria from which waiver is sought, why the criteria are not 
reasonably applicable to the particular study, what alternative 
procedures, if any, are to be, or have been employed, and what results 
have been obtained. The petition is also required to state why the 
studies so conducted will yield, or have yielded, substantial evidence 
of effectiveness, notwithstanding nonconformance with the criteria for 
which waiver is requested.
    (e) Uncontrolled studies. Uncontrolled studies or partially 
controlled studies are not acceptable as the sole basis for the approval 
of claims of effectiveness or target animal safety. Such studies, 
carefully conducted and documented, may provide corroborative support of 
adequate and well-controlled studies regarding effectiveness and may 
yield valuable data regarding safety of the new animal drug. Such 
studies will be considered on their merits in light of the 
characteristics listed here. Isolated case reports, random experience, 
and reports lacking the details which permit scientific evaluation will 
not be considered.

Sec.  514.120  Revocation of order refusing to approve an application or suspending or withdrawing approval of an application.

    The Commissioner, upon his own initiative or upon request of an 
applicant stating reasonable grounds therefor and if he finds that the 
facts so require, may issue an order approving an application that 
previously has had its approval refused, suspended, or withdrawn.


<R05>
Sec.  514.121  Service of notices and orders.

    All notices and orders under this subchapter E and section 512 of 
the act pertaining to new animal drug applications shall be served:
    (a) In person by any officer or employee of the Department 
designated by the Commissioner; or
    (b) By mailing the order by certified mail addressed to the 
applicant or respondent at his last known address in the records of the 
Food and Drug Administration.

Sec.  514.200  Contents of notice of opportunity for a hearing.

    (a) The notice to the applicant of opportunity for a hearing on a 
proposal by the Commissioner to refuse to approve an application or to 
withdraw the approval of an application will specify the grounds upon 
which he proposes to issue his order. On request of the applicant, the 
Commissioner will explain the reasons for his action. The notice of 
opportunity for a hearing will be published in the Federal Register and 
will specify that the applicant has 30 days after issuance of the notice 
within which he is required to file a written appearance electing 
whether:

[[Page 88]]

    (1) To avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing; or
    (2) Not to avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) If the applicant fails to file a written appearance in answer to 
the notice of opportunity for hearing, his failure will be construed as 
an election not to avail himself of the opportunity for the hearing, and 
the Commissioner without further notice may enter a final order.
    (c) If the applicant elects to avail himself of the opportunity for 
a hearing, he is required to file a written appearance requesting the 
hearing within 30 days after the publication of the notice, giving the 
reason why the application should not be refused or should not be 
withdrawn, together with a well-organized and full-factual analysis of 
the clinical and other investigational data he is prepared to prove in 
support of his opposition to the Commissioner's proposal. A request for 
a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set 
forth specific facts showing there is a genuine and substantial issue of 
fact that requires a hearing. When it clearly appears from the data in 
the application and from the reasons and a factual analysis in the 
request for the hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact 
precludes the refusal to approve the application or the withdrawal of 
approval of the application (for example, no adequate and well-
controlled clinical investigations to support the claims of 
effectiveness have been identified), the Commissioner will enter an 
order on this data, stating his findings and conclusions. If a hearing 
is requested and is justified by the applicant's response to the notice 
of opportunity for a hearing, the issues will be defined, an 
Administrative Law Judge will be named, and he shall issue a written 
notice of the time and place at which the hearing will commence. In the 
case of denial of approval, such time shall be not more than 90 days 
after the expiration of such 30 days unless the Administrative Law Judge 
and the applicant otherwise agree; and, in the case of withdrawal of 
approval, such time shall be as soon as practicable.
    (d) The hearing will be open to the public; however, if the 
Commissioner finds that portions of the application which serve as a 
basis for the hearing contain information concerning a method or process 
entitled to protection as a trade secret, the part of the hearing 
involving such portions will not be public, unless the respondent so 
specifies in his appearance.

together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the 
methods used in, or the facilities and controls used for, the 
manufacture, processing, packing, and holding of such animal feed are 
inadequate to assure and preserve the identity, strength, quality, and 
purity of the new animal drug therein, and were not made adequate within 
a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the Commissioner 
specifying the matter complained of; or
    (3) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated 
together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the 
labeling of any animal feeds, based on a fair evaluation of all material 
facts, is false or misleading in any particular and was not corrected 
within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice from the 
Commissioner specifying the matter complained of; or
    (4) That on the basis of new information before him, evaluated 
together with the evidence before him when such license was issued, the 
facility has manufactured, processed, packed, or held animal feed 
bearing or containing a new animal drug adulterated under section 
501(a)(6) of the act, and the facility did not discontinue the

    (1) To avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing; or
    (2) Not to avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing.
    (b) If the applicant fails to file a written appearance in answer to 
the notice of opportunity for hearing, this failure will be construed as 
an election not to avail himself of the opportunity for the hearing, and 
the Commissioner without further notice may enter a final order.
    (c) If the applicant elects to avail himself of the opportunity for 
a hearing, the applicant is required to file a written appearance 
requesting the hearing within 30 days after the publication of the 
notice, giving the reason why the application should not be refused or 
the medicated feed mill license should not be revoked, together with a 
well-organized and full-factual analysis of the information the 
applicant is prepared to prove in support of his opposition to the 
Commissioner's proposal. A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere 
allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing there 
is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. When 
it clearly appears from the information in the application and from the 
reasons and factual analysis in the request for the hearing that no 
genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the refusal to approve 
the application or the revocation of approval of the application, the 
Commissioner will enter an order on this information, stating his/her 
findings and conclusions. If a hearing is requested and is justified by 
the applicant's response to the notice of opportunity for a hearing, the 
issues will be defined, an Administrative Law Judge will be named, and 
the Judge shall issue a written notice of the time and place at which 
the hearing will commence. In the case of denial of approval, such time 
shall be not more than 90 days after the expiration of such 30 days 
unless the Administrative Law Judge and the applicant otherwise agree; 
and, in the case of withdrawal of approval, such time shall be as soon 
as practicable.
    (d) The hearing will be open to the public; however, if the 
Commissioner finds that portions of the application which serve as a 
basis for the hearing contain information concerning a method or process 
entitled to protection as a trade secret, the part of the hearing 
involving such portions will not be public, unless the respondent so 
specifies in the appearance.

Sec.  520.1880  Prednisolone tablets.

    (a) Specifications. Each tablet contains 5 or 20 milligrams 
prednisolone.
    (b) Sponsor. See No. 061690 in Sec.  510.600(c)(2) of this chapter.
    (c) Special considerations. (1) Clinical and experimental data have 
demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally to 
animals may induce the first stage of parturition when administered 
during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate parturition 
followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis.
    (2) Do not use in viral infections. Systemic therapy with 
prednisolone is contraindicated in animals with peptic ulcer, corneal 
ulcer, and Cushingoid syndrome. The presence of diabetes, osteoporosis, 
predisposition to thrombophlebitis, hypertension, congestive heart 
failure, renal insufficiency, and active tuberculosis necessitates 
carefully controlled use. Some of the above conditions occur only rarely 
in dogs but should be kept in mind.
    (3) Anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids may mask signs of 
infection.
    (d) Conditions of use--(1) Amount. Dogs: 2.5 milligrams per 4.5 
kilograms (10 pounds) body weight per day. Administer total daily dose 
orally in equally divided doses 6 to 10 hours apart until response is 
noted or 7 days have elapsed. When response is attained, dosage should 
be gradually reduced until maintenance level is achieved.
    (2) Indications for use. For use in dogs as an anti-inflammatory 
agent.
    (3) Limitations. Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the 
order of a licensed veterinarian.

necessary. Do not change litter unless absolutely necessary. Do not give 
flushing mashes.
    (3) Chickens and turkeys. (i) As an aid in the control of acute fowl 
cholera caused by Pasteurella multocida susceptible to sulfaquinoxaline 
and fowl typhoid caused by Salmonella gallinarum susceptible to 
sulfaquinoxaline.
    (ii) Administer at the 0.04 percent level for 2 or 3 days. Move 
birds to clean ground. If disease recurs, repeat treatment. If cholera 
has become established as the respiratory or chronic form, use feed 
medicated with sulfaquinoxaline. Poultry which have survived typhoid 
outbreaks should not be kept for laying house replacements or breeders 
unless tests show they are not carriers.
    (4) Cattle and calves. (i) For the control and treatment of 
outbreaks of coccidiosis caused by Eimeria bovis or E. zurnii.
    (ii) Administer at the 0.015-percent level for 3 to 5 days in

    (iii) In lieu of treatment as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of 
this section, administer 1 teaspoon of 25-percent sulfaquinoxaline 
soluble powder per day for each 125 pounds of body weight for 3 to 5 
days in drinking water.
    (d) Limitations. Consult a veterinarian or poultry pathologist for 
diagnosis. May cause toxic reactions unless the drug is evenly mixed in 
water at dosages indicated and used according to directions. For control 
of outbreaks of disease, medication should be initiated as soon as the 
diagnosis is determined. Medicated chickens, turkeys, cattle, and calves 
must actually consume enough medicated water which provides a 
recommended dosage of approximately 10 to 45 milligrams per pound per 
day in chickens, 3.5 to 55 milligrams per pound per day in turkeys, and 
approximately 6 milligrams per pound per day in cattle and calves 
depending on the age, class of animal, ambient temperature, and other 
factors. A withdrawal period has not been established for 
sulfaquinoxaline in preruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be 
processed for veal. Not for use in lactating dairy cattle. Do not give 
to chickens, turkeys or cattle within 10 days of slaughter for food. Do 
not medicate chickens or turkeys producing eggs for human consumption.

skin and can cause abortion and/or bronchiospasms. Direct contact with 
the skin should therefore be avoided. Accidental spillage on the skin 
should be washed off immediately with soap and water.

    (c) Special considerations. (1) Clinical and experimental data have 
demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally to 
animals may induce the first stage of parturition when administered 
during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature 
parturition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and 
metritis.
    (2) Systemic therapy with methylprednisolone acetate, as with other 
corticoids, is contraindicated in animals with arrested tuberculosis, 
peptic ulcer, and Cushing's syndrome. The presence of active 
tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, renal insufficiency, 
predisposition to thrombophlebitis, hypertension, or congestive heart 
failure necessitates carefully controlled use of corticosteroids. 
Intrasynovial, intratendinous, or other injections of corticosteroids 
for local effect are contraindicated in the presence of acute infectious 
conditions. Exacerbation of pain, further loss of joint motion, with 
fever and malaise following injection may indicate that the condition 
has become septic. Appropriate antibacterial therapy should be 
instituted immediately.
    (d) Conditions of use--(1) Amount--(i) Intramuscular. Dosage may be 
repeated when necessary, as follows: dogs--2 to 40 milligrams (up to 120 
milligrams in extremely large breeds or dogs with severe involvement); 
cats--10 to 20 milligrams; horses--200 milligrams. \1\

    (2) Indications for use. Oxytocin may be used as a uterine 
contractor to precipitate and accelerate normal parturition and 
postpartum evacuation of uterine debris. In surgery it may be used 
postoperatively following cesarean section to facilitate involution and 
resistance to the large inflow of blood. It will contract smooth muscle 
cells of the mammary gland for milk letdown if the udder is in proper 
physiological state.
    (3) Limitations. Do not use in dystocia due to abnormal presentation 
of fetus until correction is accomplished. For prepartum usage, full 
relaxation of the cervix should be accomplished either naturally or by 
administration of estrogen prior to oxytocin therapy. Federal law 
restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed 
veterinarian.

    (a) Specifications. Each single-dose syringe contains 500 milligrams 
(mg) sometribove zinc in a prolonged-release suspension.
    (b) Sponsor. See No. 059945 in Sec.  510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (c) Conditions of use--(1) Amount. Inject 500 mg every 14 days 
beginning during the 9th or 10th week (57 to 70 days) after calving and 
continue until the end of lactation.
    (2) Indications for use. For use in healthy lactating dairy cows to 
increase the production of marketable milk.
    (3) Limitations. For use in lactating dairy cows only. Safety to 
replacement bulls born to treated dairy cows has not been established. 
Administer subcutaneously. To minimize injection site blemishes on 
carcass at time of slaughter, avoid injections within 2 weeks of 
expected slaughter. No milk discard or preslaughter withdrawal period is 
required. Use may result in reduced pregnancy rates and, in first calf 
heifers, an increase in days open. The incidence of retained placenta 
may be higher. Treated cows are at an increased risk for clinical 
mastitis and subclinical mastitis. In some herds, use has been 
associated with increases in somatic cell counts in milk. Care should be 
taken to differentiate increased body temperature due to use of this 
product from an increased body temperature that may occur due to 
illness. Use may result in an increase in digestive disorders such as 
indigestion, bloat, and diarrhea. There may be an increase in the number 
of cows experiencing periods of ``off-feed'' (reduced feed intake) 
during treatment. Cows treated with this product may have increased 
numbers of enlarged hocks and lesions of the knee (carpal region), and 
second lactation or older cows may have more disorders of the foot 
region. Use has been associated with reductions in hemoglobin and 
hematocrit values during treatment. Human warning: Avoid prolonged or 
repeated contact with eyes and skin.

intravenous administration to dogs and cats during short to moderately 
long surgical and other procedures. It is also used to induce anesthesia 
in dogs and cats which then have surgical anesthesia maintained by use 
of a volatile anesthetic.
    (2) It is administered as follows:
    (i) For brief anesthesia (6 to 10 minutes) a dosage of 6 to 9 
milligrams per pound of body weight is suggested.
    (ii) To obtain anesthesia of 15 to 25 minutes duration the suggested 
dosage is 10 to 12 milligrams per pound of body weight.
    (iii) Use of a preanesthetic tranquilizer or morphine will decrease 
the dosage of sodium thiopental required, provide for smoother induction 
and smoother recovery, and sometimes prolong the recovery period. If 
morphine is used as a preanesthetic agent the dose of the barbiturate 
can be reduced as much as 40 to 50 percent. When a tranquilizer is 
administered the barbiturate dosage can be reduced 10 to 25 percent.

For most effective results, cattle should be treated as soon as possible 
after heel-fly activity ceases. Host-parasite reactions such as bloat, 
salivation, staggering and paralysis may sometimes occur when cattle are 
treated while the common cattle grub (Hypoderma lineatum) is in the 
gullet, or while the northern cattle grub (H. bovis) is in the area of 
the spinal cord. Cattle should be treated before these stages of grub 
development. Consult your veterinarian, extension livestock specialist, 
or extension entomologist regarding the timing of treatment. If it is 
impossible to determine the area from which the cattle came and/or exact 
stage of the grubs, it is recommended that the cattle receive only a 
maintenance ration of low-energy feed during the treatment period. This 
lessens the likelihood of severe bloat which may occur in cattle on full 
feed when the common grub is killed while in the gullet. A second 
application is required for animals heavily infested with lice or for 
those which become reinfested. A second application should

[[Page 299]]

be made no sooner than 35 days after the first treatment.
    (iii) Do not treat dairy cattle of breeding age; calves less than 3 
months old; sick, convalescent, or severely stressed livestock.
    (iv) Do not treat cattle for 10 days before or after shipping, 
weaning, dehorning, or after exposure to contagious or infectious 
diseases.
    (v) Do not slaughter within 45 days of treatment.
    (d) Specifications. (1) The drug is a solution containing either 5.6 
or 13.8 percent fenthion. Each concentration is available in 2 volumes 
which are contained in single-dose applicators.
    (2) Sponsor. See No. 000859 in Sec.  510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (3) Special considerations. Fenthion is a cholinesterase inhibitor. 
Do not use this product on dogs simultaneously with or within 14 days 
before or after treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting 
drugs, pesticides, or chemicals. Do not use with flea or tick collars.
    (4) Conditions of use--(i) Amount. Four to 8 milligrams per kilogram 
of body weight.
    (ii) Indications for use. For flea control on dogs only.
    (iii) Limitations. Apply the contents of the proper size, single-
dose tube directly to one spot on the dog's skin. Frequency of repeat 
treatments depends upon rate of flea reinfestations. Do not use more 
often than once every 2 weeks. Treatment at 2-week intervals is not to 
exceed 6 months. Do not use on puppies under 10 weeks of age. Do not use 
on sick, stressed, or convalescing dogs. Safe use in breeding males has 
not been established. Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) Dip vat procedure. (a) Prior to charging vat, empty old contents 
and thoroughly clean the vat. Dip vats

[[Page 315]]

should be calibrated to maintain an accurate dilution. Add water, then 
drug to the vat according to the dilution rate indicated in the table. 
Add super phosphate at a rate of 100 pounds per 1,000 gallons of vat 
solution. Super phosphate is added to control the pH of the solution and 
ensure vat stability. Super phosphate is usually available at most 
fertilizer dealers as 0-45-0 or 0-46-0. Stir the dip thoroughly, 
preferably with a compressed air device; however, any form of thorough 
mixing is adequate. Re-stir vat contents prior to each use. During the 
dipping operation, each time the dip's volume is reduced by \1/8\ to \1/
4\ of its initial volume, replenish with water and add the drug at a 
rate of 1 gallon for each 50 or 200 gallons water added--depending on 
dilution rate 1:60 or 1:240. Also add super phosphate as necessary to 
maintain pH between 4.5 and 6.5. Stir well and resume dipping. Repeat 
replenishment process as necessary. For evaportion, add additional water 
accordingly. For added water due to rainfall, merely replenish dip with 
the product according to directions. If overflow occurs, either analyze 
for drug concentration and adjust accordingly or dispose of vat contents 
and recharge. Check pH after each addition of water or super phosphate 
to assure proper pH controls.
    (b) Dip maintenance. (1) With use of dip vat tester, dipping may 
continue as long as the drug concentration is maintained between 0.15 
and 0.25 percent, and the dip is not too foul for satisfactory use as 
indicated by foul odor or excessive darkening (i.e., color changes from 
beige to very dark brown).
    (2) Without use of dip vat tester, vat should be emptied, cleaned, 
and recharged each time one of the following occurs: When the dip has 
been charged for 120 days; when the dip becomes too foul for 
satisfactory use, within the 120-day limit; if the number of animals 
dipped equals twice the number of gallons of the initial dip volume, 
within the 120-day limit.
    (ii) Spray method. To prepare the spray, mix drug with water 
according to table and stir thoroughly. Apply the fresh mixture as a 
high-pressure spray, taking care to wet the skin, not just the hair. 
Apply to the point of ``runoff,'' about 1 gallon of diluted spray per 
adult animal. Lesser amounts will permit runoff for younger animals.
    (iii) Pour-on method. Dilute the drug with water according to table 
by slowly adding water to the product while stirring. Apply 1 ounce of 
the diluted mixture per 100 pounds of body weight (to a maximum of 8 
ounces per head) down the center line of the back.
    (2) Timing of applications for cattle grub control. For optimum 
cattle grub control, it is important to treat as soon as possible after 
the heel fly season, before the grub larvae reach the gullet or spinal 
canal, as the rapid kill of large numbers of larvae in these tissues may 
cause toxic side effects, such as bloat, salivation, staggering, and 
paralysis.
    (3) Treatment regimens. (i) Control of scabies mites requires two 
treatments, 10 to 14 days apart.
    (ii) Control of Lone Star Ticks and hornflies requires two 
treatments, 7 days apart.
    (4) Warnings. The drug is a cholinesterase inhibitor. Do not use 
this drug on animals simultaneously or within a few days before or after 
treatment with or exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting drugs, 
pesticides, or chemicals. Do not apply within 21 days of slaughter. For 
use on beef cattle only. Do not treat sick, convalescent, or stressed 
cattle, or calves less than 3 months old except in Federal or State 
eradication programs where immediate treatment of all animals in an 
infested herd is mandatory. Be sure free access to drinking water is 
available to cattle prior to dipping. Do not dip excessively thirsty 
animals. Do not dip animals when overheated. Repeat treatment as 
necessary but not more often than every 7 to 10 days. Treatment for 
lice, ticks, hornflies, and scabies mites may be made any time of the 
year except when cattle grub larvae are in the gullet or spinal canal. 
Treatment for lice, ticks, and scabies mites may be made any time 7 to 
10 days following treatment for grubs. Do not treat grubs when the grub 
larvae are in the gullet or spinal canal. Do not get in eyes, on skin, 
or on clothing. Do not breathe spray mist. Wear rubber gloves, goggles, 
and protective clothing. In case of skin contact, wash immediately with 
soap and water; for eyes, flush with

[[Page 316]]

water. Wash all contaminated clothing with soap and hot water before re-
use.
    (d) Related tolerances. See 40 CFR 180.261.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Use the lower concentration when ponds, tanks, or raceways are
  heavily loaded with phytoplankton or fish to avoid oxygen depletion
  due to the biological oxygen demand by decay of dead phytoplankton.
  Alternatively, a higher concentration may be used if dissolved oxygen
  is strictly monitored.
\2\ Although the indicated concentrations are considered safe for cold
  and warm water finfish, a small number of each lot or pond to be
  treated should always be used to check for any unusual sensitivity to
  formalin before proceeding.

    (v) For control of fungi of the family Saprolegniaceae on all 
finfish eggs: Eggs of all finfish except Acipenseriformes, 1,000 to 
2,000 [mu]L/L (ppm) for 15 minutes; eggs of Acipenseriformes, up to 
1,500 [mu]L/L (ppm) for 15 minutes.
    (3) Limitations. Fish tanks and raceways may be treated daily until 
parasite control is achieved. Pond treatment may be repeated in 5 to 10 
days if needed. However, pond treatments for Ichthyophthirius should be 
made at 2-day intervals until control is achieved. Egg tanks may be 
treated as often as necessary to prevent growth of fungi. Do not use 
formalin which has been subjected to temperatures below 40 [deg]F, or 
allowed to freeze. Do not treat ponds containing striped bass. 
Treatments in tanks should never exceed 1 hour even if fish show no 
signs of stress. Do not apply formalin to ponds with water warmer than 
27 [deg]C (80 [deg]F), when a heavy bloom of phytoplankton is present, 
or when the concentration of dissolved oxygen is less than 5 milligrams 
per liter.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec.  530.1  Scope.

    This part applies to the extralabel use in an animal of any approved 
new animal drug or approved new human drug by or on the lawful order of 
a licensed veterinarian within the context of a valid veterinary-client-
patient relationship.


<R05>
Sec.  530.2  Purpose.

    The purpose of this part is to establish conditions for extralabel 
use or intended extralabel use in animals by or on the lawful order of 
licensed veterinarians of Food and Drug Administration approved new 
animal drugs and approved new human drugs. Such use is limited to 
treatment modalities when the health of an animal is threatened or 
suffering or death may result from failure to treat. This section 
implements the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994 (the 
AMDUCA) (Pub. L. 103-396).


<R05>
Sec.  530.3  Definitions.

    (a) Extralabel use means actual use or intended use of a drug in an 
animal in a manner that is not in accordance with the approved labeling. 
This includes, but is not limited to, use in species not listed in the 
labeling, use for indications (disease or other conditions) not listed 
in the labeling, use at

[[Page 332]]

dosage levels, frequencies, or routes of administration other than those 
stated in the labeling, and deviation from the labeled withdrawal time 
based on these different uses.
    (b) FDA means the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
    (c) The phrase a reasonable probability that a drug's use may 
present a risk to the public health means that FDA has reason to believe 
that use of a drug may be likely to cause a potential adverse event.
    (d) The phrase use of a drug may present a risk to the public health 
means that FDA has information that indicates that use of a drug may 
cause an adverse event.
    (e) The phrase use of a drug presents a risk to the public health 
means that FDA has evidence that demonstrates that the use of a drug has 
caused or likely will cause an adverse event.
    (f) A residue means any compound present in edible tissues that 
results from the use of a drug, and includes the drug, its metabolites, 
and any other substance formed in or on food because of the drug's use.
    (g) A safe level is a conservative estimate of a drug residue level 
in edible animal tissue derived from food safety data or other 
scientific information. Concentrations of residues in tissue below the 
safe level will not raise human food safety concerns. A safe level is 
not a safe concentration or a tolerance and does not indicate that an 
approval exists for the drug in that species or category of animal from 
which the food is derived.
    (h) Veterinarian means a person licensed by a State or Territory to 
practice veterinary medicine.
    (i) A valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship is one in 
which:
    (1) A veterinarian has assumed the responsibility for making medical 
judgments regarding the health of (an) animal(s) and the need for 
medical treatment, and the client (the owner of the animal or animals or 
other caretaker) has agreed to follow the instructions of the 
veterinarian;
    (2) There is sufficient knowledge of the animal(s) by the 
veterinarian to initiate at least a general or preliminary diagnosis of 
the medical condition of the animal(s); and
    (3) The practicing veterinarian is readily available for followup in 
case of adverse reactions or failure of the regimen of therapy. Such a 
relationship can exist only when the veterinarian has recently seen and 
is personally acquainted with the keeping and care of the animal(s) by 
virtue of examination of the animal(s), and/or by medically appropriate 
and timely visits to the premises where the animal(s) are kept.


<R05>
Sec.  530.4  Advertising and promotion.

    Nothing in this part shall be construed as permitting the 
advertising or promotion of extralabel uses in animals of approved new 
animal drugs or approved human drugs.


<R05>
Sec.  530.5  Veterinary records.

    (a) As a condition of extralabel use permitted under this part, to 
permit FDA to ascertain any extralabel use or intended extralabel use of 
drugs that the agency has determined may present a risk to the public 
health, veterinarians shall maintain the following records of extralabel 
uses. Such records shall be legible, documented in an accurate and 
timely manner, and be readily accessible to permit prompt retrieval of 
information. Such records shall be adequate to substantiate the 
identification of the animals and shall be maintained either as 
individual records or, in food animal practices, on a group, herd, 
flock, or per-client basis. Records shall be adequate to provide the 
following information:
    (1) The established name of the drug and its active ingredient, or 
if formulated from more than one ingredient, the established name of 
each ingredient;
    (2) The condition treated;
    (3) The species of the treated animal(s);
    (4) The dosage administered;
    (5) The duration of treatment;
    (6) The numbers of animals treated; and
    (7) The specified withdrawal, withholding, or discard time(s), if 
applicable, for meat, milk, eggs, or any food which might be derived 
from any food animals treated.

[[Page 333]]

    (b) A veterinarian shall keep all required records for 2 years or as 
otherwise required by Federal or State law, whichever is greater.
    (c) Any person who is in charge, control, or custody of such records 
shall, upon request of a person designated by FDA, permit such person 
designated by FDA to, at all reasonable times, have access to, permit 
copying, and verify such records.


<R04>
 Subpart B--Rules and Provisions for Extralabel Uses of Drugs in Animals


<R05>
Sec.  530.10  Provision permitting extralabel use of animal drugs.

    An approved new animal drug or human drug intended to be used for an 
extralabel purpose in an animal is not unsafe under section 512 of the 
act and is exempt from the labeling requirements of section 502(f) of

<R04>
Subpart C--Specific Provisions Relating to Extralabel Use of Animal and 
                  Human Drugs in Food-Producing Animals


<R05>
Sec.  530.20   Conditions for permitted extralabel animal and human drug use in food-producing animals.

    (a) The following conditions must be met for a permitted extralabel 
use in food-producing animals of approved new animal and human drugs:
    (1) There is no approved new animal drug that is labeled for such 
use and that contains the same active ingredient which is in the 
required dosage form and concentration, except where a veterinarian 
finds, within the context of a valid veterinarian-client-patient 
relationship, that the approved new animal drug is clinically 
ineffective for its intended use.
    (2) Prior to prescribing or dispensing an approved new animal or 
human drug for an extralabel use in food animals, the veterinarian must:
    (i) Make a careful diagnosis and evaluation of the conditions for 
which the drug is to be used;-
    (ii) Establish a substantially extended withdrawal period prior to 
marketing of milk, meat, eggs, or other edible products supported by 
appropriate scientific information, if applicable;
    (iii) Institute procedures to assure that the identity of the 
treated animal or animals is carefully maintained; and
    (iv) Take appropriate measures to assure that assigned timeframes 
for withdrawal are met and no illegal drug residues occur in any food-
producing animal subjected to extralabel treatment.
    (b) The following additional conditions must be met for a permitted 
extralabel use of in food-producing animals an approved human drug, or 
of an animal drug approved only for use in animals not intended for 
human consumption:
    (1) Such use must be accomplished in accordance with an appropriate 
medical rationale; and
    (2) If scientific information on the human food safety aspect of the 
use of the drug in food-producing animals is not available, the 
veterinarian must take appropriate measures to assure that the animal 
and its food products will not enter the human food supply.
    (c) Extralabel use of an approved human drug in a food-producing 
animal is not permitted under this part if an animal drug approved for 
use in food-producing animals can be used in an extralabel manner for 
the particular use.


<R05>
Sec.  530.21  Prohibitions for food-producing animals.

    (a) FDA may prohibit the extralabel use of an approved new animal or 
human drug or class of drugs in food-producing animals if FDA determines 
that:
    (1) An acceptable analytical method needs to be established and such 
method has not been established or cannot be established; or
    (2) The extralabel use of the drug or class of drugs presents a risk 
to the public health.
    (b) A prohibition may be a general ban on the extralabel use of the 
drug or class of drugs or may be limited to a specific species, 
indication, dosage form, route of administration, or combination of 
factors.


<R05>
Sec.  530.22  Safe levels and analytical methods for food-producing animals.

    (a) FDA may establish a safe level for extralabel use of an approved 
human drug or an approved new animal drug when the agency finds that 
there is a reasonable probability that an

[[Page 335]]

extralabel use may present a risk to the public health. FDA may:
    (1) Establish a finite safe level based on residue and metabolism 
information from available sources;
    (2) Establish a safe level based on the lowest level that can be 
measured by a practical analytical method; or
    (3) Establish a safe level based on other appropriate scientific, 
technical, or regulatory criteria.
    (b) FDA may require the development of an acceptable analytical 
method for the quantification of residues above any safe level 
established under this part. If FDA requires the development of such an 
acceptable analytical method, the agency will publish notice of that 
requirement in the Federal Register.
    (c) The extralabel use of an animal drug or human drug that results 
in residues exceeding a safe level established under this part is an 
unsafe use of such drug.
    (d) If the agency establishes a safe level for a particular species 
or category of animals and a tolerance or safe concentration is later 
established through an approval for that particular species or category 
of animals, for that species or category of animals, the safe level is 
superseded by the tolerance or safe concentration for that species or 
category of animals.


<R05>
Sec.  530.23  Procedure for setting and announcing safe levels.

    (a) FDA may issue an order establishing a safe level for a residue 
of an extralabel use of an approved human drug or an approved animal 
drug. The agency will publish in the Federal Register a notice of the 
order. The notice will include:
    (1) A statement setting forth the agency's finding that there is a 
reasonable probability that extralabel use in animals of the human drug 
or animal drug may present a risk to the public health;
    (2) A statement of the basis for that finding; and
    (3) A request for public comments.
    (b) A current listing of those drugs for which a safe level for 
extralabel drug use in food-producing animals has been established, the 
specific safe levels, and the availability, if any, of a specific 
analytical method or methods for drug residue detection will be codified 
in Sec.  530.40.


<R05>
Sec.  530.24   Procedure for announcing analytical methods for drug residue quantification.

    (a) FDA may issue an order announcing a specific analytical method 
or methods for the quantification of extralabel use drug residues above 
the safe levels established under Sec.  530.22 for extralabel use of an 
approved human drug or an approved animal drug. The agency will publish 
in the Federal Register a notice of the order, including the name of the 
specific analytical method or methods and the drug or drugs for which 
the method is applicable.
    (b) Copies of analytical methods for the quantification of 
extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels established under 
Sec.  530.22 will be available upon request from the Communications and 
Education Branch (HFV-12), Division of Program Communication and 
Administrative Management, Center for Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish 
Pl., Rockville, MD 20855. When an analytical method for the detection of 
extralabel use drug residues above the safe levels established under 
Sec.  530.22 is developed, and that method is acceptable to the agency, 
FDA will incorporate that method by reference.


<R05>
Sec.  530.25  Orders prohibiting extralabel uses for drugs in food-producing animals.

    (a) FDA may issue an order prohibiting extralabel use of an approved 
new animal or human drug in food-producing animals if the agency finds, 
after providing an opportunity for public comment, that:
    (1) An acceptable analytical method required under Sec.  530.22 has

extralabel use in animals of a particular human drug or animal drug 
presents a risk to the public health, FDA will publish in the Federal 
Register, with a 90-day delayed effective date, an order of prohibition 
for an extralabel use of a drug in food-producing animals. Such order 
shall state that an acceptable analytical method required under Sec.  
530.22 has not been developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by 
FDA; that such method cannot be established; or that the extralabel use 
in animals presents a risk to the public health; and shall:
    (1) Specify the nature and extent of the order of prohibition and 
the reasons for the prohibition;
    (2) Request public comments; and
    (3) Provide a period of not less than 60 days for comments.
    (c) The order of prohibition will become effective 90 days after 
date of publication of the order unless FDA publishes a notice in the 
Federal Register prior to that date, that revokes the order of 
prohibition, modifies it, or extends the period of public comment.
    (d) The agency may publish an order of prohibition with a shorter 
comment period and/or delayed effective date than specified in paragraph 
(b) of this section in exceptional circumstances (e.g., where there is 
immediate risk to the public health), provided that the order of 
prohibition states that the comment period and/or effective date have 
been abbreviated because there are exceptional circumstances, and the 
order of prohibition sets forth the agency's rationale for taking such 
action.
    (e) If FDA publishes a notice in the Federal Register modifying an 
order of prohibition, the agency will specify in the modified order of 
prohibition the nature and extent of the modified prohibition, the 
reasons for it, and the agency's response to any comments on the 
original order of prohibition.
    (f) A current listing of drugs prohibited for extralabel use in 
animals will be codified in Sec.  530.41.
    (g) After the submission of appropriate information (i.e., adequate 
data, an acceptable method, approval of a new animal drug application 
for the prohibited extralabel use, or information demonstrating that the 
prohibition was based on incorrect data), FDA may, by publication of an 
appropriate notice in the Federal Register, remove a drug from the list 
of human and animal drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals, or 
may modify a prohibition.
    (h) FDA may prohibit extralabel use of a drug in food-producing 
animals without establishing a safe level.

<R04>
                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec.  556.1  General considerations; tolerances for residues of new animal drugs in food.

    (a) Tolerances established in this part are based upon residues of 
drugs in edible products of food-producing animals treated with such 
drugs. Consideration of an appropriate tolerance for a drug shall result 
in a conclusion either that:
    (1) Finite residues will be present in the edible products--in which 
case a finite tolerance is required; or
    (2) It is not possible to determine whether finite residues will be 
incurred but there is reasonable expectation that they may be present--
in which case a tolerance for negligible residue is required; or
    (3) The drug induces cancer when ingested by man or animal or, after 
tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of such 
drug, has been shown to induce cancer in man or animal; however, such 
drug will not adversely affect the animals for which it is intended, and 
no residue of such drug will be found by prescribed methods of analysis 
in any edible portion of such animals after slaughter or in any food 
yielded by or derived from the living animal--in which case the accepted 
method of analysis shall be published or cited, if previously published 
and available elsewhere, in this part; or
    (4) It may or may not be possible to determine whether finite 
residues will be incurred but there is no reasonable expectation that 
they may be present--in which case the establishment of a tolerance is 
not required; or
    (5) The drug is such that it may be metabolized and/or assimilated 
in such form that any possible residue would be indistinguishable from 
normal tissue constituents--in which case the establishment of a 
tolerance is not required.
    (b) No tolerance established pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section will be set at any level higher than that reflected by the 
permitted use of the drug.
    (c) Any tolerance required pursuant to this section will, in 
addition to the toxicological considerations, be conditioned on the 
availability of a practicable analytical method to determine the 
quantity of residue. Such method must be sensitive to and reliable at 
the established tolerance level or, in certain instances, may be 
sensitive at a higher level where such level is also deemed satisfactory 
and safe in light of the toxicity of the drug residue and of the 
unlikelihood of such residue's exceeding the tolerance.

Sec.  556.220  3,5-Dinitrobenzamide.

    No residues of 3,5-dinitrobenzamide may be found in the uncooked 
edible tissues of chickens as determined by the following method of 
analysis:

    I. Method of analysis--3,5-dinitrobenzamide. A method for 3,5-
dinitrobenzamide (3,5-DNBA) in chicken tissues is described with a 
cleanup step that removes most of the interfering materials, thus 
allowing uncompensated measurements to be read. The 3,5-DNBA is 
extracted from the sample with acetone and chloroform and prepared for 
chromatography by removing the aqueous phase in a separatory funnel and 
the solvents in a flash evaporator. The extract residue is 
chromatographed on alumina to remove several lipid components and 
residues of other drugs. The benzamide eluate is passed through a column 
of Dowex-50 resin, or equivalent, to remove arylamines; for example, 3-
amino-5-nitrobenzamide. The 3,5-DNBA fraction is reduced, after removal 
of alcohol, with TiCl<INF>3</INF> in basic solution to an arylamine, 
presumably 3,5-diaminobenzamide. The reduced fraction is placed on 
another Dowex-50 column, most of the interfering substances are removed 
with washings of alcohol and water, and the arylamine residue is eluted 
with 4N HCl. Colorimetric measurement is made in a 100-millimeter cell 
at 530 millimicrons after reacting the residue with Bratton-Marshall 
reagents.
    II. Reagents. A. Acetone.

weekly.
    F. Cation-exchange resin--Dowex 50W-X8, 200-400 mesh, Baker Analyzed 
Reagent, or equivalent, prepared as follows:
    1. Place 500 grams of resin into a 3-liter beaker.
    2. Add 2,000 milligrams of 6N HCl.
    3. Heat and stir while on a bath at 80 [deg]C. for 6 hours. 
Discontinue heating and continue stirring overnight.
    4. Filter the resin on a Buchner funnel (24 cm.) fitted with Whatman 
No. 1 paper.
    5. Wash the resin bed with four 500-milliliter portions of 6N HCl.
    6. Wash the resin bed with 500-milliliter portions of deionized 
water until the effluent has a pH of 5 or higher.
    7. Wash the resin bed with three 400-milliliter portions of 
specially denatured alcohol 3A. Drain thoroughly.
    8. Make a slurry of resin in 1,250 milliliters of specially 
denatured alcohol 3A.
    G. Chloroform.
    H. Coupling reagent--0.25 gram of N-1-naphthyl-ethylenediamine 
dihydrochloride per 100 milliliters of water. Refrigerate when not in 
use. Prepare fresh weekly.
    I. 3,5-Dinitrobenzamide (3,5-DNBA standard). Add to boiling 
specially denatured alcohol 3A until a saturated solution is obtained 
and treat with activated carbon, filtered and crystallize by cooling to 
room temperature. The 3,5-DNBA therefrom is treated a second time with

denatured alcohol 3A. The third crystallization is washed with diethyl 
ether and dried in a vacuum desiccator, melting point range 185 [deg]C.-
186 [deg]C.
    J. Ethyl alcohol--absolute, A.C.S.
    K. Eluting reagent A. The formula and volume required in procedure 
step V-D is dependent on the adsorptive strength of the Al<INF>2</INF> 
O<INF>3</INF>. For each lot Al<INF>2</INF> O<INF>3</INF>, make the 
following test:
    1. Prepare a column (see procedure step V-D for determining formula 
and volume to eluting reagent A).
    2. Transfer 1 milliliter of APNPS standard (100 micrograms per 
milliliter) in 75 milliliters of chloroform to the column.
    3. Wash the column with 100 milliliters of chloroform and discard 
the eluate.
    4. Pass through 100 milliliters of solution consisting of specially 
denatured alcohol 3A and ethyl alcohol 1:1 (volume to volume). Collect 
one 50-milliliter and five 10-milliliter portions; these make up the 
first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth portions of eluate.
    5. Place in beakers under a stream of air on a water bath (90 
[deg]C.) until the solvents are evaporated.
    6. Add 10 milliliters of 4N HCl to each, cover with watch glasses 
and heat (90 [deg]C.) for 30 minutes; cool to room temperature.
    7. Add the Bratton-Marshall reagents.
    8. All fractions show a slight color. Note the portion containing 
the first significant increase in pink color.
    a. If the color increases in the second, third, or fourth portions 
of eluate, the formula in procedure step V-D is suitable and, depending 
on the portion, 45, 55, or 65 milliliters, respectively, should be used 
in procedure step V-D4. Thereby, the APNPS is retained on the column and 
the benzamides are eluted.
    b. If the color increases in the first portion, the eluting strength 
of the reagent is too strong. Return the test, substituting 1:4 (volume 
to volume) in procedure step V-D4. If 1:4 (volume to volume) is too 
strong, rerun with ethyl alcohol in procedure step V-D. If none of these 
are suitable, another lot of Al<INF>2</INF> O<INF>3</INF> should be 
used.
    c. If the color increases in the fifth or sixth portion, the eluting 
strength of the reagent is too weak. Rerun the test, substituting in 
procedure step V-D4, respectively, 4:1 (volume to volume), specially 
denatured alcohol 3A: methyl alcohol, 4:1 (volume to volume), until a 
suitable formula is found. If none of these are suitable, another lot of 
Al<INF>2</INF> O<INF>3</INF> should be used.

    V. Procedure. A. Extraction. 1. Mince 350 grams of tissue in a 1-
quart blending jar for 3 minutes. Use samples obtained from either 
freshly killed or quickly frozen birds. The latter should be analyzed as 
soon as thawed. For fibrous meats (for example, muscle, skin) put 
through a meat grinder before mincing.
    2. Weight 100 +/-0.5 grams of each replicate sample in a 150-
milliliter beaker. Analyze each sample in triplicate and average the 
results. Reproducibility of +/-10 percent between such analyses has been 
obtained.
    3. Transfer the sample to a 1-quart blender jar. For kidney and 
liver tissues, make a slurry with acetone in the weighing beaker. 
Transfer with several rinses of acetone.
    4. Blend the sample for 5 minutes with 250 milliliters of acetone 
and a 100-milliliter beakerful of diatomaceous earth.

blender jar.
    8. Add 250 milliliters of chloroform.
    9. Blend for 3 minutes.
    10. Filter through the aforementioned apparatus of procedure step V-
A5. For rapid filtration of skin and blood samples, prepare funnel by 
adding diatomaceous earth and tamping evenly over paper to a thickness 
of 3 to 5 millimeters.
    11. Rinse the blender jar into the funnel with three 25-milliliter 
rinses of chloroform.
    B. Phasic separation. 1. Pour the combined filtrates into a 1-liter 
separatory funnel.
    2. Rinse the suction flask twice with 25 milliliters of chloroform.
    3. Mix the funnel contents by gently rocking and swirling for 30 
seconds.
    4. Let stand 10 minutes to allow phases to separate.
    a. The upper (aqueous) phase (30 to 50 milliliters) is not always 
emulsion-free. Losses from emulsions have not been significant.
    b. If an upper (aqueous) phase does not appear, add an additional 
100 milliliters of chloroform and 10 milliliters of water and repeat 
procedure step V-B3.
    5. Withdraw the lower phase into a 1-liter round-bottom flask, and 
discard upper phase. Withdraw nearly all of the lower phase, let stand 
for 2 to 3 minutes, then withdraw the remainder.

[[Page 344]]

    C. Evaporation. Attach the flask on a thin-film rotary evaporator 
connected to a vacuum supply, and place in a water bath maintained at 45 
[deg]C.-50 [deg]C. until an oily residue remains. Do not overheat the 
sample or allow to go to dryness.

    b. Tap walls gently with hands.
    c. Add anhydrous sodium sulfate to an additional depth of 25 
millimeters.
    d. Wet and wash column with 50 milliliters of chloroform.
    i. During chromatography, make each addition to the tube when the 
liquid level has reached the top of the sodium sulfate layer.
    ii. Increase the percolation rates by applying a slight air pressure 
to the top of the column.
    2. Transfer the residue from procedure step V-C to the column with 
four 15-milliliter rinses of chloroform. Then rinse the walls of the 
tube and sodium sulfate layer with three 5-milliliter portions of 
chloroform. Percolation rate: 15 to 25 milliliters per minute. No color 
from sample should be seen in sodium sulfate layer after final rinse.
    3. Wash column with 100 milliliters of chloroform. Discard eluate.
    4. Add 75 milliliters of eluting reagent A and collect eluate A in a 
250-milliliter beaker for cation-exchange chromatography.
    a. Refer to ``Eluting reagent A'' under ``Reagents'' (II-K) for 
determining formula and volume.
    b. Percolation rate: 8 to 12 milliliters per minute.
    E. Cation-exchange chromatography--No. 1. 1. Prepare an ion-exchange 
column as follows:
    a. Add a uniform slurry of resin to the column to obtain a 4 to 5 
centimeter bed depth after settling.
    i. Obtain a uniform slurry using a magnetic stirrer. To add the 
required amount of resin, calibrate the slurry and transfer it with a 
10-milliliter pipette to deliver a reproducible volume.
    ii. Increase the flow rate to 2 to 4 milliliters per minute by 
applying air pressure to the column. A glycerol manostat adjusted to 30

    G. Cation-exchange chromatography--No. 2. 1. Prepare resin column by 
procedure step V-E.
    2. Pass the centrifugate of procedure step V-F7 through column. Use 
three rinses of specially denatured alcohol 3A, each 5 milliliters, to 
aid in transferring of sample.
    3. Pass 50 milliliters of specially denatured alcohol 3A through the 
column.
    4. Pass 50 milliliters of deionized water through the column.
    5. Elute arylamine residue from the resin with 40 to 43 milliliters 
of 4N HCl into a 50-milliliter volumetric flask (actinic ware) for 3,5-
DNBA analysis. Avoid direct sunlight. The arylamine has been found to be 
photosensitive.

                     I. Method of Analysis--Zeranol

    A gas chromatographic method for the determination of the drug in 
frozen beef tissues is described. Tissue is frozen and stored in a deep 
freezer until ready for examination. A weighed portion of wet tissue 
(with exception of fat) is homogenized and lyophilized to dry solid. The 
drug is recovered from dry tissue by an extraction with methanol in a 
Soxhlet extractor. The methanol extract is digested in the presence of 
hydrochloric acid to hydrolyze conjugates should any be present. 
Elimination of impurities is brought about by liquid partition transfer 
successively to chloroform to 1N sodium hydroxide, to carbon 
tetrachloride, to 1N sodium hydroxide, to ethyl ether, and, finally, to 
a dry residue. The residue is reacted with a silane mixture to create a 
volatile derivative which is quantitated by peak area measurements from 
a flame ionization detector. The drug can be detected at a level of 20 
parts per billion with negligible interference from tissues or reagents.

[[Page 355]]

as a calibration standard in operation of the gas chromatograph.

                              V. Procedure

    A. Preparation of glassware: Glassware should be washed in detergent 
or chromic acid solution to remove contaminants and rinsed in water to 
remove traces of cleaning agent. Rinse with methanol before using.
    B. Preparation of sample.
    1. Collect muscle, liver, kidney, and tripe from a freshly 
sacrificed animal under the cleanest conditions possible.
    2. Grind the fresh tissue in a meat grinder, divide into 100-gram 
portions, and wrap in aluminum foil. Store wrapped tissue in a deep 
freeze. Fat should be wrapped in foil and stored in deep freeze.
    C. Extraction procedure for muscle, liver, kidney, and tripe.
    1. Weight 100 grams of partially thawed tissue into a 250-milliliter 
homogenizing flask, add 60 milliliters of water, and attach to a Virtis 
``45'' Tissue Mill, or equivalent.
    2. Mix the materials at 45,000 r.p.m. for 5 minutes to obtain a thin 
homogenate.
    3. Transfer the homogenate to a 1-liter, widemouth, freeze drying 
flask using 10-20 milliliters of water for a rinse.
    4. Place the flask on its side in a nearly horizontal position in a 
slurry of dry ice and acetone. Rotate the flask on its side as the 
homogenate cools to set down a uniform frozen solid layer on the wall of 
the flask.
    5. Mount the flask on a Virtis freeze drier, or equivalent, and 
lyophilize to dry solids. This operation usually requires 20-24 hours. 
Stopping place.
    6. Transfer the solid cake to a clean sheet of paper and crumble by 
hand to a size convenient for transfer to an extraction thimble.
    7. Transfer the solids to a single thickness 60x180 milliliter 
Soxhlet extraction thimble and compact the solids sufficiently to 
guarantee complete immersion during solid extraction.
    8. Transfer 600 milliliters of methanol to a 1-liter pot of a 
Soxhlet extraction assembly and place the thimble in the extractor. 
Mount a large glass funnel in the neck of the extractor with the stem 
extending into the thimble. Rinse the 1-liter freeze drying flask with 
three 50-milliliter portions of fresh methanol and transfer the rinses 
through the funnel into the thimble. Mount the condenser in the 
extractor and extract the solids for 15 hours. The extractor should be 
heated with the electric heating mantle so that a fill-empty cycle 
requires 18-24 minutes.
    9. Drain the methanol from the thimble. Composite the methanol from 
the extractor and pot in an 800-milliliter beaker.
    10. Rinse the pot with 10 milliliters of methanol and add to the 
methanol composite. Transfer 50 milliliters of 2N HCl down the pot side 
wall, and add to methanol composite. Concentrate to 125 milliliters by 
boiling on a hot plate.
    D. Extraction procedure for fat.
    1. Cut fat into \1/4\-inch cubes. The lyophilization of fat is 
unnecessary since it is essentially water free.
    2. Transfer 100 grams of the prepared fat to a 60x180-millimeter 
extraction thimble and extract with 750 milliliters of methanol for 15 
hours in the Soxhlet extractor. The extractor should be heated with the 
electric heating mantle so that a fill-empty cycle requires 18-24 
minutes.
    3. Drain the methanol from the thimble. Composite the methanol from 
the extractor and pot into an 800-milliliter beaker.
    4. Rinse the pot with 10 milliliters of methanol and add to the 
methanol composite. Transfer 50 milliliters of 2N HCl down the pot side 
wall, and add to methanol composite. Concentrate to 125 milliliters by 
boiling on a hot plate.
    E. Solvent partition.
    1. Transfer the methanol concentrate to a 500-milliliter separatory 
funnel, identified by number as 1, with 70 milliliters of chloroform 
rinse and mix.
    2. Add 300 milliliters of water and without shaking allow liquid 
phases to separate.
    3. Withdraw the chloroform layer into a separatory funnel, 
identified by number as 2, containing 100 milliliters of 2 percent 
aqueous sodium chloride.
    4. Gently mix the contents of funnel 2 horizontally end to end 30 
times and allow phases to separate. Usually about 20 minutes are 
required to obtain maximum chloroform separation.
    5. Withdraw the chloroform layer into a beaker.
    6. Extract with shaking the contents of funnels 1 and 2 successively 
with three more 50-milliliter portions of chloroform.
    7. Composite the chloroform extracts and concentrate to 125 
milliliters by evaporation on a steam bath and cool to room temperature.
    8. Transfer the chloroform composite to a 250-milliliter separatory 
funnel, fitted with a Teflon stopcock, using 10 milliliters of 
chloroform as a rinse.
    9. Extract the chloroform with three separate 20-milliliter portions 
of 1N sodium hydroxide solution retaining the emulsion in the sodium 
hydroxide phase. Agitation of sodium hydroxide with the chloroform 
extract for the first time is accompanied by the appearance of emulsion.
    10. Perform an extraction by gently inverting the closed funnel and 
returning the funnel to an upright position.
    11. Repeat phase mixing 30 times per extraction.

[[Page 356]]

    12. Allow phases to separate for 10 minutes. The time delay allows 
for gradual dissipation of the emulsion to improve phase separation. The 
zeranol transfers from the chloroform to the upper sodium hydroxide 
phase in this operation.
    13. Composite the sodium hydroxide extracts.
    14. Wash the sodium hydroxide extract with three 50-milliliter 
portions of chloroform using the technique as in step 9 and the same 10-
minute interval for phase separation. Washing the chloroform removes the 
emulsion and unwanted impurities from the sodium hydroxide phase.
    15. Discard the chloroform washes. Transfer the sodium hydroxide 
extracts to a 250-milliliter beaker. Rinse each separatory funnel with 
two 5-milliliter portions of water and add to the sodium hydroxide 
extract. Wash each funnel twice with tap water and twice with distilled 
water before next use.
    16. Neutralize the washed sodium hydroxide extract to pH 8.0 by 
dropwise addition of 3N phosphoric acid using a pH meter for pH 
detection.
    17. Transfer the pH 8.0 water extract to a 250-milliliter separatory 
funnel using 10 to 20 milliliters of water for a rinse.
    18. Extract the solution with three separate 50-milliliter portions 
of carbon tetrachloride. The zeranol transfers to the lower carbon 
tetrachloride phase. Use the same 30-count phase-mixing technique as in 
step 9 and allow the mixture to stand 5 minutes for phase separation.
    19. Composite the carbon tetrachloride extracts.
    20. Extract the carbon tetrachloride composite with two 20-
milliliter portions of 1N sodium hydroxide. Zeranol transfers from 
carbon tetrachloride to the upper sodium hydroxide phase. After phase 
mixing, allow the mixture to stand 5 minutes for phase separation.
    21. Composite the sodium hydroxide extracts.
    22. Wash the extract with two 50-milliliter portions of carbon 
tetrachloride. Allow the mixture to stand 5 minutes for phase 
separation. Discard the carbon tetrachloride washes.
    23. Transfer the sodium hydroxide extract into a 250-milliliter 
beaker. Rinse the separatory funnel with two 5-milliliter portions of 
water and add to the sodium hydroxide extract. Wash each funnel twice 
with tap water and twice with distilled water before next use. Adjust 
the sodium hydroxide extract to a pH of 9.5 by dropwise addition of 3N 
phosphoric acid and transfer to a 250-milliliter separatory funnel using 
10-20 milliliters of water for a rinse.
    24. Extract the pH 9.5 water solution with three separate 30-
milliliter portions of anhydrous ethyl ether. Allow the mixture to stand 
5 minutes for phase separation. The zeranol transfers to the upper ether 
phase.
    25. Composite the ether extracts in a 125-milliliter Erlenmeyer 
flask.
    26. Reduce the volume of ether to about 1-2 milliliters by 
evaporation on a hot plate with low heat while removing vapor from top 
of flask by vacuum aspiration.
    27. Transfer ether residue to a 1-dram glass vial. Rinse down flask 
side wall with 1-2 milliliters of fresh ether and transfer to the glass 
vial.
    28. Continue evaporation of ether to 0.1 milliliter.
    29. Place vial in a vacuum desiccator and evaporate residue at line 
vacuum and room temperature overnight to dryness.
    30. Close vial with a plastic cap and submit ether residue for 
preparation of TMS derivative and gas chromatographic assay. Stopping 
place.
    F. Gas liquid chromatography.
    1. Start the gas chromatography and maintain the following 
operational conditions:
    Carrier gas pressure: 50 p.s.i. at tank.
    Carrier gas flow rate: Sufficient to give zeranol derivative peak a 
retention time of 4-8 minutes.
    Electrometer range: 10\2\ or 10\1\.
    Detector temperature: 325 [deg]C.
    Injection port temperature: 325 [deg]C.
    Column temperature: 250[deg]-280 [deg]C., operate isothermally.
    Recorder sensitivity: 1 millivolt.
    Recorder chart speed: 1 inch per minute.
    Sample size: 1 microliter to 5 microliters as necessary to give 
desired peak area for quantitative measurement.
    Septums: Replace each evening and allow to condition overnight at 
operational temperature.
    Flame assembly: Remove silica ash from the flame assembly each week. 
The flame assembly is removed; the anode, flame jet, and chimney are 
cleaned with a nylon bristle brush. Water and acetone are drawn through 
the jet capillary to remove any foreign material.
    2. Add 0.2 milliliter of silating reagent to the sample or to the 
zeranol standard.
    3. Stopper the vial and shake vigorously.
    4. Warm the vial at 40[deg]-50 [deg]C. for a few minutes, then roll 
the vial on a horizontal plane to insure that all of the interior 
surfaces of the vial have been in contact with the reagent.
    5. Let vial stand for 4 hours or overnight in a warm area (40 
[deg]C.) to allow reaction to reach completion.
    6. Place vial in a small padded centrifuge tube and centrifuge to 
settle the precipitate and insure that all the liquid is at the bottom 
of the vial.
    7. Inject 1.0-5.0 microliters of clear solution into the 
chromatograph. At the beginning of the day's run, make 3-5 injections of

[[Page 357]]

a standard to condition the column for that day before taking 
quantitative data.
    8. Run known mixtures at the beginning, middle, and end of the day's 
run over the concentration range of samples to be analyzed to compensate 
for day-to-day sensitivity fluctuations and drift. If four or less 
samples are to be run, calibrating at the beginning and end of the run 
is sufficient.

                            VI. Calculations

    Area values are obtained on known mixtures and samples by 
multiplying the net peak height by the peak width at half height or by 
counting squares. Area values obtained on knowns are plotted versus 
zeranol concentration. Calibration plots indicate a near linear function 
in the 0-10 microgram range. Area values obtained on samples are 
converted directly to microgram quantities using the curve. Control 
tests demonstrated a 70 percent recovery of zeranol from spiked wet beef 
liver and muscle necessitating a correction factor.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JA93.411

Where:
0.7=Correction factor for 70 percent recovery.
W=Grams of tissue examined.

                           VII. Recovery Study

    A. Fortification of reagent blank.
    1. For those using this method for the first time either for 
recovery study or tissue assay, a solvent blank and solvent fortified 
with zeranol should be processed through the entire procedure. This 
preliminary operation will establish whether or not the procedure is 
free from contamination arising from solvents and glassware and 
demonstrate the level of recovery of the standard zeranol. Level of 
recovery should be in the same range as the samples.
    2. Transfer 600 milliliters of methanol to a 1-liter beaker. Add 50 
milliliters of 2N HCl to the methanol and concentrate to 125 milliliters 
by boiling on a hot plate.
    3. Transfer 600 milliliters of methanol to a 1-liter beaker. Add 50 
milliliters of 2N HCl to the methanol and concentrate to 125 milliliters 
by boiling on a hot plate. Spike the concentrate with 1.0 milliliter of 
stock solution D.
    4. Assay both samples as described in the procedure beginning 
extraction step V-E1.
    B. Fortification of samples.
    1. Transfer 100-gram portions of partially thawed tissues into 250-
milliliter homogenizing flasks and set half of them aside to serve as 
tissue blanks.
    2. Add to the remaining samples 1 milliliter of stock solution D to 
serve as fortified samples to which 20 parts per billion zearalanol have 
been added.
    3. Assay both fortified and unfortified tissue as described in the 
procedure section beginning with V-C1.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec.  558.3  Definitions and general considerations applicable to this part.

    (a) Regulations in this part provide for approved uses of drugs and 
combinations of drugs in animal feeds. Approved combinations of such 
drugs are specifically identified or incorporated by cross-reference. 
Unless specifically provided for by the regulations, a combination of 
two or more drugs is not approved.
    (b) The following definitions apply to terms used in this part:
    (1) New animal drugs approved for use in animal feed are placed in 
two categories as follows:
    (i) Category I--These drugs require no withdrawal period at the 
lowest use level in each species for which they are approved.
    (ii) Category II--These drugs require a withdrawal period at the 
lowest use level for at least one species for which they are approved, 
or are regulated on a ``no-residue'' basis or with a zero tolerance 
because of a carcinogenic concern regardless of whether a withdrawal 
period is required, or are a veterinary feed directive drug.
    (2) A ``Type A medicated article'' is intended solely for use in the 
manufacture of another Type A medicated article or a Type B or Type C 
medicated feed. It consists of a new animal drug(s), with or without 
carrier (e.g., calcium carbonate, rice hull, corn, gluten) with or 
without inactive ingredients. The manufacture of a Type A medicated 
article requires an application approved under Sec.  514.105 of this 
chapter.
    (3) A ``Type B medicated feed'' is intended solely for the 
manufacture of other medicated feeds (Type B or Type C). It contains a 
substantial quantity of nutrients including vitamins and/or minerals 
and/or other nutritional ingredients in an amount not less than 25 
percent of the weight. It is manufactured by diluting a Type A medicated 
article or another Type B medicated feed. The maximum concentration of 
animal drug(s) in a Type B medicated feed is 200 times the highest 
continuous use level for Category I drugs and 100 times the highest 
continuous use level for Category II drugs. The term ``highest 
continuous use level'' means the highest dosage at which the drug is 
approved for continuous use (14 days or more), or, if the drug is not 
approved for continuous use, it means the highest level used for disease 
prevention or control. If the drug is approved for multiple species at 
different use levels,

[[Page 359]]

the highest approved level of use would govern under this definition. 
The manufacture of a Type B medicated feed from a Category II, Type A 
medicated article requires a medicated feed mill license application 
approved under Sec.  515.20 of this chapter.
    (4) A ``Type C medicated feed'' is intended as the complete feed for 
the animal or may be fed ``top dressed'' (added on top of usual ration) 
on or offered ``free-choice'' (e.g., supplement) in conjunction with 
other animal feed. It contains a substantial quantity of nutrients 
including vitamins, minerals, and/or other nutritional ingredients. It 
is manufactured by diluting a Type A medicated article or a Type B 
medicated feed. A Type C medicated feed may be further diluted to 
produce another Type C medicated feed. The manufacture of a Type C 
medicated feed from a Category II, Type A medicated article requires a 
medicated feed mill license application approved under Sec.  515.20 of 
this chapter.
    (5) A Type B or Type C medicated feed manufactured from a drug 
component (bulk or ``drum-run'' (dried crude fermentation product)) 
requires an application approved under Sec.  514.105 of this chapter.
    (6) A ``veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug'' is a new animal drug 
approved under section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (the act) for use in or on animal feed. Use of a VFD drug must be 
under the professional supervision of a licensed veterinarian.
    (7) A ``veterinary feed directive'' is a written statement issued by 
a licensed veterinarian in the course of the veterinarian's professional 
practice that orders the use of a veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug 
in or on an animal feed. This written statement authorizes the client 
(the owner of the animal or animals or other caretaker) to obtain and 
use the VFD drug in or on an animal feed to treat the client's animals 
only in accordance with the directions for use approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA). A veterinarian may issue a VFD only if a 
valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship exists, as defined in 
Sec.  530.3(i) of this chapter.
    (8) A ``medicated feed'' means a Type B medicated feed as defined in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section or a Type C medicated feed as defined 
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
    (9) For the purposes of this part, a ``distributor'' means any 
person who distributes a medicated feed containing a VFD drug to another 
distributor or to the client-recipient of the VFD.
    (10) An ``animal production facility'' is a location where animals 
are raised for any purpose, but does not include the specific location 
where medicated feed is made.
    (11) An ``acknowledgment letter'' is a written communication 
provided to a distributor by a consignee who is not the ultimate user of 
medicated feed containing a VFD drug. An acknowledgment letter affirms 
that the consignee will not ship such medicated animal feed to an animal 
production facility that does not have a VFD, and will not ship such 
feed to another distributor without receiving a similar written 
acknowledgment letter.

Sec.  558.4  Requirement of a medicated feed mill license.

    (a) A feed manufacturing facility must possess a medicated feed mill 
license in order to manufacture a Type B or Type C medicated feed from a 
Category II, Type A medicated article.
    (b) The manufacture of the following types of feed are exempt from 
the required license, unless otherwise specified:
    (1) Type B or Type C medicated feed using Category I, Type A 
medicated articles or Category I, Type B or Type C medicated feeds; and
    (2) Type B or Type C medicated feed using Category II, Type B or 
Type C medicated feeds.
    (c) The use of Type B and Type C medicated feeds shall also conform 
to the conditions of use provided for in subpart B of this part and in 
Sec. Sec.  510.515 and 558.15 of this chapter.
    (d) This paragraph identifies each drug by category, the maximum 
level of drug in Type B medicated feeds, and the assay limits for the 
drug in Type A

Sec.  558.5  New animal drug requirements for liquid Type B feeds.

    (a) Information available to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs 
shows that certain drugs are unstable when added to some liquid Type B 
medicated feeds. The demonstrated instability of these drugs gives rise 
to the question of the stability of other drugs when added to liquid 
Type B medicated feeds, except where specific approval has been granted 
for such use. Therefore, the labeling of a drug to provide for its use 
in a liquid Type B medicated feed causes the drug to be a new animal 
drug for such use for which an approved new animal drug application is 
required pursuant to section 512(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act.
    (b) The addition of a drug to a liquid Type B medicated feed causes 
such Type B feed to become an animal feed bearing or containing a new 
animal drug for which an approved application is required pursuant to 
section 512(m) of the act.
    (c) Each drug product, intended for oral administration to animals, 
which contains any of the drugs listed in paragraph (d) of this section 
and which bears labeling for its use in animal feed and/or drinking 
water shall also include in such labeling the following statement: ``FOR 
USE IN ------ ONLY. NOT FOR USE IN LIQUID TYPE B MEDICATED FEEDS,'' the 
blank being filled in with the words ``DRY FEEDS,'' ``DRINKING WATER,'' 
``DRY FEEDS AND DRINKING WATER'' as applicable, unless:
    (1) Such drug product is the subject of an approved new animal drug 
application providing for its use in liquid Type B medicated feeds, or;
    (2) The labeling provisions of this paragraph have been waived on 
the basis of approval of a petition which includes a copy of the product 
label; a description of the formulation; and information which 
establishes that the physical, chemical, or other properties of the 
particular drug product are such that it cannot reasonably be expected 
to be diverted for use in liquid Type B medicated feeds. Such petitions 
shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for 
Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.
    (d) The labeling provisions of paragraph (c) of this section apply 
to all forms of bacitracin, oxytetracycline, and chlortetracycline.
    (e) For any drug which is the subject of an approved new animal drug 
application, the labeling provisions of paragraph (c) of this section 
may be implemented without prior approval as provided for in Sec.  
514.8(d) and (e) of this chapter.

Sec.  558.15  Antibiotic, nitrofuran, and sulfonamide drugs in the feed of animals.

    (a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs will propose to revoke 
currently approved subtherapeutic (increased rate of gain, disease 
prevention. etc.) uses in animal feed of antibiotic and sulfonamide 
drugs whether granted by approval of new animal drug applications, 
master files and/or antibiotic or food additive regulations, by no later 
than April 20, 1975, or the nitrofuran drugs by no later than September 
5, 1975, unless data are submitted which resolve conclusively the issues 
concerning their safety to man and animals and their effectiveness under 
specific criteria established by the Food and Drug Administration based 
on the guidelines included in the report of the FDA task force on the 
use of antibiotics in animal feeds. All persons or firms previously 
marketing identical, related, or similar products except the nitrofuran 
drugs not the subject of an approved new animal drug application must 
submit a new animal drug application by July 19, 1973, or by December 4, 
1973, in the case of nitrofuran drugs, if marketing is to continue 
during the interim. New animal drug entities with antibacterial activity 
not previously marketed, now pending approval or submitted for approval 
prior to, on, or following the effective date of this publication, shall 
satisfy such criteria prior to approval.
    (b) Any person interested in developing data which will support 
retaining approval for such uses of such antibiotic, nitrofuran, and 
sulfonamide drugs pursuant to section 512(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act shall submit to the Commissioner the following:
    (1) By July 19, 1973, records and reports of completed, ongoing, or 
planned studies, including protocols, on the tetracyclines, 
streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, penicillin, and the sulfonamides; for 
all other antibiotics by October 17, 1973; and for the nitrofuran drugs 
by March 4, 1974. The Food and Drug Administration encourages sponsors 
to consult with the Center for Veterinary Medicine on protocol design 
and plans for future studies.
    (2) By April 20, 1974, data from completed studies on the 
tetracyclines, streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, the sulfonamides, and 
penicillin assessing the effect of the subtherapeutic use of the drug in 
feed on the salmonella reservoir in the target animal as compared to 
that in nonmedicated controls. Failure to complete the salmonella 
studies for any of these drugs by that time will be grounds for 
proceeding to immediately withdraw approval.
    (3) By April 20, 1975, data satisfying all other specified criteria 
for safety and effectiveness, including the effect on the salmonella 
reservoir for any antibiotic or sulfonamide drugs and by September 5, 
1975, for the nitrofuran drugs, approved for subtherapeutic use in 
animal feeds. Drug efficacy data shall be submitted for any feed-use 
combination product containing such drug and any feed-use single 
ingredient antibiotic, nitrofuran, or sulfonamide not reviewed by the 
National Academy of Sciences--National Research Council, Drug Efficacy 
Study covering drugs marketed between 1938 and 1962.
    (4) Progress reports on studies underway every January 1 and July 1 
until completion.
    (c) Failure on the part of any sponsor to comply with any of the 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section for any of the antibacterial 
drugs included in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or interim results 
indicating a health hazard, will be considered as grounds for 
immediately proceeding to withdraw approval of that drug for use in 
animal feeds under section 512(l) of the act in the case of failure to 
submit required records and reports and under section 512(e) where new 
information shows that such drug is not shown to be safe.
    (d) Criteria based upon the guidelines laid down by the task force 
may be obtained from the Food and Drug Administration, Center for 
Veterinary Medicine, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855.

[[Page 365]]

    (e) Reports as specified in this section shall be submitted to: Food 
and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine, Office of New 
Animal Drug Evaluation (HFV-100), 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 
20855.
    (f) Following the completion of the requirements of paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section and the studies provided for therein:
    (1) Those antibiotic, nitrofuran, and sulfonamide drugs which fail 
to meet the prescribed criteria for subtherapeutic uses but which are 
found to be effective for the therapeutic purposes will be permitted in 
feed only for high-level, short-term therapeutic use and only by or on 
the order of a licensed veterinarian.
    (2) Animal feeds containing antibacterial drugs permitted to remain 
in use for subtherapeutic purposes shall be labeled to include a 
statement of the quantity of such drugs.
    (g) The submission of applications and data required by paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section is not required for the continued 
manufacture of any Type A medicated article which is produced solely 
from a Type A article that is in compliance with the requirements of 
this section: Provided, That the Type A medicated article contains no 
drug ingredient whose use in or on animal feed requires an approved 
application pursuant to section 512(m) of the act and/or where the Type 
A article is approved by regulation in this part.
    (1) The following antibacterial Type A articles manufactured by the 
designated sponsors are eligible for interim marketing based on their 
compliance with the requirements of this section:

(e)(1)(xviii) of this section.
    (c) Related tolerance. See Sec.  556.347 of this chapter.
    (d) Special considerations. (1) Type C cattle and sheep feeds may be 
manufactured from lasalocid liquid Type B feeds which have a pH of 4.0 
to 8.0 and bear appropriate mixing directions as follows:
    (i) For liquid Type B feeds stored in recirculating tank systems: 
Recirculate immediately prior to use for no less than 10 minutes, moving 
not less than 1 percent of the tank contents per minute from the bottom 
of the tank to the top. Recirculate daily as described even when not 
used.
    (ii) For liquid Type B feeds stored in mechanical, air, or other 
agitation-type tank systems: Agitate immediately prior to use for not 
less than 10 minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the tank 
that is visible at the top. Agitate daily as described even when not 
used.
    (2) A positionally stable lasalocid liquid Type B feed will not be 
subject to the requirements for mixing directions prescribed in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section provided it has a pH of 4.0 to 8.0 and 
contains a suspending agent(s) sufficient to maintain a viscosity of not 
less than 300 centipoises per second for 3 months. Form FDA 1900 must 
indicate the pH and centipoises per second for such lasalocid liquid 
Type B feed.
    (3) If a manufacturer is unable to meet the requirements of 
paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, the manufacturer may secure 
approval of a positionally stable liquid Type B feed by (i) either 
filing a new animal drug application for the product or establishing a 
master file containing data to support the stability of its product; 
(ii) authorizing the agency to reference and rely upon the data in the 
master file to support approval of a supplemental new animal drug 
application to establish positional stability; and (iii) requesting the 
sponsor of an approved new animal drug application to file a supplement 
to provide for use of its lasalocid Type A article in the manufacture of 
the liquid Type B feed specified in the appropriate master file. If the 
data demonstrate the stability of the liquid Type B feed described in 
the master file, the supplement new animal drug application will be 
approved. Approval of the supplement will not be published in the 
Federal Register because such approval will not affect or alter 
conditions or use of the product in the new animal drug application or 
the regulation. The approval will, however, provide a basis for the 
individual liquid feed manufacturer to submit, and for the agency to 
approve, a medicated feed application under section 512(m) of the act 
for liquid Type B feed. A manufacturer who seeks to market a 
positionally unstable lasalocid liquid Type B feed with mixing 
directions different from the standard directions established in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section may also follow this procedure.
    (4) If adequate information is submitted to show that a particular 
liquid

[[Page 418]]

Type B feed containing lasalocid is stable outside the pH of 4.0 to 8.0, 
the pH restriction described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this 
section may be waived.
    (5) Required label statements:
    (i) For liquid Type B feed (cattle and sheep): Mix thoroughly with 
grain and/or roughage prior to feeding. Feeding undiluted, mixing 
errors, or inadequate mixing (recirculation or agitation) may result in 
an excess lasalocid concentration which could be fatal to cattle and 
sheep. Do not allow horses or other equines access to Type A articles or 
Type B feeds containing lasalocid as ingestion may be fatal. Safety of 
lasalocid for use in unapproved species has not been established.
    (ii) For Type A articles or Type B feeds (cattle and sheep): Feeding 
undiluted or mixing errors may result in an excess lasalocid 
concentration which could be fatal to cattle and sheep. Do not allow 
horses or other equines access to Type A articles or Type B feeds 
containing lasalocid as ingestion may be fatal. Safety of lasalocid for 
use in unapproved species has not been established.
    (6) Lasalocid Type A medicated articles containing lasalocid dried 
fermentation residue are for use in cattle and sheep feed only.
    (7) Each use in a free-choice Type C cattle feed as in paragraph 
(e)(1)(xii) and (e)(1)(xviii) of this section must be the subject of an 
approved NADA or supplemental NADA as provided in Sec.  510.455 of this 
chapter.

    (iii) Limitations. It is recommended that regular feed be withheld 
overnight and worming feed administered the following morning; dilute 
supplement with nonmedicated feed as directed; feed the equivalent of 1 
lb. of 0.08 percent worming feed per 100 lbs. of body weight of pigs to 
be treated; may be fed as sole feed or thoroughly mixed with 1 to 2 
parts of regular feed prior to feeding; when medicated feed is consumed, 
resume normal feeding. Pigs maintained under conditions of constant worm 
exposure may require retreatment within 4 to 5 weeks after the first 
treatment due to reinfection; do not slaughter for food within 72 hours 
of treatment; the label shall bear the caution, ``Excessive salivation 
or muzzle foam may be observed. This reaction is occasionally seen and 
will disappear in a short time after medication. If pigs are infected 
with mature lungworms, coughing and vomiting may be observed soon after

    (a) Specifications. (1) Dry Type A medicated articles containing 100 
or 200 milligrams (mg) melengestrol acetate per pound.
    (2) Liquid Type A medicated article containing 500 mg melengestrol 
acetate per pound.
    (b) Approvals. See No. 000009 in Sec.  510.600(c) of this chapter.
    (c) Related tolerances. See Sec.  556.380 of this chapter.
    (d) Special considerations. (1) Type B or C medicated feeds may be 
manufactured from melengestrol acetate liquid Type A articles or Type B 
or C medicated feeds which have a pH of 4.0 to 8.0 and bear appropriate 
mixing directions as follows:
    (i) For liquid Type B or C feeds stored in recirculating tank 
systems: Recirculate immediately prior to use for no less than 10 
minutes, moving not less than 1 percent of the tank contents per minute 
from the bottom of the tank to the top. Recirculate daily as described 
even when not used.
    (ii) For liquid Type B or C feeds stored in mechanical, air, or 
other agitation type tank systems: Agitate immediately prior to use for 
not less than 10 minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the 
tank that is visible at the top. Agitate daily as described even when 
not used.
    (2) A positionally stable melengestrol acetate liquid Type B or C 
feed will not be subject to the requirements for mixing directions 
prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1) of this section provided it has a pH of 
4.0 to 8.0 and contains a suspending agent(s) sufficient to maintain a 
viscosity of not less than 300 centipoises per second for 3 months.
    (3) Combination Type B or C medicated feeds containing lasalocid 
must be labeled in accordance with Sec.  558.311(d)(5) of this chapter.
    (4) Liquid combination Type B or C medicated feeds containing 
melengestrol acetate and lasalocid must be manufactured in accordance 
with Sec.  558.311(d) of this chapter.
    (5) Combination Type B or C medicated feeds containing monensin must 
be labeled in accordance with Sec.  558.355(d) of this chapter.

Sec.  558.355  Monensin.

    (a) Specifications. Monensin, as the base or the sodium salt, 
contains a minimum of 90 percent monensin activity derived from monensin 
A and a minimum of 95 percent derived from monensin A plus B. Using thin 
layer chromatography, the R<INF>f</INF> value must be comparable to a 
reference standard (the R<INF>f</INF> value is the distance the spots 
travel from the starting line divided by the distance the solvent front 
travels from the starting line), or, using High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography, the factor distribution of monensin Factor A or B is 
calculated as the percentage of total biopotency of all peaks. The loss 
on drying is not more than 10 percent when dried in vacuum at 60 [deg]C 
for 2 hours.

    (3) Cattle--(i) Amount per ton. Monensin, 5-30 grams.
    (a) Indications for use. Improved feed efficiency.
    (b) Limitations. (1) Feed only to cattle being fed in confinement 
for slaughter. Feed continuously in complete feed at a rate of 50 to 360 
milligrams of monensin per head per day; as monensin sodium. Complete 
feeds may be manufactured from monensin liquid Type B feeds. The liquid 
Type B feeds have a pH of 4.3 to 7.1 and their labels must bear 
appropriate mixing directions. Mixing directions for liquid Type B feeds 
stored in recirculating tank systems are: Recirculate immediately prior 
to use for no less than 10 minutes, moving not less than 1 percent of 
the tank contents per minute from the bottom of the tank to the top. 
Recirculate daily, as directed in this paragraph, even when Type B feed 
is not used. Mixing directions for liquid Type B feeds stored in 
mechanical, air, or other agitation-type tank systems are: Agitate 
immediately prior to use for not less than 10 minutes, creating a 
turbulence at the bottom of the tank that is visible at the top. Agitate 
daily, as directed in this paragraph, even when Type B feed is not used. 
The liquid Type B feed must bear directions to mix thoroughly with grain 
and/or roughage prior to feeding and must bear caution statements as 
follows: Inadequate mixing, (recirculation or agitation), of liquid Type 
B feeds has resulted in increased monensin concentration which has been 
fatal to cattle.
    (2) An approved positionally stable monensin liquid Type B feed will 
not be subject to the requirements for mixing directions and cautionary 
labeling prescribed in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(b)(1) of this section. A 
manufacturer may secure approval of a positionally stable liquid Type B 
feed by (i) either filing an NADA for the product or by establishing a 
master file containing data to support the stability of its product; 
(ii) authorizing the agency to reference and rely upon the data in the 
master file to support approval of a supplemental NADA to establish 
positional stability; and (iii) requesting No. 000986 in Sec.  
510.600(c) of this chapter to file a supplemental NADA to provide for 
the use of its monensin Type A article in the manufacture of the liquid 
Type B feed specified in the appropriate master file. If the data 
demonstrate the stability of the liquid Type B feed described in the 
master file, the agency will approve the supplemental NADA. Approval of 
the Type B feed need not be published in the Federal Register because 
approval will not affect or alter the content of the regulation. The 
approval will, however, provide a basis for the individual liquid feed 
manufacturer to submit, and for the agency to approve, a medicated feed 
application under section 512(m) of the act for the liquid Type B feed. 
A manufacturer who seeks to market a positionally unstable monensin 
liquid Type B feed with mixing directions different from the standard 
established in paragraph (f)(3)(i)(b)(1) of this section may also follow 
this procedure.

monensin sodium. Type C feeds may be manufactured from monensin liquid 
Type B feeds. The liquid Type B feeds have a pH of 4.3 to 7.1 and their 
labels must bear appropriate mixing directions. Mixing directions for 
liquid Type B feeds stored in recirculating tank systems are: 
Recirculate immediately prior to use for no less than 10 minutes, moving 
not less than 1 percent of the tank contents per minute from the bottom 
of the tank to the top. Recirculate daily, as directed in this 
paragraph, even when Type B feed is not used. Mixing directions for 
liquid Type B feeds stored in mechanical, air, or other agitation-type 
tank systems are: Agitate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 
minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the tank that is visible 
at the top. Agitate daily, as directed in this paragraph, even when Type 
B feed is not used. The liquid Type B feed must bear directions to mix 
thoroughly with grain and/or roughage prior to feeding and must bear 
caution statement as follows: Inadequate mixing (recirculation or 
agitation), of liquid Type B feeds has resulted in increased monensin 
concentration which could be fatal to goats.
    (2) An approved positionally stable monensin liquid Type B feed will 
not be subject to the requirements for mixing directions and cautionary 
labeling prescribed in paragraph (f)(6)(i)(b)(1) of this section. A 
manufacturer may secure approval of a positionally stable liquid Type B 
feed by (i) either filing an NADA for the product or by establishing a 
master file containing data to support the stability of its product; 
(ii) authorizing the agency to reference and rely upon the data in the 
master file to support approval of a supplemental NADA to establish 
positional stability; and (iii) requesting No. 000986 in Sec.  
510.600(c) of this chapter to file a supplemental NADA to provide for 
the use of its monensin Type A article in the manufacture of the liquid 
Type B feed specified in the appropriate master file. If the data 
demonstrate the stability of the liquid Type B feed described in the 
master file, the agency will approve the supplemental NADA. Approval of 
the Type B feed need not be published in the Federal Register because 
approval will not affect or alter the content of the regulation. The 
approval will, however, provide a basis for the individual liquid feed 
manufacturer to submit, and for the agency to approve, a medicated feed 
application under section 512(m) of the act for the liquid Type B feed. 
A manufacturer who seeks to market a positionally unstable monensin 
liquid Type B feed with mixing directions different from

[[Page 440]]

the standard established in paragraph (f)(6)(i)(b)(1) of this section 
may also follow this procedure.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (7) Monensin may also be used in combination with:
    (i) Decoquinate alone or with tylosin as in Sec.  558.195.
    (ii) Melengestrol acetate alone or with tylosin as in Sec.  558.342.

    (2) For control of legume (alfalfa, clover) bloat in cattle grazing 
of prebloom legumes, use 10.00 grams of poloxalene per pound of liquid 
Type C feed (2.2 percent weight/weight). Each animal must consume 0.15 
pound of Type C feed per 100 pounds of body weight daily for adequate 
protection. If consumption exceeds 0.2 pound of Type C feed per 100 
pounds of body weight daily, cattle should be changed to a Type C feed 
containing 7.5 grams of poloxalene per pound.
    (3) Poloxalene liquid Type A article must be thoroughly blended and 
evenly distributed into a liquid Type C feed and offered to cattle in a 
covered liquid Type C feed feeder with lick wheels. The formula for the 
liquid Type C feed, on a weight/weight basis, is as follows: Ammonium 
polyphosphate 2.66 percent, phosphoric acid (75 percent) 3.37 percent, 
sulfuric acid 1.00 percent, water 10.00 percent, and molasses sufficient 
to make 100.00 percent, vitamins A and D and/or trace minerals may be 
added. One free-turning lick wheel per 25 head of cattle must be 
provided.
    (4) The medicated liquid Type C feed must be introduced at least 2 
to 5 days before legume consumption to accustom the cattle to the 
medicated liquid Type C feed and to lick wheel feedings. If the 
medicated liquid wheel Type C feed feeding is interrupted, this 2- to 5-
day introductory feeding should be repeated.

Sec.  558.586  Sulfaquinoxoline.

    (a) Approvals. Type A medicated articles: 40 percent to 050749 in 
Sec.  510.600(c) of this chapter.

[[Page 472]]

    (b)-(c) [Reserved]
    (d) NAS/NRC status. The conditions of use specified in this section 
have been reviewed by NAS/NRC and are found effective. Applications for 
these uses need not include effectiveness data as specified by Sec.  
514.111 of this chapter, but may require bioequivalency information. 
Applications must be accompanied by a written commitment to undertake 
the human safety studies required by FDA.
    (e) Special considerations. (1) For control of outbreaks of disease, 
medication should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis is determined. 
Medicated chickens, turkeys, and rabbits must actually consume enough 
medicated feed which provides a recommended dose of approximately 3.5 to 
60 milligrams per pound per day in chickens, 2.5 to 100 milligrams per 
pound per day in turkeys, and 2.8 to 68 milligrams per pound per day in 
rabbits depending upon age and class of animal, ambient temperature, and 
other factors. Consult a veterinarian or poultry pathologist for 
diagnosis.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) Conditions of use. It is used as follows:
    (1) Chickens--(i) Amount. 0.015 percent.
    (a) Indications for use. As an aid in preventing outbreaks of 
coccidiosis caused by Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. 
maxima, and E. brunetti under average conditions of exposure.
    (b) Limitations. Feed continuously from the time birds are placed on 
litter and continue past the age when coccidiosis is ordinarily a 
hazard. If death losses exceed 0.5 percent in a 2-day period, obtain a 
laboratory diagnosis. If coccidiosis is the cause, use the 
sulfaquinoxaline levels recommended for control of outbreaks, returning 
to the original dosage schedule after the outbreak has subsided. Losses 
may result from intercurrent disease, other conditions affecting drug 
intake, or variant strains of coccidia species which can contribute to 
the virulence of coccidiosis under field conditions. Do not treat 
chickens within 10 days of slaughter. Do not medicate chickens producing 
eggs for human consumption.
    (ii) Amount. 0.0175 percent.
    (a) Indications for use. As an aid in preventing outbreaks of 
coccidiosis caused by Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. 
maxima, and E. brunetti where excessive exposure to coccidia is 
increased due to overcrowding or other management factors.
    (b) Limitations. Feed continuously from the time birds are placed on 
litter and continue past the age when coccidiosis is ordinarily a 
hazard. If death losses exceed 0.5 percent in a 2-day period, obtain a 
laboratory diagnosis. If coccidiosis is the cause, use the 
sulfaquinoxaline levels recommended for control of outbreaks, returning 
to the original dosage schedule after the outbreak has subsided. Losses 
may result from intercurrent disease, other conditions affecting drug 
intake, or variant strains of coccidia species which can contribute to 
the virulence of coccidiosis under field conditions. Do not treat 
chickens within 10 days of slaughter. Do not medicate chickens producing 
eggs for human consumption.
    (iii) Amount. 0.1 to 0.05 percent.
    (a) Indications for use. As an aid in controlling outbreaks of 
coccidiosis caused by Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. 
maxima, and E. brunetti.
    (b) Limitations. Feed at 0.1 percent level for first 48 to 72 hours. 
Skip 3 days; 0.05 percent for 2 days, skip 3 days; 0.05 percent for 2 
days. If bloody droppings recur, give 0.05 percent for another 2 days. 
Do not treat chickens within 10 days of slaughter. Do not medicate 
chickens producing eggs for human consumption.
    (2) Turkeys--(i) Amount. 0.0175 percent.
    (a) Indications for use. As an aid in preventing outbreaks of 
coccidiosis caused by Eimeria meleagrimitis and E. adenoeides.
    (b) Limitations. Feed 0.0175 percent continuously during time birds 
are closely confined. May be continued for week to 10 days after flock 
is transferred to range to reduce danger of an outbreak following moving 
of the flock. Do not treat turkeys within 10 days of slaughter. Do not 
medicate turkeys producing eggs for human consumption.
    (ii) Amount. 0.05 percent.

[[Page 473]]

    (a) Indications for use. As an aid in controlling outbreaks of 
coccidiosis caused by Eimeria meleagrimitis, and E. adenoeides.
    (b) Limitations. Feed 0.05 percent for 2 days. Follow with 3 days on 
regular feed and 2 more days on 0.05 percent sulfaquinoxaline feed. 
Again follow with 3 days on regular feed and 2 more days on 0.05 percent 
sulfaquinoxaline feed. Continue this schedule if necessary till all 
signs of the outbreaks have subsided. Do not treat turkeys within 10 
days of slaughter. Do not medicate turkeys producing eggs for human 
consumption.
    (3) Chickens and turkeys--(i) Amount. 0.05 or 0.1 percent.
    (a) Indications for use. As an aid in the control of acute fowl 
cholera caused by Pasteurella multocida susceptible to sulfaquinoxaline 
and fowl typhoid caused by Salmonella gallinarum susceptible to 
sulfaquinoxaline.
    (b) Limitations. Feed 0.1 percent for 48 to 72 hours. Mortality 
should be brought under control. After medication, move birds to clean 
ground or to a clean house. If disease recurs, use 0.05 percent in feed 
again for 2 days. Do not treat chickens or turkeys within 10 days of 
slaughter for food. Do not medicate chickens or turkeys producing eggs 
for human consumption.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (4) Rabbits--(i) Amount. 0.025 percent.
    (a) Indications for use. As an aid in preventing coccidiosis caused 
by Eimeria stiedae.
    (b) Limitations. Treatment to be started after weaning. Feed 
continuously for 30 days or feed medicated feed for 2 days out of every 
week until marketing. Do not treat within 10 days of slaughter.
    (ii) Amount. 0.1 percent.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec.  570.3  Definitions.

    (a) Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
    (b) Department means the Department of Health and Human Services.
    (c) Commissioner means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
    (d) As used in this part, the term act means the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act approved June 25, 1936 (52 Stat. 1040 et seq., as 
amended; 21 U.S.C. 301-392).
    (e) Food additives includes all substances not exempted by section 
201(s) of the act, the intended use of which results or may reasonably 
be expected to result, directly or indirectly, either in their becoming 
a component of food or otherwise affecting the characteristics of food. 
A material used in the production of containers and packages is subject 
to the definition if it may reasonably be expected to become a 
component, or to affect the characteristics, directly or indirectly, of 
food packed in the container. Affecting the characteristics of food does 
not include such physical effects, as protecting contents of packages, 
preserving shape, and preventing moisture loss. If there is no migration 
of a packaging component from the package to the food, it does not 
become a component of the food and thus is not a food additive. A 
substance that does not become a component of food, but that is used, 
for example, in preparing an ingredient of the food to give a different 
flavor, texture, or other characteristic in the food, may be a food 
additive.
    (f) Common use in food means a substantial history of consumption of 
a substance by a significant number of animals in the United States.
    (g) The word substance in the definition of the term food additive 
includes a food or feed or a component of a food or feed consisting of 
one or more ingredients.
    (h) Scientific procedures include those human, animal, analytical, 
and other scientific studies, whether published or unpublished, 
appropriate to establish the safety of a substance.
    (i) Safe or safety means that there is a reasonable certainty in the 
minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under 
the intended conditions of use. It is impossible in the present state of 
scientific knowledge to establish with complete certainty the absolute 
harmlessness of the use of any substance. Safety may be determined by 
scientific procedures or by general recognition of safety. In 
determining safety, the following factors shall be considered:
    (1) The probable consumption of the substance and of any substance 
formed in or on food because of its use;
    (2) The cumulative effect of the substance in the diet, taking into 
account any chemically or pharmacologically related substance or 
substances in such diet;
    (3) Safety factors which, in the opinion of experts qualified by 
scientific training and experience to evaluate the

[[Page 486]]

safety of food and food ingredients, are generally recognized as 
appropriate.
    (j) The term nonperishable processed food means any processed food 
not subject to rapid decay or deterioration that would render it unfit 
for consumption. Not included are hermetically sealed foods and other 
processed foods requiring refrigeration.
    (k) General recognition of safety shall be determined in accordance 
with Sec.  570.30.
    (l) Prior sanction means an explicit approval granted with respect 
to use of a substance in food prior to September 6, 1958, by the Food 
Drug and Administration or the United States Department of Agriculture 
pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Poultry 
Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act.
    (m) Food includes human food, substances migrating to food from 
food-contact articles, pet food, and animal feed.

<R05>
Sec.  570.6  Opinion letters on food additive status.

    (a) Over the years the Food and Drug Administration has given 
informal written opinions to inquirers as to the safety of articles 
intended for use as components of, or in contact with, food. Prior to 
the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (Pub. L. 85-929, 
Sept. 6, 1958), these opinions were given pursuant to section 402(a)(1) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which reads in part: ``A 
food shall be deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains any 
poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to 
health''.
    (b) Since enactment of the Food Additives Amendment, the Food and 
Drug Administration has advised such inquirers that an article:
    (1) Is a food additive within the meaning of section 201(s) of the 
act; or
    (2) Is generally recognized as safe (GRAS); or
    (3) Has prior sanction or approval under that amendment; or
    (4) Is not a food additive under the conditions of intended use.
    (c) In the interest of the public health, such articles which have 
been considered in the past by the Food and Drug Administration to be 
safe under the provisions of section 402(a)(1), or to be generally 
recognized as safe for their intended use, or to have prior sanction or 
approval, or not to be food additives under the conditions of intended 
use, must be reexamined in the light of current scientific information 
and current principles for evaluating the safety of food additives if 
their use is to be continued.
    (d) Because of the time span involved, copies of many of the letters 
in which the Food and Drug Administration has expressed an informal 
opinion concerning the status of such articles may no longer be in the 
file of the Food and Drug Administration. In the absence of information 
concerning the names and uses made of all the articles referred to in 
such letters, their safety of use cannot be reexamined. For this reason 
all food additive status opinions of the kind described in paragraph (c) 
of this section given by the Food and Drug Administration are hereby 
revoked.
    (e) The prior opinions of the kind described in paragraph (c) of 
this section will be replaced by qualified and current opinions if the 
recipient of each such letter forwards a copy of each to the Department 
of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Center for 
Veterinary Medicine, Office of Surveillance and Compliance (HFV-200), 
7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, along with a copy of his letter 
of inquiry, on or before July 23, 1970.
    (f) This section does not apply to food additive status opinion 
letters pertaining to articles that were considered by the Food and Drug 
Administration to be food additives nor to articles included in 
regulations in this Subchapter E if the articles are used in accordance 
with the requirements of such regulations.

Sec.  570.15  Adoption of regulation on initiative of Commissioner.

    (a) The Commissioner upon his own initiative may propose the 
issuance of a regulation prescribing, with respect to any particular use 
of a food additive, the conditions under which such additive may be 
safely used. Notice of such proposal shall be published in the Federal 
Register and shall state the reasons for the proposal.
    (b) Action upon a proposal made by the Commissioner shall proceed as 
provided in part 10 of this chapter.

Sec.  570.17  Exemption for investigational use and procedure for obtaining authorization to market edible products from experimental animals.

    A food additive or food containing a food additive intended for 
investigational use by qualified experts shall be exempt from the 
requirements of section 409 of the act under the following conditions:
    (a) If intended for investigational use in vitro or in laboratory 
research animals, it bears a label which states prominently, in addition 
to the other information required by the act, the warning:

    Caution. Contains a new food additive for investigational use only 
in laboratory research animals or for tests in vitro. Not for use in 
humans.

    (b) If intended for use in animals other than laboratory research 
animals and if the edible products of the animals are to be marketed as 
food, permission for the marketing of the edible products as food has 
been requested by the sponsor, and authorization has been granted by the 
Food and Drug Administration in accordance with Sec.  511.1 of this 
chapter or by the Department of Agriculture in accordance with 9 CFR 
309.17, and it bears a label which states prominently, in addition to 
the other information required by the act, the warning:

    Caution. Contains a new food additive for use only in 
investigational animals. Not for use in humans.
    Edible products of investigational animals are not to be used for 
food unless authorization has been granted by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration or by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

    (c) If intended for nonclinical laboratory studies in food-producing 
animals, the study is conducted in compliance with the regulations set 
forth in part 58 of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec.  570.18  Tolerances for related food additives.

    (a) Food additives that cause similar or related pharmacological 
effects will be regarded as a class, and in the absence of evidence to 
the contrary, as having additive toxic effects and will be considered as 
related food additives.
    (b) Tolerances established for such related food additives may limit 
the amount of a common component that may be present, or may limit the 
amount of biological activity (such as cholinesterase inhibition) that 
may be present or may limit the total amount of related food additives 
that may be present.
    (c) Where food additives from two or more chemicals in the same 
class are present in or on a food, the tolerance for the total of such 
additives shall be the same as that for the additive having the lowest 
numerical tolerance in this class, unless there are available

[[Page 488]]

methods that permit quantitative determination of the amount of each 
food additive present or unless it is shown that a higher tolerance is 
reasonably required for the combined additives to accomplish the 
physical or technical effect for which such combined additives are 
intended and that the higher tolerance will be safe.
    (d) Where residues from two or more additives in the same class are 
present in or on a food and there are available methods that permit 
quantitative determination of each residue, the quantity of combined 
residues that are within the tolerance may be determined as follows:
    (1) Determine the quantity of each residue present.
    (2) Divide the quantity of each residue by the tolerance that would 
apply if it occurred alone, and multiply by 100 to determine the 
percentage of the permitted amount of residue present.
    (3) Add the percentages so obtained for all residues present.
    (4) The sum of the percentages shall not exceed 100 percent.

Sec.  570.19  Pesticide chemicals in processed foods.

    When pesticide chemical residues occur in processed foods due to the 
use of raw agricultural commodities that bore or contained a pesticide 
chemical in conformity with an exemption granted or a tolerance 
prescribed under section 408 of the act, the processed food will not be 
regarded as adulterated so long as good manufacturing practice has been 
followed in removing any residue from the raw agricultural commodity in 
the processing (such as by peeling or washing) and so long as the 
concentration of the residue in the processed food when ready to eat is 
not greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural 
commodity. But when the concentration of residue in the processed food 
when ready to eat is higher than the tolerance prescribed for the raw 
agricultural commodity, the processed food is adulterated unless the 
higher concentration is permitted by a tolerance obtained under section 
409 of the act. For example, if fruit bearing a residue of 7 parts per 
million of DDT permitted on the raw agricultural commodity is dried and 
a residue in excess of 7 parts per million of DDT results on the dried 
fruit, the dehydrated fruit is adulterated unless the higher tolerance 
for DDT is authorized by the regulations in this part. Food that is 
itself ready to eat, and which contains a higher residue than allowed 
for the raw agricultural commodity, may not be legalized by blending or 
mixing with other foods to reduce the residue in the mixed food below 
the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity.

                     Subpart B--Food Additive Safety


<R05>
Sec.  570.20  General principles for evaluating the safety of food additives.

    (a) In reaching a decision on any petition filed under section 409 
of the act, the Commissioner will give full consideration to the 
specific biological properties of the compound and the adequacy of the 
methods employed to demonstrate safety for the proposed use, and the 
Commissioner will be guided by the principles and procedures for 
establishing the safety of food additives stated in current publications 
of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council. A 
petition will not be denied, however, by reason of the petitioner's 
having followed procedures other than those outlined in the publications 
of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council if, from 
available evidence, the Commissioner finds that the procedures used give 
results as reliable as, or more reliable than, those reasonably to be 
expected from the use of the outlined procedures. In reaching a 
decision, the Commissioner will give due weight to the anticipated 
levels and patterns of consumption of the additive specified or 
reasonably inferable. For the purposes of this section, the principles 
for evaluating safety of additives set forth in the above-mentioned 
publications will apply to any substance that may properly be classified 
as a food additive as defined in section 201(s) of the act.
    (b) Upon written request describing the proposed use of an additive 
and the proposed experiments to determine its safety, the Commissioner 
will advise a person who wishes to establish the

[[Page 489]]

safety of a food additive whether he believes the experiments planned 
will yield data adequate for an evaluation of the safety of the 
additive.


<R05>
Sec.  570.30  Eligibility for classification as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).

    (a) General recognition of safety may be based only on the views of 
experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the 
safety of substances directly or indirectly added to food. The basis of 
such views may be either (1) scientific procedures or (2) in the case of 
a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, through experience 
based on common use in food. General recognition of safety requires 
common knowledge about the substance throughout the scientific community 
knowledgeable about the safety of substances directly or indirectly 
added to food.
    (b) General recognition of safety based upon scientific procedures 
shall require the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is 
required to obtain approval of a food additive regulation for the 
ingredient. General recognition of safety through scientific procedures 
shall ordinarily be based upon published studies which may be 
corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information.
    (c) General recognition of safety through experience based on common 
use in food prior to January 1, 1958, may be determined without the 
quantity or quality of scientific procedures required for approval of a 
food additive regulation. General recognition of safety through 
experience based on common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, shall 
ordinarily be based upon generally available data and information. An 
ingredient not in common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, may 
achieve general recognition of safety only through scientific 
procedures.
    (d) The food ingredients listed as GRAS in part 582 of this chapter 
do not include all substances that are generally recognized as safe for 
their intended use in food. Because of the large number of substances 
the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to 
result, directly or indirectly, in their becoming a component or 
otherwise affecting the characteristics of food, it is impracticable to 
list all such substances that are GRAS. A food ingredient of natural 
biological origin that has been widely consumed for its nutrient 
properties in the United States prior to January 1, 1958, without known 
detrimental effects, which is subject only to conventional processing as 
practiced prior to January 1, 1958, and for which no known safety hazard 
exists, will ordinarily be regarded as GRAS without specific inclusion 
in part 582 of this chapter.
    (e) A food ingredient that is not GRAS or subject to a prior 
sanction requires a food additive regulation promulgated under section 
409 of the act before it may be directly or indirectly added to food.
    (f) A food ingredient that is listed as GRAS in part 582 of this 
chapter shall be regarded as GRAS only if, in addition to all the 
requirements in the applicable regulation, it also meets all of the 
following requirements:
    (1) It complies with any applicable specifications, or in the 
absence of such specifications, shall be of a purity suitable for its 
intended use.
    (2) It performs an appropriate function in the food or food-contact 
article in which it is used.
    (3) It is used at a level no higher than necessary to achieve its 
intended purpose in that food or, if used as a component of a food-
contact article, at a level no higher than necessary to achieve its 
intended purpose in that article.
    (g) New information may at an time require reconsideration of the 
GRAS status of a food ingredient. Any change in status shall be 
accomplished pursuant to Sec.  570.38.
    (h) If a substance is affirmed as GRAS pursuant to Sec.  570.35 and 
listed in a regulation with no limitation other than good manufacturing 
practice, it shall be regarded as GRAS if its conditions of use are not 
significantly different from those reported in the regulation as the 
basis on which the GRAS status of the substance was affirmed. If the 
conditions of use are significantly different, such use of the substance 
may not be GRAS. In such case a manufacturer may not rely on the 
regulation as authorizing the use but must

[[Page 490]]

independently establish that the use is GRAS or must use the substance 
in accordance with a food additive regulation.
    (i) If an ingredient is affirmed as GRAS pursuant to Sec.  570.35 
and listed in a regulation with specific limitation(s), it may be used 
in food only within such limitation(s) (including the category of 
food(s), the functional use(s) of the ingredient, and the level(s) of 
use). Any use of such and ingredient not in full compliance with each 
such established limitation shall require a food additive regulation.
    (j) Pursuant to Sec.  570.35, a food ingredient may be affirmed as 
GRAS and listed in a regulation for a specific use(s) without a general 
evaluation of use of the ingredient. In addition to the use(s) specified 
in the regulation, other uses of such an ingredient may also be GRAS. 
Any affirmation of GRAS status for a specific use(s), without a general 
evaluation of use of the ingredient, is subject to reconsideration upon 
such evaluation.

[42 FR 55206, Oct. 14, 1977]


<R05>
Sec.  570.35  Affirmation of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status.

    (a) The Commissioner, either on his initiative or on the petition of 
an interested person, may affirm the GRAS status of substances that 
directly or indirectly become components of food.
    (b)(1) If the Commissioner proposes on his own initiative that a 
substance is entitled to affirmation as GRAS, he will place all of the 
data and information on which he relies on public file in the office of 
the Dockets Management Branch and will publish in the Federal Register a 
notice giving the name of the substance, its proposed uses, and any 
limitations proposed for purposes other than safety.
    (2) The Federal Register notice will allow a period of 60 days 
during which any interested person may review the data and information 
and/or file comments with the Dockets Management Branch. Copies of all 
comments received shall be made available for examination in the Dockets 
Management Branch's office.
    (3) The Commissioner will evaluate all comments received. If he 
concludes that there is convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS 
as defined in Sec.  570.3(k), he will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register listing the substance in this subchapter E as GRAS.
    (4) If, after evaluation of the comments, the Commissioner concludes 
that there is a lack of convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS 
and that it should be considered a food additive subject to section 409 
of the act, he shall publish a notice thereof in the Federal Register in 
accordance with Sec.  570.38.
    (c)(1) Persons seeking the affirmation of GRAS status of substances 
as provided for in Sec.  570.30(e), except those subject to the NAS-NRC 
GRAS list survey (36 FR 20546), shall submit a petition for GRAS 
affirmation pursuant to part 10 of this chapter. Such petition shall 
contain information to establish that the GRAS criteria as set forth in 
Sec.  570.30(b) have been met, in the following form:
    (i) Description of the substance, including:
    (a) Common or usual name.
    (b) Chemical name.
    (c) Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) registry number.
    (d) Empirical formula.
    (e) Structural formula.
    (f) Specifications for food grade material, including arsenic and 
heavy metals. (Recommendation for any change in the Food Chemicals Codex 
monograph should be included where applicable.)
    (g) Quantitative compositions.
    (h) Manufacturing process (excluding any trade secrets).
    (ii) Use of the substance, including:
    (a) Date when use began.
    (b) Information and reports or other data on past uses in food.
    (c) Foods in which used, and levels of use in such foods, and for 
what purposes.
    (iii) Methods for detecting the substance in food, including:
    (a) References to qualitative and quantitative methods for 
determining the substance(s) in food, including the type of analytical 
procedures used.
    (b) Sensitivity and reproducibility of such method(s).
    (iv) Information to establish the safety and functionality of the 
substance in food. Published scientific literature,

[[Page 491]]

evidence that the substance is identical to a GRAS counterpart of 
natural biological origin, and other data may be submitted to support 
safety. Any adverse information or consumer complaints shall be 
included. Complete bibliographic references shall be provided where a 
copy of the article is not provided.
    (v) A statement signed by the person responsible for the petition 
that to the best of his knowledge it is a representative and balanced 
submission that includes unfavorable information, as well as favorable 
information, known to him pertinent to the evaluation of the safety and 
functionality of the substance.
    (vi) If nonclinical laboratory studies are involved, additional 
information and data submitted in support of filed petitions shall 
include, with respect to each nonclinical study, either a statement that 
the study was conducted in compliance with the requirements set forth in 
part 58 of this chapter, or, if the study was not conducted in 
compliance with such regulations, a brief statement of the reason for 
the noncompliance.
    (vii) [Reserved]
    (viii) A claim for categorical exclusion under Sec.  25.30 or 25.32 
of this chapter or an environmental assessment under Sec.  25.40 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Within 30 days after the date of filing the petition, the 
Commissioner will place the petition on public file in the Dockets 
Management Branch and will publish a notice of filing in the Federal 
Register giving the name of the petitioner and a brief description of 
the petition including the name of the substance, its proposed use, and 
any limitations proposed for reasons other than safety. A copy of the 
notice will be mailed to the petitioner at the time the original is sent 
to the Federal Register.
    (3) The notice of filing in the Federal Register will allow a period 
of 60 days during which any interested person may review the petition 
and/or file comments with the Dockets Management Branch. Copies of all 
comments received shall be made available for examination in the Dockets 
Management Branch.
    (4) The Commissioner will evaluate the petition and all available 
information including all comments received. If the petition and such 
information provide convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS as 
defined in Sec.  570.3, he will publish an order in the Federal Register 
listing the substance in this subchapter E as GRAS.
    (5) If, after evaluation of the petition and all available 
information, the Commissioner concludes that there is a lack of 
convincing evidence that the substance is GRAS and that it should be 
considered a food additive subject to section 409 of the act, he shall 
publish a notice thereof in the Federal Register in accordance with 
Sec.  570.38.
    (6) The notice of filing in the Federal Register will request 
submission of proof of any applicable prior sanction for use of the 
ingredient under conditions different from those proposed to be 
determined to be GRAS. The failure of any person to come forward with 
proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to the notice of 
filing will constitute a waiver of the right to assert or rely on such 
sanction at any later time. The notice of filing will also constitute a 
proposal to establish a regulation under this subchapter E, 
incorporating the same provisions, in the event that such a regulation 
is determined to be appropriate as a result of submission of proof of 
such an applicable prior sanction in response to the notice of filing.

<R05>
Sec.  570.38  Determination of food additive status.

    (a) The Commissioner may, in accordance with Sec.  570.35 (b)(4) or 
(c)(5), publish a notice in the Federal Register determining that a 
substance is not GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409 of 
the act.
    (b)(1) The Commissioner, on his own initiative or on the petition of 
any interested person, pursuant to part 10 of this chapter, may issue a 
notice in the Federal Register proposing to determine that a substance 
is not GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409

[[Page 492]]

of the act. Any petition shall include all relevant data and information 
of the type described in Sec.  571.130(b) of this chapter. The 
Commissioner will place all of the data and information on which he 
relies on public file in the Dockets Management Branch and will include 
in the Federal Register notice the name of the substance, its known 
uses, and a summary of the basis for the determination.
    (2) The Federal Register notice will allow a period of 60 days 
during which any interested person may review the data and information 
and/or file comments with the Dockets Management Branch. Copies of all 
comments shall be made available for examination in the Dockets 
Management Branch.
    (3) The Commissioner will evaluate all comments received. If he 
concludes that there is a lack of convincing evidence that the substance 
is GRAS or is otherwise exempt from the definition of a food additive in 
section 201(s) of the act, he will publish a notice thereof in the 
Federal Register. If he concludes that there is convincing evidence that 
the substance is GRAS, he will publish an order in the Federal Register 
listing the substance in this subchapter E as GRAS.
    (c) A Federal Register notice determining that a substance is a food 
additive shall provide for the use of the additive in food or food-
contact surfaces as follows:
    (1) It may promulgate a food additive regulation governing use of 
the additive.
    (2) It may promulgate an interim food additive regulation governing 
use of the additive.
    (3) It may require discontinuation of the use of the additive.
    (4) It may adopt any combination of the above three approaches for 
different uses or levels of use of the additive.
    (d) If the Commissioner of Food and Drugs is aware of any prior 
sanction for use of the substance, he will concurrently propose a 
separate regulation covering such use of the ingredient under this 
subchapter E. If the Commissioner is unaware of any such applicable 
prior sanction, the proposed regulation will so state and will require 
any person who intends to assert or rely on such sanction to submit 
proof of its existence. Any regulation promulgated pursuant to this 
section constitutes a determination that excluded uses would result in 
adulteration of the food in violation of section 402 of the act, and the 
failure of any person to come forward with proof of such an applicable 
prior sanction in response to the proposal will constitute a waiver of 
the right to assert or rely on such sanction at any later time. The 
notice will also constitute a proposal to establish a regulation under 
this subchapter E., incorporating the same provisions, in the event that 
such a regulation is determined to be appropriate as a result of 
submission of proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to 
the proposal.

    Dear Sirs: The undersigned, --------

submits this petition pursuant to section 409(b)(1) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and

Cosmetic Act with respect to____________________________________________

(Name of the food additive and proposed use)
    Attached hereto, in triplicate, and constituting a part of this 
petition, are the following:
    A. The name and all pertinent information concerning the food 
additive, including chemical identity and composition of the food 
additive, its physical, chemical, and biological properties, and 
specifications prescribing the minimum content of the desired 
component(s) and identifying and limiting the reaction byproducts and 
other impurities. Where such information is not available, a statement 
as to the reasons why it is not should be submitted.
    When the chemical identity and composition of the food additive is 
not known, the petition shall contain information in sufficient detail 
to permit evaluation regarding the method of manufacture and the 
analytical controls used during the various stages of manufacturing, 
processing, or packing of the food additive which are relied upon to 
establish that it is a substance of reproducible composition. 
Alternative methods and controls and variations in methods and controls 
within reasonable limits that do not affect the characteristics of the 
substance or the reliability of the controls may be specified.
    If the food additive is a mixture of chemicals, the petition shall 
supply a list of all substances used in the synthesis, extraction, or 
other method of preparation, regardless of whether they undergo chemical 
change in the process. Each substance should be identified by its common 
English name and complete chemical name, using structural formulas when 
necessary for specific identification. If any proprietary preparation is 
used as a component, the proprietary name should be followed by a 
complete quantitative statement of composition. Reasonable alternatives 
for any listed substance may be specified.
    If the petitioner does not himself perform all the manufacturing, 
processing, and packing operations for a food additive, the petition 
shall identify each person who will perform a part of such operations 
and designate the part.
    The petition shall include stability data, and, if the data indicate 
that it is needed to ensure the identity, strength, quality, or purity 
of the additive, the expiration date that will be employed.
    B. The amount of the food additive proposed for use and the purposes 
for which it is proposed, together with all directions, recommendations, 
and suggestions regarding the proposed use, as well as specimens of the 
labeling proposed for the food additive and any labeling that will be 
required by applicable provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act on the finished food by reason of the use of the food 
additive. If the additive results or may reasonably be expected to 
result from the use of packaging material, the petitioner shall show how 
this may occur and what residues may reasonably be anticipated.
    (Typewritten or other draft-labeling copy will be accepted for 
consideration of the petition, provided a statement is made that final 
printed labeling identical in content to the draft copy will be 
submitted as soon as available and prior to the marketing of the food 
additive.
    If the food additive is one for which a tolerance limitation is 
required to assure its safety, the level of use proposed should be no 
higher than the amount reasonably required to accomplish the intended 
physical or other technical effect, even though the safety data may 
support a higher tolerance.)

[[Page 494]]

    C. Data establishing that the food additive will have the intended 
physical or other technical effect or that it may reasonably be expected 
to become a component, or to affect the characteristics, directly or 
indirectly, of food and the amount necessary to accomplish this. These 
data should include information in sufficient detail to permit 
evaluation with control data.
    D. A description of practicable methods to determine the amount of 
the food additive in the raw, processed, and/or finished food and of any 
substance formed in or on such food because of its use. The test 
proposed shall be one that can be used for food-control purposes and 
that can be applied with consistent results by any properly equipped and 
trained laboratory personnel.
    E. Full reports of investigations made with respect to the safety of 
the food additive.
    (A petition may be regarded as incomplete unless it includes full 
reports of adequate tests reasonably applicable to show whether or not 
the food additive will be safe for its intended use. The reports 
ordinarily should include detailed data derived from appropriate animal 
and other biological experiments in which the methods used and the 
results obtained are clearly set forth. The petition shall not omit 
without explanation any reports of investigations that would bias an 
evaluation of the safety of the food additive.)
    F. Proposed tolerances for the food additive, if tolerances are 
required in order to ensure its safety. A petitioner may include a 
proposed regulation.
    G. If submitting petition to modify an existing regulation issued 
pursuant to section 409(c)(1)(A) of the act, full information on each 
proposed change that is to be made in the original regulation must be 
submitted. The petition may omit statements made in the original 
petition concerning which no change is proposed. A supplemental petition 
must be submitted for any change beyond the variations provided for in 
the original petition and the regulation issued on the basis of the 
original petition.
    H. The petitioner is required to submit either a claim for 
categorical exclusion under Sec.  25.30 or Sec.  25.32 of this chapter 
or an environmental assessment under Sec.  25.40 of this chapter.
Yours very truly,
     Petitioner --------

                                                    (Indicate authority)

    (d) The petitioner will be notified of the date on which his 
petition is filed, and an incomplete petition, or one that has not been 
submitted in triplicate, will usually be retained but not filed as a 
petition under section 409 of the act. The petitioner will be notified 
in what respects his petition is incomplete.
    (e) The petition must be signed by the petitioner or by his attorney 
or agent, or (if a corporation) by an authorized official.
    (f) The data specified under the several lettered headings should be 
submitted on separate sheets or sets of sheets, suitably identified. If 
such data have already been submitted with an earlier application, the 
present petition may incorporate it by specific reference to the 
earlier. If part of the data have been submitted by the manufacturer of 
the food additive as a master file, the petitioner may refer to the 
master file if and to the extent he obtains the manufacturer's written 
permission to do so. The manufacturer may authorize specific reference 
to the data without disclosure to the petitioner. Nothing herein shall 
prevent reference to published data.
    (g) A petition shall be retained but shall not be filed if any of 
the data prescribed by section 409(b) of the act are lacking or are not 
set forth so as to be readily understood.
    (h)(1) The following data and information in a food additive 
petition are available for public disclosure, unless extraordinary 
circumstances are shown, after the notice of filing of the petition is 
published in the Federal Register or, if the petition is not promptly 
filed because of deficiencies in it, after the petitioner is informed 
that it will not be filed because of the deficiencies involved:
    (i) All safety and functionality data and information submitted with 
or incorporated by reference in the petition.
    (ii) A protocol for a test or study, unless it is shown to fall 
within the exemption established for trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information in Sec.  20.61 of this chapter.
    (iii) Adverse reaction reports, product experience reports, consumer 
complaints, and other similar data and information, after deletion of:
    (a) Names and any information that would identify the person using 
the product.
    (b) Names and any information that would identify any third party 
involved with the report, such as a physician or hospital or other

    (i) Unsaponifiable matter shall be determined by the method 
described in Section 28.081, ``Unsaponifiable Residue (20)--Official 
Final Action'' of the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association 
of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed., 1980, p. 451, which is 
incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the Association of 
Official Analytical Chemists, 2200 Wilson Blvd., Suite 400, Arlington, 
VA 22201-3301, or available for inspection at the Office of the Federal 
Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC 
20001.
    (ii) The chick-edema factor bioassay method described under ``26. 
Oils, Fats, and Waxes'' in the Journal of the Association of Official 
Agricultural Chemists, Vol. 44, Page 146 (1961), or the method described 
under ``Chick-Edema Factor--Bioassay Method (34)--Official Final 
Action'' in Sec. Sec.  28.113-28.117, ``Official Methods of Analysis of 
the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 12th Ed., 1975, pp. 
509-511, which is incorporated by reference, shall be employed. (Copies 
of the methods are available from the Association of Official Analytical 
Chemists, 2200 Wilson Blvd., Suite 400, Arlington, VA 22201-3301, or 
available for inspection at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 
North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC 20001.) The 
presence of chick-edema factor shall be determined by a comparison 
between the mean log of the pericardial fluid volumes of a test group 
and of a concurrent negative control group. The significance of the 
difference in pericardial fluid volumes between the test group and the 
negative control group is determined by calculating a ``t'' value 
according to the formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JA93.412

where:
x<INF>t</INF> and x<INF>c</INF> are the means of the logs of the 
pericardial fluid volumes of the test and control groups, respectively;
n<INF>t</INF> and n<INF>c</INF> are the number of chicks in the 
respective groups;
s<INF>t<SUP> 2</SUP></INF> and s<INF>c<SUP> 2</SUP></INF> are the 
variances of the test and control groups, respectively.
The variances are calculated as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR01JA93.413

where:
[Sigma]x is the sum of the logs of the pericardial fluid volumes;
[Sigma]x \2\ is the sum of the squares of the logs of the pericardial 
fluid volumes for either the test t or control c group data.


The test sample is judged to contain chick-edema factor if the 
calculated ``t'' exceeds +1.3 and the mean log of the pericardial fluid 
volume obtained from the negative control group multiplied by 100 is 
less than 1.1461.
    (iii) ``Other factors toxic to chicks'' referred to in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section shall be determined during the course of the 
bioassay test described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, on the 
basis of chick deaths or other abnormalities not attributable to chick-
edema factor or to the experimental conditions of the test.
    (c) It is used or intended for use as a supplementary source of fat 
for animal feed.
    (d) To assure safe use of the additive, in addition to the other 
information required by the act:
    (1) The label and labeling of the additive, and any feed additive

<R05>
Sec.  579.40  Ionizing radiation for the treatment of poultry feed and poultry feed ingredients.

    Ionizing radiation for the treatment of complete poultry diets and 
poultry feed ingredients may be safely used as follows:
    (a) Energy sources. Ionizing radiation is limited to gamma rays from 
sealed units of cobalt-60.
    (b) Limitation. The ionizing radiation is used for feed or feed 
ingredients that do not contain drugs.
    (c) Use. Ionizing radiation is used as a single treatment for 
rendering complete poultry diets or poultry feed ingredients salmonella 
negative as follows:
    (1) Minimum dose 2.0 kiloGrays (kGy) (0.2 megarad (Mrad)); maximum 
dose 25 kGy (2.5 megarads Mrad). The absorbed dose of irradiation is to 
be based on initial concentration of salmonella using the relationship 
that 1.0 kGy (0.1 Mrad) reduces salmonella concentration by one log 
cycle (one decimal reduction).
    (2) Feeds treated by irradiation should be formulated to account for 
nutritional loss.
    (3) If an irradiated feed ingredient is less than 5 percent of the 
final product, the final product can be irradiated without being 
considered to be reirradiated.

                      Subpart A--General Provisions


<R05>
Sec.  582.1  Substances that are generally recognized as safe.

    (a) It is impracticable to list all substances that are generally 
recognized as safe for their intended use. However, by way of 
illustration, the Commissioner regards such common food ingredients as 
salt, pepper, sugar, vinegar, baking powder, and monosodium glutamate as 
safe for their intended use. The lists in subparts B through H of this 
part include additional substances that, when used for the purposes 
indicated, in accordance with good manufacturing or feeding practice, 
are regarded by the Commissioner as generally recognized as safe for 
such uses.
    (b) For the purposes of this section, good manufacturing or feeding 
practice shall be defined to include the following restrictions:
    (1) The quantity of a substance added to animal food does not exceed 
the amount reasonably required to accomplish its intended physical, 
nutritional, or other technical effect in food; and
    (2) The quantity of a substance that becomes a component of animal 
food as a result of its use in the manufacturing, processing, or 
packaging of

[[Page 518]]

food, and which is not intended to accomplish any physical or other 
technical effect in the food itself, shall be reduced to the extent 
reasonably possible.
    (3) The substance is of appropriate grade and is prepared and 
handled as a food ingredient. Upon request the Commissioner will offer 
an opinion, based on specifications and intended use, as to whether or 
not a particular grade or lot of the substance is of suitable purity for 
use in food and would generally be regarded as safe for the purpose 
intended, by experts qualified to evaluate its safety.
    (c) The inclusion of substances in the list of nutrients does not 
constitute a finding on the part of the Department that the substance is 
useful as a supplement to the diet for animals.
    (d) Substances that are generally recognized as safe for their 
intended use within the meaning of section 409 of the Act are listed in 
subparts B through H of this part. When the status of a substance has 
been reevaluated and affirmed as GRAS or deleted from subparts B through 
H of this part, an appropriate explanation will be noted, e.g., 
``affirmed as GRAS,'' ``food additive regulation,'' ``interim food 
additive regulation,'' or ``prohibited from use in food,'' with a 
reference to the appropriate new regulation. Such notation will apply 
only to the specific use covered by the review, e.g., direct animal food 
use and/or indirect animal food use and/or animal feed use and will not 
affect its status for other uses not specified in the referenced 
regulation, pending a specific review of such other uses.

<R05>
Sec.  589.1  Substances prohibited from use in animal food or feed.

    (a) The substances listed in this part have been prohibited from use 
in animal food or feed by the Food and Drug Administration because of a 
determination that they present a potential risk to the public health or 
have not been shown by adequate scientific data to be safe for use in 
such food or feed. Use of any of these substances in violation of this 
part causes the animal food or feed involved to be adulterated and in 
violation of the Act.
    (b) This part includes only a partial list of substances prohibited 
from use in animal food or feed; it is for easy reference purposes and 
is not a complete list of substances that may not lawfully be used in 
such animal food or feed. No substance may be used in animal food or 
feed unless it meets all applicable requirements of the Act.
    (c) The Food and Drug Administration either on its own initiative or 
on behalf of any interested person who has submitted a petition, may 
publish a proposal to establish, amend, or repeal a regulation under 
this part on the basis of new scientific evaluation or information. Any 
such petition shall include an adequate scientific basis to support the 
petition, shall be the form set forth in Sec.  571.1 of this chapter, 
and will be published in the Federal Register for comment if it contains 
reasonable ground.

<R05>
Sec.  589.1000  Gentian violet.

    The Food and Drug Administration has determined that gentian violet 
has not been shown by adequate scientific data to be safe for use in 
animal feed. Use of gentian violet in animal feed causes the feed to be 
adulterated and in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(the act), in the absence of a regulation providing for its safe use as 
a food additive under section 409 of the act, unless it is subject to an 
effective notice of claimed investigational exemption for a food 
additive under Sec.  570.17 of this chapter, or unless the substance is 
intended for use as a new animal drug and is subject to an approved 
application under section 512 of the act or an effective notice of 
claimed investigational exemption for a new animal drug under part 511 
of this chapter.

<R05>
Sec.  589.1001  Propylene glycol in or on cat food.

    The Food and Drug Administration has determined that propylene 
glycol in or on cat food has not been shown by adequate scientific data 
to be safe for use. Use of propylene glycol in or on cat food causes the 
feed to be adulterated and in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (the act), in the absence of a regulation providing for its 
safe use as a food additive under section 409 of the act, unless it is 
subject to an effective notice of claimed investigational exemption for 
a food additive under Sec.  570.17 of this chapter, or unless the 
substance is intended for use as a new animal drug and is subject to an 
approved application under section 512 of the act or an effective notice 
of claimed investigational exemption for a new animal drug under part 
511 of this chapter.

[61 FR 19544, May 2, 1996]


<R05>
Sec.  589.2000  Animal proteins prohibited in ruminant feed.

    (a) Definitions--(1) Protein derived from mammalian tissues means 
any protein-containing portion of mammalian animals, excluding: Blood 
and blood products; gelatin; inspected meat products which have been 
cooked and offered for human food and further heat processed for feed 
(such as plate waste and used cellulosic food casings); milk products 
(milk and milk proteins); and any product whose only mammalian protein 
consists entirely of porcine or equine protein.

[[Page 542]]

    (2) Renderer means any firm or individual that processes slaughter 
byproducts, animals unfit for human consumption, or meat scraps. The 
term includes persons who collect such materials and subject them to 
minimal processing, or distribute them to firms other than renderers (as 
defined here) whose intended use for the products may include animal 
feed. The term includes renderers that also blend animal protein 
products.
    (3) Blender means any firm or individual which obtains processed 
animal protein from more than one source or from more than one species, 
and subsequently mixes (blends) or redistributes an animal protein 
product.
    (4) Feed manufacturer includes manufacturers of complete and 
intermediate feeds intended for animals, and includes on-farm in 
addition to off-farm feed manufacturing and mixing operations.
    (5) Nonmammalian protein includes proteins from nonmammalian 
animals.
    (6) Distributor includes persons who distribute or transport feeds 
or feed ingredients intended for animals.
    (7) Ruminant includes any member of the order of animals which has a 
stomach with four chambers (rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum) 
through which feed passes in digestion. The order includes, but is not 
limited to, cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats, deer, elk, and antelopes.
    (b) Food additive status. The Food and Drug Administration has 
determined that protein derived from mammalian tissues for use in 
ruminant feed is a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The use or intended use in 
ruminant feed of any material that contains protein derived from 
mammalian tissues causes the feed to be adulterated and in violation of 
the act, unless it is the subject of an effective notice of claimed 
investigational exemption for a food additive under Sec.  570.17 of this 
chapter.
    (c) Requirements for renderers that are not included in paragraph 
(e) of this section. (1) Renderers that manufacture products that 
contain or may contain protein derived from mammalian tissues and that 
are intended for use in animal feed shall take the following measures to 
ensure that materials identified in paragraph (b) of this section are 
not used in the feed of ruminants:
    (i) Label the materials as follows: ``Do not feed to cattle or other 
ruminants''; and
    (ii) Maintain records sufficient to track the materials throughout 
their receipt, processing, and distribution, and make the copies 
available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug 
Administration.
    (2) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be 
exempted from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section if they:
