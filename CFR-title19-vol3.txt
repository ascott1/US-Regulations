                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (c) An employee shall not solicit a contribution from another 
employee for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift 
to an official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving 
less pay than himself (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph does not 
prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in a nominal 
amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness, or 
retirement.

other thing from a foreign government unless authorized by Congress as 
provided by the Constitution and in 5 U.S.C. 7342.

from receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for 
expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible 
with this part for which no Government payment or reimbursement is made. 
However, this paragraph does not allow an employee to be reimbursed, or 
payment to be made on his behalf, for excessive personal living 
expenses, gifts, entertainment or other personal benefits, nor does it 
allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official 
business under agency orders when reimbursement is proscribed by 
Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.

preparation of a person or class of persons for an examination of the 
Civil Service Commission or Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service, 
that is dependent on information obtained as a result of his Government 
employment, except when that information has been made available to the 
general public or will be made available on request, or when the 
Commission gives authorization for the use of nonpublic information 
(other than information received in confidence) on the basis that the 
use is in the public interest and would not be in violation of law. In 
addition, Commissioners shall not receive compensation or anything of 
monetary value for any consultation, lecture, discussion, writing, or 
appearance the subject matter of which is devoted substantially to the 
responsibilities, programs, or operations of the Commission, or which

result of, or primarily relying on, information obtained through his 
Government employment.

following types of financial interests are considered too remote or 
inconsequential to affect a Commission employee's integrity or services 
and do not constitute a conflict of interest under 18 U.S.C. 208(a):
    (1) In widely-held, diversified mutual funds or regulated investment 
companies, regardless of their value; and
    (2) In state or local government bonds, or other noncorporate bonds, 
regardless of their value.

Sec. 200.735-110   Indebtedness.

    An employee shall pay each just financial obligation in a proper and 
timely manner, especially one imposed by law such as Federal, State or 
local taxes. For the purpose of this section a just financial obligation 
means one acknowledged by the employee or reduced to judgment by a 
court, and in a proper and timely manner means in a manner which the 
Commission determines does not, under the circumstances, reflect 
adversely on the Government as his employer. In the event of a dispute 
between an employee and an alleged creditor, the Commission shall make 
no determination of the validity or amount of the disputed debt.

Sec. 200.735-111   Gambling, betting, and lotteries.

    An employee shall not participate, while on Government-owned or 
leased property or while on duty for the Government, in any gambling 
activity including the operation of a gambling device, in conducting a 
lottery or pool, in a game for money or property, or in selling or 
purchasing a numbers slip or ticket. However, this section does not 
preclude activities:
    (a) Necessitated by an employee's law enforcement duties; or
    (b) Under section 3 of Executive Order 10927 and similar Commission-
approved activities.

    Source: 45 FR 31988, May 15, 1980, unless otherwise noted.

Sec. 200.735-124  General.

    The procedures in this subpart are established pursuant to 
subsection 207(j) of title 18, United States Code, for the 
administrative enforcement of the restrictions on postemployment 
activities in Title V of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (18 U.S.C. 
207 (a), (b), and (c)) and implementing regulations published by the 
Office of Government Ethics (5 CFR part 737). Subsections 207 (a), (b), 
and (c) of Title 18, United States Code, prohibit certain forms of 
representational activity or communications by former Commission 
employees.

[[Page 13]]

(13

Sec. 200.735-125  Exemption from restrictions.

    (a) Scientific and technological information solicited by the 
Commission. Communications of a former Commission employee solely for 
the purpose of furnishing scientific or technological information 
solicited by the Commission in the course of its statutory 
investigations are exempted from the restrictions on postemployment 
practices.
    (b) Exemption for persons with special qualifications in a technical 
discipline--(1) Applicability. A former Commission employee may be 
exempted from the restrictions on postemployment practices if the 
Chairman, in consultation with the Director, Office of Government Ethics 
(the Director), executes a certification published in the Federal 
Register that the former Commission employee has outstanding 
qualifications in a scientific, technological, or other technical 
discipline; that the former Commission employee is acting with respect 
to a particular matter which requires such qualifications; and that the 
national interest would be served by the former Commission employee's 
participation.
    (2) Certification authority. Certification shall be by the Chairman, 
or in the absence thereof, by the acting head of the Commission. 
Consultation with the Director shall precede any certification. The 
exemption is effective upon the execution of the certification. The 
Secretary shall immediately transmit the certification to the Federal 
Register for publication.
    (c) Testimony and statement under oath are subject to penalty of 
perjury--(1) Applicability. A former Commission employee may testify 
before any court, board, commission, or legislative body with respect to 
matters of fact within the personal knowledge of the former Commission 
employee. This provision does not, however, allow a former Commission 
employee, otherwise barred under 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b), or (c), to 
testify on behalf of another as an expert witness except (i) to the 
extent that the former employee may testify from personal knowledge as 
to occurrences which are relevant to the issues in the proceeding, 
including those in which the Commission employee participated, utilizing 
his or her expertise, or (ii) in any proceeding where it is determined 
that another expert in the field cannot practically be obtained, that it 
is impracticable for the facts or opinions on the same subject to be 
obtained by other means, and that the former Commission employee's 
testimony is required in the interest of justice.
    (2) Statements under penalty of perjury. A former Commission 
employee may make any statements required to be made under penalty of 
perjury, such as those required in registration statements for 
securities, tax returns, or security clearances. The exception does not, 
however, permit a former employee to submit pleadings, applications, or 
other documents in a representational capacity on behalf of another 
merely because the attorney or other representative must sign the 
documents under oath or penalty of perjury.

Sec. 200.735-126  Administrative enforcement proceedings.

    The following are basic guidelines for administrative enforcement of 
restrictions on postemployment activities:
    (a) Initiation of administrative disciplinary hearing. (1) On 
receipt of information regarding a possible violation of 18 U.S.C. 207, 
and after determining that such information does not appear to be 
frivolous, the Chairman shall expeditiously provide such information, 
along with any comments or agency regulations, to the Director and to 
the Criminal Division, Department of Justice. Any investigation or 
administrative action will be coordinated with the Department of Justice 
to avoid prejudicing criminal proceedings, unless the Department of 
Justice informs the Commission that it does not intend to initiate 
criminal prosecution.
    (2) Whenever the Chairman has determined after appropriate review 
that there is reasonable cause to believe that a former Commission 
employee has violated 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b), or (c) or implementing 
regulations of the Office of Government Ethics (5 CFR part 737), he or 
she shall initiate an administrative disciplinary proceeding by 
providing the former Commission employee with notice as defined in 
paragraph (b).

[[Page 14]]

(14
    (3) The Chairman shall take all necessary steps to protect the 
privacy of former employees prior to a determination of sufficient cause 
to initiate an administrative disciplinary hearing.

employee with notice of an administrative disciplinary proceeding and an 
opportunity for a hearing.
    (2) Notice to the former Commission employee must include--
    (i) A statement of allegations and the basis thereof in detail 
sufficient to enable the former Commission employee to prepare an 
adequate defense;
    (ii) Notification of the right to a hearing;
    (iii) An explanation of the method by which a hearing may be 
requested; and
    (iv) A copy of this subpart.
    (c) Examiner. (1) The presiding official at proceedings under this 
subpart shall be an individual to whom the Chairman has delegated 
authority to make a recommended determination (hereinafter referred to 
as examiner).
    (2) An examiner shall be an experienced government attorney of high 
moral character and sound judgment.
    (3) An examiner shall be impartial. No individual who has 
participated in any manner in the decision to initiate the proceedings 
may serve as an examiner in those proceedings.
    (d) Scheduling of hearing. In setting a hearing date, the examiner 
shall give due regard to the former Commission employee's need for--
    (1) Adequate time to prepare a defense properly, and
    (2) An expeditious resolution of allegations that may be damaging to 
his or her reputation.
    (e) Hearing rights. A hearing shall include, at a minimum, the 
following rights:
    (1) To be represented by counsel,
    (2) To introduce and examine witnesses and to submit physical 
evidence,
    (3) To confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses,
    (4) To present oral argument; and
    (5) To obtain a transcript or recording of the proceeding on 
request.
    (f) Burden of proof. In any hearing under this subpart the 
Commission has the burden of proof and must establish a violation by 
clear and convincing evidence. The case of the Commission shall be 
presented by the Office of the General Counsel.
    (g) Recommended determination. (1) The examiner shall make a 
recommended determination exclusively on matters of record in the 
proceeding and shall set forth therein all findings of fact and

Sec. 201.3a  Missing children information.

    (a) Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3220, penalty mail sent by the Commission 
may be used to assist in the location and recovery of missing children. 
This section establishes procedures for such use and is applicable on a

Management Services, 202-724-1234, shall be the point of contact for 
matters related to the implementation of this section.
    (b) Missing children information shall be inserted in or affixed to

and other documents as the Commission may direct. Such missing children 
information shall be obtained exclusively from the National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Children.
    (c) The procedure established in subsection (b) above will result in 
missing childern information being inserted in an estimated 25 percent 
of the Commission's penalty mail and will cost an estimated $1,500 for 
the first year of implementation. The Director of Administration shall 
make such changes in the procedure as he deems appropriate to maximize 
the use of missing children information in the Commission's mail.

it may designate, prosecute any inquiry necessary to its duties in any 
part of the United States or in any foreign country.
    (b) Alteration or waiver of rules. Rules in this chapter may be 
amended, waived, suspended, or revoked by the Commission only. A rule 
may be waived or suspended only when in the judgment of the Commission 
there is good and sufficient reason therefor, provided the rule is not a 
matter of procedure required by law.
    (c) Authority to make decisions. Authority to interpret the 
Commission's rules and the laws applying to the Commission, and to make 
findings, determinations, or other decisions not relating to matters of 
internal management, is retained in the Commission itself and is not 
delegated.
    (d) Presentation of matter that may come within the purview of other 
laws. Whenever any party or person, including the Commission staff, has 
reason to believe that (1) a matter under investigation pursuant to 
section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, or (2) a matter under an 
investigation pursuant to section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 
U.S.C. 2251), which is causing increased imports may come within the 
purview of another remedial provision of law not the basis of such 
investigation, including but not limited to the antidumping provisions 
(19 U.S.C. 1673) or the countervailing duty provisions (19 U.S.C. 1303, 
1671 et seq.) of the Tariff Act of 1930, then the party or person may 
file a suggestion of notification with the Commission that the 
appropriate agency be notified of such matter or circumstances, together 
with such information as the party or person has available. The 
Commission Secretary shall promptly thereafter publish notice of the 
filing of such suggestion and information, and make them available for 
inspection and copying to the extent permitted by law. Any person may 
comment on the suggestion within 10 days after the publication of said 
notice. Thereafter, the Commission shall determine whether notification 
is appropriate under the law and, if so, shall notify the appropriate 
agency of such matters or circumstances. The Commission may at any time 
make such notification in the absence of a suggestion under this rule 
when the Commission has reason to believe, on the basis of information 
before it, that notification is appropriate under law.

same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the courts of the United 
States: Provided, that salaried employees of the United States summoned 
to depose or testify

[[Page 19]]

(19as to matters related to their public employment, irrespective of at

[41 FR 17710, Apr. 27, 1976]

Sec. 201.6  Confidential business information.

    (a) Definitions. (1) Confidential business information is 
information which concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, 
operations, style of works, or apparatus, or to the production, sales, 
shipments, purchases, transfers, identification of customers, 
inventories, or amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or 
expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other 
organization, or other information of commercial value, the disclosure 
of which is likely to have the effect of either impairing the 
Commission's ability to obtain such information as is necessary to 
perform its statutory functions, or causing substantial harm to the 
competitive position of the person, firm, partnership, corporation, or 
other organization from which the information was obtained, unless the 
Commission is required by law to disclose such information. The term 
``confidential business information'' includes ``proprietary 
information'' within the meaning of section 777(b) of the Tariff Act of 
1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677f(b)). Nonnumerical characterizations of numerical 
confidential business information (e.g., discussion of trends) will be 
treated as confidential business information only at the request of the 
submitter for good cause shown.
    (2) Nondisclosable confidential business information is privileged 
information, classified information, or specific information (e.g., 
trade secrets) of a type for which there is a clear and compelling need 
to withhold from disclosure. Special rules for the handling of such 
information are set out in Sec. 207.7 of this chapter.
    (b) Procedure for submitting business information in confidence. (1) 
A request for confidential treatment of business information shall be 
addressed to the Secretary, United States International Trade 
Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, and shall indicate 
clearly on the envelope that it is a request for confidential treatment.
    (2) In the absence of good cause shown, any request relating to 
material to be submitted during the course of a hearing shall be 
submitted at least three (3) working days prior to the commencement of 
such hearing.
    (3) With each submission of, or offer to submit, business 
information which a submitter desires to be treated as confidential 
business information, under paragraph (a) of this section, the submitter 
shall provide the following, which may be disclosed to the public:
    (i) A written description of the nature of the subject information;
    (ii) A justification for the request for its confidential treatment;
    (iii) A certification in writing under oath that substantially 
identical information is not available to the public;
    (iv) A copy of the document
    (A) Clearly marked on its cover as to the pages on which 
confidential information can be found;
    (B) With information for which confidential treatment is requested 
clearly identified by means of brackets; and
    (C) With information for which nondisclosable confidential treatment 
is requested clearly identified by means of triple brackets (except when 
submission of such document is withheld in accord with paragraph (b)(4) 
of this section); and
    (v) A nonconfidential copy of the documents as required by 
Sec. 201.8(d).
    (4) The submission of the documents itemized in paragraph (b)(3) of 
this section will provide the basis for rulings on the confidentiality 
of submissions, including rulings on the confidentiality of submissions 
offered to the Commission which have not yet been placed under the 
possession, control, or custody of the Commission. The submitter has the 
option of providing the business information for which confidential 
treatment is sought at the time the

[[Page 20]]

(20documents itemized in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are provided 
or of withholding them until a ruling on their confidentiality has been 
issued.
    (c) Identification of business information submitted in confidence. 
Business information which a submitter desires to be treated as 
confidential shall be clearly labeled ``confidential business 
information'' when submitted, and shall be segregated from other 
material being submitted.
    (d) Approval or denial of requests for confidential treatment. 
Approval or denial of requests shall be made only by the Secretary or 
Acting Secretary. A denial shall be in writing, shall specify the reason 
therefor, and shall advise the submitter of the right to appeal to the 
Commission.
    (e) Appeals from denial of confidential treatment. (1) For good 
cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from a denial by the 
Secretary of a request for confidential treatment of a submission. Any 
appeal filed shall be addressed to the Chairman, United States 
International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, 
and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential submission appeal. 
An appeal may be made within twenty (20) days of a denial or whenever 
the approval or denial has not been forthcoming within ten (10) days 
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) of the 
receipt of a confidential treatment request, unless an extension notice 
in writing with the reasons therefor has been provided the person 
requesting confidential treatment.
    (2) An appeal will be decided within twenty (20) days of its receipt 
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) unless an 
extension notice in writing with the reasons therefor, has been provided 
the person making the appeal.
    (3) The justification submitted to the Commission in connection with 
an appeal shall be limited to that presented to the Secretary with the 
original or amended request. When the Secretary or Acting Secretary has 
denied a request on the ground that the submitter failed to provide 
adequate justification, any such additional justification shall be 
submitted to the Secretary for his consideration as part of an amended 
request. For purposes of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the twenty 
(20) day period for filing an appeal shall be tolled on the filing of an 
amended request and a new twenty (20) day period shall begin once the 
Secretary or Acting Secretary has denied the amended request, or the 
approval or denial has not been forthcoming within ten (10) days of the 
filing of the amended request. A denial of a request by the Secretary on 
the ground of inadequate justification shall not obligate a requester to 
furnish additional justification and shall not preclude a requester from 
filing an appeal with the Commission based on the justification earlier 
submitted to the Secretary.
    (f) Appeals from approval of confidential treatment. (1) For good 
cause shown, the Commission may grant an appeal from an approval by the 
Secretary of a request for confidential treatment of a submission. Any 
appeal filed shall be addressed to the Chairman, United States 
International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, S.W., Washington, DC 
20436, shall show that a copy thereof has been served upon the 
submitter, and shall clearly indicate that it is a confidential 
submission appeal. An appeal may be made within twenty (20) days of the 
approval by the Secretary of a request for confidential treatment or 
whenever the approval or denial has not been forthcoming within ten (10) 
days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) of the 
receipt of a confidential treatment request, unless an extension notice 
in writing with the reasons therefor has been provided the person 
requesting confidential treatment.
    (2) An appeal will be decided within twenty (20) days of its receipt 
(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays) unless an 
extension notice, in writing with the reasons therefor, has been 
provided the person making the appeal.
    (g) Granting confidential status to business information. Any 
business information submitted in confidence and determined to be 
entitled to confidential treatment shall be maintained in confidence by 
the Commission and not disclosed except as required by law. In the event 
that any business information

[[Page 21]]

(21submitted to the Commission is not entitled to confidential 
treatment, the submitter will be permitted to withdraw the tender unless 
it is the subject of a request under the Freedom of Information Act or 
of judicial discovery proceedings.
    (h) Scope of provisions. The provisions of Secs. 201.6(b) and 201.6 
(d) through (g) shall not apply to adjudicative investigations under 
Subchapter C, Part 210, of the Commission's rules of practice and 
procedure.

[41 FR 28951, July 14, 1976, as amended at 49 FR 32571, Aug. 15, 1984;

<R04>
Subpart B--Initiation and Conduct of Investigations

Sec. 201.7  Investigative authority and initiation of investigations.

    (a) Who may appear as a party. Any person may apply to appear in an 
investigation as a party, either in person or by representative, by 
filing an entry of appearance with the Secretary. Each entry of 
appearance shall state briefly the nature of the person's reason for 
participating in the investigation and state the person's intent to file 
briefs with the Commission regarding the subject matter of the 
investigation. The Secretary shall promptly determine whether the person 
submitting the entry of appearance has a proper reason for participating 
in the investigation. In any investigation conducted under part 207 of 
this chapter, industrial users, and if the merchandise under 
investigation is sold at the retail level, representative consumer 
organizations, will be deemed to have a proper reason for participating 
in the investigation. If it is found that a person does not have a 
proper reason for participating in the investigation, that person shall 
be so notified by the Secretary and shall not be entitled to appear in 
the investigation as a party. A person found to have a proper reason for 
participating in the investigation shall be permitted to appear in the 
investigation as a party, and acceptance of such person's entry of 
appearance shall be signified by the Secretary's inclusion of such 
person on the service list established pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (b) Time for filing. (1) Except in the case of investigations 
conducted under part 207 of this chapter, each entry of appearance shall 
be filed with the Secretary not later than twenty-one (21) days after 
publication of the Commission's notice of investigation in the Federal 
Register.
    (2) In the case of investigations conducted under subpart B of part 
207 of this chapter, each entry of appearance shall be filed with the 
Secretary not later than seven (7) days after publication of the 
Commission's notice of investigation in the Federal Register. A party 
that files a notice of appearance during such time need not file an 
additional notice of appearance during the portion of the investigation 
conducted under subpart C of part 207 of this chapter.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a party may 
file an entry of appearance during the final phase of an investigation 
conducted under part 207 of this chapter no later than twenty-one (21) 
days prior to the hearing date listed in the Federal Register notice 
published pursuant to Sec. 207.24(b) of this chapter.

[44 FR 76476, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 61 FR 37828, July 22, 1996]

Sec. 201.8   Filing of documents.

    (a) Where to file; date of filing. Documents shall be filed at the 
office of the Secretary of the Commission in Washington, DC. Such 
documents, if properly filed, will be deemed to be filed on the date on 
which they are actually received in the Commission.
    (b) Conformity with rules. Each document filed with the Commission 
for the purpose of initiating any investigation shall be considered 
properly filed if it conforms with the pertinent rules prescribed in 
this chapter. Substantial compliance with the pertinent rules may be 
accepted by the Commission provided good and sufficient reason is stated 
in the document for inability to comply fully with the pertinent rules.
    (c) Specifications for documents. Each document filed under this 
chapter shall be clear and legible.
    (d) Number of copies. A signed original (or a copy designated as an

copies of documents prepared for another agency or a court (e.g. patent 
file wrappers or pleadings papers). The original and at least one copy 
of all submissions shall be printed on one side only and shall be 
unbound (although they may be stapled or held together by means of a 
clip). In the event that confidential treatment of the document is 
requested under Sec. 201.6, at least four (4) additional copies shall be 
filed, in which the confidential business information shall have been 
deleted and which shall have been conspicuously marked 
``nonconfidential'' or ``public inspection.'' The name of the person 
signing the original shall be typewritten or otherwise reproduced on

Sec. 201.11  Appearance in an investigation as a party.

    (a) Who may appear as a party. Any person may apply to appear in an 
investigation as a party, either in person or by representative, by 
filing an entry of appearance with the Secretary. Each entry of 
appearance shall state briefly the nature of the person's reason for 
participating in the investigation and state the person's intent to file 
briefs with the Commission regarding the subject matter of the 
investigation. The Secretary shall promptly determine whether the person 
submitting the entry of appearance has a proper reason for participating 
in the investigation. In any investigation conducted under part 207 of 
this chapter, industrial users, and if the merchandise under 
investigation is sold at the retail level, representative consumer 
organizations, will be deemed to have a proper reason for participating 
in the investigation. If it is found that a person does not have a 
proper reason for participating in the investigation, that

[[Page 23]]

(23person shall be so notified by the Secretary and shall not be 
entitled to appear in the investigation as a party. A person found to 
have a proper reason for participating in the investigation shall be 
permitted to appear in the investigation as a party, and acceptance of 
such person's entry of appearance shall be signified by the Secretary's 
inclusion of such person on the service list established pursuant to

publication of the Commission's notice of investigation in the Federal 
Register.
    (2) In the case of investigations conducted under subpart B of part 
207 of this chapter, each entry of appearance shall be filed with the 
Secretary not later than seven (7) days after publication of the 
Commission's notice of investigation in the Federal Register. A party 
that files a notice of appearance during such time need not file an 
additional notice of appearance during the portion of the investigation 
conducted under subpart C of part 207 of this chapter.
    (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a party may 
file an entry of appearance during the final phase of an investigation 
conducted under part 207 of this chapter no later than twenty-one (21) 
days prior to the hearing date listed in the Federal Register notice 
published pursuant to Sec. 207.24(b) of this chapter.
    (c) Late filing. Any entry of appearance filed with the Secretary 
after the filing date established in paragraph (b) of this section shall 
be referred to the Chairman, or other person designated to conduct the 
investigation, who shall promptly determine whether to accept such entry 
for good cause shown by the person desiring to file the notice. The 
Secretary shall promptly notify the submitter of a decision to deny the 
entry, or if the entry is accepted, include such person on the service 
list established pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) Service list. Upon the expiration of the time for filing notices 
of appearance established in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
Secretary shall prepare a service list. The service list shall contain 
the names and addresses of all persons, or their representatives, who

has been accepted and shall promptly forward such notice to all parties 
to the investigation.

The Commission shall take such action or make such response as it deems 
appropriate.

[47 FR 6189, Feb. 10, 1982]

Sec. 201.13  Conduct of nonadjudicative hearings.

    (a) In general. Public hearings are held by the Commission when 
required by law or, if not required by law, when in the judgment of the 
Commission there is good and sufficient reason therefor. Public hearings 
will be held at the time and place specified in notices issued under 
Sec. 201.10. Public hearings are ordinarily held in the Hearing Room of 
the International Trade Commission Building, in Washington, DC, but may 
be held elsewhere at the Commission's discretion.
    (b) Presiding officials--(1) Who presides. Public hearings or 
conferences in nonadjudicative investigations will be conducted by the 
Commission or by one or more Commissioners. When the Commission deems it

will be presented for the consideration of the Commission.

[[Page 24]]

(24
    (2) Powers and duties. The Commission, one or more of the 
Commissioners, or one or more designated employees shall have all the 
powers to conduct fair and impartial hearings, to take necessary action 
to avoid delay in the disposition of proceedings, including the 
prescription of time allocated to testimony, argument, and questioning, 
to regulate the course of hearings and the conduct of the parties and 
their counsel therein, and to maintain order.
    (c) Participation in a hearing--(1) Who may participate. A party may 
participate in the hearing, either in person or by representative. A 
nonparty who has testimony or arguments that may aid the Commission's 
deliberations may also participate, under such conditions as may be 
established by the presiding officials at the hearing.
    (2) Notices of participation. Notices of participation in a hearing 
shall be filed with the Secretary at least three (3) days in advance of 
the date set for the hearing or two (2) days in advance of the date set 
in the notice of investigation for a prehearing conference, whichever 
shall first occur, except that the presiding officials may waive this 
requirement for good cause. Witnesses on behalf of persons filing 
notices of participation need not file separate notices.
    (d) Witness list. Each person who files a notice of participation 
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section shall simultaneously file with 
the Secretary a list of the witnesses he intends to call at the hearing.
    (e) Order of the testimony. Unless otherwise ordered by the 
presiding officials, witnesses will give testimony in the order 
designated by the Secretary to the Commission. Each witness, after being 
duly sworn, will be permitted to proceed with his or her testimony 
without interruption except by presiding officials.
    (f) Supplementary material. Up to five double-spaced pages of 
supplementary material, other than remarks read into the record, will be 
accepted for the record. Supplementary material exceeding five pages may 
be accepted upon a showing of such cause as may be deemed sufficient by 
the presiding officials. As used herein, the term supplementary material 
refers to (1) additional graphic material such as charts and diagrams 
used to illuminate an argument or clarify a position and (2) information 
not available to a party at the time its prehearing brief was filed.
    (g) Questioning of witnesses. After completing testimony, a witness 
may be questioned by any member of the Commission or by its staff. Any 
participant may, with the permission of the presiding officials, direct 
questions to the witness, but only for the purpose of assisting the 
Commission in obtaining relevant and material facts with respect to the 
subject matter of the investigation.
    (h) Oral argument. When, in the opinion of the presiding officials, 
time permits and the nature of the proceedings and the complexity or 
importance of the questions of fact or law involved warrant, the 
presiding officials may allow oral argument after conclusion of the 
testimony in a hearing. The presiding officials will determine in each 
instance the time to be allowed for argument and the allocation thereof.
    (i) Briefs--(1) Parties. Briefs of the information produced at the 
hearing and arguments thereon may be presented to the Commission by 
parties to the investigation. Unless otherwise ordered, fourteen (14) 
clear copies shall be filed with the Secretary to the Commission. Time 
to be allowed for submission of briefs will be set after conclusion of 
testimony and oral argument, if any.
    (2) Nonparties. Any person who is not a party to an investigation 
may submit a short statement for the record regarding the subject matter 
of an investigation.
    (j) Verification of testimony. Oral or written information submitted 
at hearings will, upon order of the Commission, be subject to 
verification from books, papers, and records of the persons submitting 
the information and from any other available sources.
    (k) Hearing transcripts. A verbatim transcript of all hearings will 
be taken. The Commission does not distribute transcripts of the records 
of such hearings. Any person may inspect the transcript of a hearing at 
the Commission's office in Washington, DC, or purchase it from the 
official reporter.

investigation no later than seven (7) days prior to the date of the

this chapter) may close a portion of a hearing (or conference under 
Sec. 207.15 of this chapter) held in any investigation in order to allow 
such party to address confidential business information, as defined in 
Sec. 201.6, during the course of its presentation.
    (2) In addition, during each hearing held in an investigation 
conducted under section 202 of the Trade Act, as amended, or in an 
investigation under title VII of the Tariff Act as provided in 
Sec. 207.24 of this chapter, following the public presentation of the 
petitioner(s) and that of each panel of respondents, the Commission 
will, if it deems it appropriate, close the hearing in order to allow 
Commissioners to question parties and/or their representatives 
concerning matters involving confidential business information.

the computation. As used in this rule, a Federal legal holiday refers to 
any full calendar day designated as a legal holiday by the President or 
the Congress of the United States.
    (b) Additional hearings, postponements, continuances, and extensions

in this section shall be filed with the Secretary and served on all

Sec. 201.19  Notification regarding requests for confidential business 
          information.

    (a) In general. Business information provided to the Commission by a 
business submitter which the Commission has designated as ``confidential 
business information'' will not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) request except in accordance with this section.
    (b) Definitions. The following definitions are to be used in 
reference to this section:
    Confidential business information means commercial or financial 
information that has been designated as confidential business 
information by the Commission under Sec. 201.6 of this part.

[[Page 28]]

(28
    Submitter means any person or entity who provides confidential 
business information, directly or indirectly, to the Commission. The 
term includes, but is not limited to, corporations, producers, 
importers, and state and foreign governments.
    (c) Notice to submitters. Except as provided for in paragraph (e) of 
this section, the Commission will, to the extent permitted by law, 
provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or 
administrative appeal encompassing its confidential business information 
whenever required under paragraph (d) of this section, in order to 
afford the submitter an opportunity to object to disclosure pursuant to 
paragraph (f) of this section. Such written notice will describe the 
nature of the confidential business information requested. The requester 
will also be notified that notice and opportunity to object to are being 
provided to a submitter.
    (d) When notice is required. Notice will be given to a submitter in 
writing at submitter's last known address whenever:
    (1) The information the subject of the FOIA request or appeal has 
been designated by the Commission as confidential business information; 
and
    (2) The Commission has reason to believe that the information may 
not be protected from disclosure under FOIA Exemptions 3 or 4.
    (e) Exceptions to notice requirment. The notice requirements of 
paragraph (c) of this section will not apply if:
    (1) The Commission determines that the information should not be 
disclosed;
    (2) The information lawfully has been published or has been 
officially made available to the public; or
    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 
U.S.C. 552).
    (f) Opportunity to object to disclosure. In general, the Commision 
has 10 working days in which to respond to a FOIA request. Through the 
notice described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission will 
afford a submitter an opportunity, within the period afforded to the 
Commission to make its decision in response to the FOIA request, to 
provide the Commission with a detailed written statement of any 
objection to disclosure. Such statement shall be filed at least one 
working day before the Commission is required to respond to the FOIA 
request, and it shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the 
information under any exemption of FOIA. In the case of FOIA Exemptions 
3 or 4, it shall demonstrate why the information should continue to be 
considered confidential business information within the meaning of 
Sec. 201.6 of this part and should not be disclosed. The submitter's 
claim of continued confidentiality should be supported by a 
certification by an officer or authorized representative of the 
submitter. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this 
paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA.
    (g) Notice of intent to disclose. The Commission will consider 
carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for 
nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose the information. 
Whenever the Commission decides to disclose such information over the 
objection of a submitter, the Commission will forward to the submitter a 
written notice which will include:
    (1) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure 
objections were not sustained;
    (2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and
    (3) A specified disclosure date.

Such notice of intent to disclose will be forwarded to the submitter a 
reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date and the 
requester will be notified likewise.
    (h) Notice of FOIA lawsuit. Whenever a requester brings suit seeking 
to compel disclosure of information that the Commission has designated 
as confidential business information, the Commission will promptly 
notify the submitter at its last known address. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, the Secretary may assume such address to be that given on the 
submission.

through the use of existing programming, requester shall be charged the 
actual direct costs of conducting the search, although certain 
requesters (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) shall be 
entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of manual search time 
without charge. These direct costs shall include the cost of operating a 
central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is 
directly attributable to searching for records responsive to a request, 
as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the 
search (at no more than $5.00 per quarter hour of time so spent). Agency 
personnel are not required to alter or develop programming to conduct a 
search.
    (2) Duplication. Duplication fees shall be assessed with respect to 
all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this 
section. For a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of 
which need be supplied), the fee shall be $0.10 per page. For copies 
produced by computer, such as tapes or printouts, the Secretary shall 
charge the actual direct costs, including operator time, of producing 
the copy. For other methods of duplication, the Secretary shall charge 
the actual direct costs of duplicating a record.
    (3) Review. (i) Review fees shall be assessed with respect to only 
those requesters who seek records for a commercial use, as defined in 
paragraph (j)(5) of this section. For each quarter hour spent by agency 
personnel in reviewing a requested record for possible disclosure, the 
fee shall be $5.00.
    (ii) Review fees shall be assessed only for the initial record 
review, i.e., all of the review undertaken when a component analyzes the 
applicability of a particular exemption to a particular record or record 
portion at the initial request level. No charge shall be assessed for 
review at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already 
applied. However, records or record portions withheld pursuant to an 
exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed 
again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously 
considered. The costs of such a subsequent review are properly 
assessable, particularly where that review is made necessary by a change 
of circumstances.
    (c) Limitations on charging fees. (1) No search or review fee shall 
be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that 
period is required for search or review.
    (2) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use (as 
defined in paragraph (j)(5) of this section), the Secretary shall 
provide without charge--

[[Page 30]]

(30
    (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or its cost equivalent), and
    (ii) The first two hours of search (or its cost equivalent).
    (3) Whenever a total fee calculated under paragraph (b) of this 
section is $25.00 or less, no fee shall be charged.
    (4) The provisions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section work 
together. For requesters other than those seeking records for a 
commercial use, no fee shall be charged unless the cost of search is in 
excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess of 100 pages 
exceeds $25.00.
    (d) Waiver or reduction of fees. (1) Records responsive to a request 
under 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be furnished without charge or at a charge 
reduced below that established under paragraph (b) of this section where 
the Secretary determines, based upon information provided by a requester 
in support of a fee waiver request or otherwise made known to the 
Secretary that disclosure of the requested information is in the public 
interest, because it is likely to contribute significantly to public 
understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is 
not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Requests for 
a waiver or reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case 
basis.
    (2) In order to determine whether the first fee waiver requirement 
is met--i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to 
public understanding of the operations or activities of the government--
the Secretary shall consider the following four factors in sequence:
    (i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested 
records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government.'' The 
subject matter of the requested records, in the context of the request, 
must specifically concern identifiable operations or activities of the 
federal government--with a connection that is direct and clear, not 
remote or attenuated. Furthermore, the records must be sought for their 
informative value with respect to those government operations or 
activities; a request for access to records for their intrinsic 
informational content alone will not satisfy this threshold 
consideration.
    (ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: 
Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding 
of government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the 
requested records must be meaningfully informative on specific 
government operations or activities in order to hold potential for 
contributing to increased public understanding of those operations and 
activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public 
domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would 
not be likely to contribute to such understanding, as nothing new would 
be added to the public record.
    (iii) The contribution of an understanding of the subject by the 
public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the 
requested information will contribute to ``public understanding.'' The 
disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public at large, 
as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester or a narrow 
segment of interested persons. A requester's identity and 
qualifications--e.g., expertise in the subject area and ability and 
intention to effectively convey information to the general public--shall 
be considered. It will be presumed that a representative of the news 
media (as defined in paragraph (j)(8) of this section) who has access to 
the means of public dissemination readily will be able to satisfy this 
consideration. Requests from libraries or other record repositories (or 
requesters who intend merely to disseminate information to such 
institutions) shall be analyzed, like those of other requesters, to 
identify a particular person who represents that he actually will use 
the requested information in scholarly or other analytic work and then 
disseminate it to the general public.
    (iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: 
Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to 
public understanding of government operations or activities. The 
public's understanding of the subject matter in question, as compared to 
the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must 
be likely to be enhanced by the disclosure to a

[[Page 31]]

(31significant extent. The Secretary shall not make separate judgments 
as to whether information, even though it in fact would contribute 
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of 
the government, is ``important'' enough to be made public.
    (3) In order to determine whether the second fee waiver requirement 
is met--i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is not 
primarily in the commercial interest of the requester--the Secretary 
shall consider the following two factors in sequence:
    (i) The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether 
the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the 
requested disclosure. The Secretary shall consider all commercial 
interests of the requester (with reference to the definition of 
commercial use in paragraph (j)(5) of this section), or any person on 
whose behalf the requester may be acting, but shall consider only those 
interests which would be furthered by the requested disclosure. In 
assessing the magnitude of identified commercial interests, 
consideration shall be given to the role that such FOIA-disclosed 
information plays with respect to those commercial interests, as well as 
to the extent to which FOIA disclosures serve those interests overall. 
Requesters shall be given a reasonable opportunity in the administrative 
process to provide information bearing upon this consideration.
    (ii) The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of 
the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently 
large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that 
disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.'' 
A fee waiver or reduction is warranted only where, once the ``public 
interest'' standard set out in paragraph (d)(2) of this section is 
satisfied, that public interest can fairly be regarded as greater in 
magnitude than that of the requester's commercial interest in 
disclosure. The Secretary shall ordinarily presume that, where a news 
media requester has satisfied the ``public interest'' standard, that 
will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester. 
Disclosure to data brokers or others who compile and market government 
information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to 
primarily serve the ``public interest.''
    (4) Where only a portion of the requested records satisfies both of 
the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph, 
a waiver or reduction shall be granted only as to that portion.
    (5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees shall address each 
of the factors listed in paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section, as 
they apply to each record request.
    (e) Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. Where the 
Secretary determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed under 
this section may amount to more than $25.00, he shall notify the 
requester as soon as practicable of the actual or estimated amount of 
the fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness 
to pay fees as high as those anticipated. (If only a portion of the fee 
can be estimated readily, the Secretary shall advise the requester that 
the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee.) In cases 
where a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees may 
amount to more than $25.00, the request will be deemed not to have been 
received until the requester has agreed to pay the anticipated total 
fee. A notice of the requester pursuant to this paragraph shall offer 
him the opportunity to confer with agency personnel in order to 
reformulate his request to meet his needs at a lower cost.
    (f) Aggregating requests. Where the Secretary reasonably believes 
that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is 
attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose 
of evading the assessment of fees, the Secretary may aggregate any such 
requests and charge accordingly. The Secretary may presume that multiple 
requests of such type made within a 30-day period have been made in 
order to evade fees. Where requests are separated by a longer period, 
the Secretary shall aggregate them only where there exists a reasonable 
basis for determining that said aggregation is warranted, e.g., where 
the requests involve

[[Page 32]]

(32clearly related matters. Multiple requests involving unrelated 
matters shall not be aggregated
    (g) Advance payments. (1) Where the Secretary estimates that a total 
fee to be assessed under this section is likely to exceed $250.00, the 
Secretary may require the requester to make an advance payment of an 
amount up to the entire estimated fee before beginning to process the 
request, except where the Secretary receives a satisfactory assurance of 
full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.
    (2) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a records access 
fee within 30 days of the date of billing, the Secretary may require the 
requester to pay the full amount owed, plus any applicable interest (as 
provided for in paragraph (h) of this section), and to make an advance 
payment of the full amount of any estimated fee before he begins to 
process a new request or continues to process a pending request from 
that requester.
    (3) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (g) (1) 
and (2) of this section, the Secretary shall not require the requester 
to make an advance payment, i.e., a payment made before work is 
commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed on work already 
completed is not an advance payment.
    (4) Where the Secretary acts under paragraph (g) (1) or (2) of this 
section, the administrative time limits described in subsection (a)(6) 
of the FOIA for the processing of an initial request or an appeal, plus 
permissible extensions of these time limits, shall be deemed not to 
begin to run until the Secretary has received payment of the assessed 
fee.
    (h) Charging interest. The Secretary may assess interest charges on 
an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the 
bill was sent to the requester. Once a fee payment has been received by 
the Secretary, even if not processed, the accrual of interest shall be 
stayed. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate prescribed in 
section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C. and shall accrue from the date of the 
billing. The Secretary shall follow the provisions of the Debt 
Collection Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97-265 (Oct. 25, 1982), and its 
implementing procedures, including the use of consumer reporting 
agencies, collection agencies, and offset.
    (i) Other statutes specifically providing for fees. (1) The fee 
schedule of this section does not apply with respect to the charging of 
fees under a statute specifically providing for setting the level of 
fees for particular types of records--i.e., any statute that 
specifically requires a government entity such as the Government 
Printing Office or the National Technical Information Service, to set 
and collect fees for particular types of records--in order to:
    (i) Serve both the general public and private sector organizations 
by conveniently making available government information;
    (ii) Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications 
and other services that are for their special use so that these costs 
are not borne by the general taxpaying public;
    (iii) Operate an information-dissemination activity on a self-
sustaining basis to the maximum extent possible; or
    (iv) Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in 
part, appropriate funds used to pay the costs of disseminating 
government information.
    (2) Where records responsive to requests are maintained for 
distribution by agencies operating statutorily based fee schedule 
programs, the Secretary shall inform requesters of the steps necessary 
to obtain records from those sources.
    (j) Definitions. For the purpose of this section:
    (1) The term direct costs means those expenditures which the agency 
actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of 
commercial use requesters, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA 
request. Direct costs include, for example the salary of the employee 
performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 
percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating 
duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead 
expenses such as costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility 
in which the records are stored.

[[Page 33]]

(33
    (2) The term search includes all time spent looking for material 
that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line 
identification of material within documents. The Secretary shall ensure, 
however, that searches are undertaken in the most efficient and least 
expensive manner reasonably possible; thus, for example, the Secretary 
shall not engage in line-by-line search where merely duplicating an 
entire document would be quicker and less expensive.
    (3) The term duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a 
record necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the 
form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-
readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The 
copy provided shall be in a form that is reasonably usable by 
requesters.
    (4) The term review refers to the process of examining a record 
located in response to a request in order to determine whether any 
portion of it is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing 
any record for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise 
it and otherwise prepare it for release, although review costs shall be 
recoverable even where there ultimately is no disclosure of a record. 
Review time does not include time spent resolving general legal or 
policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
    (5) The term commercial use in the context of a request refers to a 
request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or 
purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the 
requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can 
include furthering those interests through litigation. The Secretary 
shall determine, as well as reasonably possible, the use to which a 
requester will put the records requested. Where the circumstances of a 
request suggest that the requester will put the records sought to a 
commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or 
because the Secretary otherwise has reasonable cause to doubt a 
requester's stated use, the Secretary shall provide the requester a 
reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.
    (6) The term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public 
or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of 
undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher 
education, an institution of professional education, and an institution 
of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of 
scholarly research. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a 
requester must show that the request is being made as authorized by and 
under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are 
not sought for a commercial use but are sought in furtherance of 
scholarly research.
    (7) The term noncommercial scientific institution refers to an 
institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term 
is referenced in paragraph (j)(5) of this section, and which is operated 
solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of 
which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To 
be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must show that 
the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a 
qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a 
commercial use but are sought in furtherance of scientific research.
    (8) The term representative of the news media refers to any person 
actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to 
publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information 
that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the 
public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio 
stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of 
periodicals (but only in those instances where they can qualify as 
disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available for 
purchase or subscription by the general public. For ``freelance'' 
journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must 
demonstrate a clear basis for expecting publication through that 
organization; a publication contract would be the clearest proof, but 
the Secretary shall also look to the past publication

[[Page 34]]

(34record of a requester in making this determination. To be eligible 
for inclusion in this category, a requester also must not be seeking the 
requested records for a commercial use. In this regard, a request for 
records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester 
shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.
    (k) Charges for other services and materials. Apart from the other 
provisions of this section, where the Secretary elects, as a matter of 
administrative discretion, to comply with a request for a special 
service or materials, such as certifying that records are true copies or 
sending them other than by ordinary mail, the actual direct costs of 
providing the service or materials shall be charged.

[54 FR 13673, Apr. 5, 1989]

Sec. 201.21   Availability of specific records.

    (a) Records available. The following information, on request to the 
Secretary of the Commission, is available for public inspection and 
copying: (1) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting 
opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases; (2) 
those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted 
by the agency; and (3) administrative staff manuals and instructions to 
staff that affect a member of the public.

Available information includes, but is not limited to: (i) Applications, 
petitions, and other formal documents filed with the Commission, (ii) 
notices to the public concerning Commission matters, (iii) transcripts 
of testimony taken and exhibits submitted at hearings, (iv) reports to 
the President, to either or both Houses of Congress, or to Committees of 
Congress, release of which has been authorized by the President or the 
legislative body concerned, (v) reports and other documents issued for 
general distribution.
    (b) Records not available. Information specifically exempted from 
disclosure by 5 U.S.C. 552(b), including reports to the President, to 
either or both Houses of Congress, or to Committees of Congress, the 
release of which has not been authorized by the President or the 
legislative body concerned, and confidential business data as defined in 
18 U.S.C. 1905 and 19 CFR 201.06 are not available to the public.
    (c) Information requested in cases or matters to which the 
Commission is not a party. (1) The procedure specified in this section 
will apply to all demands directed to Commission employees for the 
production of documents or for testimony that relates in any way to the 
employees' official duties. These procedures will also apply to demands 
directed to former employees if the demands seek nonpublic materials or 
information acquired during Commission employment. The provisions of 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section will also apply to demands directed to 
the agency. For purposes of this section, the term demand means any 
request, order or subpoena for testimony or production of documents; the 
term subpoena means any compulsory process in a case or matter to which 
the Commission is not a party; the term nonpublic includes any material 
or information which, under Sec. 201.21(b), is exempt from availability 
for public inspection and copying; the term employee means any current 
or former officer or employee of the Commission; the term documents 
means all records, papers or official files, including without 
limitation, official letters, telegrams, memoranda, reports, studies, 
calendar and diary entries, graphs, notes, charts, tabulations, data 
analysis, statistical or information accumulations, records of meetings 
and conversations, film impressions, magnetic tapes, and sound or 
mechanical reproductions; the term case or matter means any civil 
proceeding before a court of law, administrative board, hearing officer, 
or other body conducting a legal or administrative proceeding in which 
the Commission is not a named party.
    (2) Prior to or simultaneously with a demand to a Commission 
employee for the production of documents or for testimony concerning 
matters relating to official duties, the party seeking such production 
or testimony must serve upon the General Counsel of the Commission an 
affidavit, or if that is not feasible, then a statement which sets forth 
the title of the case, the forum, the party's interest in the case, the 
reasons for the request, and a showing

[[Page 35]]

(35that the desired testimony or documents are not reasonably available 
from any other source. Where testimony is sought, the party must also 
provide a summary of the testimony desired, the intended use of the 
testimony, and show that Commission records could not be provided and 
used instead of the requested testimony. A subpoena for testimony from a 
Commission employee concerning official matters or for the production of 
documents shall be served in accordance with Rule 45 of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure and a copy of the subpoena shall be sent to the 
General Counsel.
    (3) Any employee or former employee who is served with a subpoena or 
other demand shall promptly advise the General Counsel of the service of 
the subpoena or other demand, the nature of the documents or information 
sought, and all relevant facts and circumstances.
    (4) Absent written authorization from the Chairman of the Commission 
(``Chairman''), the employee shall respectfully decline to produce the 
requested documents, to testify, or to otherwise disclose requested 
information. If a court rules that the demand must be complied with 
despite the absence of such written authorization, the employee upon 
whom the demand is made shall respectfully refuse to comply based upon 
these regulations and Touhy v. Ragan, 340 U.S. 462 (1951).
    (5) The Chairman will consider and act upon subpoenas under this 
section with due regard for statutory restrictions, the Commission's 
rules and the public interest, taking into account such factors as the 
need to conserve employees' time for conducting official business, the 
need to prevent the expenditure of the United States government's time 
and money for private purposes, the need to maintain impartiality 
between private litigants in cases where no substantial governmental 
interest is involved, and the relevant legal standards for determining 
whether justification exists for the disclosure of nonpublic information 
and documents. If the Chairman determines that the subpoenaed documents 
or information are protected by a privilege or that the Commission has a 
duty in law or equity to protect such documents or information from 
disclosure, the General Counsel shall move the court to quash the 
subpoena or for other appropriate action.
    (6) The General Counsel may consult or negotiate with counsel or the 
party seeking testimony or documents to refine and limit the demand so 
that compliance is less burdensome, or obtain information necessary to 
make the determination described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. 
Failure of the counsel or party seeking the testimony or documents to 
cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel to make an 
informed recommendation to the Chairman under paragraph (c)(5) of this 
section may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with 
the demand.
    (7) Permission to testify will, in all cases, be limited to the 
information set forth in the affidavit as described in paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section, or to such portions thereof as the Chairman deems 
proper.
    (8) If the Chairman authorizes the testimony of an employee, then 
the General Counsel shall arrange for the taking of the testimony by 
methods that are least disruptive of the official duties of the 
employee. Testimony may, for example, be provided by affidavits, answers 
to interrogatories, written depositions, or depositions transcribed, 
recorded, or preserved by any other means allowable by law. Costs of 
providing testimony, including transcripts, will be borne by the party 
requesting the testimony. Such costs shall also include reimbursing the 
Commission for the usual and ordinary expenses attendant upon the 
employee's absence from his or her official duties in connection with 
the case or matter, including the employee's salary and applicable 
overhead charges and any necessary travel expenses.
    (9) The Secretary in consultation with the General Counsel is 
further authorized to charge reasonable fees to parties demanding 
documents or information. Such fees, calculated to reimburse the 
government for the expense of responding to such demand, may include the 
costs of time expended by Commission employees to process and respond to 
the demand, attorney time

[[Page 36]]

(36for reviewing the demand and for related legal work in connection 
with the demand, and expenses generated by equipment used to search for, 
produce and copy the responsive information. In general, such fees will 
be assessed at the rates and in the manner specified in Sec. 201.20 of 
this part.
    (10) This section does not affect the rights and procedures 
governing the public access to official documents pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act or the Privacy Act.
    (11) This section is intended to provide instructions to Commission 
employees and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or 
procedural, enforceable by any party against the Commission.

Sec. 201.25   Times, places, and requirements for identification of 
          individuals making requests.

    (a) It shall be the responsibility of the individual requester to 
arrange an appointment with the Director of Personnel for the purpose of 
inspecting individual records. The time of inspection shall be during 
the regular office hours of the Commission, 8:45 A.M. to 5:15 P.M., 
Monday through Friday. The time arranged should be mutually convenient 
to the requester and to the Commission.
    (b) The place where an individual may gain access to records 
maintained by the Commission which pertain to him or her shall be at the 
United States International Trade Commission Building, 500 E Street SW., 
Washington, DC 20436. The Director of Personnel shall inform the 
individual requester of the specific room wherein inspection will take 
place.
    (c) An individual who requests to gain access to those records 
maintained by the Commission which pertain to him or her shall not be 
granted access to those records without first presenting adequate 
identification to the Director of Personnel. Adequate identification 
includes, but is not limited to, a government identification card, a 
driver's license, medicare card, a birth certificate, or a passport.
    (d) Where the nature of the record or system of records permits and 
where the individual cannot view the records pertaining to him in 
person, the Director of Personnel may dispense with the requisites of 
Secs. 201.25(a) and 201.25(b) of these regulations and provide the 
individual with a copy of the record by certified mail.

Sec. 201.26   Disclosure of requested information to individuals.

    (a) Assuming that the individual requester has met the adequate 
identification criterion of Sec. 201.25(c) of these regulations, the 
Director of Personnel shall permit the individual to review the 
pertinent records and to have a copy made of all or any portion of them. 
Where specific exemptions within the purview of Sec. 201.32(c) would 
render such records or portions thereof incomprehensible, the Director 
of Personnel shall furnish an abstract in addition to an actual copy.
    (b) The individual has the right to have a person of his or her own 
choosing accompany him or her to review his or her records. The Director 
of Personnel shall permit a person of the individual requester's 
choosing to accompany the individual during inspection.
    (c) When the individual requests the Director of Personnel to permit 
a person of the individual's choosing to accompany him or her during the 
inspection of his or her records, the Director of Personnel shall 
require the individual requester to furnish a written statement 
authorizing discussion of the records in the accompanying person's 
presence.
    (d) The Director of Personnel shall take all necessary steps to 
insure that individual privacy is protected while the individual 
requester is inspecting his or her records or while those records are 
being discussed. Only the Director of Personnel shall accompany the 
individual as representative of the Commission during the inspection of 
the individual's records. The Director of Personnel shall be authorized 
to discuss the pertinent records with the individual.

Sec. 201.27   Special procedures: Medical records.

    (a) While an individual has an unqualified right of access to the 
records in systems of records maintained by the Commission which pertain 
to him or her, medical and psychological records merit special treatment 
because of the possibility that disclosure will have an adverse physical 
or psychological effect upon the requesting individual. Accordingly, 
therefore, in those instances where an individual is

[[Page 38]]

(38requesting the medical and/or psychological records which pertain to 
him or her, he or she shall, in his or her Privacy Act request to the 
Director of Personnel as called for in Sec. 201.24(a) of these 
regulations, specify a physician to whom the medical and/or 
psychological records may be released.
    (b) It shall be the responsibility of the individual requesting 
medical or psychological records to specify a physician to whom the 
requested records may be released. If an individual refuses to name a 
physician and insists on inspecting his or her medical or psychological 
records in the absence of a doctor's discussion and advice, the 
individual shall so state in his Privacy Act request to the Director of 
Personnel as called for in Sec. 201.24(a) and the Director of Personnel 
shall provide access to or transmit such records directly to the 
individual.

Sec. 201.28   Request for correction or amendment of record.

    (a) If, upon viewing his or her records, the individual disagrees 
with a portion thereof or feels sections thereof to be erroneous, the 
individual may request amendment(s) of the records pertaining to him or 
her. The individual should request such an amendment in writing. The 
request for amendment of records shall be addressed to the Director of 
Personnel, United States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street 
SW., Washington, DC 20436, and shall clearly indicate both on the 
envelope and in the letter that it is a Privacy Act request for 
amendment of records.
    (b) Not later than 10 days (Saturdays, Sundays and Federal legal 
public holidays excluded) after the date of receipt of a Privacy Act 
request for amendment of records, the Director of Personnel shall 
acknowledge such receipt in writing. Such a request for amendment will 
be granted or denied by the Director of Personnel or, for records 
maintained by the Inspector General, the Inspector General. If the 
request is granted, the Director of Personnel, or, the Inspector 
General, for records maintained by the Inspector General, shall promptly 
make any correction of any portion of the record which the individual 
believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. If, however, 
the request is denied, the Director of Personnel shall inform the 
individual of the refusal to amend the record in accordance with the 
individual's request and give the reason(s) for the refusal. In cases 
where the Director of Personnel or the Inspector General has refused to 
amend in accordance with an individual's request, he or she also shall 
advise the individual of the procedures under Sec. 201.29 of this 
chapter for the individual to request a review of that refusal by the 
full Commission or by an officer designated by the Commission.

Sec. 201.29  Commission review of request for correction or amendment to 
          record.

    (a) The individual who disagrees with the refusal of the Director of 
Personnel or the Inspector General to amend the record may request a 
review of the refusal by the Commission. All requests for review of 
refusals to amend records should be addressed to the Chairman, United 
States International Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 
20436, and shall clearly indicate both on the envelope and in the letter 
that it is a Privacy Act review request.
    (b) Not later than 30 days (Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal 
public holidays excluded) from the date on which the Commission receives 
a request for review of the Director of Personnel's or the Inspector 
General's refusal to amend the record, the Commission shall complete 
such a review and make a final determination thereof unless, for good 
cause shown, the Commission extends the 30-day period.
    (c) After the individual's request to amend his or her records has 
been reviewed by the Commission, if the Commission agrees with the 
Director of Personnel's or the Inspector General's refusal to amend the 
record in accordance with the individual's request, the Commission 
shall:
    (1) Notify the individual in writing of the Commission's decision;

[[Page 39]]

(39
    (2) Advise the individual that he or she has the right to file a 
concise statement of disagreement with the Commission which sets forth 
his or her reasons for disagreement with the refusal of the Commission 
to amend the records; and
    (3) Notify the individual of his or her legal right to judicial 
review of the Commission's final determination.
    (d) In any disclosure, containing information about which the 
individual has filed a statement of disagreement, the Director of 
Personnel, or, for records maintained by the Inspector General, the 
Inspector General, shall clearly note any portion of the record which is 
disputed and shall provide copies of the statement and, if the 
Commission deems it appropriate, copies of a concise statement of the 
reasons of the Commission for not making the amendments requested, to 
persons or other agencies to whom the disputed record has been 
disclosed.

[60 FR 37336, July 20, 1995]

Sec. 201.30   Commission disclosure of record to person other than the 
          individual to whom it pertains.

    (a) Except as is permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(1)-(b)(11), it is 
the policy of the Commission not to disclose any record which is

person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, 
or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record 
pertains.
    (b) Except for disclosures either to officers and employees of the 
Commission, or, to contractor employees who, in the Inspector General's 
or the Director of Personnel's judgment, are acting as federal 
employees, who have a need for the record in the performance of their 
duties, and any disclosure required by 5 U.S.C. 552, the Director of 
Personnel shall keep an accurate accounting of:
    (1) The date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record to 
any person or to another agency under paragraph (a) of this section; and
    (2) The name or address of the person or agency to whom the 
disclosure is made.
    (c) The Director of Personnel shall retain the accounting required 
by Sec. 201.30(b) for at least five years or the life of the record, 
whichever is longer, after such disclosure.
    (d) Except for disclosures made to other agencies for civil or 
criminal law enforcement purposes pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(7), the 
Director of Personnel shall make any accounting made under 
Sec. 201.30(b) available to the individual named in the record at the 
individual's request.
    (e) Where the Commission has provided any person or other agency 
with an individual record and such accounting as required by 
Sec. 201.30(b) has been made, the Director of Personnel shall inform all 
such persons or other agencies of any correction, amendment, or notation 
of dispute concerning said record.

Subpart E--Opening Commission Meetings to Public Observation Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552b

    Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552b; 19 U.S.C. 1335.

    Source: 42 FR 11243, Feb. 28, 1977, unless otherwise noted.

Sec. 201.33   Purpose and scope.

    (a) Consistent with the principle that the public is entitled to the 
fullest practicable information regarding the decisionmaking processes 
of the Federal Government, it is the purpose of this subpart to open the 
meetings of the United States International Trade Commission to public 
observation while protecting the rights of individuals and the ability 
of the Commission to carry out its statutory functions and 
responsibilities. These regulations are promulgated pursuant to the 
directive of section (g) of the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 
552b(g)), and specifically implement sections (b) through (f) of said 
act (5 U.S.C. 552(b) through (f)).
    (b) Public access to documents being considered at Commission 
meetings may be obtained by access to the public files of the Commission 
or, where documents are not in said public files, shall be obtained in 
the manner set forth in subpart C of this part (Secs. 201.17 through 
201.21).
    (c) Unless otherwise provided by the public notices as described in 
Sec. 201.35 of this subpart, public observation of Commission meetings 
does not encompass public participation in the deliberations at such 
meetings.

Sec. 201.34   Definitions.

    For the purpose of this subpart:
    (a)(1) Except as hereinafter provided, the term meeting means the 
deliberations of at least the number of individual Commissioners 
required to take action on behalf of the Commission where such 
deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of 
official Commission business.

[[Page 41]]

(41
    (2) The consideration by individual Commissioners of business which 
is circulated sequentially in writing (circulation by ``action jacket'') 
is not considered a meeting under paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
because circulation by action jacket does not determine or result in the 
joint conduct or disposition of Commission business until ratification 
thereof by formal vote of the Commissioners in a meeting as defined by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section, although action proposed by action 
jacket may be taken before or after formal ratification thereof by vote 
at a Commission meeting.
    (3) Conference telephone calls among the Commissioners are 
considered meetings as defined by paragraph (a)(1) of this section if 
they involve the number of Commissioners requisite for Commission 
action.
    (4) Deliberations of a majority of the entire membership of the 
Commission with the sole purpose of determining whether or not to call a 
meeting at a date earlier than the requisite public notice period as 
specified in Sec. 201.35 of this subpart are not considered to 
constitute a meeting or portion of a meeting as defined by paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section.
    (5) Deliberations of a majority of the entire membership of the 
Commission with the sole purpose of determining whether or not to close 
a portion or portions of a meeting or series of meetings pursuant to 
Sec. 201.36 of this subpart are not considered to constitute a meeting 
or portion of a meeting within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (6) Deliberations of a majority of the entire membership of the 
Commission with the sole purpose of determining whether or not to change 
the subject matter of a publicly announced meeting, or to change the 
determination of the Commission to open or close a meeting, or portion 
thereof, to the public, following a public notice, as permitted under 
Sec. 201.37(b) of this subpart, are not considered to constitute a 
meeting or portion of a meeting under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) The terms Secretary and General Counsel mean the Secretary and 
General Counsel of the Commission and their respective designees within 
their respective offices.

Sec. 201.35   Notices to the public.

    (a) At least seven (7) days before each Commission meeting the 
Commission shall issue a public notice which:
    (1) States the time and place of the meeting;
    (2) Lists the subjects or agenda items to be discussed at the 
meeting;
    (3) States whether the meeting or portion thereof is to be open or 
closed to public observation; and
    (4) Gives the name and business phone number of the Secretary to the 
Commission.
    (b) When the Commission has voted to close any portion of any 
meeting in accordance with Sec. 201.36 of this subpart, the notice 
referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall also include, or be 
amended to include, if already issued, (1) A list of the persons 
reasonably expected to be present at such closed portion or portions of 
the meeting, (2) A corresponding list of the affiliations of those 
persons reasonably expected to be present, (3) A written copy of the 
vote of each Commissioner on whether or not the portion or portions of 
the meeting or series of meetings should be closed to public 
observation, (4) A full, written explanation of the Commission's action 
in closing the portion or portions of the meeting or series of meetings, 
and (5) A copy of the certification of the General Counsel, called for 
by Sec. 201.39 of this subpart, that such portion or portions of the 
meeting or series of meetings were properly closed to the public by the 
Commission. When a vote to close a portion or portions of a meeting in 
accordance with Sec. 201.36 of this subpart or a vote to change the 
subject matter of a meeting or to change a determination to open or 
close a meeting, or portion thereof, to the public in accordance with 
Sec. 201.37(b) of this subpart fails for lack of a majority of the 
entire membership of the Commission, the vote shall also be published as 
part of the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c)(1) The 7-day period for public notice provided for in paragraph 
(a) of this section shall not apply when a majority of the entire

(c)(1) of this section to shorten the 7-day period for public notice 
provided for by paragraph (a) of this section with respect to a 
particular meeting, the Commission shall issue the public notice 
required by paragraph (a) of this section at the earliest practicable

    (3) When the Commission not only has voted in conformity with 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section to shorten the 7-day period for public 
notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to a 
particular meeting, but also has voted to close a portion or portions of 
such meeting in accordance with Sec. 201.36 of this subpart, the public 
notice required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall also include, 
or be amended to include, if already issued, those items specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d)(1) When the Commission has changed the time or place of a 
publicly announced meeting by acting under Sec. 201.37(a) of this 
subpart, the public notice required by paragraph (a) or (c)(2) of this 
section shall be amended to reflect such changed time or place.
    (2) When the Commission has changed the subject matter of a meeting 
or its determination to open or close a meeting, or portion thereof, to 
the public following a public notice by acting under Sec. 201.37(b) of 
this subpart, the public notice required by paragraph (a) or (c)(2) of 
this section shall be amended to (i) Include a statement affirming that 
Commission business required the change in subject matter and that no 
earlier announcement of such change was possible and (ii) Indicate the 
change in subject matter and the vote of each Commissioner upon such

Sec. 201.36   Closing a portion or portions of a meeting or a series of 
          meetings.

    (a) Every meeting of the Commission shall be open to public 
observation except when the Commission properly determines in the manner 
specified in paragraph (d) of this section that a portion or portions of 
a Commission meeting shall be closed to the public for the specific 
reasons enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) The Commission may close a portion or portions of a Commission 
meeting only when it determines that public disclosure of information to 
be discussed at such meeting is likely to:
    (1) Disclose matters that are (i) Specifically authorized under 
criteria established by Executive order to be kept secret in the 
interests of national defense or foreign policy and (ii) in fact 
properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;
    (2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Commission;
    (3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by 
statute (other than the Freedom of Information Act), provided that such 
statute (i) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in 
such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (ii) 
Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular 
types of matters to be withheld.

[[Page 43]]

(43
    (4) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information 
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;
    (5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring 
any person;
    (6) Disclose information of a personal nature when disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;
    (7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law-enforcement 
purposes, or information which, if written, would be contained in such 
records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or 
information would: (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings, (ii) 
deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or to an impartial 
adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy, or (iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source, and, in 
the case of a record compiled by a criminal law-enforcement authority in 
the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a 
lawful national-security intelligence investigation, confidential 
information furnished only by the confidential source;
    (8)(i) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would, 
in those instances where the Commission regulates commodities, be likely 
to lead to significant financial speculation in such commodities;
    (ii) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be 
likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed 
Commission action except (A) When the Commission has already disclosed 
to the public the content or nature of its proposed action or (B) when 
the Commission is required by law to make such disclosure on its own 
initiative prior to taking final Commission action on such proposal; or
    (9) Specifically concern: (i) The Commission's issuance of a 
subpoena, (ii) the Commission's participation in a civil action or

Commission of a particular case of formal Commission adjudication under 
19 U.S.C. 1337 pursuant to the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise 
involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
    (c)(1) When the Commission has determined that one or more of the 
specific reasons enumerated in paragraph (b) of this section for closing

subject matter or matters to be discussed, the Commission shall consider 
whether or not the public interest requires that such portion or 
portions of the meeting be open to public observation.
    (2) In making the public-interest determination under paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section, the Commission shall consider whether public 
disclosure would (i) Interfere with the Commission's carrying out its 
statutory responsibilities, (ii) Conflict with the individual right of 
privacy under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or (iii) Place 
the Commission in violation of any other applicable provision of law, in 
addition to any other factors which it deems to be relevant to the 
particular meeting in question.
    (d)(1) Action by the Commission to close a portion or portions of a

action.
    (2) A single recorded vote of the Commission shall be taken with

    Source: 48 FR 5898, Feb. 9, 1983, unless otherwise noted.

Sec. 201.42  Purpose and scope.

    The following regulation supplements Executive Order 12356, National 
Security Information, April 2, 1982, as it applies to the Commission.

Sec. 201.43  Program.

    The Director of Administration is designated as the official of the 
Commission who is responsible for implementation and oversight of 
information security programs and procedures, including ensuring 
conformity with the provisions of Executive Order No. 12356. He shall 
chair a committee, composed of himself and representatives of the

[[Page 46]]

(46offices of the Secretary, General Counsel, Executive Liaison and 
Special Adviser for Trade Agreements, and Operations, that will act on 
all suggestions and complaints with respect to the Commission's 
administration of the program. All questions, suggestions, and 
complaints regarding all elements of the information security program 
shall be directed to the Director of Administration.

Sec. 201.44  Procedures.

    (a) Mandatory declassification review. (1) Requests for 
declassification and release of national security information in the 
custody of the Commission shall be directed to the Secretary. Requests 
must reasonably describe the information that is desired to be 
declassified. All requests for declassification submitted pursuant to 
the Freedom of Information Act shall be processed in accordance with the 
provisions of that act and the applicable regulations of the Commission 
(19 CFR 201.17 through 201.21).
    (2) Because the Commission does not have original classification 
authority and national security information in its custody has been 
classified by another Federal agency, the Secretary shall refer all 
requests for mandatory declassification review of classified information 
to the originating Federal agency along with his recommendations. 
Following consultation with the originating agency, the Secretary will 
notify the requestor of the referral.
    (b) Safeguarding. All classified materials shall be delivered to the 
addressee or his designee immediately upon receipt at the Commission. In 
the event that the addressee or his designee is not available to receive 
the materials, they shall be delivered to the Secretary and secured, 
unopened, in a combination safe located in his office until the 
addressee or his designee is available. Under no circumstances shall 
classified materials that cannot be delivered to the addressee or his 
designee be stored other than in a GSA approved safe. Access to 
classified materials at the Commission shall be limited to officers and 
employees of the Commission on the basis of a favorable determination of 
trustworthiness on the basis of appropriate personnel security 
investigations and a need for access in the performance of official 
duties.
    (c) Reproduction. ``Top Secret'' documents may not be reproduced 
without the consent of the originating agency unless otherwise marked by 
that agency. Documents that have been classified ``Secret'' or 
``Confidential'' with special dissemination orders may not be reproduced 
without the permission of the Executive Liaison and Special Adviser for 
Trade Agreements, and are subject to any limitations imposed by the 
originator. Reproduced copies shall be subject to the same controls as 
the original document. The Executive Liaison and Special Adviser for 
Trade Agreements shall establish a system of recording the number and 
distribution of copies reproduced from the original documents. 
Reproduction for the purposes of mandatory review shall not be 
restricted.
    (d) Storage. All classified material shall be stored in GSA-approved 
combination safes located at the Commission. The combinations shall be 
changed as required by section 2001.43(b) of Information Security 
Oversight Office Directive No. 1. The combinations shall be known only 
by those employees possessing an appropriate security clearance who have 
need for access in the performance of official duties.
    (e) Employee education. The Director of Administration shall 
establish for all employees who have been granted a security clearance 
an information security education program that will advise them of the 
handling, reproduction, and storage procedures for these materials. The 
education program will also enable employees to familiarize themselves 
with the Order and applicable directives of the Information Security 
Oversight Office. New employees will be instructed in these procedures 
as they enter employment with the Commission.
    (f) Agency terminology. The use of the terms ``Top Secret'', 
``Secret'', and ``Confidential'' shall be limited to material classified 
for national security purposes.

Secs. 201.141--201.148  [Reserved]

Sec. 201.149  Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

    Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 201.150, no qualified 
handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are 
inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the 
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be

the agency.

Sec. 201.150  Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

    (a) General. The agency shall operate each program or activity so

not--
    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing

[[Page 50]]

(50
    (2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate 
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or 
activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those 
circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action 
would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in 
undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of 
proving that compliance with Sec. 201.150(a) would result in such 
alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such 
alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her 
designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the 
funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be 
accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such 
burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in 
such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.
    (b) Methods. The agency may comply with the requirements of this 
section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of 
services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, 
home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, 
alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, 
use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in 
making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural 
changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in 
achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making 
alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements 
to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as 
amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In 
choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this 
section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer 
programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most 
integrated setting appropriate.
    (c) Time period for compliance. The agency shall comply with the 
obligations established under this section by June 6, 1986, except that 
where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes 
shall be made by April 7, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as 
possible.
    (d) Transition plan. In the event that structural changes to 
facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the 
agency shall develop, by October 7, 1986, a transition plan setting 
forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall 
provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped 
persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to 
participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting 
comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be 
made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum--
    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that 
limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped 
persons;
    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the 
facilities accessible;
    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve 
compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition 
plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during 
each year of the transition period; and
    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the 
plan.

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered 
by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, 
constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by 
handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the 
Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41

conducted by the agency.
    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the 
agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the 
handicapped person.
    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, 
readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal 
nature.

by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or 
equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.

the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and 
facilities.

of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which 
they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The 
international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary 
entrance of an accessible facility.
    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that 
it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the 
nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative 
burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the 
proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or 
would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency 
has the burden of proving that compliance with Sec. 201.160 would result 
in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result 
in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or 
her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in 
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must 
be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that 
conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would 
result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any 
other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens 
but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, 
handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or 
activity.

The provisions of section 336 of the Tariff Act may not be applied to 
any article with respect to the importation of which into the United 
States a foreign trade agreement has been concluded under the Trade 
Agreements Act of 1934, as amended, or the Trade Expansion Act. (19 
U.S.C. 1352(a)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sec. 202.2   Applications.

    (a) Who may file. Applications for an investigation to which this 
part 202 relates may be filed by any firm, association of firms, or 
corporation engaged in the production of a domestic article, or by any 
duly authorized representative of the foregoing.
    (b) Requirements for applications. In addition to conforming with

far as practicable, information of the following character should be 
furnished:
    (1) Comparability of the domestic and foreign articles and the 
degree of competition between them.
    (2) Trend in recent years of (i) domestic production, (ii) domestic 
sales, (iii) imports, (iv) costs of production, and (v) prices.
    (3) Evidence of difference between domestic and foreign costs of 
production of the articles involved.
    (4) Areas of greatest competition between the imported and domestic 
products and the principal market or markets in the United States.
    (5) Other relevant factors that constitute, in the opinion of the 
applicant, an advantage or disadvantage in competition, and any other 
information which the applicant believes the Commission should consider.

Sec. 202.3   Preliminary inquiry.

    Upon the receipt of an application properly filed, the Commission 
will make a preliminary inquiry for the purpose of determining whether 
there is good and sufficient reason for a full investigation. If such 
determination is in the affirmative, a full investigation will be 
instituted.

Sec. 202.4   Public hearing.

    A public hearing will be held in connection with each full 
investigation to which this part 202 relates.

Sec. 202.5   Type of information to be developed at hearing.

    Without excluding other factors, but with a view to assisting 
parties interested to present information necessary for the formulation 
of findings required

[[Page 54]]

(54by the statute, the Commission will expect attention in the hearing 
to be concentrated upon facts relating to:
    (a) The degree of competition between the foreign and domestic 
articles in the markets of the United States.
    (b) The degree of likeness or similarity between grades, classes, 
and price groups of the American product and the imported article.
    (c) Costs of production and importation. Statements of average cost 
of production, domestic and, so far as known, foreign, may be submitted 
subject to verification and review in the Commission's investigation. 
Such statements should include not only the direct costs for materials 
and labor, commonly termed prime cost, but also indirect costs such as 
indirect labor, overhead factory expenses, fixed charges, the portion of 
general and administrative expense chargeable to manufacture, imputed 
interest on investment equity, and transportation to markets. For the 
foreign product the expenses (other than duties) incident to importation 
are also important. Any information which may be available bearing on 
the general levels of domestic and foreign costs of production, the 
differentials between particular elements of domestic and foreign costs, 
and the extent to which invoice or wholesale prices are reliable 
evidence of foreign costs, will be pertinent.
    (d) Other significant advantages or disadvantages in competition.

Sec. 202.6   Reports.

    After the completion of its investigation, the Commission will 
incorporate its findings in a report, and the report will be transmitted

Sec. 206.17, in the case of an investigation under Subpart B, C, D, or F 
of this Part, the Commission will not release information which the 
Commission considers to be confidential business information within the 
meaning of Sec. 201.6 unless the party submitting the confidential 
business information had notice, at the time of submission, that such 
information would be released by the Commission, or such party

business information, and a nonconfidential version of such report will 
be made available to the public.
    (b) Nonconfidential summaries. Except as the Commission may 
otherwise provide, a party submitting confidential business information 
shall also submit

[[Page 60]]

(60to the Commission, at the time it submits such information, a 
nonconfidential summary of the information. If a party indicates that 
the confidential business information cannot be summarized, it shall 
state in writing the reasons why a summary cannot be provided. If the 
Commission finds that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and 
if the party concerned is either unwilling to make the information 
public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summarized form, 
the Commission may disregard the submission.

Sec. 206.8  Service, filing, and certification of documents.

    (a) Certification. Any person submitting factual information on 
behalf of the petitioner or any other interested party for the 
consideration of the Commission in the course of an investigation to 
which this part pertains, and any person submitting a response to a 
Commission questionnaire issued in connection with an investigation to 
which this part pertains, must certify that such information is accurate 
and complete to the best of the submitter's knowledge.
    (b) Service. Any party submitting a document for the consideration 
of the Commission in the course of an investigation to which this part 
pertains shall, in addition to complying with Sec. 201.8 of this 
chapter, serve a copy of the public version of such document on all 
other parties to the investigation in the manner prescribed in 
Sec. 201.16 of this chapter, and, when appropriate, serve a copy of the 
confidential version of such document in the manner provided for in 
Sec. 206.17(f). If a document is filed before the Secretary's issuance 
of the service list provided for in Sec. 201.11 of this chapter or the 
administrative protective order list provided for in Sec. 206.17, the 
document need not be accompanied by a certificate of service, but the 
document shall be served on all appropriate parties within two (2) days 
of the issuance of the service list or the administrative protective 
order list and a certificate of service shall then be filed. 
Notwithstanding Sec. 201.16 of this chapter, petitions, briefs, and 
testimony filed by parties shall be served by hand or, if served by 
mail, by overnight mail or its equivalent. Failure to comply with the 
requirements of this rule may result in removal from status as a party 
to the investigation. The Commission shall make available, upon request, 
to all parties to the investigation a copy of each document, except 
transcripts of hearings, confidential business information, privileged 
information, and information required to be served under this section, 
placed in the docket file of the investigation by the Commission.
    (c) Filing. Documents to be filed with the Commission must comply 
with applicable rules, including Sec. 201.8 of this chapter. If the 
Commission establishes a deadline for the filing of a document, and the 
submitter includes confidential business information in the document, 
the submitter is to file and, if the submitter is a party, serve the 
confidential version of the document on the deadline and may file and 
serve the nonconfidential version of the document no later than one 
business day after the deadline for filing the document. The 
confidential version shall enclose all confidential business information 
in brackets and have the following warning marked on every page: 
``Bracketing of CBI not final for one business day after date of 
filing.'' The bracketing becomes final one business day after the date 
of filing of the document, i.e., at the same time as the nonconfidential 
version of the document is due to be filed. Until the bracketing becomes 
final, recipients of the document may not divulge any part of the 
contents of the document to anyone not subject to the administrative 
protective order issued in the investigation. If the submitter discovers 
it has failed to bracket correctly, the submitter may file a corrected 
version or portion of the confidential document at the same time as the 
nonconfidential version is filed. No changes to the document other than 
bracketing and deletion of confidential business information are 
permitted after the deadline. Failure to comply with this paragraph may 
result in the striking of all or a portion of a submitter's document.

Sec. 206.13  Who may file a petition.

    A petition under this Subpart B may be filed by an entity, including 
a trade association, firm, certified or recognized union, or group of 
workers, that is representative of a domestic industry producing an

thereof, to such domestic industry.

Sec. 206.14  Contents of petition.

    A petition under this Subpart B shall include specific information 
in support of the claim that an article is being imported into the 
United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause 
of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry 
producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported 
article. Such petition shall state whether provisional relief is sought 
because critical circumstances exist or because the imported article is 
a perishable agricultural product. In addition, such petition shall 
include the following information, to the extent that such information 
is available from governmental or other sources, or best estimates and 
the basis therefor if such information is not available:
    (a) Product description. The name and description of the imported

article known to the petitioner;

domestic article for each full year for which data are provided pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section;

extent of injury to the domestic industry concerned:
    (1) With respect to serious injury, data indicating:

(62
    (i) A significant idling of production facilities in the industry, 
including data indicating plant closings or the underutilization of 
production capacity;
    (ii) The inability of a significant number of firms to carry out 
domestic production operations at a reasonable level of profit; and
    (iii) Significant unemployment or underemployment within the 
industry; and/or
    (2) With respect to the threat of serious injury, data relating to:
    (i) A decline in sales or market share, a higher and growing 
inventory (whether maintained by domestic producers, importers, 
wholesalers, or retailers), and a downward trend in production, profits, 
wages, productivity, or employment (or increasing underemployment);
    (ii) The extent to which firms in the industry are unable to 
generate adequate capital to finance the modernization of their domestic 
plants and equipment, or are unable to maintain existing levels of 
expenditures for research and development;
    (iii) The extent to which the U.S. market is the focal point for the 
diversion of exports of the article concerned by reason of restraints on 
exports of such article to, or on imports of such article into, third 
country markets; and
    (3) Changes in the level of prices, production, and productivity.
    (f) Cause of injury. An enumeration and description of the causes 
believed to be resulting in the injury, or threat thereof, described 
under paragraph (e) of this section, and a statement regarding the 
extent to which increased imports, either actual or relative to domestic 
production, of the imported article are believed to be such a cause, 
supported by pertinent data;
    (g) Relief sought and purpose thereof. A statement describing the 
import relief sought, including the type, amount, and duration, and the 
specific purposes therefor, which may include facilitating the orderly 
transfer of resources to more productive pursuits, enhancing 
competitiveness, or other means of adjustment to new conditions of 
competition;

imports of such article.
    (j) Critical circumstances. If the petition alleges the existence of 
critical circumstances, a statement setting forth the basis for the 
belief that there is clear evidence that increased imports (either 
actual or relative to domestic production) of the article are a 
substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the 
domestic industry, and that delay in taking action would cause damage to 
that industry that would be difficult to repair, and a statement 
concerning the provisional relief requested and the basis therefor.

Sec. 206.15  Institution of investigation.

    (a) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the Commission, after receipt of a petition under this Subpart B, 
properly filed, will promptly institute an appropriate investigation and 
will cause a notice thereof to be published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Exceptions--(1) Reinvestigation within one (1) year. Except for 
good cause determined by the Commission to exist, no new investigation 
will be made under section 202 of the Trade Act with respect to the same

(1) year has elapsed since the Commission made its report to the 
President of the results of such previous investigation.
    (2) Articles subject to prior action. No new investigation will be 
made under section 202 of the Trade Act with respect to an article that 
is or has been the subject of an action under section 203(a) (3)(A),

    (3) Articles subject to the Textiles Agreement. No investigation 
will be made under section 202 of the Trade Act with respect to an

Clothing unless the United States has integrated the article into GATT 
1994 and the Secretary of Commerce has published notice to such effect 
in the Federal Register.
    (4) Perishable agricultural product. An entity of the type described 
in Sec. 206.13 that represents a domestic industry producing a 
perishable agricultural product may petition for provisional relief with 
respect to such product only if such product has been subject to 
monitoring by the Commission for not less than 90 days as of the date 
the allegation of injury is included in the petition.

Sec. 206.16  Industry adjustment plan and commitments.

    (a) Adjustment plan. A petitioner may submit to the Commission, 
either with the petition or at any time within 120 days after the date 
of filing of the petition, a plan to facilitate positive adjustment to 
import competition.

Commission commitments regarding actions such persons and entities 
intend to take to facilitate positive adjustment to import competition.

Sec. 206.17  Limited disclosure of certain confidential business 
          information under administrative protective order.

    (a)(1) Disclosure. Upon receipt of a timely application filed by an 
authorized applicant, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
which describes in general terms the information requested, and sets 
forth the reasons for the request (e.g., all confidential business 
information properly disclosed pursuant to this section for the purpose 
of representing an interested party in investigations pending before the 
Commission), the Secretary shall make available all confidential 
business information contained in Commission memoranda and reports and 
in written submissions filed with the Commission at any time during the 
investigation (except privileged information, classified information, 
and specific information of a type which there is a clear and compelling 
need to withhold from disclosure, e.g., trade secrets) to the authorized 
applicant under an administrative protective order described in 
paragraph (b) of this section. The term ``confidential business 
information'' is defined in Sec. 201.6 of this chapter.

section must be made by an authorized applicant on a form adopted by the 
Secretary or a photocopy thereof. An application on behalf of an 
authorized applicant must be made no later than the time that entries of 
appearance are due pursuant to Sec. 201.11 of this chapter. In the event 
that two or more authorized applicants represent one interested party 
who is a party to the investigation, the authorized applicants must 
select one of their number to be lead authorized applicant. The lead 
authorized applicant's application must be filed no later than the time 
that entries of appearance are due. Provided that the application is 
accepted, the lead authorized applicant shall be served with 
confidential business information pursuant to paragraph (f) of this 
section. The other authorized applicants representing the same party may 
file their applications after the deadline for entries of appearance but 
at least five (5) days before the deadline for filing posthearing briefs 
in the investigation, and shall not be served with confidential business 
information.
    (3) Authorized applicant. (i) Only an authorized applicant may file 
an application under this subsection. An authorized applicant is:

investigation, if such interested party is not represented by counsel.
    (ii) In addition, an authorized applicant must not be involved in 
competitive decisionmaking for an interested party which is a party to 
the investigation. Involvement in ``competitive decisionmaking'' 
includes past, present, or likely future activities, associations, and 
relationships with an interested party which is a party to the 
investigation that involve the prospective authorized applicant's advice 
or participation in any of such party's decisions made in light of 
similar or corresponding information about a competitor (pricing, 
product design, etc.).
    (iii) For purposes of this Sec. 206.17, the term interested party 
means:
    (A) A foreign manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or the United 
States importer, of an article which is the subject of an investigation 
under this section or a trade or business association a majority of the 
members of which are producers, exporters, or importers of such article;

manufactured;
    (C) A manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the United States of 
a like or directly competitive article;

of this section with respect to a like or directly competitive article.
    (4) Forms and determinations. (i) The Secretary may adopt, from time 
to time, forms for submitting requests for disclosure pursuant to an 
administrative protective order incorporating the terms of this rule. 
The Secretary shall determine whether the requirements for release of 
information under this rule have been satisfied. This determination 
shall be made concerning specific confidential business information as 
expeditiously as possible but in no event later than fourteen (14) days 
from the filing of the information, except if the submitter of the 
information objects to its release or the information is unusually 
voluminous or complex, in which case the determination shall be made 
within thirty (30) days from the filing of the information. The 
Secretary shall establish a list of parties whose applications have been 
granted. The Secretary's determination shall be final.
    (ii) Should the Secretary determine pursuant to this section that 
materials sought to be protected from public disclosure by a person do 
not constitute confidential business information or were not required to 
be served under paragraph (f) of this section, then the Secretary shall, 
upon request, issue an order on behalf of the Commission requiring the 
return of all copies of such materials served in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section.

statement that, in addition to such other conditions as the Secretary 
may require, he shall:
    (1) Not divulge any of the confidential business information 
obtained

[[Page 65]]

(65under the administrative protective order and not otherwise available 
to him, to any person other than
    (i) Personnel of the Commission concerned with the investigation,
    (ii) The person or agency from whom the confidential business 
information was obtained,
    (iii) A person whose application for access to confidential business

employed or supervised by an authorized applicant; who have a need 
thereof in connection with the investigation; who are not involved in 
competitive decisionmaking on behalf of an interested party which is a 
party to the investigation; and who have submitted to the Secretary a 
signed statement in a form approved by the Secretary that they agree to 
be bound by the administrative protective order (the authorized 
applicant shall be deemed responsible for such persons' compliance with 
the administrative protective order);
    (2) Use such confidential business information solely for the 
purposes of the Commission investigation then in progress;
    (3) Not consult with any person not described in paragraph (b)(1) of

suitable container;
    (5) Serve all materials containing confidential business information

assigned to the investigation);
    (9) Report promptly and confirm in writing to the Secretary any 
breach of the administrative protective order; and
    (10) Acknowledge that breach of the administrative protective order 
may subject the authorized applicant to such sanctions or other actions 
as the Commission deems appropriate.
    (c) Final disposition of material released under administrative 
protective order. At such date as the Secretary may determine 
appropriate for particular data, each authorized applicant shall return 
or destroy all copies of materials released to authorized applicants 
pursuant to this section and all other materials containing confidential 
business information, such as charts or notes based on any such 
information received under administrative protective order, and file 
with the Secretary a certificate attesting to his personal, good faith 
belief that all copies of such material have been returned or destroyed 
and no copies of such material have been made available to any person to 
whom disclosure was not specifically authorized.
    (d) Commission responses to a breach of administrative protective 
order. A breach of an administrative protective order may subject an 
offender to:
    (1) Disbarment from practice in any capacity before the Commission 
along with such person's partners, associates, employer, and employees, 
for up to seven years following publication of a determination that the 
order has been breached;

[[Page 66]]

(66of or striking from the record any information or briefs submitted 
by, or on behalf of, the offender or the party represented by the 
offender, denial of further access to confidential business information 
in the current or any future investigations before the Commission, and 
issuance of a public or private letter of reprimand; and
    (5) Such other actions, including but not limited to, a warning 
letter, as the Commission determines to be appropriate.
    (e) Breach investigation procedure. (1) The Commission shall 
determine whether any person has violated an administrative protective 
order, and may impose sanctions or other actions in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section. At any time within sixty (60) days of the 
later of
    (i) The date on which the alleged violation occurred or, as 
determined by the Commission, could have been discovered through the 
exercise of reasonable and ordinary care; or
    (ii) The completion of an investigation conducted under this 
subpart, the Commission may commence an investigation of any breach of 
an administrative protective order alleged to have occurred at any time 
during the pendency of the investigation, including all appeals, 
remands, and subsequent appeals. Whenever the Commission has reason to 
believe that a person may have breached an administrative protective 
order issued pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall issue a 
letter informing such person that the Commission has reason to believe a 
breach has occurred and that the person has a reasonable opportunity to 
present his views on whether a breach has occurred. If subsequently the 
Commission determines that a breach has occurred and that further 
investigation is warranted, then the Secretary shall issue a letter 
informing such person of that determination and that the person has a 
reasonable opportunity to present his views on whether mitigating 
circumstances exist and on the appropriate sanction to be imposed, but 
no longer on whether a breach has occurred. Once such person has been 
afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his views, the Commission 
shall determine what sanction if any to impose.
    (2) Where the sanction imposed is a private letter of reprimand, the 
Secretary shall expunge the sanction from the recipient's record two (2) 
years from the date of issuance of the sanction, provided that
    (i) The recipient has not received another unexpunged sanction 
pursuant to this section at any time prior to the end of the two year 
period, and
    (ii) The recipient is not the subject of an investigation for 
possible breach of administrative protective order under this section at 
the end of the two year period. Upon the completion of such a pending 
breach investigation without the issuance of a sanction, the original 
sanction shall be expunged. The Secretary shall notify a sanction 
recipient in the event that the sanction is expunged.

submissions upon all authorized applicants specified on the list 
established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this

(2) days of the establishment of the list and a certificate of service 
shall then be filed.
    (2) A party may seek an exemption from the service requirement of 
paragraph (f)(1) of this section for particular confidential business

clearly marked as such when submitted, and must be segregated from other 
material being submitted.
    (g) Exemption from disclosure--(1) In general. Any person may 
request exemption from the disclosure of confidential business 
information under administrative protective order, whether the person 
desires to include such information in a petition filed under this 
Subpart B, or any other submission to the Commission during the course 
of an investigation. Such a request shall only be granted if the 
Secretary finds that such information is privileged information, 
classified information, or specific information of a type which there is 
a clear and compelling need to withhold from disclosure.
    (2) Request for exemption. A request for exemption from disclosure 
must be filed with the Secretary in writing with the reasons therefor.

versions shall conform to and be filed in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 206.8, except that the specific information as to 
which exemption from disclosure was granted shall be redacted from those 
versions of the submission.
    (4) Procedure if request is denied. If the request is denied, the 
copy of the information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be

that imports of the article alone constitute a substantial cause of 
serious injury, or (except in the case of a Canadian article) a threat 
of serious injury, to such domestic industry.
    (b) Perishable agricultural product. An entity of the type described 
in paragraph (a) of this section that represents a domestic industry

article, alone, constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or 
(except in the case of a Canadian article) a threat of serious injury, 
to the domestic industry producing an article that is like or directly 
competitive with the imported article. Such petition shall state whether 
provisional relief is sought because critical circumstances exist or 
because the imported article is a perishable agricultural product. In 
addition, such petition shall include the following information, to the 
extent that such information is publicly available from governmental or 
other sources, or best estimates and the basis therefor if such 
information is not available:

production capacity;
    (ii) The inability of a significant number of firms to carry out 
domestic production operations at a reasonable level of profit; and
    (iii) Significant unemployment or underemployment within the

hereby assigned to them:
    (a) The term the Act means: The Tariff Act of 1930, as amended.
    (b) The term administering authority means: The Secretary of

information in connection with an investigation, and
    (2) Any Commissioner, or member of a Commissioner's staff, in which 
less than all parties participate, and which is not a hearing or 
conference for which an opportunity to participate is given to the 
parties.
    (e) The term injury means: Material injury or threat of material

[44 FR 76468, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 60 FR 21, Jan. 3, 1995]

Sec. 207.3  Service, filing, and certification of documents.

    (a) Certification. Any person submitting factual information on 
behalf of the petitioner or any other interested party for inclusion in 
the record, and any person submitting a response to a Commission 
questionnaire, must certify that such information is accurate and 
complete to the best of the submitter's knowledge.
    (b) Service. Any party submitting a document for inclusion in the 
record of the investigation shall, in addition to complying with 
Sec. 201.8 of this chapter, serve a copy of each such document on all 
other parties to the investigation in the manner prescribed in 
Sec. 201.16 of this chapter. If a document is filed before the 
Secretary's issuance of the service list provided for in Sec. 201.11 of 
this chapter or the administrative protective order list provided for in 
Sec. 207.7, the document need not be accompanied by a certificate of 
service, but the document shall be served on all appropriate parties 
within two (2) days of the issuance of the service list or the 
administrative protective order list and a certificate of service shall 
then be filed. Notwithstanding Sec. 201.16 of this chapter, petitions, 
briefs, and testimony filed by parties pursuant to Secs. 207.10, 207.15, 
207.23, 207.24, and 207.25 shall be served by hand or, if served by 
mail, by overnight mail or its equivalent. Failure to comply with the 
requirements of this rule may result in removal from status as a party 
to the investigation. The Commission shall make available to all parties 
to the investigation a copy of each document, except transcripts of 
conferences and hearings, business proprietary information, privileged 
information, and information required to be served under this section, 
placed in the record of the investigation by the Commission.
    (c) Filing. Documents to be filed with the Commission must comply 
with applicable rules, including Sec. 201.8 of this chapter. If the 
Commission establishes a deadline for the filing of a document, and the 
submitter includes business proprietary information in the document, the 
submitter is to file and, if the submitter is a party, serve the 
business proprietary version of the document on the deadline and may 
file and serve the nonbusiness proprietary version of the document no 
later than one business day after the deadline for filing the document. 
The business proprietary version shall enclose all business proprietary 
information in brackets and have the following warning marked on every 
page: ``Bracketing of BPI not final for one business day after date of 
filing.'' The bracketing becomes final one business day after the date 
of filing of the document, i.e., at the same time as the nonbusiness 
proprietary version of the document is due to be filed. Until the 
bracketing becomes final, recipients of the document may not divulge any 
part of the contents of the document to anyone not subject to the 
administrative protective order issued in the investigation. If the 
submitter discovers it has failed to bracket correctly, the submitter 
may file a corrected version or portion of the business proprietary 
document at the same time as the nonbusiness proprietary version is 
filed. No changes, including typographical changes, to the document 
other than bracketing and deletion of business proprietary information 
are permitted after the deadline unless an extension of time is granted 
to file an amended document pursuant to Sec. 201.14(b)(2) of this 
chapter. Failure to comply with this paragraph may result in the 
striking from the record of all or a portion of a submitter's document.

[44 FR 76468, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 61 FR 37829, July 22, 1996]

Sec. 207.4  The record.

    (a) Maintenance of the record. The Secretary shall maintain the 
record of each investigation conducted by the Commission pursuant to 
title VII of the Act. The record shall be maintained contemporaneously 
with each actual filing in the record. It shall be divided into public 
and nonpublic sections. The Secretary shall also maintain a 
contemporaneous index of all

[[Page 77]]

(77materials filed in the record. All material properly filed with the 
Secretary shall be placed in the record. The Commission need not 
consider in its determinations or include in the record any material 
that is not filed with the Secretary. All material which is placed in 
the record shall be maintained in the public record, with the exception 
of material which is privileged, or which is business proprietary 
information submitted in accordance with Sec. 201.6 of this chapter. 
Privileged and business proprietary material shall be maintained in the 
nonpublic record.
    (b) Audits. The Commission may in its discretion verify information 
received in the course of an investigation. To the extent a verification 
results in new or different information, the Commission shall place such 
information on the record.
    (c) Materials provided by the administering authority. Materials 
received by the Commission from the administering authority shall be 
placed on the Commission's record and shall be designated by the 
Commission as public or nonpublic in conformity with the applicable 
designation of the administering authority. Any requests to the 
Commission either to permit access to such materials or to release such 
materials shall be referred to the administering authority for its 
advice.

[44 FR 76468, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 61 FR 37829, July 22, 1996]

Sec. 207.5  Ex parte meetings.

    There shall be included in the record of each investigation a record 
of ex parte meetings as required by section 777(a)(3) of the Act. The 
record of each ex parte meeting shall include the identity of the 
persons present at the meeting, the date, time, and place of the 
meeting, and a summary of the matters discussed or submitted.

Sec. 207.6  Reports of progress of investigation.

    The Secretary shall upon the request of a party inform the parties 
to an investigation of the progress of that investigation. No such 
progress report, however, shall be issued by the Secretary less than 
thirty (30) days after the date of publication of commencement of an 
investigation by notice in the Federal Register, nor shall the Secretary 
be required to issue a report on the progress of any investigation less 
than thirty (30) days after the date of issuance of the previous such 
report with respect to the same investigation. A report shall be limited 
to a statement of what official actions the Commission has taken since 
the previous such report, if any.

Sec. 207.7  Limited disclosure of certain business proprietary 
          information under administrative protective order.

    (a)(1) Disclosure. Upon receipt of a timely application filed by an 
authorized applicant, as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
which describes in general terms the information requested, and sets 
forth the reasons for the request (e.g., all business proprietary 
information properly disclosed pursuant to this section for the purpose 
of representing an interested party in investigations pending before the 
Commission), the Secretary shall make available all business proprietary 
information contained in Commission memoranda and reports and in written 
submissions filed with the Commission at any time during the 
investigation (except nondisclosable confidential business information) 
to the authorized applicant under an administrative protective order 
described in paragraph (b) of this section. The term ``business 
proprietary information'' has the same meaning as the term 
``confidential business information'' as defined in Sec. 201.6 of this 
chapter.
    (2) Application. An application under paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section must be made by an authorized applicant on a form adopted by the 
Secretary or a photocopy thereof. An application on behalf of a 
petitioner, a respondent, or another party must be made no later than 
the time that entries of appearance are due pursuant to Sec. 201.11 of 
this chapter. In the event that two or more authorized applicants 
represent one interested party who is a party to the investigation, the 
authorized applicants must select one of their number to be lead 
authorized applicant. The lead authorized applicant's application must 
be filed no later than the time that entries of appearance are due. 
Provided

[[Page 78]]

(78that the application is accepted, the lead authorized applicant shall 
be served with business proprietary information pursuant to paragraph 
(f) of this section. The other authorized applicants representing the 
same party may file their applications after the deadline for entries of 
appearance but at least five (5) days before the deadline for filing 
posthearing briefs in the investigation, or the deadline for filing 
briefs in the preliminary phase of an investigation, and shall not be 
served with business proprietary information.
    (3) Authorized applicant. (i) Only an authorized applicant may file 
an application under this subsection. An authorized applicant is:
    (A) An attorney for an interested party which is a party to the 
investigation;
    (B) A consultant or expert under the direction and control of a 
person under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section;
    (C) A consultant or expert who appears regularly before the 
Commission and who represents an interested party which is a party to 
the investigation; or
    (D) A representative of an interested party which is a party to the 
investigation, if such interested party is not represented by counsel.
    (ii) In addition, an authorized applicant must not be involved in 
competitive decisionmaking for an interested party which is a party to 
the investigation. Involvement in ``competitive decisionmaking'' 
includes past, present, or likely future activities, associations, and 
relationships with an interested party which is a party to the 
investigation that involve the prospective authorized applicant's advice 
or participation in any of such party's decisions made in light of 
similar or corresponding information about a competitor (pricing, 
product design, etc.).
    (4) Forms and determinations. (i) The Secretary may adopt, from time 
to time, forms for submitting requests for disclosure pursuant to an 
administrative protective order incorporating the terms of this rule. 
The Secretary shall determine whether the requirements for release of 
information under this rule have been satisfied. This determination 
shall be made concerning specific business proprietary information as 
expeditiously as possible but in no event later than fourteen (14) days 
from the filing of the information, or seven (7) days in the preliminary 
phase of an investigation, except if the submitter of the information 
objects to its release or the information is unusually voluminous or 
complex, in which case the determination shall be made within thirty 
(30) days from the filing of the information, or ten (10) days in the 
preliminary phase of an investigation. The Secretary shall establish a 
list of parties whose applications have been granted. The Secretary's 
determination shall be final for purposes of review by the U.S. Court of 
International Trade under section 777(c)(2) of the Act.
    (ii) Should the Secretary determine pursuant to this section that 
materials sought to be protected from public disclosure by a person do 
not constitute business proprietary information or were not required to 
be served under paragraph (f) of this section, then the Secretary shall, 
upon request, issue an order on behalf of the Commission requiring the 
return of all copies of such materials served in accordance with 
paragraph (f) of this section.
    (iii) The Secretary shall release business proprietary information 
only to an authorized applicant whose application has been accepted and 
who presents the application along with adequate personal 
identification; or a person described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this 
section who presents a copy of the statement referred to in that 
paragraph along with adequate personal identification.
    (iv) An authorized applicant granted access to business proprietary 
information in the preliminary phase of an investigation may, subject to 
paragraph (c) of this section, retain such business proprietary 
information during any final phase of that investigation, provided that 
the authorized applicant has not lost his authorized applicant status 
(e.g., by terminating his representation of an interested party who is a 
party). When retaining business proprietary information pursuant to this 
paragraph, the authorized applicant need not file a new application in 
the final phase of the investigation.
    (b) Administrative protective order. The administrative protective 
order under

[[Page 79]]

(79which information is made available to the authorized applicant shall 
require him to submit to the Secretary a personal sworn statement that, 
in addition to such other conditions as the Secretary may require, he 
shall:
    (1) Not divulge any of the business proprietary information obtained 
under the administrative protective order and not otherwise available to 
him, to any person other than
    (i) Personnel of the Commission concerned with the investigation,
    (ii) The person or agency from whom the business proprietary 
information was obtained,
    (iii) A person whose application for access to business proprietary 
information under the administrative protective order has been granted 
by the Secretary, and
    (iv) Other persons, such as paralegals and clerical staff, who are 
employed or supervised by the authorized applicant; who have a need 
thereof in connection with the investigation; who are not involved in 
competitive decisionmaking for an interested party which is a party to 
the investigation; and who have submitted to the Secretary a signed 
statement in a form approved by the Secretary that they agree to be 
bound by the administrative protective order (the authorized applicant 
shall be deemed responsible for such persons' compliance with the 
administrative protective order);
    (2) Use such business proprietary information solely for the 
purposes of the Commission investigation then in progress or for 
judicial or other review of such Commission investigation;
    (3) Not consult with any person not described in paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section concerning such business proprietary information without 
first having received the written consent of the Secretary and the party 
or the attorney of the party from whom such business proprietary 
information was obtained;
    (4) Whenever materials (e.g., documents, computer disks, etc.) 
containing such business proprietary information are not being used, 
store such material in a locked file cabinet, vault, safe, or other 
suitable container;
    (5) Serve all materials containing business proprietary information 
as directed by the Secretary and pursuant to paragraph (f) of this 
section;
    (6) Transmit all materials containing business proprietary 
information with a cover sheet identifying the materials as containing 
business proprietary information;
    (7) Comply with the provisions of this section;
    (8) Make true and accurate representations in the authorized 
applicant's application and promptly notify the Secretary of any changes 
that occur after the submission of the application and that affect the 
representations made in the application (e.g., change in personnel 
assigned to the investigation);
    (9) Report promptly and confirm in writing to the Secretary any 
breach of the administrative protective order; and
    (10) Acknowledge that breach of the administrative protective order 
may subject the authorized applicant to such sanctions or other actions 
as the Commission deems appropriate.
    (c) Final disposition of material released under administrative 
protective order. At such date as the Secretary may determine 
appropriate for particular data, each authorized applicant shall return 
or destroy all copies of materials released to authorized applicants 
pursuant to this section and all other materials containing business 
proprietary information, such as charts or notes based on any such 
information received under administrative protective order, and file 
with the Secretary a certificate attesting to his personal, good faith 
belief that all copies of such material have been returned or destroyed 
and no copies of such material have been made available to any person to 
whom disclosure was not specifically authorized.
    (d) Commission responses to a breach of administrative protective 
order. A breach of an administrative protective order may subject an 
offender to:
    (1) Disbarment from practice in any capacity before the Commission 
along with such person's partners, associates, employer, and employees, 
for up to seven years following publication of a determination that the 
order has been breached;

[[Page 80]]

(80
    (2) Referral to the United States Attorney;
    (3) In the case of an attorney, accountant, or other professional, 
referral to the ethics panel of the appropriate professional 
association;
    (4) Such other administrative sanctions as the Commission determines 
to be appropriate, including public release of or striking from the 
record any information or briefs submitted by, or on behalf of, the 
offender or the party represented by the offender, denial of further 
access to business proprietary information in the current or any future 
investigations before the Commission, and issuance of a public or 
private letter of reprimand; and
    (5) Such other actions, including but not limited to, a warning 
letter, as the Commission determines to be appropriate.
    (e) Breach investigation procedure. (1) The Commission shall 
determine whether any person has violated an administrative protective 
order, and may impose sanctions or other actions in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section. At any time within sixty (60) days of the 
later of the date on which the alleged violation occurred or, as 
determined by the Commission, could have been discovered through the 
exercise of reasonable and ordinary care, or the completion of an 
investigation conducted under subpart B or C of this part, the 
Commission may commence an investigation of any breach of an 
administrative protective order alleged to have occurred at any time 
during the pendency of the investigation, including all appeals, 
remands, and subsequent appeals. Whenever the Commission has reason to 
believe that a person may have breached an administrative protective 
order issued pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall issue a 
letter informing such person that the Commission has reason to believe a 
breach has occurred and that the person has a reasonable opportunity to 
present his views on whether a breach has occurred. If subsequently the 
Commission determines that a breach has occurred and that further 
investigation is warranted, the Secretary shall issue a letter informing 
such person of that determination and that the person has a reasonable 
opportunity to present his views on whether mitigating circumstances 
exist and on the appropriate sanction to be imposed, but no longer on 
whether a breach has occurred. Once such person has been afforded a 
reasonable opportunity to present his views, the Commission shall 
determine what sanction if any to impose.
    (2) Where the sanction imposed is a private letter of reprimand, the 
Secretary shall expunge the sanction from the recipient's record two (2) 
years from the date of issuance of the sanction, provided that
    (i) The recipient has not received another unexpunged sanction 
pursuant to this section at any time prior to the end of the two year 
period, and
    (ii) The recipient is not the subject of an investigation for 
possible breach of administrative protective order under this section at 
the end of the two year period. Upon the completion of such a pending 
breach investigation without the issuance of a sanction, the original 
sanction shall be expunged. The Secretary shall notify a sanction 
recipient in the event that the sanction is expunged.
    (f) Service. (1) Any party filing written submissions which include 
business proprietary information to the Commission during an 
investigation shall at the same time serve complete copies of such 
submissions upon all authorized applicants specified on the list 
established by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section, and, except as provided in Sec. 207.3, a nonbusiness 
proprietary version on all other parties. All such submissions must be 
accompanied by a certificate attesting that complete copies of the 
submission have been properly served. In the event that a submission is 
filed before the Secretary's list is established, the document need not 
be accompanied by a certificate of service, but the submission shall be 
served within two (2) days of the establishment of the list and a 
certificate of service shall then be filed.
    (2) If a party's request under paragraph (g) of this section is 
granted, the Secretary shall accept the nondisclosable confidential 
business information into the record. The party shall serve the 
submission containing

[[Page 81]]

(81such information in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 207.3(b) 
and paragraph (f)(1) of this section, with the information redacted from 
the copies served.
    (3) The Secretary shall not accept for filing into the record of an 
investigation submissions filed without a proper certificate of service. 
Failure to comply with paragraph (f) of this section may result in 
denial of party status and such sanctions as the Commission deems 
appropriate. Business proprietary information in submissions must be 
dealt with as required by Sec. 207.3(c).
    (g) Exemption from disclosure--(1) In general. Any person may 
request exemption from the disclosure of business proprietary 
information under administrative protective order, whether the person 
desires to include such information in a petition filed under 
Sec. 207.10, or any other submission to the Commission during the course 
of an investigation. Such a request shall only be granted if the 
Secretary finds that such information is nondisclosable confidential 
business information as defined in Sec. 201.6(a)(2) of this chapter. The 
request will be granted or denied not later than thirty (30) days (ten 
(10) days in a preliminary phase investigation) after the date on which 
the request is filed.
    (2) Request for exemption. A request for exemption from disclosure 
must be filed with the Secretary in writing with the reasons therefor. 
At the same time as the request is filed, one copy of the business 
proprietary information in question must be lodged with the Secretary 
solely for the purpose of obtaining a determination as to the request. 
The business proprietary information for which exemption from disclosure 
is sought shall remain the property of the requester, and shall not 
become or be incorporated into any agency record until such time as the 
request is granted. A request should, when possible, be filed two 
business days prior to the deadline, if any, for filing the document in 
which the information for which exemption from disclosure is sought is 
proposed to be included. If the request is denied, the copy of the 
information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be returned to the 
requester. Such a request shall only be granted if the Secretary finds 
that such information is privileged information, classified information, 
or specific information of a type for which there is a clear and 
compelling need to withhold from disclosure. The Secretary shall 
promptly notify the requester as to whether the request has been 
approved or denied.
    (3) Procedure if request is approved. If the request is approved, 
the person shall file three versions of the submission containing the 
nondisclosable confidential business information in question. One 
version shall contain all business proprietary information, bracketed in 
accordance with Sec. 201.6 of this chapter and Sec. 207.3. The other two 
versions shall conform to and be filed in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec. 201.6 of this chapter and Sec. 207.3, except that 
the specific information as to which exemption from disclosure was 
granted shall be redacted from the submission.
    (4) Procedure if request is denied. If the request is denied, the 
copy of the information lodged with the Secretary shall promptly be 
returned to the requester. The requester may file the submission in 
question without that information, in accordance with the requirements

concerning the names and addresses of all known enterprises believed to 
be manufacturing, producing, exporting, or importing the subject 
merchandise;
    (3) Information reasonably available to the requesting party 
documenting that the industry described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section is likely to be materially injured by reason of subject imports 
if the Order is revoked, including:
    (i) Information concerning the capacity, production, sales, market 
share, inventories, employment, wages, productivity, profits, ability to 
raise capital, and development and production efforts of the industry

753 investigations for which requests for investigations are received 
within one year after the date on which the WTO Agreement enters into 
force with respect to the United States. All such investigations must be 
completed within four years of that date, however. In determining 
whether to extend the completion date for a section 753 investigation, 
the Commission shall consult with the administering authority. Grounds

303 countervailing duty investigation in progress or suspended with 
respect to that country's merchandise for which the requirement of a 
material injury determination under section 303(a)(2) of the Act was not 
applicable at the time the investigation was initiated, the Commission 
shall commence an investigation pursuant to the provisions of section 
753(c) of the Act with respect to pending investigations and suspended 
investigations to which section 704(i)(1)(B) of the Act applies.
    (g) Request for Simultaneous Expedited Section 751(c) Review. (1) A 
requesting party who requests a section 753 review may at the same time 
request from the Commission and the administering authority an expedited 
review under section 751(c) of the Act of a countervailing or 
antidumping duty order involving the same or comparable subject 
merchandise. The request for review under section 751(c) of the Act 
should set forth evidence to establish why revocation of the order to be 
reviewed under section 751(c) of the Act would be likely to lead to 
continuation or recurrence of material injury and should additionally 
contain any information required by the regulations of the administering 
authority.
    (2) Should the administering authority, after consulting with the 
Commission, determine to initiate a section 751(c) review, the 
Commission shall conduct a consolidated review under sections 751(c) and 
753 of the Act of the orders involving the same or comparable subject 
merchandise. The procedures set forth in subparts A and C of this part

    (2) Any person may file a response to the request within twenty (20) 
days after it is filed, unless the Commission issues a notice indicating 
otherwise. After consideration of the request and any responses thereto, 
the Commission shall take such action as it deems appropriate.
    (3) If a request filed under this paragraph alleges that a person is 
violating the terms of a protective order, the Commission may treat the 
request as a report of violation under Sec. 207.101 of this subpart.
    (4) The Commission may also modify or revoke a protective order on 
its own initiative.
    (5) If the Commission revokes, amends or modifies a person's 
protective order, it shall provide to the person, the United States 
Secretary and all participants a copy of the Notice of Revocation, 
amendment or modification.

Sec. 207.94  Protection of privileged information during panel and 
          committee proceedings.

    When and if a panel or extraordinary challenge committee decides 
that the Commission is required, pursuant to the United States law, to 
grant access pursuant to protective order to information for which the 
Commission has claimed a privilege, any individual to whom a panel or 
extraordinary challenge committee has directed the Commission release 
information and who is otherwise within the category of individuals 
eligible to receive proprietary information pursuant to 19 CFR 
207.93(b), may file an application for a protective order with the 
Commission. Upon receipt of such application, the Commission Secretary 
shall certify to the Commission that a panel or extraordinary challenge 
committee has required the Commission to release such information to 
specified persons, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1677f(f)(1). Twenty-four hours 
following such certification, the Commission Secretary shall issue a 
protective order releasing such information to any authorized applicant 
subject to terms and conditions equivalent to those described in 19 CFR 
207.93(c)(2).

(97determined under this subpart to have committed a prohibited act, may 
be subject to one or more of the following sanctions:
    (1) A civil penalty not to exceed $100,000 for each violation, each 
day of a continuing violation constituting a separate violation;
    (2) Debarment from practice in any capacity before the Commission, 
which disbarment may, in appropriate circumstances, include such 
person's partners, associates, employers and employees, for a designated 
time period following publication of a determination that the protective 
order has been breached;
    (3) Denial of further access to proprietary or privileged 
information covered by the breached protective order or to proprietary 
information in future Commission proceedings;
    (4) An official reprimand by the Commission;

referral of the facts underlying the prohibited act to the ethics panel 
or other disciplinary body of the appropriate professional association 
or licensing authority;
    (6) When appropriate, referral of the facts underlying the violation 
to the United States Trade Representative or his or her designees, or to 
another government agency; and
    (7) Any other administrative sanctions as the Commission determines 
to be appropriate.
    (b) Each partner, associate, employer, and employee described in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section is entitled to all the administrative 
rights set forth in this subpart.
    (c) For the purposes of this subpart, the knowing receipt of 
information the receipt of which constitutes a violation of a protective 
order includes, but is not limited to, the reading or unauthorized 
dissemination of the information covered by a protective order by a 
person who knows or should reasonably believe that he or she is not 
authorized to read or disseminate such information.

Sec. 207.101  Reporting of prohibited act and commencement of 
          investigation.

    (a) Any person who has information indicating that a prohibited act 
has been committed shall immediately report all pertinent facts relating 
thereto to the Commission Secretary.
    (b) Upon receipt, the Commission Secretary shall record the 
information, assign an investigation number, and forward all information 
he or she received to the Office of Unfair Import Investigations.
    (c) As expeditiously as possible, the Office of Unfair Import 
Investigations shall conduct an inquiry to determine whether there is 
reasonable cause to believe that a person or persons have committed a 
prohibited act. At any time, the Office of Unfair Import Investigations 
may request that the Commission assign an administrative law judge to 
oversee the inquiry.
    (d) At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Office of Unfair Import 
Investigations shall assess whether the available information is 
sufficient to provide reasonable cause to believe that a person or 
persons have committed a prohibited act.

Sec. 207.102  Initiation of proceedings.

    (a) Upon completion of the inquiry,
    (1) If the Office of Unfair Import Investigations concludes that 
there is not reasonable cause to believe that a person or persons have 
committed a prohibited act, the Office of Unfair Import Investigations 
shall:
    (i) Submit a report to the Commission; and
    (ii) Unless the Commission directs otherwise, the file shall be 
closed and returned to the Commission Secretary.
    (2) If the Office of Unfair Import Investigations concludes that 
there is reasonable cause to believe that a person or persons have 
committed a prohibited act, the Office of Unfair Import Investigations 
shall:
    (i) Make a recommendation to the Commission regarding whether and to 
what extent it is appropriate to notify the person whose proprietary 
information may have been compromised; and

[[Page 98]]

(98
    (ii) Submit a report and recommendation to the Commission regarding 
whether to initiate sanctions proceedings or to take other appropriate 
action.
    (b) The Commission may make any appropriate determination regarding 
the initiation of sanctions proceedings, including rejecting, approving, 
or approving and amending any recommendation made by the Office of 
Unfair Import Investigations.
    (c) If the Commission determines that it is appropriate to issue a 
charging letter, the Commission shall appoint an administrative law 
judge to oversee the proceeding and the Commission Secretary shall 
initiate a proceeding under this subpart by issuing a charging letter as 
set forth in 19 CFR 207.103.
    (d) If the Commission determines that it is appropriate to initiate 
proceedings, but that the party to be charged is beyond the jurisdiction 
of the Commission and within the jurisdiction of another Free Trade Area 
country, or that for other reasons an authorized agency of another Free 
Trade Area country would be the more appropriate forum for initiation of 
a proceeding, the Commission shall take the necessary steps for issuance 
of a letter requesting the authorized agency of another Free Trade Area 
country to initiate proceedings under applicable law on the basis of an 
alleged prohibited act.
    (e) The Commission may make any determination regarding notification 
about the alleged prohibited act and the relevant underlying facts to 
the persons who submitted the proprietary information that allegedly has 
been disclosed. A determination by the Commission on this subject does 
not foreclose the administrative law judge from redetermining at any 
time during the hearing whether notification to the compromised party is 
appropriate.
    (f) If the Commission determines that it is not appropriate to issue 
a charging letter or to refer the facts to the authorized agency of 
another Free Trade Area country, the file shall be closed and returned 
to the Commission Secretary, unless the Commission directs otherwise.
    (g) All aspects of the inquiry shall remain confidential, except as 
deemed reasonably necessary to the Office of Unfair Import 
Investigations to gather relevant information and to protect the 
interests of the person who submitted the proprietary information, or 
except as otherwise ordered by the Commission. Except as the Commission 
may otherwise order, the Commission Secretary shall maintain all closed 
investigatory files in confidence to the extent permitted by law, and 
shall destroy any documentary evidence containing allegations of a 
prohibited act for which no proceeding is initiated one year after the 
file is closed.

Sec. 207.103  Charging letter.

    (a) Contents of charging letter. Each charged party shall be served 
by the Commission with a copy of a charging letter and any accompanying 
motion for interim measures, as provided for in 19 CFR 207.106. The

    (5) A statement that the charged party has a right to retain an 
attorney at the charged party's own expense for purposes of 
representation; and
    (6) A statement that the charged party has the right to request in 
the response described in Sec. 207.104 of this subpart that the 
proceedings remain confidential to the extent practicable.
    (b) Service of charging letter. (1) The charging letter shall be 
served in a double envelope. The inner envelope shall indicate that it 
is to be opened only by the addressee. Service of a charging letter 
shall be made by one of the following methods:

charged

[[Page 99]]

(99party at the party's last known permanent address; or
    (ii) Personal service; or

of Civil Procedure.
    (2) Service shall be evidenced by a certificate of service signed by 
the person making such service.

have been initiated, the investigative attorney may move for leave to 
amend or withdraw the charging letter.
    (2) If the administrative law judge determines that the charging 
letter should be amended to include additional parties, the judge shall 
issue a recommended determination to that effect. The Commission shall 
review the recommended determination, and issue a determination granting 
or denying the motion to amend the charging letter to include additional 
parties.
    (3) Upon motion, the administrative law judge may grant leave to 
amend the charging letter for good cause shown upon such conditions as 
are necessary to avoid prejudicing the public interest and the rights of 
the parties already charged.
    (4) Any amended charging letter shall be served upon all charged 
parties in the form and manner set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of 
this section.

Sec. 207.104  Response to charging letter.

by the charged party or its duly authorized officer, attorney, or agent, 
with the name, address, and telephone number of the same. Each charged 
party shall respond to each allegation in the charging letter, and may 
set forth a concise statement of the facts constituting each ground of 
defense. There shall be a specific admission or denial of each fact 
alleged in the charging letter, or if the charged party is without 
knowledge of any such fact, a statement to that effect.
    (c) Request for confidentiality. The response shall contain a 
statement as to whether the charged party seeks an order to maintain the 
confidentiality of all or part of the proceedings to the extent 
practicable, pursuant to Sec. 207.105 of this subpart.

Sec. 207.105  Confidentiality.

    (a) Protection of proprietary and privileged information. As the 
administrative law judge deems reasonably necessary for the preparation 
of the defense of a charged party, the attorney for the charged party 
may be granted access in these proceedings to proprietary information or 
to the privileged information, the disclosure of which is the subject of 
the proceedings. Any such access shall be under protective order 
consistent with the provisions of this subpart.
    (b) Confidentiality of proceedings. Upon the request of any charged 
party pursuant to Sec. 207.106 of this subpart, the administrative law 
judge will issue an appropriate confidentiality order. This order will 
provide for the confidentiality, to the extent practicable and permitted 
by law, of information relating to allegations concerning the commitment 
of a prohibited act, consistent with public policy considerations and 
the needs of the parties in conducting the sanctions proceedings. The 
order will provide that all proceedings under this provision shall be 
kept confidential within the terms of the order, except to the extent 
that a discussion of such proceedings is incorporated into a published 
final decision of the Commission. Any confidential information not 
disclosed in such decision will remain protected.

Sec. 207.106  Interim measures.

    (a) At any time after proceedings are initiated, the administrative 
law judge, upon motion, or on his or her own initiative, may issue a 
recommended determination to revoke the allegedly-violated protective 
order, to disclose

[[Page 100]]

(100information about the proceedings that would otherwise be kept 
confidential, or to take other appropriate interim measures.
    (b) Before issuing a determination recommending interim sanctions, 
the administrative law judge shall afford a party against whom such 
measures are proposed the opportunity to oppose them. The administrative 
law judge shall ordinarily decide any motion under this section no more 
than twenty (20) days after it is filed.
    (c) The Commission shall review any recommended determination 
regarding the imposition of interim measures within twenty (20) days 
from its issuance or such other time as it may order. The Commission may 
impose any appropriate interim sanctions.

that interim measures be modified or revoked. The Commission shall rule 
on such recommendation within ten (10) days after its issuance or such 
other time as it may order.
    (e) The Commission Secretary shall immediately notify the 
Secretariat of any interim measures that revoke or modify an outstanding 
protective order in an ongoing panel review. The Commission Secretary 
shall also immediately notify the Secretariat of any revocation or 
modification of an interim measure.

Sec. 207.107  Motions.

    (a) Presentation and disposition. (1) After issuance of the charging 
letter and while part of the proceeding is pending before the 
administrative law judge, all motions relating to that part of the 
proceeding shall be addressed to the administrative law judge.
    (2) While part of a proceeding is pending before the Commission, all

permitted by the administrative law judge or the Commission.
    (d) Service. All motions, responses, replies, briefs, petitions, and 
other documents filed in sanctions proceedings under this subpart shall 
be served by the party filing the document upon each other party. 
Service shall be made upon the attorney for the party unless the 
administrative law judge or the Commission orders otherwise.

Sec. 207.108  Preliminary conference.

    As soon as practicable after the response to the charging letter is 
filed, the administrative law judge shall direct counsel or other 
representatives for the parties to meet with him or her at a preliminary 
conference, unless the administrative law judge determines that such a 
conference is not necessary. At the conference, the administrative law 
judge shall consider the issuance of such orders as the administrative 
law judge deems necessary for the conduct of the proceedings. Such 
orders may include, as appropriate under these regulations, the 
establishment of a discovery schedule or the issuance of an order, if 
requested, to provide for maintaining the confidentiality of the 
proceedings pursuant to Sec. 207.105(b) of this subpart.

Subpart A--Rules of General Applicability

Sec. 210.1  Applicability of part.

    The rules in this part apply to investigations under section 337 of 
the Tariff Act of 1930 and related proceedings. These rules are

U.S.C. Secs. 1333, 1335, and 1337) and sections 2 and 1342(d)(1)(B) of 
the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-418, 
102 Stat. 1107 (1988).

Sec. 210.2  General policy.

    It is the policy of the Commission that, to the extent practicable 
and consistent with requirements of law, all investigations and related 
proceedings under this part shall be conducted expeditiously. The 
parties, their attorneys or other representatives, and the presiding 
administrative law judge shall make every effort at each stage of the 
investigation or related proceeding to avoid delay.

Sec. 210.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part--
    Administrative law judge means the person appointed under section 
3105 of title 5 of the United States Code who presides over the taking

orders or a section of this part so provides, an administrative law 
judge also may preside over stages of a related proceeding under this 
part.
    Commission investigative attorney means a Commission attorney 
designated to engage in investigatory activities in an investigation or

proceeding under this part.
    Investigation means a formal Commission inquiry instituted to 
determine whether there is a violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act 
of 1930. An investigation is instituted upon publication of a notice in

complaint and notice of investigation; a motion for temporary relief; a 
motion to designate ``more complicated'' the temporary relief stage of 
the investigation; an interlocutory appeal of an administrative law 
judge's decision on a particular matter; a motion for sanctions for 
abuse of process, abuse of discovery, or failure to make or cooperate in 
discovery, which if granted, would have an impact on the adjudication of 
the merits of the complaint; a petition for reconsideration of a final 
Commission determination; a motion for termination of the investigation 
in whole or part; and procedures undertaken in response to a judgment or 
judicial order issued in an appeal of a Commission determination or

[[Page 107]]

(107remedial order issued under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930.
    Party means each complainant, respondent, intervenor, or Commission 
investigative attorney.
    Proposed intervenor means any person who has filed a motion to 
intervene in an investigation or a related proceeding under this part.
    Proposed respondent means any person named in a complaint filed 
under this part as allegedly violating section 337 of the Tariff Act of 
1930.
    Related proceeding means preinstitution proceedings, sanction 
proceedings (for the possible issuance of sanctions that would not have 
a bearing on the adjudication of the merits of a complaint or a motion 
under this part), bond forfeiture proceedings, proceedings to enforce, 
modify, or revoke a remedial or consent order, or advisory opinion 
proceedings.
    Respondent means any person named in a notice of investigation 
issued under this part as allegedly violating section 337 of the Tariff 
Act of 1930.

[59 FR 39039, Aug. 1, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 67626, Dec. 30, 1994]

Sec. 210.4  Written submissions; representations; sanctions.

    (a) Caption; names of parties. The front page of every written 
submission filed by a party or a proposed party to an investigation or a 
related proceeding under this part shall contain a caption setting forth 
the name of the Commission, the title of the investigation or related 
proceeding, the docket number or investigation number, if any, assigned 
to the investigation or related proceeding, and in the case of a 
complaint, the names of the complainant and all proposed respondents.
    (b) Signature. Every pleading, written motion, and other paper of a 
party or proposed party who is represented by an attorney in an 
investigation or a related proceeding under this part shall be signed by 
at least one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name. A 
party or proposed party who is not represented by an attorney shall 
sign, or his duly authorized officer or agent shall sign, the pleading, 
written motion, or other paper. Each paper shall state the signer's 
address and telephone number, if any. Pleadings, written motions, and 
other papers need not be under oath or accompanied by an affidavit, 
except as provided in Secs. 210.12(a)(1), 210.13(b), 210.18, 210.52(d), 
210.59(b), or another section of this part or by order of the 
administrative law judge or the Commission. If a pleading, motion, or 
other paper is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is signed 
promptly after omission of the signature is called to the attention of 
the submitter.
    (c) Representations. By presenting to the presiding administrative 
law judge or the Commission (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or 
later advocating) a pleading, written motion, or other paper, an 
attorney or unrepresented party or proposed party is certifying that to 
the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed 
after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances--
    (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to 
harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of 
the investigation or related proceeding;
    (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are 
warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the 
extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the 
establishment of new law;
    (3) the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary 
support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have 
evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further 
investigation or discovery; and
    (4) the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence 
or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on a lack of 
information or belief.
    (d) Sanctions. If, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to 
respond (see paragraphs (d)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section and 
Sec. 210.25), the presiding administrative law judge or the Commission 
determines that paragraph (c) of this section has been violated, the 
administrative law judge or the Commission may, subject to the 
conditions stated below and in Sec. 210.25, impose an appropriate 
sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that have violated 
paragraph (c) or are responsible for the violation. A representation 
need not be

[[Page 108]]

(108frivolous in its entirety in order for the administrative law judge 
or the Commission to determine that paragraph (c) has been violated. If 
any portion of a representation is found to be false, frivolous, 
misleading, or otherwise in violation of paragraph (c), a sanction may 
be imposed. In determining whether paragraph (c) has been violated, the 
administrative law judge or the Commission will consider whether the 
representation or disputed portion thereof was objectively reasonable 
under the circumstances.
    (1) How initiated--(i) By motion. A motion for sanctions under this 
section shall be made separately from other motions or requests and 
shall describe the specific conduct alleged to violate paragraph (c). It 
shall be served as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, but shall 
not be filed with or presented to the presiding administrative law judge 
or the Commission unless, within seven days after service of the motion 
(or such other period as the administrative law judge or the Commission 
may prescribe), the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, 
allegation, or denial is not withdrawn or appropriately corrected. See 
also Sec. 210.25 (a) through (c). If warranted, the administrative law 
judge or the Commission may award to the party or proposed party 
prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees 
incurred in presenting or opposing the motion. Absent exceptional 
circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for 
violations committed by its partners, associates, and employees.
    (ii) On the administrative law judge's or the Commission's 
initiative. The administrative law judge or the Commission may enter an 
order sua sponte describing the specific conduct that appears to violate 
paragraph (c) of this section and directing an attorney, law firm, 
party, or proposed party to show cause why it has not violated paragraph 
(c) with respect thereto.
    (2) Nature of sanctions; limitations. A sanction imposed for 
violation of paragraph (c) of this section shall be limited to what is 
sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by 
others similarly situated. Subject to the limitations in paragraphs 
(d)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section, the sanction may consist of, or 
include, directives of a nonmonetary nature, an order to pay a penalty, 
or, if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence, an 
order directing payment to the movant of some or all of the reasonable 
attorney's fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the 
violation.
    (i) Monetary sanctions shall not be imposed under this section 
against the United States, the Commission, or a Commission investigative 
attorney.
    (ii) Monetary sanctions may not be awarded against a represented 
party or proposed party for a violation of paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (iii) Monetary sanctions may not be imposed on the administrative 
law judge's or the Commission's initiative unless--
    (A) The Commission or the administrative law judge issues an order 
to show cause before the investigation or related proceeding is 
terminated, in whole or in relevant part, as to the party or proposed 
party which is, or whose attorneys are, to be sanctioned; and
    (B) such termination is the result of--
    (1) A motion to withdraw the complaint, motion, or petition that was 
the basis for the investigation or related proceeding;
    (2) A settlement agreement;
    (3) A consent order agreement; or
    (4) An arbitration agreement.
    (iv) Monetary sanctions imposed to compensate the Commission for 
expenses incurred by a Commission investigative attorney or the 
Commission's Office of Unfair Import Investigations will include 
reimbursement for some or all costs reasonably incurred as a direct 
result of the violation, but will not include attorney's fees.
    (3) Order. When imposing sanctions, the administrative law judge or 
the Commission shall describe the conduct determined to constitute a 
violation of this rule and explain the basis for the sanction imposed. 
See also Sec. 210.25(d)--(f).
    (e) Inapplicability to discovery. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section do not apply to discovery requests, responses,

[[Page 109]]

(109objections, and motions that are subject to provisions of 
Secs. 210.27 through 210.34.
    (f) Specifications; filing of documents. (1) (i) Written submissions 
that are addressed to the Commission during an investigation or a 
related proceeding shall comply with Sec. 201.8 of this chapter, except 
for the provisions regarding the number of copies to be submitted. The 
required number of copies shall be governed by paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section. Written submissions may be produced by standard typographic 
printing or by a duplicating or copying process which produces a clear 
black image on white paper. If the submission is produced by other than 
the standard typographical process used by commercial printers, typed 
matter shall not exceed 6\1/2\ by 9\1/2\ inches using 10-pitch (pica) or 
larger pitch type or 5\1/2\ by 8\1/2\ inches using 11-point or larger 
proportional spacing type, and shall be double-spaced between each line 
of text using the standard of 6 lines of type per inch. Text and 
footnotes shall be in the same size type. Quotations more than two lines 
long in the text or footnotes may be indented and single-spaced. 
Headings and footnotes may be single-spaced.
    (ii) The administrative law judge may impose any specifications he 
deems appropriate for submissions that are addressed to the 
administrative law judge.
    (2) Unless the Commission or another section of this part 
specifically states otherwise, the original and 6 true copies of each 
submission shall be filed if the investigation or related proceeding is 
before an administrative law judge, and the original and 14 true copies 
of each submission shall be filed if the investigation or related 
proceeding is before the Commission.
    (3)(i) If a complaint, a supplement to a complaint, a motion for 
temporary relief, or the documentation supporting a motion for temporary 
relief contains confidential business information as defined in 
Sec. 201.6(a) of this chapter, the complainant shall file 
nonconfidential copies of the complaint, the supplement to the 
complaint, the motion for temporary relief, or the documentation 
supporting the motion for temporary relief concurrently with the 
requisite confidential copies, as provided in Sec. 210.8(a) of this 
part.
    (ii) Persons who file the following submissions that contain 
confidential business information covered by an administrative 
protective order, or that are the subject of a request for confidential 
treatment, must file nonconfidential copies and serve them on the other 
parties to the investigation or related proceeding within 10 calendar 
days after filing the confidential version with the Commission:
    (A) A response to a complaint and all supplements and exhibits 
thereto;
    (B) All submissions relating to a motion to amend the complaint or 
notice of investigation; and
    (C) All submissions addressed to the Commission.
Other sections of this part may require, or the Commission or the 
administrative law judge may order, the filing and service of 
nonconfidential copies of other kinds of confidential submissions. If 
the submitter's ability to prepare a nonconfidential copy is dependent 
upon receipt of the nonconfidential version of an initial determination, 
or a Commission order or opinion, or a ruling by the administrative law 
judge or the Commission as to whether some or all of the information at 
issue is entitled to confidential treatment, the nonconfidential copies 
of the submission must be filed within 10 calendar days after service of 
the Commission or administrative law judge document in question. The 
time periods for filing specified in this paragraph apply unless the 
Commission, the administrative law judge, or another section of this 
part specifically provides otherwise.
    (g) Service. Unless the Commission, the administrative law judge, or 
another section of this part specifically provides otherwise, every 
written submission filed by a party or proposed party shall be served on 
all other parties in the manner specified in Sec. 201.16(b) of this 
chapter.

this part.
    (b) Restrictions on disclosure. Information submitted to the 
Commission or exchanged among the parties in connection with an

the following persons without the consent of the submitter:
    (1) Persons who are granted access to confidential information under 
Sec. 210.39(a) or a protective order issued pursuant to Sec. 210.34(a);
    (2) An officer or employee of the Commission who is directly 
concerned with--
    (i) Carrying out or maintaining the records of the investigation or 
related proceeding for which the information was submitted;
    (ii) The administration of a bond posted pursuant to subsection (e), 
(f), or (j) of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930;

    (4) An officer or employee of the United States Customs Service who 
is directly involved in administering an exclusion from entry under

a civil action, subject to such protective order as the district court 
determines necessary, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1659.
    (d) Confidentiality determinations in preinstitution proceedings. 
After a complaint is filed under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 
and before an investigation is instituted by the Commission, 
confidential business information designated confidential by the 
supplier shall be submitted in accordance with Sec. 201.6(b) of this 
chapter. The Secretary shall decide, in accordance with Sec. 201.6(d) of 
this chapter, whether the information is entitled to confidential 
treatment. Appeals from the ruling of the Secretary shall be made to the 
Commission as set forth in Sec. 201.6(e) and (f) of this chapter.
    (e) Confidentiality determinations in investigations and other 
related proceedings. (1) If an investigation is instituted or if a 
related proceeding is assigned to an administrative law judge, the 
administrative law judge shall set the ground rules for the designation, 
submission, and handling of information designated confidential by the 
submitter. When requested to do so, the administrative law judge shall 
decide whether information in a document addressed to the administrative 
law judge, or to be exchanged among the parties while the administrative 
law judge is presiding, is entitled to confidential treatment. The 
administrative law judge shall also decide, with respect to all orders, 
initial determinations, or other documents issued by the administrative 
law judge, whether information designated confidential by the supplier 
is entitled to confidential

accordance with Sec. 201.6(d) of this chapter, whether the information 
is entitled to confidential treatment. Appeals from the ruling of the 
Secretary shall be made to the Commission as provided in Sec. 201.6(e)

all orders, notices, opinions, and other documents issued by or on 
behalf of the Commission, whether information designated confidential by 
the supplier is entitled to confidential treatment.

          continuances, and extensions of time.

section of this part specifically provides otherwise, the computation of 
time and the granting of additional hearings, postponements, 
continuances, and extensions of time shall be in accordance with 
Secs. 201.14 and 201.16(d) of this chapter. Whenever a party has the 
right or is required to perform some act or to take some action within a 
prescribed period after service of a document upon it, and the document 
was served by mail, the deadline shall be computed by adding to the end 
of the prescribed period the additional time allotted under 
Sec. 201.16(d), unless the Commission, the administrative law judge, or 
another section of this part specifically provides otherwise.

Sec. 210.7  Service of process and other documents; publication of 
          notices.

issued by or on behalf of the Commission or the administrative law 
judge--and the service of all documents issued by parties under 
Secs. 210.27 through 210.34 of this part--shall be in accordance with 
Sec. 201.16 of this chapter, unless the Commission, the administrative 
law judge, or another section of this part specifically provides 
otherwise.

or an administrative law judge will be published in the Federal Register 
only as specifically provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, by 
another section in this chapter, or by order of an administrative law 
judge or the Commission.

nonconfidential copy for the government of the foreign country of the 
proposed respondent. The additional copies of the complaint and motion 
for temporary relief for each proposed respondent and the appropriate 
foreign government are to be provided notwithstanding the procedures 
applicable to a motion for temporary relief, which require service of 
the complaint and motion for temporary relief by the complainant.
    (b) Upon the initiative of the Commission. The Commission may upon 
its initiative commence a preinstitution proceeding based upon any 
alleged violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930.

Sec. 210.9  Action of Commission upon receipt of complaint.

    Upon receipt of a complaint alleging violation of section 337 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930, the Commission shall take the following actions:
    (a) Examination of complaint. The Commission shall examine the 
complaint for sufficiency and compliance with the applicable sections of 
this chapter.
    (b) Informal investigatory activity. The Commission shall identify 
sources of relevant information, assure itself of the availability 
thereof, and, if deemed necessary, prepare subpoenas therefore, and give 
attention to other preliminary matters.

Sec. 210.10  Institution of investigation.

    (a)(1) The Commission shall determine whether the complaint is 
properly filed and whether an investigation should be instituted on the 
basis of the complaint. That determination shall be made within 30 days 
after the complaint is filed, unless--
    (i) Exceptional circumstances preclude adherence to a 30-day 
deadline;
    (ii) Additional time is allotted under other sections of this part 
in connection with the preinstitution processing of a motion by the 
complainant for temporary relief;
    (iii) The complainant requests that the Commission postpone the 
determination on whether to institute an investigation; or
    (iv) The complainant withdraws the complaint.
    (2) If exceptional circumstances preclude Commission adherence to 
the 30-day deadline for determining whether to institute an 
investigation on the basis of the complaint, the determination will be 
made as soon after that deadline as possible.
    (3) If additional time is allotted in connection with the 
preinstitution processing of a motion by the complainant for temporary 
relief, the Commission will determine whether to institute an 
investigation and provisionally accept the motion within 35 days after 
the filing of the complaint or by a subsequent deadline computed in 
accordance with Sec. 210.53(a), Sec. 210.54, Sec. 210.55(b), 
Sec. 210.57, or Sec. 210.58 as applicable.
    (4) If the complainant desires to have the Commission postpone 
making a determination on whether to institute an investigation in 
response to the complaint, the complainant must file a written request 
with the Secretary. If the request is granted, the determination will be 
rescheduled for whatever date is appropriate in light of the facts.
    (5)(i) The complainant may withdraw the complaint as a matter of 
right at any time before the Commission votes on whether to institute an 
investigation. To effect such withdrawal, the complainant must file a 
written notice with the Commission. If the complaint is being withdrawn 
pursuant to a settlement agreement, a copy of the agreement must be 
filed with the Commission along with the notice of withdrawal. If the 
agreement contains confidential business information within the meaning 
of Sec. 201.6(a) of this chapter, at least one copy of the agreement 
with such information deleted shall accompany the motion, in addition to 
a copy of the confidential version.
    (ii) If a motion for temporary relief was filed in addition to the 
complaint, the motion must be withdrawn along

[[Page 113]]

(113with the complaint, and the complainant must serve copies of the 
notice of withdrawal on all proposed respondents and on the embassies 
that were served with copies of the complaint and motion pursuant to 
Sec. 210.54.
    (b) An investigation shall be instituted by the publication of a 
notice in the Federal Register. The notice will define the scope of the 
investigation and may be amended as provided in Sec. 210.14 (b) and (c).
    (c) If the Commission determines not to institute an investigation 
on the basis of the complaint, the complaint shall be dismissed, and the 
complainant and all proposed respondents will receive written notice of 
the Commission's action and the reason(s) therefor.

Sec. 210.11  Service of complaint and notice of investigation.

    (a)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 210.54 requiring 
service of the complaint by the complainant, the Commission, upon 
institution of an investigation, shall serve copies of the complaint and 
the notice of investigation (and any accompanying motion for temporary 
relief) upon each respondent and the embassy in Washington, DC of the 
government of each foreign country represented by each respondent. All 
respondents named after an investigation has been instituted and the 
governments of the foreign countries they represent shall be served as 
soon as possible after the respondents are named.
    (2) The Commission shall serve copies of the notice of investigation 
upon the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. 
Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Customs 
Service, and such other agencies and departments as the Commission 
considers appropriate.
    (b) With leave from the presiding administrative law judge, a party 
may attempt to effect personal service of the complaint and notice of 
investigation upon a respondent, if the Secretary's efforts to serve the 
respondent by certified mail have been unsuccessful. If the party 
succeeds in serving the respondent by personal service, the party must 
notify the administrative law judge and file proof of such service with 
the Secretary.

Sec. 210.13  The response.

    (a) Time for response. Except as provided in Sec. 210.59(a) and 
unless otherwise ordered in the notice of investigation or by the 
administrative law judge, respondents shall have 20 days from the date 
of service of the complaint and notice of investigation, by the 
Commission under Sec. 210.11(a) or by a party under Sec. 210.11(b), 
within which to file a written response to the complaint and the notice 
of investigation. When the investigation involves a motion for temporary 
relief and has not been declared ``more complicated,'' the response to 
the complaint and notice of investigation must be filed along with the 
response to the motion for temporary relief--i.e., within 10 days after 
service of the complaint, notice of investigation, and the motion for 
temporary relief by the Commission under Sec. 210.11(a) or by a party 
under Sec. 210.11(b). (See Sec. 210.59.)
    (b) Content of the response. In addition to conforming to the 
requirements of Sec. 201.8 of this chapter and Secs. 210.4 and 210.5 of 
this part, each response shall be under oath and signed by respondent or 
his duly authorized officer, attorney, or agent with the name, address, 
and telephone number of the respondent and any such officer, attorney, 
or agent given on the first page of the response. Each respondent shall 
respond to each allegation in the complaint and in the notice of 
investigation, and shall set forth a concise statement of the facts 
constituting each ground of defense. There shall be a specific 
admission, denial, or explanation of each fact alleged in the complaint 
and notice, or if the respondent is without knowledge of any such fact, 
a statement to that effect. Allegations of a complaint and notice not 
thus answered may be deemed to have been admitted. Each response shall 
include, when available, statistical data on the quantity and value of 
imports of the involved article. Respondents who are importers must also 
provide the Harmonized Tariff Schedule item number(s) for importations 
of the accused imports occurring on or after January 1, 1989, and the 
Tariff Schedules of the United States item number(s) for importations 
occurring before January 1, 1989. Each response shall also include a 
statement concerning the respondent's capacity to produce the subject 
article and the relative significance of the United States market to its 
operations. Respondents who are not manufacturing their accused imports 
shall state the name and address of the supplier(s) of those imports. 
Affirmative defenses shall be pleaded with as much specificity as 
possible in the response. When the alleged unfair methods of competition 
and unfair acts are based upon the claims of a valid U.S. letters 
patent, the respondent is encouraged to make the following showing when 
appropriate:
    (1) If it is asserted in defense that the article imported or sold 
by respondents is not covered by, or produced under a process covered 
by, the claims of each involved U.S. letters patent, a showing of such 
noncoverage for each involved claim in each U.S. letters patent in 
question shall be made, which showing may be made by appropriate 
allegations and, when practicable, by a chart that applies the involved 
claims of each U.S. letters patent in question to a representative 
involved imported article of the respondent or to the process under 
which such article was produced;
    (2) Drawings, photographs, or other visual representations of the 
involved imported article of respondent or the process utilized in 
producing such article, and, when a chart is furnished under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, the parts of such drawings, photographs, or 
other visual representations, should be labeled so that they can be read 
in conjunction with such chart; and
    (3) If the claims of any involved U.S. letters patent are asserted 
to be invalid

[[Page 117]]

(117or unenforceable, the basis for such assertion, including, when 
prior art is relied on, a showing of how the prior art renders each 
claim invalid or unenforceable and a copy of such prior art. For good 
cause, the presiding administrative law judge may waive any of the 
substantive requirements imposed under this paragraph or may impose 
additional requirements.
    (c) Submission of article as exhibit. At the time the response is 
filed, if practicable, the respondent shall submit the accused article 
imported or sold by that respondent, unless the article has already been 
submitted by the complainant.

Sec. 210.14  Amendments to pleadings and notice; supplemental 
          submissions; counterclaims.

    (a) Preinstitution amendments. The complaint may be amended at any 
time prior to the institution of the investigation.
    (b) Postinstitution amendments generally. (1) After an investigation 
has been instituted, the complaint or notice of investigation may be 
amended only by leave of the Commission for good cause shown and upon 
such conditions as are necessary to avoid prejudicing the public 
interest and the rights of the parties to the investigation. A motion 
for amendment must be made to the presiding administrative law judge. If 
the proposed amendment of the complaint would require amending the 
notice of investigation, the presiding administrative law judge may 
grant the motion only by filing with the Commission an initial 
determination. All other dispositions of such motions shall be by order.
    (2) If disposition of the issues in an investigation on the merits 
will be facilitated, or for other good cause shown, the presiding 
administrative law judge may allow appropriate amendments to pleadings 
other than complaints upon such conditions as are necessary to avoid 
prejudicing the public interest and the rights of the parties to the 
investigation.
    (c) Postinstitution amendments to conform to evidence. When issues 
not raised by the pleadings or notice of investigation, but reasonably 
within the scope of the pleadings and notice, are considered during the 
taking of evidence by express or implied consent of the parties, they 
shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the 
pleadings and notice. Such amendments of the pleadings and notice as may 
be necessary to make them conform to the evidence and to raise such 
issues shall be allowed at any time, and shall be effective with respect 
to all parties who have expressly or impliedly consented.
    (d) Supplemental submissions. The administrative law judge may, upon 
reasonable notice and on such terms as are just, permit service of a 
supplemental submission setting forth transactions, occurrences, or 
events that have taken place since the date of the submission sought to 
be supplemented and that are relevant to any of the issues involved.
    (e) Counterclaims. At any time after institution of the 
investigation, but not later than ten business days before the 
commencement of the evidentiary hearing, a respondent may file a 
counterclaim at the Commission in accordance with section 337(c) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930. Counterclaims shall be filed in a separate document. 
A respondent who files such a counterclaim shall immediately file a 
notice of removal with a United States district court in which venue for 
any of the counterclaims raised by the respondent would exist under 28 
U.S.C. 1391.

Subpart D--Motions

Sec. 210.15  Motions.

    (a) Presentation and disposition. (1) During the period between the 
institution of an investigation and the assignment of the investigation 
to a presiding administrative law judge, all motions shall be addressed 
to the chief administrative law judge. During the time that an 
investigation or related proceeding is before an administrative law 
judge, all motions therein shall be addressed to the administrative law 
judge.
    (2) When an investigation or related proceeding is before the 
Commission, all motions shall be addressed to the Chairman of the 
Commission. A motion

[[Page 118]]

(118to amend the complaint and notice of investigation to name an 
additional respondent after institution shall be served on the proposed 
respondent. All motions shall be filed with the Secretary and shall be 
served upon each party.
    (b) Content. All written motions shall state the particular order, 
ruling, or action desired and the grounds therefor.
    (c) Responses to motions. Within 10 days after service of any 
written motions, or within such longer or shorter time as may be 
designated by the administrative law judge or the Commission, a 
nonmoving party, or in the instance of a motion to amend the complaint 
or notice of investigation to name an additional respondent after 
institution, the proposed respondent, shall respond or he may be deemed 
to have consented to the granting of the relief asked for in the motion. 
The moving party shall have no right to reply, except as permitted by 
the administrative law judge or the Commission.
    (d) Motions for extensions. As a matter of discretion, the 
administrative law judge or the Commission may waive the requirements of 
this section as to motions for extension of time, and may rule upon such 
motions ex parte.

Sec. 210.16  Default.

    (a) Definition of default. (1) A party shall be found in default if 
it fails to respond to the complaint and notice of investigation in the 
manner prescribed in Sec. 210.13 or Sec. 210.59(c), or otherwise fails 
to answer the complaint and notice, and fails to show cause why it 
should not be found in default.
    (2) A party may be found in default as a sanction for abuse of 
process, under Sec. 210.4(c), or failure to make or cooperate in 
discovery, under Sec. 210.33(b).
    (b) Procedure for determining default. (1) If a respondent has 
failed to respond or appear in the manner described in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, a party may file a motion for, or the administrative 
law judge may issue upon his own initiative, an order directing that 
respondent to show cause why it should not be found in default. If the 
respondent fails to make the necessary showing, the administrative law 
judge shall issue an initial determination finding the respondent in 
default. An administrative law judge's decision denying a motion for a 
finding of default under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be in 
the form of an order.
    (2) Any party may file a motion for issuance of, or the 
administrative law judge may issue on his own initiative, an initial 
determination finding a party in default for abuse of process under 
Sec. 210.4(c) or failure to make or cooperate in discovery. A motion for 
a finding of default as a sanction for abuse of process or failure to 
make or cooperate in discovery shall be granted by initial determination 
or denied by order.
    (3) A party found in default shall be deemed to have waived its 
right to appear, to be served with documents, and to contest the 
allegations at issue in the investigation.
    (c) Relief against a respondent in default. (1) After a respondent 
has been found in default by the Commission, the complainant may file 
with the Commission a declaration that it is seeking immediate entry of 
relief against the respondent in default. The facts alleged in the 
complaint will be presumed to be true with respect to the defaulting 
respondent. The Commission may issue an exclusion order, a cease and 
desist order, or both, affecting the defaulting respondent only after 
considering the effect of such order(s) upon the public health and 
welfare, competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, the production of 
like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and U.S. 
consumers, and concluding that the order(s) should still be issued in 
light of the aforementioned public interest factors.
    (2) In any motion requesting the entry of default or the termination 
of the investigation with respect to the last remaining respondent in 
the investigation, the complainant shall declare whether it is seeking a 
general exclusion order. The Commission may issue a general exclusion 
order pursuant to section 337(g)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, 
regardless of the source or importer of the articles concerned, provided 
that a violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is established 
by

[[Page 119]]

(119substantial, reliable, and probative evidence, and only after 
considering the aforementioned public interest factors and the 
requirements of Sec. 210.50(c).

Sec. 210.17  Failures to act other than the statutory forms of default.

    Failures to act other than the defaults listed in Sec. 210.16 may 
provide a basis for the presiding administrative law judge or the 
Commission to draw adverse inferences and to issue findings of fact, 
conclusions of law, determinations (including a determination on 
violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930), and orders that are 
adverse to the party who fails to act. Such failures include, but are 
not limited to:
    (a) Failure to respond to a motion that materially alters the scope 
of the investigation or a related proceeding;
    (b) Failure to respond to a motion for temporary relief pursuant to 
Sec. 210.59;
    (c) Failure to respond to a motion for summary determination under 
Sec. 210.18;
    (d) Failure to appear at a hearing before the administrative law 
judge after filing a written response to the complaint or motion for 
temporary relief, or failure to appear at a hearing before the 
Commission;
    (e) Failure to file a brief or other written submission requested by 
the administrative law judge or the Commission during an investigation 
or a related proceeding;
    (f) Failure to respond to a petition for review of an initial 
determination, a petition for reconsideration of an initial 
determination, or an application for interlocutory review of an 
administrative law judge's order;
    (g) Failure to file a brief or other written submission requested by 
the administrative law judge or the Commission; and
    (h) Failure to participate in temporary relief bond forfeiture 
proceedings under Sec. 210.70.

The presiding administrative law judge or the Commission may take action 
under this rule sua sponte or in response to the motion of a party.

Sec. 210.18  Summary determinations.

    (a) Motions for summary determinations. Any party may move with any 
necessary supporting affidavits for a summary determination in his favor 
upon all or any part of the issues to be determined in the 
investigation. Counsel or other representatives in support of the 
complaint may so move at any time after 20 days following the date of 
service of the complaint and notice instituting the investigation. Any 
other party or a respondent may so move at any time after the date of 
publication of the notice of investigation in the Federal Register. Any 
such motion by any party in connection with the issue of permanent 
relief, however, must be filed at least 30 days before the date fixed 
for any hearing provided for in Sec. 210.36(a)(1). Any motion for 
summary determination filed in connection with the temporary relief 
phase of an investigation must be filed on or before the deadline set by 
the presiding administrative law judge.
    (b) Opposing affidavits; oral argument; time and basis for 
determination. Any nonmoving party may file opposing affidavits within 
10 days after service of the motion for summary determination. The 
administrative law judge may, in his discretion or at the request of any 
party, set the matter for oral argument and call for the submission of 
briefs or memoranda. The determination sought by the moving party shall 
be rendered if pleadings and any depositions, answers to 
interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, 
if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and 
that the moving party is entitled to a summary determination as a matter 
of law.
    (c) Affidavits. Supporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on 
personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in 
evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to 
testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all 
papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached 
thereto or served therewith. The administrative law judge

[[Page 120]]

(120may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, 
answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits. When a motion for 
summary determination is made and supported as provided in this section, 
a party opposing the motion may not rest upon the mere allegations or 
denials of the opposing party's pleading, but the opposing party's 
response, by affidavits, answers to interrogatories, or as otherwise 
provided in this section, must set forth specific facts showing that 
there is a genuine issue of fact for the evidentiary hearing under 
Sec. 210.36(a)(1) or (2). If the opposing party does not so respond, a 
summary determination, if appropriate, shall be rendered against the 
opposing party.
    (d) Refusal of application for summary determination; continuances 
and other orders. Should it appear from the affidavits of a party 
opposing the motion that the party cannot, for reasons stated, present 
by affidavit facts essential to justify the party's opposition, the 
administrative law judge may refuse the application for summary 
determination, or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be 
obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make 
such other order as is appropriate, and a ruling to that effect shall be 
made a matter of record.
    (e) Order establishing facts. If on motion under this section a 
summary determination is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the 
relief asked and a hearing is necessary, the administrative law judge, 
by examining the pleadings and the evidence and by interrogating counsel 
if necessary, shall if practicable ascertain what material facts exist 
without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and 
in good faith controverted. The administrative law judge shall thereupon 
make an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial 
controversy and directing such further proceedings in the investigation 
as are warranted. The facts so specified shall be deemed established.
    (f) Order of summary determination. An order of summary 
determination shall constitute an initial determination of the 
administrative law judge.

Sec. 210.19  Intervention.

    Any person desiring to intervene in an investigation or a related 
proceeding under this part shall make a written motion. The motion shall 
have attached to it a certificate showing that the motion has been 
served upon each party to the investigation or related proceeding in the 
manner described in Sec. 201.16(b) of this chapter. Any party may file a 
response to the motion in accordance with Sec. 210.15(c) of this part, 
provided that the response is accompanied by a certificate confirming 
that the response was served on the proposed intervenor and all other 
parties. The Commission, or the administrative law judge by initial 
determination, may grant the motion to the extent and upon such terms as 
may be proper under the circumstances.

Sec. 210.20  Declassification of confidential information.

    (a) Any party may move to declassify documents (or portions thereof) 
that have been designated confidential by the submitter but that do not 
satisfy the confidentiality criteria set forth in Sec. 201.6(a) of this 
chapter. All such motions, whether brought at any time during the 
investigation or after conclusion of the investigation shall be 
addressed to and ruled upon by the presiding administrative law judge, 
or if the investigation is not before a presiding administrative law 
judge, by the chief administrative law judge or such administrative law 
judge as he may designate.
    (b) Following issuance of a public version of the initial 
determination on whether there is a violation of section 337 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 or an initial determination that would otherwise 
terminate the investigation (if adopted by the Commission), the granting 
of a motion, in whole or part, to declassify information designated 
confidential shall constitute an initial determination, except as to 
that information for which no submissions in opposition to 
declassification have been filed.

Sec. 210.21  Termination of investigations.

    (a) Motions for termination. (1) Any party may move at any time 
prior to the issuance of an initial determination on violation of 
section 337 of the

[[Page 121]]

(121Tariff Act of 1930 for an order to terminate an investigation in 
whole or in part as to any or all respondents, on the basis of 
withdrawal of the complaint or certain allegations contained therein, or 
for good cause other than the grounds listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section. The presiding administrative law judge may grant the motion in 
an initial determination upon such terms and conditions as he deems 
proper.
    (2) Any party may move at any time for an order to terminate an 
investigation in whole or in part as to any or all respondents on the 
basis of a settlement, a licensing or other agreement, including an 
agreement to present the matter for arbitration, or a consent order, as 
provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section.
    (b) Termination by Settlement. (1) An investigation before the 
Commission may be terminated as to one or more respondents pursuant to 
section 337(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 on the basis of a licensing or 
other settlement agreement. A motion for termination by settlement shall 
contain copies of the licensing or other settlement agreement, any 
supplemental agreements, and a statement that there are no other 
agreements, written or oral, express or implied between the parties 
concerning the subject matter of the investigation. If the licensing or 
other settlement agreement contains confidential business information 
within the meaning of Sec. 201.6(a) of this chapter, a copy of the 
agreement with such information deleted shall accompany the motion.
    (2) The motion and agreement(s) shall be certified by the 
administrative law judge to the Commission with an initial determination 
if the motion for termination is granted. If the licensing or other 
agreement or the initial determination contains confidential business 
information, copies of the agreement and initial determination with 
confidential business information deleted shall be certified to the 
Commission simultaneously with the confidential versions of such 
documents. Notice of the initial determination and the agreement shall 
be provided to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the 
U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. 
Customs Service, and such other departments and agencies as the 
Commission deems appropriate. If the Commission's final disposition of 
the initial determination results in termination of the investigation in 
its entirety, a notice will be published in the Federal Register. An 
order of termination by settlement need not constitute a determination 
as to violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930.
    (c) Termination by entry of consent order. An investigation before 
the Commission may be terminated pursuant to section 337(c) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 on the basis of a consent order. An order of 
termination by consent order need not constitute a determination as to 
violation of section 337.
    (1) Opportunity to submit proposed consent order--(i) Prior to 
institution of an investigation. Where time, the nature of the 
proceeding, and the public interest permit, any person being 
investigated pursuant to section 603 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 
Sec. 2482) shall be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Commission 
a proposal for disposition of the matter under investigation in the form 
of a consent order stipulation that incorporates a proposed consent 
order executed by or on behalf of such person and that complies with the 
requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Subsequent to institution of an investigation. In 
investigations under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, a proposal 
to terminate by consent order shall be submitted as a motion to the 
administrative law judge with a stipulation that incorporates a proposed 
consent order. If the stipulation contains confidential business 
information within the meaning of Sec. 201.6(a) of this chapter, a copy 
of the stipulation with such information deleted shall accompany the 
motion. The stipulation shall comply with the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(3)(i) of this section. At any time prior to commencement of the 
hearing, the motion may be filed by one or more respondents, and may be 
filed jointly with other parties to the investigation. Upon request and 
for good cause shown, the administrative law judge may consider such a 
motion during or after a hearing. The filing of the motion shall not 
stay proceedings

[[Page 122]]

(122before the administrative law judge unless the administrative law 
judge so orders. The administrative law judge shall promptly file with 
the Commission an initial determination regarding the motion for 
termination if the motion is granted. If the initial determination 
contains confidential business information, a copy of the initial 
determination with such information deleted shall be filed with the 
Commission simultaneously with the filing of the confidential version of 
the initial determination. Pending disposition by the Commission of a 
consent order stipulation, a party may not, absent good cause shown, 
withdraw from the stipulation once it has been submitted pursuant to 
this section.
    (2) Commission disposition of consent order. (i) If an initial 
determination granting the motion for termination based on a consent 
order stipulation is filed with the Commission, notice of the initial 
determination and the consent order stipulation shall be provided to the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of 
Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Customs Service, and 
such other departments and agencies as the Commission deems appropriate.
    (ii) The Commission, after considering the effect of the settlement 
by consent order upon the public health and welfare, competitive 
conditions in the U.S. economy, the production of like or directly 
competitive articles in the United States, and U.S. consumers, shall 
dispose of the initial determination according to the procedures of 
Secs. 210.42 through 210.45. If the Commission's final disposition of 
the initial determination results in termination of the investigation in 
its entirety, a notice will be published in the Federal Register. An 
order of termination by consent order need not constitute a 
determination as to violation of section 337. Should the Commission 
reverse the initial determination, the parties are in no way bound by 
their proposal in later actions before the Commission.
    (3) Contents of consent order stipulation--(i) Contents. (A) Every 
consent order stipulation shall contain, in addition to the proposed 
consent order, the following:
    (1) An admission of all jurisdictional facts;
    (2) An express waiver of all rights to seek judicial review or 
otherwise challenge or contest the validity of the consent order;
    (3) A statement that the signatories to the consent order 
stipulation will cooperate with and will not seek to impede by 
litigation or other means the Commission's efforts to gather information 
under subpart I of this part; and
    (4) A statement that the enforcement, modification, and revocation 
of the consent order will be carried out pursuant to subpart I of this 
part, incorporating by reference the Commission's Rules of Practice and 
Procedure.
    (B) In the case of an intellectual property-based investigation, the 
consent order stipulation shall also contain--
    (1) a statement that the consent order shall not apply with respect 
to any claim of any intellectual property right that has expired or been 
found or adjudicated invalid or unenforceable by the Commission or a 
court or agency of competent jurisdiction, provided that such finding or 
judgment has become final and nonreviewable; and
    (2) a statement that each signatory to the stipulation who was a 
respondent in the investigation will not seek to challenge the validity 
of the intellectual property right(s), in any administrative or judicial 
proceeding to enforce the consent order.
    (C) The consent order stipulation may contain a statement that the 
signing thereof is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute 
admission by any respondent that an unfair act has been committed.
    (ii) Effect, interpretation, and reporting. The consent order shall 
have the same force and effect and may be enforced, modified, or revoked 
in the same manner as is provided in section 337 of the Tariff Act of 
1930 and this part for other Commission actions. The Commission may 
require periodic compliance reports pursuant to subpart I of this part 
to be submitted by the person entering into the consent order 
stipulation.
    (d) Termination based upon arbitration agreement. Upon filing of a 
motion for

[[Page 123]]

(123termination with the administrative law judge or the Commission, a 
section 337 investigation may be terminated as to one or more 
respondents pursuant to section 337(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 on the 
basis of an agreement between complainant and one or more of the 
respondents to present the matter for arbitration. The motion and a copy 
of the arbitration agreement shall be certified by the administrative 
law judge to the Commission with an initial determination if the motion 
for termination is granted. If the agreement or the initial 
determination contains confidential business information, copies of the 
agreement and initial determination with confidential business 
information deleted shall be certified to the Commission with the 
confidential versions of such documents. A notice will be published in 
the Federal Register if the Commission's final disposition of the 
initial determination results in termination of the investigation in its 
entirety. An order of termination based on an arbitration agreement does 
not constitute a determination as to violation of section 337 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930.
    (e) Effect of termination. An order of termination issued by the 
administrative law judge shall constitute an initial determination.

FR 53120, Oct. 12, 1995]

Sec. 210.22  Designating an investigation ``more complicated''.

    (a) Definition. A more complicated investigation is an investigation 
that is of an involved nature owing to the subject matter, difficulty in 
obtaining information, the large number of parties involved, or other 
significant factors.
    (b) Temporary relief. The Commission or the presiding administrative 
law judge, pursuant to Sec. 210.60, may declare an investigation ``more 
complicated'' in order to have up to 60 days of additional time to 
adjudicate a motion for temporary relief. See also Sec. 210.51(b). The 
Commission's or the administrative law judge's reasons for designating 
the investigation ``more complicated'' for that purpose shall be 
published in the Federal Register. The extended deadline for concluding 
an investigation that has been designated ``more complicated'' under 
this paragraph shall be computed in the manner specified in 
Sec. 210.51(c).

[59 FR 39039, Aug. 1, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 67627, Dec. 30, 1994]

Sec. 210.23  Suspension of investigation.

    Any party may move to suspend an investigation under this part, 
because of the pendency of proceedings before the Secretary of Commerce 
or the administering authority pursuant to section 337(b)(3) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930. The administrative law judge or the Commission also 
may raise the issue sua sponte. An administrative law judge's decision 
granting a motion for suspension shall be in the form of an initial 
determination.

[59 FR 39039, Aug. 1, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 67627, Dec. 30, 1994]

Sec. 210.24  Interlocutory appeals.

    Rulings by the administrative law judge on motions may not be 
appealed to the Commission prior to the administrative law judge's 
issuance of an initial determination, except in the following 
circumstances:
    (a) Appeals without leave of the administrative law judge. The 
Commission may in its discretion entertain interlocutory appeals, except 
as provided in Sec. 210.64, when a ruling of the administrative law 
judge:
    (1) Requires the disclosure of Commission records or requires the 
appearance of Government officials pursuant to Sec. 210.32(c)(2); or
    (2) Denies an application for intervention under Sec. 210.19. 
Appeals from such rulings may be sought by filing an application for 
review, not to exceed 15 pages, with the Commission within five days 
after service of the administrative law judge's ruling. An answer to the 
application for review may be filed within five days after service of 
the application. The application for review should specify the person or 
party taking the appeal, designate the ruling or part thereof from which 
appeal is being taken, and specify the reasons and present arguments as 
to why review is being sought. The Commission may, upon its own motion, 
enter an order

[[Page 124]]

(124staying the return date of an order issued by the administrative law 
judge pursuant to Sec. 210.32(c)(2) or may enter an order placing the 
matter on the Commission's docket for review. Any order placing the 
matter on the Commission's docket for review will set forth the scope of 
the review and the issues that will be considered and will make 
provision for the filing of briefs if deemed appropriate by the 
Commission.
    (b) Appeals with leave of the administrative law judge. (1) Except 
as otherwise provided in paragraph (a) of this section, Sec. 210.64, and 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, applications for review of a ruling by 
an administrative law judge may be allowed only upon request made to the 
administrative law judge and upon determination by the administrative 
law judge in writing, with justification in support thereof, that the 
ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which 
there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and that either 
an immediate appeal from the ruling may materially advance the ultimate 
completion of the investigation or subsequent review will be an 
inadequate remedy.
    (2) Applications for review of a ruling by an administrative law 
judge under Sec. 210.5(e)(1) as to whether information designated 
confidential by the supplier is entitled to confidential treatment under 
Sec. 210.5(b) may be allowed only upon request made to the 
administrative law judge and upon determination by the administrative 
law judge in writing, with justification in support thereof.
    (3) A written application for review under paragraph (b)(1) or 
(b)(2) of this section shall not exceed 15 pages and may be filed within 
five days after service of the administrative law judge's determination. 
An answer to the application for review may be filed within five days 
after service of the application for review. Thereupon, the Commission 
may, in its discretion, permit an appeal. Unless otherwise ordered by 
the Commission, Commission review, if permitted, shall be confined to 
the application for review and answer thereto, without oral argument or 
further briefs.
    (c) Investigation not stayed. Application for review under this 
section shall not stay the investigation before the administrative law 
judge unless the administrative law judge or the Commission shall so 
order.

[59 FR 39039, Aug. 1, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 67627, Dec. 30, 1994]

Sec. 210.25  Sanctions.

    (a) (1) Any party may file a motion for sanctions for abuse of 
process under Sec. 210.4(d)(1), abuse of discovery under 
Sec. 210.27(d)(3), failure to make or cooperate in discovery under 
Sec. 210.33 (b) or (c), or violation of a protective order under 
Sec. 210.34(c). A motion alleging abuse of process should be filed 
promptly after the requirements of Sec. 210.4(d)(1)(i) have been 
satisfied. A motion alleging abuse of discovery, failure to make or 
cooperate in discovery, or violation of a protective order should be 
filed promptly after the allegedly sanctionable conduct is discovered.
    (2) The administrative law judge (when the investigation or related 
proceeding is before him) or the Commission (when the investigation or 
related proceeding is before it) also may raise the sanction issue sua 
sponte. (See also Secs. 210.4(d)(1)(ii), 210.27(d)(3), 210.33(c), and 
210.34(c).)
    (b) A motion for sanctions shall be addressed to the presiding 
administrative law judge, if the allegedly sanctionable conduct occurred 
and is discovered while the administrative law judge is presiding in an 
investigation or in a related proceeding. During an investigation, the 
administrative law judge's ruling on the motion shall be in the form of 
an order, if it is issued before or concurrently with the initial 
determination concerning violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 
1930 or termination of the investigation. In a related proceeding, the 
administrative law judge's ruling shall be in the form of an order, 
regardless of the point in time at which the order is issued.
    (c) A motion for sanctions shall be addressed to the Commission, if 
the allegedly sanctionable conduct occurred while the Commission is 
presiding or is filed after the subject investigation or related 
proceeding is terminated. The Commission may assign the motion to

[[Page 125]]

(125an administrative law judge for issuance of a recommended 
determination. The deadlines and procedures that will be followed in 
processing the recommended determination will be set forth in the 
Commission order assigning the motion to an administrative law judge.
    (d) If an administrative law judge's order concerning sanctions is 
issued before the initial determination concerning violation of section 
337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or termination of the investigation, it 
may be appealed under Sec. 210.24(b)(1) with leave from the 
administrative law judge, if the requirements of that section are 
satisfied. If the order is issued concurrently with the initial 
determination, the order may be appealed by filing a petition meeting 
the requirements of Sec. 210.43(b). The periods for filing such 
petitions and responding to the petitions will be specified in the 
Commission notice issued pursuant to Sec. 210.42(i), if the initial 
determination has granted a motion for termination of the investigation, 
or in the Commission notice issued pursuant to Sec. 210.46(a), if the 
initial determination concerns violation of section 337. The Commission 
will determine whether to adopt the order after disposition of the 
initial determination concerning violation of section 337 or termination 
of the investigation.
    (e) If the administrative law judge's ruling on the motion for 
sanctions is in the form of a recommended determination pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section, the deadlines and procedures for parties 
to contest the recommended determination will be set forth in the 
Commission order assigning the motion to an administrative law judge.
    (f) If a motion for sanctions is filed with the administrative law 
judge during an investigation, he may defer his adjudication of the 
motion until after he has issued a final initial determination 
concerning violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 or 
termination of investigation. If the administrative law judge defers his 
adjudication in such a manner, his ruling on the motion for sanctions 
must be in the form of a recommended determination and shall be issued 
no later than 90 days after issuance of the aforesaid initial 
determination on violation of section 337 or termination of the 
investigation. To aid the Commission in determining whether to adopt a 
recommended determination, any party may file written comments with the 
Commission 14 days after service of the recommended determination. 
Replies to such comments may be filed within seven days after service of 
the comments. The Commission will determine whether to adopt the 
recommended determination after reviewing the parties' arguments and 
taking any other steps the Commission deems appropriate.

Sec. 210.26  Other motions.

    Motions pertaining to discovery shall be filed in accordance with 
Sec. 210.15 and the pertinent provisions of subpart E of this part 
(Secs. 210.27 through 210.34). Motions pertaining to evidentiary 
hearings and prehearing conferences shall be filed in accordance with 
Sec. 210.15 and the pertinent provisions of subpart F of this part 
(Secs. 210.35 through 210.40). Motions for temporary relief shall be 
filed as provided in subpart H of this part (see Secs. 210.52 through 
210.57).


<R04>
Subpart E--Discovery and Compulsory Process

Sec. 210.27  General provisions governing discovery.

    (a) Discovery methods. The parties to an investigation may obtain 
discovery by one or more of the following methods: depositions upon oral 
examination or written questions; written interrogatories; production of 
documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property 
for inspection or other purposes; and requests for admissions.
    (b) Scope of discovery. Regarding the scope of discovery for the 
temporary relief phase of an investigation, see Sec. 210.61. For the 
permanent relief phase of an investigation, unless otherwise ordered by 
the administrative law judge, a party may obtain discovery regarding any 
matter, not privileged, that is relevant to the following:
    (1) The claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or to the 
claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, 
description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any

[[Page 126]]

(126books, documents, or other tangible things;
    (2) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of any 
discoverable matter;
    (3) The appropriate remedy for a violation of section 337 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 (see Sec. 210.42(a)(1)(ii)(A)); or
    (4) The appropriate bond for the respondents, under section 
337(j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, during Presidential review of the 
remedial order (if any) issued by the Commission (see 
Sec. 210.42(a)(1)(ii)(B)).

It is not grounds for objection that the information sought will be 
inadmissible at the hearing if the information sought appears reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    (c) Supplementation of Responses. (1) A party who has responded to a 
request for discovery with a response is under a duty to supplement or 
correct the response to include information thereafter acquired if 
ordered by the administrative law judge or the Commission or in the 
following circumstances: A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a 
prior response to an interrogatory, request for production, or request 
for admission if the party learns that the response is in some material 
respect incomplete or incorrect and if the additional or corrective 
information has not otherwise been made known to the other parties 
during the discovery process or in writing.
    (2) A duty to supplement responses also may be imposed by agreement 
of the parties, or at any time prior to a hearing through new requests 
for supplementation of prior responses.
    (d) Signing of Discovery Requests, Responses, and Objections. (1) 
The front page of every request for discovery or response or objection 
thereto shall contain a caption setting forth the name of the 
Commission, the title of the investigation or related proceeding, and 
the docket number or investigation number, if any, assigned to the 
investigation or related proceeding.
    (2) Every request for discovery or response or objection thereto 
made by a party represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least 
one attorney of record in the attorney's individual name, whose address 
shall be stated. A party who is not represented by an attorney shall 
sign the request, response, or objection and shall state the party's 
address. The signature of the attorney or party constitutes a 
certification that to the best of the signer's knowledge, information, 
and belief formed after a reasonable inquiry, the request, objection, or 
response is:

    (i) Consistent with Sec. 210.5(a) (if applicable) and other relevant 
provisions of this chapter, and warranted by existing law or a good 
faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing 
law;
    (ii) Not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or 
to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of 
litigation; and
    (iii) Not unreasonable or unduly burdensome or expensive, given the 
needs of the case, the discovery already had in the case, and the 
importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.

If a request, response, or objection is not signed, it shall be stricken 
unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called to the 
attention of the party making the request, response, or objection, and a 
party shall not be obligated to take any action with respect to it until 
it is signed.
    (3) If without substantial justification a request, response, or 
objection is certified in violation of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, 
the administrative law judge or the Commission, upon motion or sua 
sponte under Sec. 210.25 of this part, may impose an appropriate 
sanction upon the person who made the certification, the party on whose 
behalf the request, response, or objection was made, or both.
    (4) An appropriate sanction may include an order to pay to the other 
parties the amount of reasonable expenses incurred because of the 
violation, including a reasonable attorney's fee, to the extent 
authorized by Rule 26(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
Monetary sanctions shall not be imposed under this section against the 
United States, the Commission, or a Commission investigative attorney.
    (5) Monetary sanctions may be imposed under this section to 
reimburse the Commission for expenses incurred by a Commission 
investigative attorney or the Commission's Office of Unfair Import 
Investigations. Monetary sanctions will not be imposed under

[[Page 127]]

(127this section to reimburse the Commission for attorney's fees.

Sec. 210.28  Depositions.

    (a) When depositions may be taken. Following publication in the 
Federal Register of a Commission notice instituting the investigation, 
any party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by 
deposition upon oral examination or written questions. The presiding 
administrative law judge will determine the permissible dates or 
deadlines for taking such depositions.
    (b) Persons before whom depositions may be taken. Depositions may be 
taken before a person having power to administer oaths by the laws of 
the United States or of the place where the examination is held.
    (c) Notice of examination. A party desiring to take the deposition 
of a person shall give notice in writing to every other party to the 
investigation. The administrative law judge shall determine the 
appropriate period for providing such notice. The notice shall state the 
time and place for taking the deposition and the name and address of 
each person to be examined, if known, and, if the name is not known, a 
general description sufficient to identify him or the particular class 
or group to which he belongs. A notice may provide for the taking of 
testimony by telephone, but the administrative law judge may, on motion 
of any party, require that the deposition be taken in the presence of 
the deponent. The parties may stipulate in writing, or the 
administrative law judge may upon motion order, that the testimony at a 
deposition be recorded by other than stenographic means. If a subpoena 
duces tecum is to be served on the person to be examined, the 
designation of the materials to be produced as set forth in the subpoena 
shall be attached to or included in the notice.
    (d) Taking of deposition. Each deponent shall be duly sworn, and any 
adverse party shall have the right to cross-examine. Objections to 
questions or documents shall be in short form, stating the grounds of 
objections relied upon. Evidence objected to shall be taken subject to 
the objections, except that privileged communications and subject matter 
need not be disclosed. The questions propounded and the answers thereto, 
together with all objections made, shall be reduced to writing, after 
which the deposition shall be subscribed by the deponent (unless the 
parties by stipulation waive signing or the deponent is ill or cannot be 
found or refuses to sign) and certified by the person before whom the 
deposition was taken. If the deposition is not subscribed by the 
deponent, the person administering the oath shall state on the record 
such fact and the reason therefor. When a deposition is recorded by 
stenographic means, the stenographer shall certify on the transcript 
that the witness was sworn in the stenographer's presence and that the 
transcript is a true record of the testimony of the witness. When a 
deposition is recorded by other than stenographic means and is 
thereafter transcribed, the person transcribing it shall certify that 
the person heard the witness sworn on the recording and that the 
transcript is a correct writing of the recording. Thereafter, that 
person shall forward one copy to each party who was present or 
represented at the taking of the deposition. See paragraph (i) of this 
section concerning the effect of errors and irregularities in 
depositions.
    (e) Depositions of nonparty officers or employees of the Commission 
or of other Government agencies. A party desiring to take the deposition 
of an officer or employee of the Commission other than the Commission 
investigative attorney, or of an officer or employee of another 
Government agency, or to obtain documents or other physical exhibits in 
the custody, control, and possession of such officer or employee, shall 
proceed by written motion to the administrative law judge for leave to 
apply for a subpoena under Sec. 210.32(c). Such a motion shall be 
granted only upon a showing that the information expected to be obtained 
thereby is within the scope of discovery permitted by Sec. 210.27(b) or 
Sec. 210.61 and cannot be obtained without undue hardship by alternative 
means.
    (f) Service of deposition transcripts on the Commission staff. The 
party taking the deposition shall promptly serve one copy of the 
deposition transcript on the Commission investigative attorney.

[[Page 128]]

(128
    (g) Admissibility of depositions. The fact that a deposition is 
taken and filed with the Commission investigative attorney as provided 
in this section does not constitute a determination that it is 
admissible in evidence or that it may be used in the investigation. Only 
such part of a deposition as is received in evidence at a hearing shall 
constitute a part of the record in such investigation upon which a 
determination may be based. Objections may be made at the hearing to 
receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason that 
would require exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present 
and testifying.
    (h) Use of depositions. A deposition may be used as evidence against 
any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition 
or who had reasonable notice thereof, in accordance with any of the 
following provisions:
    (1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of 
contradicting or impeaching the testimony of a deponent as a witness;
    (2) The deposition of a party may be used by an adverse party for 
any purpose;
    (3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used 
by any party for any purposes if the administrative law judge finds--
    (i) That the witness is dead; or
    (ii) That the witness is out of the United States, unless it appears 
that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the 
deposition; or
    (iii) That the witness is unable to attend or testify because of 
age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or
    (iv) That the party offering the deposition has been unable to 
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or
    (v) Upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances 
exist as to make it desirable in the interest of justice and with due 
regard to the importance of presenting the oral testimony of witnesses 
at a hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.
    (4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, 
an adverse party may require him to introduce any other part that ought 
in fairness to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may 
introduce any other parts.
    (i) Effect of errors and irregularities in depositions--(1) As to 
notice. All errors and irregularities in the notice for taking a 
deposition are waived unless written objection is promptly served upon 
the party giving notice.
    (2) As to disqualification of person before whom the deposition is 
to be taken. Objection to taking a deposition because of 
disqualification of the person before whom it is to be taken is waived 
unless made before the taking of the deposition begins or as soon 
thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered 
with reasonable diligence.
    (3) As to taking of depositions. (i) Objections to the competency of 
a witness or the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are 
not waived by failure to make them before or during the deposition, 
unless the ground of the objection is one which might have been obviated 
or removed if presented at that time.
    (ii) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in 
the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or 
answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties, and 
errors of any kind which might be obviated, removed, or cured if 
promptly presented, are waived unless seasonable objection thereto is 
made at the taking of the deposition.
    (iii) Objections to the form of written questions submitted under 
this section are waived unless served in writing upon the party 
propounding them. The presiding administrative law judge shall set the 
deadline for service of such objections.
    (4) As to completion and return of deposition. Errors and 
irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or 
the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, indorsed, 
transmitted, filed, or otherwise dealt with by the person before whom it 
is taken are waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some 
part thereof is made with reasonable promptness after such defect is, or 
with due diligence might have been, ascertained.

Sec. 210.29  Interrogatories.

    (a) Scope; use at hearing. Any party may serve upon any other party 
written interrogatories to be answered by the party served. 
Interrogatories may relate to any matters that can be inquired into 
under Sec. 210.27(b) or Sec. 210.61, and the answers may be used to the 
extent permitted by the rules of evidence.
    (b) Procedure. (1) Interrogatories may be served upon any party 
after the date of publication in the Federal Register of the notice of 
investigation.
    (2) Parties answering interrogatories shall repeat the 
interrogatories being answered immediately preceding the answers. Each 
interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under 
oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reasons for objection 
shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers are to be signed by 
the person making them, and the objections are to be signed by the 
attorney making them. The party upon whom the interrogatories have been 
served shall serve a copy of the answers, and objections if any, within 
the time specified by the administrative law judge. The party submitting 
the interrogatories may move for an order under Sec. 210.33(a) with 
respect to any objection to or other failure to answer an interrogatory.
    (3) An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily 
objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an 
opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to 
fact, but the administrative law judge may order that such an 
interrogatory need not be answered until after designated discovery has 
been completed or until a prehearing conference or a later time.
    (c) Option to produce records. When the answer to an interrogatory 
may be derived or ascertained from the records of the party upon whom 
the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit, or 
inspection of such records, or from a compilation, abstract, or summary 
based thereon, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is 
substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for 
the party served, it is a sufficient answer to such interrogatory to 
specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained 
and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable 
opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect such records and to make 
copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries. The specifications 
provided shall include sufficient detail to permit the interrogating 
party to locate and to identify, as readily as can the party served, the 
documents from which the answer may be ascertained.

Sec. 210.30  Requests for production of documents and things and entry 
          upon land.

    (a) Scope. Any party may serve on any other party a request:
    (1) To produce and permit the party making the request, or someone 
acting on his behalf, to inspect and copy any designated documents 
(including writings, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, and other 
data compilations from which information can be obtained), or to inspect 
and copy, test, or sample any tangible things that are in the 
possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is 
served; or
    (2) To permit entry upon designated land or other property in the 
possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for 
the purpose of inspecting and measuring, surveying, photographing, 
testing, or sampling the property or any designated object or operation 
thereon, within the scope of Sec. 210.27(b).
    (b) Procedure. (1) The request may be served upon any party after 
the date of publication in the Federal Register of the notice of 
investigation. The request shall set forth the items to be inspected, 
either by individual item or by category, and describe each item and 
category with reasonable particularity. The request shall specify a 
reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and 
performing the related acts.
    (2) The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written 
response within the time specified by the administrative law judge. The 
response shall state, with respect to each item or category, that 
inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless 
the request is objected to, in

[[Page 130]]

(130which event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection 
is made to part of any item or category, the part shall be specified. 
The party submitting the request may move for an order under 
Sec. 210.33(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to 
respond to the request or any part thereof, or any failure to permit 
inspection as requested. A party who produces documents for inspection 
shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or 
shall organize and label them to correspond to the categories in the 
request.
    (c) Persons not parties. This section does not preclude issuance of 
an order against a person not a party to permit entry upon land.

Sec. 210.31   Requests for admission.

    (a) Form, content, and service of request for admission. Any party 
may serve on any other party a written request for admission of the 
truth of any matters relevant to the investigation and set forth in the 
request that relate to statements or opinions of fact or of the 
application of law to fact, including the genuineness of any documents 
described in the request. Copies of documents shall be served with the 
request unless they have been otherwise furnished or are known to be, 
and in the request are stated as being, in the possession of the other 
party. Each matter as to which an admission is requested shall be 
separately set forth. The request may be served upon a party whose 
complaint is the basis for the investigation after the date of 
publication in the Federal Register of the notice of investigation. The 
administrative law judge will determine the period within which a party 
may serve a request upon other parties.
    (b) Answers and objections to requests for admissions. A party 
answering a request for admission shall repeat the request for admission 
immediately preceding his answer. The matter may be deemed admitted 
unless, within the period specified by the administrative law judge, the 
party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party requesting 
the admission a sworn written answer or objection addressed to the 
matter. If objection is made, the reason therefor shall be stated. The 
answer shall specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the 
reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the 
matter. A denial shall fairly meet the substance of the requested 
admission, and when good faith requires that a party qualify his answer 
or deny only a part of the matter as to which an admission is requested, 
he shall specify so much of it as is true and qualify or deny the 
remainder. An answering party may not give lack of information or 
knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless he states that 
he has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known to or 
readily obtainable by him is insufficient to enable him to admit or 
deny. A party who considers that a matter as to which an admission has 
been requested presents a genuine issue for a hearing may not object to 
the request on that ground alone; he may deny the matter or set forth 
reasons why he cannot admit or deny it.
    (c) Sufficiency of answers. The party who has requested the 
admissions may move to determine the sufficiency of the answers or 
objections. Unless the objecting party sustains his burden of showing 
that the objection is justified, the administrative law judge shall 
order that an answer be served. If the administrative law judge 
determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this 
section, he may order either that the matter is admitted or that an 
amended answer be served. The administrative law judge may, in lieu of 
these orders, determine that final disposition of the request be made at 
a prehearing conference or at a designated time prior to a hearing under 
this part.
    (d) Effect of admissions; withdrawal or amendment of admission. Any 
matter admitted under this section may be conclusively established 
unless the administrative law judge on motion permits withdrawal or 
amendment of the admission. The administrative law judge may permit 
withdrawal or amendment when the presentation of the issues of the 
investigation will be subserved thereby and the party who obtained the 
admission fails to satisfy the administrative law judge that withdrawal 
or amendment will prejudice him in maintaining his position on the issue

[[Page 131]]

(131of the investigation. Any admission made by a party under this 
section is for the purpose of the pending investigation only and is not 
an admission by him for any other purpose, nor may it be used against 
him in any other proceeding.

Sec. 210.32  Subpoenas.

    (a) Application for issuance of a subpoena--(1) Subpoena ad 
testificandum. An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring a 
person to appear and depose or testify at the taking of a deposition or 
at a hearing shall be made to the administrative law judge.
    (2) Subpoena duces tecum. An application for issuance of a subpoena 
requiring a person to appear and depose or testify and to produce 
specified documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits at the 
taking of a deposition, at a prehearing conference, at a hearing, or 
under any other circumstances, shall be made in writing to the 
administrative law judge and shall specify the material to be produced 
as precisely as possible, showing the general relevancy of the material 
and the reasonableness of the scope of the subpoena.
    (3) The administrative law judge shall rule on all applications 
filed under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section and may issue 
subpoenas when warranted.
    (b) Use of subpoena for discovery. Subpoenas may be used by any 
party for purposes of discovery or for obtaining documents, papers, 
books or other physical exhibits for use in evidence, or for both 
purposes. When used for discovery purposes, a subpoena may require a 
person to produce and permit the inspection and copying of nonprivileged 
documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits that constitute or 
contain evidence relevant to the subject matter involved and that are in 
the possession, custody, or control of such person.
    (c) Application for subpoenas for nonparty Commission records or 
personnel or for records and personnel of other Government agencies--(1) 
Procedure. An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring the 
production of nonparty documents, papers, books, physical exhibits, or 
other material in the records of the Commission, or requiring the 
production of records or personnel of other Government agencies shall 
specify as precisely as possible the material to be produced, the nature 
of the information to be disclosed, or the expected testimony of the 
official or employee, and shall contain a statement showing the general 
relevancy of the material, information, or testimony and the 
reasonableness of the scope of the application, together with a showing 
that such material, information, or testimony or their substantial 
equivalent could not be obtained without undue hardship or by 
alternative means.
    (2) Ruling. Such applications shall be ruled upon by the 
administrative law judge, and he may issue such subpoenas when 
warranted. To the extent that the motion is granted, the administrative 
law judge shall provide such terms and conditions for the production of 
the material, the disclosure of the information, or the appearance of 
the official or employee as may appear necessary and appropriate for the 
protection of the public interest.
    (3) Application for subpoena grounded upon the Freedom of 
Information Act. No application for a subpoena for production of 
documents grounded upon the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 
Sec. 552) shall be entertained by the administrative law judge.
    (d) Motion to limit or quash. Any motion to limit or quash a 
subpoena shall be filed within such time as the administrative law judge 
may allow.
    (e) Ex parte rulings on applications for subpoenas. Applications for 
the issuance of the subpoenas pursuant to the provisions of this section 
may be made ex parte, and, if so made, such applications and rulings 
thereon shall remain ex parte unless otherwise ordered by the 
administrative law judge.
    (f) Witness Fees--(1) Deponents and witnesses. Any person compelled 
to appear in person to depose or testify in response to a subpoena shall 
be paid the same mileage as are paid witnesses with respect to 
proceedings in the courts of the United States; provided, that salaried 
employees of the United States summoned to depose or testify as to 
matters related to their public employment, irrespective of the party at 
whose instance they are summoned,

[[Page 132]]

(132shall be paid in accordance with the applicable Federal regulations.
    (2) Responsibility. The fees and mileage referred to in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this section shall be paid by the party at whose instance 
deponents or witnesses appear. Fees due under this paragraph shall be 
tendered no later than the date for compliance with the subpoena issued 
under this section. Failure to timely tender fees under this paragraph 
shall not invalidate any subpoena issued under this section.
    (g) Obtaining judicial enforcement. In order to obtain judicial 
enforcement of a subpoena issued under paragraphs (a)(3) or (c)(2) of 
this section, the administrative law judge shall certify to the 
Commission, on motion or sua sponte, a request for such enforcement. The 
request shall be accompanied by copies of relevant papers and a written 
report from the administrative law judge concerning the purpose, 
relevance, and reasonableness of the subpoena. The Commission will 
subsequently issue a notice stating whether it has granted the request 
and authorized its Office of the General Counsel to seek such 
enforcement.

Sec. 210.33  Failure to make or cooperate in discovery; sanctions.

    (a) Motion for order compelling discovery. A party may apply to the 
administrative law judge for an order compelling discovery upon 
reasonable notice to other parties and all persons affected thereby.
    (b) Non-monetary sanctions for failure to comply with an order 
compelling discovery. If a party or an officer or agent of a party fails 
to comply with an order including, but not limited to, an order for the 
taking of a deposition or the production of documents, an order to 
answer interrogatories, an order issued pursuant to a request for 
admissions, or an order to comply with a subpoena, the administrative 
law judge, for the purpose of permitting resolution of relevant issues 
and disposition of the investigation without unnecessary delay despite 
the failure to comply, may take such action in regard thereto as is 
just, including, but not limited to the following:
    (1) Infer that the admission, testimony, documents, or other 
evidence would have been adverse to the party;
    (2) Rule that for the purposes of the investigation the matter or 
matters concerning the order or subpoena issued be taken as established 
adversely to the party;
    (3) Rule that the party may not introduce into evidence or otherwise 
rely upon testimony by the party, officer, or agent, or documents, or 
other material in support of his position in the investigation;
    (4) Rule that the party may not be heard to object to introduction 
and use of secondary evidence to show what the withheld admission, 
testimony, documents, or other evidence would have shown;
    (5) Rule that a motion or other submission by the party concerning 
the order or subpoena issued be stricken or rule by initial 
determination that a determination in the investigation be rendered 
against the party, or both; or
    (6) Order any other non-monetary sanction available under Rule 37(b) 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Any such action may be taken by 
written or oral order issued in the course of the investigation or by 
inclusion in the initial determination of the administrative law judge. 
It shall be the duty of the parties to seek, and that of the 
administrative law judge to grant, such of the foregoing means of relief 
or other appropriate relief as may be sufficient to compensate for the 
lack of withheld testimony, documents, or other evidence. If, in the 
administrative law judge's opinion such relief would not be sufficient, 
the administrative law judge shall certify to the Commission a request 
that court enforcement of the subpoena or other discovery order be 
sought.
    (c) Monetary sanctions for failure to make or cooperate in 
discovery. (1) If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of 
the party or person designated to testify on behalf of a party fails to 
obey an order to provide or permit discovery, the administrative law 
judge or the Commission may make such orders in regard to the failure as 
are just. In lieu of or in addition to taking action listed in paragraph 
(b) of this section and to the extent provided

[[Page 133]]

(133in Rule 37(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the 
administrative law judge or the Commission, upon motion or sua sponte 
under Sec. 210.25, may require the party failing to obey the order or 
the attorney advising that party or both to pay reasonable expenses, 
including attorney's fees, caused by the failure, unless the 
administrative law judge or the Commission finds that the failure was 
substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of 
expenses unjust. Monetary sanctions shall not be imposed under this 
section against the United States, the Commission, or a Commission 
investigative attorney.
    (2) Monetary sanctions may be imposed under this section to 
reimburse the Commission for expenses incurred by a Commission 
investigative attorney or the Commission's Office of Unfair Import 
Investigations. Monetary sanctions will not be imposed under this 
section to reimburse the Commission for attorney's fees.

Sec. 210.34  Protective orders.

    (a) Issuance of protective order. Upon motion by a party or by the 
person from whom discovery is sought or by the administrative law judge 
on his own initiative, and for good cause shown, the administrative law 
judge may make any order that may appear necessary and appropriate for 
the protection of the public interest or that justice requires to 
protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or 
undue burden or expense, including one or more of the following:
    (1) That discovery not be had;
    (2) That the discovery may be had only on specified terms and 
conditions, including a designation of the time or place;
    (3) That discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other 
than that selected by the party seeking discovery;
    (4) That certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of 
discovery be limited to certain matters;
    (5) That discovery be conducted with no one present except persons 
designated by the administrative law judge;
    (6) That a deposition, after being sealed, be opened only by order 
of the Commission or the administrative law judge;
    (7) That a trade secret or other confidential research, development, 
or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a 
designated way; and
    (8) That the parties simultaneously file specified documents or 
information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the 
Commission or the administrative law judge. If the motion for a 
protective order is denied, in whole or in part, the Commission or the 
administrative law judge may, on such terms and conditions as are just, 
order that any party or person provide or permit discovery. The 
Commission also may, upon motion or sua sponte, issue protective orders 
or may continue or amend a protective order issued by the administrative 
law judge.
    (b) Unauthorized disclosure of information. If confidential business 
information submitted in accordance with the terms of a protective order 
is disclosed to any person other than in a manner authorized by the 
protective order, the party responsible for the disclosure must 
immediately bring all pertinent facts relating to such disclosure to the 
attention of the submitter of the information and the administrative law 
judge or the Commission, and, without prejudice to other rights and 
remedies of the submitter of the information, make every effort to 
prevent further disclosure of such information by the party or the 
recipient of such information.
    (c) Violation of protective order. Any individual who has agreed to 
be bound by the terms of a protective order issued pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section, and who is determined to have violated the terms of 
the protective order, may be subject to one or more of the following:
    (1) An official reprimand by the Commission;
    (2) Disqualification from or limitation of further participation in 
a pending investigation;
    (3) Temporary or permanent disqualification from practicing in any 
capacity before the Commission pursuant to Sec. 201.15(a) of this 
chapter;

[[Page 134]]

(134
    (4) Referral of the facts underlying the violation to the 
appropriate licensing authority in the jurisdiction in which the 
individual is licensed to practice;
    (5) Sanctions of the sort enumerated in Sec. 210.33(b), or such 
other action as may be appropriate.

The issue of whether sanctions should be imposed may be raised on a 
motion by a party, the administrative law judge's own motion, or the 
Commission's own initiative in accordance with Sec. 210.25(a)(2). The 
Commission or the administrative law judge shall allow the parties to 
make written submissions and, if warranted, to present oral argument 
bearing on the issues of violation of a protective order and sanctions 
therefor. When the motion is addressed to the administrative law judge, 
he shall grant or deny a motion for sanctions by issuing an order.
    (d) Reporting requests for confidential business information. (1) 
Reporting Requirement. Each person subject to protective order issued 
pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall report in writing to the 
Commission immediately upon learning that confidential business 
information disclosed to him or her pursuant to the protective order is 
the subject of a subpoena, court or administrative order (other than an 
order of a court reviewing a Commission decision), discovery request, 
agreement, or other written request seeking disclosure, by him or any 
other person, of that confidential business information to persons who 
are not, or may not be, permitted access to that information pursuant to 
either a Commission protective order or Sec. 210.5(b).
    (2) Sanctions and other actions. After providing notice and an 
opportunity to comment, the Commission may impose a sanction upon any 
person who willfully fails to comply with paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, or it may take other action.


<R04>
Subpart F--Prehearing Conferences and Hearings

Sec. 210.35  Prehearing conferences.

    (a) When appropriate. The administrative law judge in any 
investigation may direct counsel or other representatives for all 
parties to meet with him for one or more conferences to consider any or 
all of the following:
    (1) Simplification and clarification of the issues;
    (2) Scope of the hearing;

such proposed findings, briefs, or other papers to such documents or 
testimony including generalized statements based on their contents. To 
the extent that counsel consider it necessary to include specific 
details of in camera data in their presentations, such data shall be 
incorporated in separate proposed findings, briefs, or other papers 
marked ``Business Confidential,'' which shall be placed in camera and 
become a part of the confidential record.

FR 53120, Oct. 12, 1995]

Sec. 210.43  Petitions for review of initial determinations on matters 
          other than temporary relief.

    (a) Filing of the petition. (1) Except as provided in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section, any party to an investigation may request 
Commission review of an initial determination issued under 
Sec. 210.42(a)(1) or (c), Sec. 210.50(d)(3) or Sec. 210.70(c) by filing 
a petition with the Secretary. A petition for review of an initial 
determination issued under Sec. 210.42(a)(1) must be filed within 10 
days after service of the initial determination. A petition for review 
of an initial determination issued under Sec. 210.42(c) must be filed 
within five business days after issuance of the initial

[[Page 139]]

(139determination. A petition for review of an initial determination 
issued under Sec. 210.50(d)(3) or Sec. 210.70(c) must be filed within 10 
days after issuance of the initial determination.
    (2) A party may not petition for review of any issue as to which the 
party has been found to be in default. Similarly, a party or proposed 
respondent who did not file a response to the motion addressed in the 
initial determination may be deemed to have consented to the relief 
requested and may not petition for review of the issues raised in the 
motion.
    (b) Content of the petition. (1) A petition for review filed under 
this section shall identify the party seeking review and shall specify 
the issues upon which review of the initial determination is sought, and 
shall, with respect to each such issue, specify one or more of the 
following grounds upon which review is sought:
    (i) That a finding or conclusion of material fact is clearly 
erroneous;
    (ii) That a legal conclusion is erroneous, without governing 
precedent, rule or law, or constitutes an abuse of discretion; or
    (iii) That the determination is one affecting Commission policy.

The petition for review must set forth a concise statement of the facts 
material to the consideration of the stated issues, and must present a 
concise argument providing the reasons that review by the Commission is 
necessary or appropriate to resolve an important issue of fact, law, or 
policy.
    (2) Any issue not raised in a petition for review will be deemed to 
have been abandoned by the petitioning party and may be disregarded by 
the Commission in reviewing the initial determination (unless the 
Commission chooses to review the issue on its own initiative under 
Sec. 210.44).
    (3) Any petition designated by the petitioner as a ``contingent'' 
petition for review shall be deemed to be a petition under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section and shall be processed accordingly.
    (4) A party's failure to file a petition for review of an initial 
determination shall constitute abandonment of all issues decided 
adversely to that party in the initial determination.
    (c) Responses to the petition. Any party may file a response to a 
petition for review within five business days after service of the 
petition, except that a party who has been found to be in default may 
not file a response to any issue as to which the party has defaulted.
    (d) Grant or denial of review. (1) The Commission shall decide 
whether to grant, in whole or in part, a petition for review of an 
initial determination filed pursuant to Sec. 210.42(a)(1), 
Sec. 210.50(d)(3) or Sec. 210.70(c) within 45 days of the service of the 
initial determination on the parties, or by such other time as the 
Commission may order. The Commission shall decide whether to grant, in 
whole or in part, a petition for review of an initial determination 
filed pursuant to Sec. 210.42(c) within 30 days of the service of the 
initial determination on the parties, or by such other time as the 
Commission may order.
    (2) The Commission shall decide whether to grant a petition for 
review, based upon the petition and response thereto, without oral 
argument or further written submissions unless the Commission shall 
order otherwise. A petition will be granted and review will be ordered 
if it appears that an error or abuse of the type described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section is present or if the petition raises a policy 
matter connected with the initial determination, which the Commission 
thinks it necessary or appropriate to address.
    (3) The Commission shall grant a petition for review and order 
review of an initial determination or certain issues therein when at 
least one of the participating Commissioners votes for ordering review. 
In its notice, the Commission shall establish the scope of the review 
and the issues that will be considered and make provisions for filing of 
briefs and oral argument if deemed appropriate by the Commission. If the 
notice solicits written submissions from interested persons on the 
issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding in addition to 
announcing the Commission's decision to grant a petition for review of 
the initial determination, the notice shall be served by the Secretary 
on all parties, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,

    Within the time provided in Sec. 210.43(d)(1), the Commission on its 
own initiative may order review of an initial determination, or certain 
issues in the initial determination, when at least one of the 
participating Commissioners votes for ordering review. A self-initiated 
Commission review of an initial determination will be ordered if it 
appears that an error or abuse of the kind described in 
Sec. 210.43(b)(1) is present or the initial determination raises a 
policy matter which the Commission thinks is necessary or appropriate to 
address.

Sec. 210.45  Review of initial determinations on matters other than 
          temporary relief.

    (a) Briefs and oral argument. In the event the Commission orders 
review of an initial determination pertaining to issues other than 
temporary relief, the parties may be requested to file briefs on the 
issues under review at a time and of a size and nature specified in the 
notice of review. The parties, within the time provided for filing the 
review briefs, may submit a written request for a hearing to present 
oral argument before the Commission, which the Commission in its 
discretion may grant or deny. The Commission shall grant the request 
when at least one of the participating Commissioners votes in favor of 
granting the request.
    (b) Scope of review. Only the issues set forth in the notice of 
review, and all subsidiary issues therein, will be considered by the 
Commission.
    (c) Determination on review. On review, the Commission may affirm, 
reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole 
or in part, the initial determination of the administrative law judge. 
The Commission also may make any findings or conclusions that in its 
judgment are proper based on the record in the proceeding. If the 
Commission's determination on review terminates the investigation in its 
entirety, a notice will be published in the Federal Register.

the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding by the 
respondents. In those submissions, the parties may assert their 
arguments concerning the recommended determination issued by the 
administrative law judge pursuant to Sec. 210.42(a)(ii) on the issues of 
remedy and bonding by respondents.
    (b) Temporary relief. Commission action on an initial determination

forth the relief desired and the grounds in support thereof. Any 
petition filed under this section must be confined to new questions 
raised by the determination or action ordered to be taken thereunder and 
upon which the petitioner had no opportunity to submit arguments. Any 
party desiring to oppose such a petition shall file an answer thereto 
within five days after service of the petition upon such party. The

the day after a copy of the Commission's action is delivered to the 
President, or if the President notifies the Commission before the close 
of the 60-day period that he approves the Commission's action, such

    (1) Consider what action (general or limited exclusion of articles 
from entry or a cease and desist order, or exclusion of articles from 
entry under bond or a temporary cease and desist order), if any, it 
should take, and, when appropriate, take such action;
    (2) Consult with and seek advice and information from the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, 
the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Customs Service, and such other 
departments and agencies as it considers appropriate, concerning the 
subject matter of the complaint and the effect its actions (general or 
limited exclusion of articles from entry or a cease and desist order, or 
exclusion of articles from entry under bond or a temporary cease and 
desist order) under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 shall have 
upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the U.S. 
economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in the 
United States, and U.S. consumers;
    (3) Determine the amount of the bond to be posted by a respondent 
pursuant to section 337(j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930 following the 
issuance of temporary or permanent relief under section 337(d), (e), 
(f), or (g) of the Tariff Act of 1930, taking into account the 
requirement of section 337(e) and (j)(3) that the amount of the bond be 
sufficient to protect the complainant from any injury.

(142
    (4) Receive submissions from the parties, interested persons, and 
other Government agencies and departments with respect to the subject 
matter of paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3), of this section.

When the matter under consideration pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section is whether to grant some form of permanent relief, the 
submissions described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section shall be filed 
by the deadlines specified in the Commission notice issued pursuant to 
Sec. 210.46(a). When the matter under consideration is whether to grant 
some form of temporary relief, such submissions shall be filed by the 
deadlines specified in Sec. 210.67(b), unless the Commission orders 
otherwise. Any submission from a party shall be served upon the other 
parties in accordance with Sec. 210.4(g). The parties' submissions, as 
well as any filed by interested persons or other agencies shall be 
available for public inspection in the Office of the Secretary. The 
Commission will consider motions for oral argument or, when necessary, a 
hearing with respect to the subject matter of this section, except that 
no hearing or oral argument will be permitted in connection with a 
motion for temporary relief.
    (b)(1) With respect to an administrative law judge's ability to take 
evidence or other information and to hear arguments from the parties and 
other interested persons on the issues of appropriate Commission action, 
the public interest, and bonding by the respondents for purposes of an 
initial determination on temporary relief, see Secs. 210.61, 210.62, and 
210.66(a). For purposes of the recommended determination required by 
Sec. 210.42(a)(1)(ii), an administrative law judge shall take evidence 
or other information and hear arguments from the parties and other 
interested persons on the issues of appropriate Commission action and 
bonding by the respondents. Unless the Commission orders otherwise, and 
except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an 
administrative law judge shall not address the issue of the public 
interest for purposes of an initial determination on violation of 
section 337 of the Tariff Act under Sec. 210.42(a)(1)(i).
    (2) Regarding terminations by settlement agreement, consent order, 
or arbitration agreement under Sec. 210.21 (b), (c) or (d), the parties 
may file statements regarding the impact of the proposed termination on 
the public interest, and the administrative law judge may hear argument, 
although no discovery may be compelled with respect to issues relating 
solely to the public interest. Thereafter, the administrative law judge 
shall consider and make appropriate findings in the initial 
determination regarding the effect of the proposed settlement on the 
public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, 
the production of like or directly competitive articles in the United 
States, and U.S. consumers.
    (c) No general exclusion from entry of articles shall be ordered 
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section unless the Commission determines 
that--
    (1) Such exclusion is necessary to prevent circumvention of an 
exclusion order limited to products of named persons; or
    (2) There is a pattern of violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act 
of 1930 and it is difficult to identify the source of infringing 
products.
    (d) Forfeiture or return of respondents' bonds. (1)(i) If one or 
more respondents posts a bond pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1337(e)(1) or 
1337(j)(3), proceedings to determine whether a respondent's bond should 
be forfeited to a complainant in whole or part may be initiated upon the 
filing of a motion by a complainant within 30 days after expiration of 
the Presidential review period under 19 U.S.C. 1337(j).
    (ii) A respondent may file a motion for the return of its bond.
    (2) Any nonmoving party may file a response to a motion filed under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section within 15 days after filing of the 
motion, unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge.
    (3) A motion for forfeiture or return of a respondent's bond in 
whole or part will be adjudicated by the administrative law judge in an 
initial determination with a 45-day effective date, which shall be 
subject to review under the provisions of Secs. 210.42 through 210.45. 
In

(143determining whether to grant the motion, the administrative law 
judge and the Commission will be guided by practice under Rule 65 of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (taking into account that the roles of 
the parties are reversed in this instance).
    (4) If the Commission determines that a respondent's bond should be 
forfeited to a complainant, and if the bond is being held by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, the Commission Secretary shall promptly 
notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the Commission's determination.

Sec. 210.51  Period for concluding investigation.

    (a) Permanent relief. Within 45 days after institution of the 
investigation, the administrative law judge shall issue an order setting 
a target date for completion of the investigation. If the target date 
does not exceed 15 months from the date of institution of the 
investigation, the order of the administrative law judge shall be final 
and not subject to interlocutory review. If the target date exceeds 15 
months, the order of the administrative law judge shall constitute an 
initial determination. After the target date has been set, it can be 
modified by the administrative law judge for good cause shown before the 
investigation is certified to the Commission or by the Commission after 
the investigation is certified to the Commission. Any extension of the 
target date beyond 15 months, before the investigation is certified to 
the Commission, shall be by initial determination.
    (b) Temporary relief. The temporary relief phase of an investigation 
shall be concluded and a final order issued no later than 90 days after 
publication of the notice of investigation in the Federal Register, 
unless the temporary relief phase of the investigation has been 
designated ``more complicated'' by the Commission or the presiding 
administrative law judge pursuant to Sec. 210.22(c) and Sec. 210.60. If 
that designation has been made, the temporary relief phase of the 
investigation shall be concluded and a final order issued no later than 
150 days after publication of the notice of investigation in the Federal 
Register.
    (c) Computation of time. In computing the deadlines imposed in 
paragraph (b) of this section, there shall be excluded any period during 
which the investigation is suspended pursuant to Sec. 210.23.

Subpart H--Temporary Relief

Sec. 210.52  Motions for temporary relief.

    Requests for temporary relief under section 337 (e) or (f) of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 shall be made through a motion filed in accordance 
with the following provisions:
    (a) A complaint requesting temporary relief shall be accompanied by 
a motion setting forth the complainant's request for such relief. In 
determining whether to grant temporary relief, the Commission will apply 
the standards the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit uses in 
determining whether to affirm lower court decisions granting preliminary 
injunctions. The motion for temporary relief accordingly must contain a 
detailed statement of specific facts bearing on the factors the Federal 
Circuit has stated that a U.S. District Court must consider in granting 
a preliminary injunction.
    (b) The motion must also contain a detailed statement of facts 
bearing on:
    (1) Whether the complainant should be required to post a bond as a 
prerequisite to the issuance of temporary relief; and
    (2) The appropriate amount of the bond, if the Commission determines 
that a bond will be required.
    (c) In determining whether to require a bond as a prerequisite to 
the issuance of temporary relief, the Commission will be guided by 
practice under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (d) The following documents and information also shall be filed 
along with the motion for temporary relief:
    (1) A memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion;
    (2) Affidavits executed by persons with knowledge of the facts 
asserted in the motion; and

[[Page 144]]

(144
    (3) All documents, information, and other evidence in complainant's 
possession that complainant intends to submit in support of the motion.
    (e) If the complaint, the motion for temporary relief, or the 
documentation supporting the motion for temporary relief contains 
confidential business information as defined in Sec. 201.6(a) of this 
chapter, the complainant must follow the procedure outlined in 
Secs. 210.4(a), 210.5(a), 201.6 (a) and (c), 210.8(a), and 210.55 of 
this part.

[59 FR 39039, Aug. 1, 1994, as amended at 59 FR 67629, Dec. 30, 1994; 60 
FR 32444, June 22, 1995]

Sec. 210.53  Motion filed after complaint.

    (a) A motion for temporary relief may be filed after the complaint, 
but must be filed prior to the Commission determination under 
Sec. 210.10 on whether to institute an investigation. A motion filed 
after the complaint shall contain the information, documents, and 
evidence described in Sec. 210.52 and must also make a showing that 
extraordinary circumstances exist that warrant temporary relief and that 
the moving party was not aware, and with due diligence could not have 
been aware, of those circumstances at the time the complaint was filed. 
When a motion for temporary relief is filed after the complaint but 
before the Commission has determined whether to institute an 
investigation based on the complaint, the 35-day period allotted under 
Sec. 210.58 for review of the complaint and informal investigatory 
activity will begin to run anew from the date on which the motion was 
filed.
    (b) A motion for temporary relief may not be filed after an 
investigation has been instituted.

Sec. 210.54  Service of motion by the complainant.

    Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 210.11 regarding service of 
the complaint and motion for temporary relief by the Commission upon 
institution of an investigation, on the day the complainant files a 
complaint and motion for temporary relief with the Commission (see 
Sec. 201.8(a) of this chapter), the complainant must serve 
nonconfidential copies of both documents (as well as nonconfidential 
copies of all materials or documents attached thereto) on all proposed 
respondents and on the embassy in Washington, DC of each country from 
which the allegedly unfair imports come. The complaint and motion shall 
be served by messenger, courier, express mail, or equivalent means. A 
signed certificate of service must accompany the complaint and motion 
for temporary relief. If the certificate does not accompany the 
complaint and the motion, the Secretary shall not accept the complaint 
or the motion and shall promptly notify the submitter. Actual proof of 
service on each respondent and embassy (e.g., certified mail return 
receipts, courier or overnight delivery receipts, or other proof of 
delivery)--or proof of a serious but unsuccessful effort to make such 
service--must be filed within 10 days after the filing of the complaint 
and motion. If the requirements of this section are not satisfied, the 
Commission may extend its 35-day deadline under Sec. 210.58 for 
determining whether to provisionally accept the motion for temporary 
relief and institute an investigation on the basis of the complaint.

Sec. 210.55  Content of service copies.

    (a) Any purported confidential business information that is deleted 
from the nonconfidential service copies of the complaint and motion for 
temporary relief must satisfy the requirements of Sec. 201.6(a) of this 
chapter (which defines confidential information for purposes of 
Commission proceedings). For attachments to the complaint or motion that 
are confidential in their entirety, the complainant must provide a 
nonconfidential summary of what each attachment contains. Despite the 
redaction of confidential material from the complaint and motion for 
temporary relief, the nonconfidential service copies must contain enough 
factual information about each element of the violation alleged in the 
complaint and the motion to enable each proposed respondent to 
comprehend the allegations against it.
    (b) If the Commission determines that the complaint, motion for 
temporary relief, or any exhibits or attachments thereto contain 
excessive designations of confidentiality that are not warranted under 
Sec. 201.6(a) of this

[[Page 145]]

(145chapter, the Commission may require the complainant to file and 
serve new nonconfidential versions of the aforesaid submissions and may 
determine that the 35-day period under Sec. 210.58 for deciding whether 
to institute an investigation and to provisionally accept the motion for 
temporary relief for further processing shall begin to run anew from the 
date the new nonconfidential versions are filed with the Commission and 
served on the proposed respondents.

Sec. 210.56  Notice accompanying service copies.

    (a) Each service copy of the complaint and motion for temporary 
relief shall be accompanied by a notice containing the following text:

    Notice is hereby given that the attached complaint and motion for 
temporary relief will be filed with the U.S. International Trade 
Commission in Washington, DC on __________, 19__. The filing of the 
complaint and motion will not institute an investigation on that date, 
however, nor will it begin the period for filing responses to the 
complaint and motion pursuant to 19 CFR 210.13 and 210.59.
    Upon receipt of the complaint, the Commission will examine the 
complaint for sufficiency and compliance with 19 CFR 201.8, 210.4, 
210.5, 210.8, and 210.12. The Commission's Office of Unfair Import 
Investigations will conduct informal investigatory activity pursuant to 
19 CFR 210.9 to identify sources of relevant information and to assure 
itself of the availability thereof. The motion for temporary relief will 
be examined for sufficiency and compliance with 19 CFR 201.8, 210.4, 
210.5, 210.52, 210.53(a) (if applicable), 210.54, 210.55, and 210.56, 
and will be subject to the same type of preliminary investigative 
activity as the complaint.
    The Commission generally will determine whether to institute an 
investigation on the basis of the complaint and whether to provisionally 
accept the motion for temporary relief within 35 days after the 
complaint and motion are filed or, if the motion is filed after the 
complaint, within 35 days after the motion is filed--unless the 35-day 
deadline is extended pursuant to 19 CFR 210.53, 210.54, 210.55(b), 
210.57, or 210.58. If the Commission determines to institute an 
investigation and provisionally accept the motion, the motion will be 
assigned to a Commission administrative law judge for issuance of an 
initial determination in accordance with 19 CFR 210.66. See 19 CFR 
210.10 and 210.58.
    If the Commission determines to conduct an investigation of the 
complaint and the motion for temporary relief, the investigation will be 
formally instituted on the date the Commission publishes a notice of 
investigation in the Federal Register pursuant to 19 CFR 210.10(b). If 
an investigation is instituted, copies of the complaint, the notice of 
investigation, the motion for temporary relief, and the Commission's 
Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR Part 210) will be served on each 
respondent by the Commission pursuant to 19 CFR 210.11(a). Responses to 
the complaint, the notice of investigation, and the motion for temporary 
relief must be filed within 10 days after Commission service thereof, 
and must comply with 19 CFR 201.8, 210.4, 210.5, 210.13, and 210.59. See 
also 19 CFR 201.14 and 210.6 regarding computation of the 10-day 
response period.
    If, after reviewing the complaint and motion for temporary relief, 
the Commission determines not to institute an investigation, the 
complaint and motion will be dismissed and the Commission will provide 
written notice of that decision and the reasons therefor to the 
complainant and all proposed respondents pursuant to 19 CFR 210.10.
    For information concerning the filing and processing of the 
complaint and its treatment, and to ask general questions concerning 
section 337 practice and procedure, contact the Office of Unfair Import 
Investigations, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., 
Room 401, Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202-205-2560. Such inquiries 
will be referred to the Commission investigative attorney assigned to 
the complaint. (See also the Commissions's Rules of Practice and 
Procedure set forth in 19 CFR Part 210.)
    To learn the date that the Commission will vote on whether to 
institute an investigation and the publication date of the notice of 
investigation (if the Commission decides to institute an investigation), 
contact the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade 
Commission, 500 E Street SW., room 112, Washington, DC 20436, telephone 
202-205-2000.
    This notice is being provided pursuant to 19 CFR 210.56.

    (b) In the event that the complaint and motion for temporary relief 
are filed after the date specified in the above notice, the complainant 
must serve a supplementary notice to all proposed respondents and 
embassies stating the correct filing date. The supplementary notice 
shall be served by messenger, courier, express mail, or equivalent 
means. The complainant shall file a certificate of service and a copy of 
the supplementary notice with the Commission.

Sec. 210.57  Amendment of the motion.

    A motion for temporary relief may be amended at any time prior to 
the institution of an investigation. All material filed to amend the 
motion (or the complaint) must be served on all proposed respondents and 
on the embassies in Washington, DC, of the foreign governments that they 
represent, in accordance with Sec. 210.54. If the amendment expands the 
scope of the motion or changes the complainant's assertions on the issue 
of whether a bond is to be required as a prerequisite to the issuance of 
temporary relief or the appropriate amount of the bond, the 35-day 
period under Sec. 210.58 for determining whether to institute an 
investigation and provisionally accept the motion for temporary relief 
shall begin to run anew from the date the amendment is filed with the 
Commission. A motion for temporary relief may not be amended to expand 
the scope of the temporary relief inquiry after an investigation is 
instituted.

Sec. 210.58  Provisional acceptance of the motion.

    The Commission shall determine whether to accept a motion for 
temporary relief at the same time it determines whether to institute an 
investigation on the basis of the complaint. That determination shall be 
made within 35 days after the complaint and motion for temporary relief 
are filed, unless the 35-day period is restarted pursuant to 
Sec. 210.53(a), 210.54, 210.55, or 210.57, or exceptional circumstances 
exist which preclude adherence to the prescribed deadline. (See 
Sec. 210.10(a)(1).) Before the Commission determines whether to 
provisionally accept a motion for temporary relief, the motion will be 
examined for sufficiency and compliance with Secs. 210.52, 210.53(a) (if 
applicable), 210.54 through 210.56, as well as Secs. 201.8, 210.4, and 
210.5. The motion will be subject to the same type of preliminary 
investigatory activity as the complaint. (See Sec. 210.9(b).) Acceptance 
of a motion pursuant to this paragraph constitutes provisional 
acceptance for referral of the motion to the chief administrative law 
judge, who will assign the motion to a presiding administrative law 
judge for issuance of an initial determination under Sec. 210.66(a). 
Commission rejection of an insufficient or improperly filed complaint 
will preclude acceptance of a motion for temporary relief. Commission 
rejection of a motion for temporary relief will not preclude institution 
of an investigation of the complaint.

Sec. 210.59  Responses to the motion and the complaint.

    (a) Any party may file a response to a motion for temporary relief. 
Unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge, a response to 
a motion for temporary relief in an ordinary investigation must be filed 
not later than 10 days after service of the motion by the Commission. In 
a ``more complicated'' investigation, the response shall be due within 
20 days after such service, unless otherwise ordered by the presiding 
administrative law judge.
    (b) The response must comply with the requirements of Sec. 201.8 of 
this chapter, as well as Secs. 210.4 and 210.5 of this part, and shall 
contain the following information:
    (1) A statement that sets forth with particularity any objection to 
the motion for temporary relief;
    (2) A statement of specific facts concerning the factors the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would consider in determining 
whether to affirm lower court decisions granting or denying preliminary 
injunctions;
    (3) A memorandum of points and authorities in support of the 
respondent's response to the motion;
    (4) Affidavits, where possible, executed by persons with knowledge 
of the facts specified in the response. Each response to the motion must 
address, to the extent possible, the complainant's assertions regarding 
whether a bond should be required and the appropriate amount of the 
bond. Responses to the motion for temporary relief also may contain 
counter-proposals concerning the amount of the bond or the manner in 
which the bond amount should be calculated.
    (c) Each response to the motion for temporary relief must also be 
accompanied by a response to the complaint and notice of investigation. 
Responses to the complaint and notice of investigation must comply with 
Sec. 201.8 of

order issued by the administrative law judge under Sec. 210.34 of this 
part.

Sec. 210.60  Designating an investigation ``more complicated'' for the 
          purpose of adjudicating a motion for temporary relief.

    At the time the Commission determines to institute an investigation 
and provisionally accepts a motion for temporary relief pursuant to 
Sec. 210.58, the Commission may designate the investigation ``more 
complicated'' pursuant to Sec. 210.22(c) for the purpose of obtaining up 
to 60 additional days to adjudicate the motion for temporary relief. In 
the alternative, after the motion for temporary relief is referred to 
the administrative law judge for an initial determination under 
Sec. 210.66(a), the administrative law judge may issue an order, sua 
sponte or on motion, designating the investigation ``more complicated'' 
for the purpose of obtaining additional time to adjudicate the motion 
for temporary relief. Such order shall constitute a final determination 
of the Commission, and notice of the order shall be published in the 
Federal Register. As required by section 337(e)(2) of the Tariff Act of 
1930, the notice shall state the reasons that the temporary relief phase 
of the investigation was designated ``more complicated.'' The ``more 
complicated'' designation may be conferred by the Commission or the 
presiding administrative law judge pursuant to this paragraph on the 
basis of the complexity of the issues raised in the motion for temporary 
relief or the responses thereto, or for other good cause shown.

Sec. 210.61  Discovery and compulsory process.

    The presiding administrative law judge shall set all discovery 
deadlines. The administrative law judge's authority to compel discovery 
includes discovery relating to the following issues:
    (a) Any matter relevant to the motion for temporary relief and the 
responses thereto, including the issues of bonding by the complainant; 
and
    (b) The issues the Commission considers pursuant to sections 337 
(e)(1), (f)(1), and (j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930, viz.,
    (1) The appropriate form of relief (notwithstanding the form 
requested in the motion for temporary relief),
    (2) Whether the public interest precludes that form of relief, and
    (3) The amount of the bond to be posted by the respondents to secure 
importations or sales of the subject imported merchandise while the 
temporary relief order is in effect. The administrative law judge may, 
but is not required to, make findings on the issues specified in 
sections 337 (e)(1), (f)(1), or (j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930. 
Evidence and information obtained through discovery on those issues will 
be used by the parties and considered by the Commission in the context 
of the parties' written submissions on remedy, the public interest, and 
bonding by respondents, which are filed with the Commission pursuant to 
Sec. 210.67(b).

Sec. 210.62  Evidentiary hearing.

    An opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act and Sec. 210.36 of this part will be provided in 
connection with every motion for temporary relief. If a hearing is 
conducted, the presiding administrative law judge may, but is not 
required to, take evidence concerning the issues of remedy, the public 
interest, and bonding by respondents under section 337 (e)(1), (f)(1), 
and (j)(3) of the Tariff Act of 1930.

Sec. 210.63  Proposed findings and conclusions and briefs.

    The administrative law judge shall determine whether and, if so, to 
what extent the parties shall be permitted to file proposed findings of 
fact, proposed conclusions of law, or briefs under Sec. 210.40 
concerning the issues involved in adjudication of the motion for 
temporary relief.

Sec. 210.64  Interlocutory appeals.

    There will be no interlocutory appeals to the Commission under 
Sec. 210.24 on any matter connected with a motion for temporary relief 
that is decided by an administrative law judge

temporary relief.

Sec. 210.65  Certification of the record.

    When the administrative law judge issues an initial determination 
concerning temporary relief pursuant to Sec. 210.66(a), he shall also 
certify to the Commission the record upon which the initial 
determination is based.

Sec. 210.66  Initial determination concerning temporary relief; 
          Commission action thereon.

    (a) On or before the 70th day after publication of the notice of 
investigation in an ordinary investigation, or on or before the 120th 
day after such publication in a ``more complicated'' investigation, the 
administrative law judge will issue an initial determination concerning 
the issues listed in Secs. 210.52 and 210.59. If the 70th day or the 
120th day is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the initial 
determination must be received in the Office of the Secretary no later 
than 12:00 noon on the first business day after the 70-day or 120-day 
deadline. The initial determination may, but is not required to, address 
the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding by the 
respondents pursuant under sections 337 (e)(1), (f)(1), and (j)(3) of 
the Tariff Act of 1930.
    (b) If the initial determination on temporary relief is issued on 
the 70-day or 120-day deadline imposed in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the initial determination will become the Commission's determination 20 
calendar days after issuance thereof in an ordinary case, and 30 
calendar days after issuance in a ``more complicated'' investigation, 
unless the Commission modifies, reverses, or sets aside the initial 
determination in whole or part within that period. If the initial 
determination on temporary relief is issued before the 70-day or 120-day 
deadline imposed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will 
add the extra time to the 20-day or 30-day deadline to which it would 
otherwise have been held. In computing the deadlines imposed by this 
paragraph, intermediary Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays shall 
be included. If the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or 
Federal holiday as defined in Sec. 201.14(a) of this chapter, the 
effective date of the initial determination shall be extended to the 
next business day.
    (c) The Commission will not modify, reverse, or set aside an initial 
determination concerning temporary relief unless the Commission finds 
that a finding of material fact is clearly erroneous, that the initial 
determination contains an error of law, or that there is a policy matter 
warranting discussion by the Commission. All parties may file written 
comments concerning any clear error of material fact, error of law, or 
policy matter warranting such action by the Commission. Such comments 
must be limited to 35 pages in an ordinary investigation and 45 pages in 
a ``more complicated'' investigation. The comments must be filed no 
later than seven calendar days after issuance of the initial 
determination in an ordinary case and 10 calendar days after issuance of 
the initial determination in a ``more complicated'' investigation. In 
computing the aforesaid 7-day and 10-day deadlines, intermediary 
Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays shall be included. If the 
initial determination is issued on a Friday, however, the filing 
deadline for comments shall be measured from the first business day 
after issuance. If the last day of the filing period is a Saturday, 
Sunday, or Federal holiday as defined in Sec. 201.14(a) of this chapter, 
the filing deadline shall be extended to the next business day. The 
parties shall serve their comments on other parties by messenger, 
courier, express mail, or equivalent means.
    (d) Notice of the initial determination shall be served on the other 
agencies listed in Sec. 210.50(a)(2). Those agencies will be given 10 
calendar days from the date of service of the notice to file comments on 
the initial determination.
    (e) (1) Each party may file a response to each set of comments filed 
by another party. All such reply comments must be filed within 10 
calendar days after issuance of the initial determination in an ordinary 
case and within 14 calendar days after issuance of an initial 
determination in a ``more complicated'' investigation. The deadlines

[[Page 149]]

(149for filing reply comments shall be computed in the manner described 
in paragraph (c) of this section, except that in no case shall a party 
have fewer than two calendar days to file reply comments.
    (2) Each set of reply comments will be limited to 20 pages in an 
ordinary investigation and 30 pages in a ``more complicated'' case.
    (f) If the Commission determines to modify, reverse, or set aside 
the initial determination, the Commission will issue a notice and, if 
appropriate, a Commission opinion. If the Commission does not modify, 
reverse, or set aside the administrative law judge's initial 
determination within the time provided under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the initial determination will automatically become the 
determination of the Commission. Notice of the Commission's 
determination concerning the initial determination will be issued on the 
statutory deadline for determining whether to grant temporary relief, or 
as soon as possible thereafter, and will be served on the parties. 
Notice of the determination will be published in the Federal Register if 
the Commission's disposition of the initial determination has resulted 
in a determination that there is reason to believe that section 337 has 
been violated and a temporary remedial order is to be issued. If the 
Commission determines (either by reversing or modifying the 
administrative law judge's initial determination, or by adopting the 
initial determination) that the complainant must post a bond as a 
prerequisite to the issuance of temporary relief, the Commission may 
issue a supplemental notice setting forth conditions for the bond if any 
(in addition to those outlined in the initial determination) and the 
deadline for filing the bond with the Commission.

Sec. 210.67  Remedy, the public interest, and bonding by respondents.

    The procedure for arriving at the Commission's determination of the 
issues of the appropriate form of temporary relief, whether the public 
interest factors enumerated in the statute preclude such relief, and the 
amount of the bond under which respondents' merchandise will be 
permitted to enter the United States during the pendency of any 
temporary relief order issued by the Commission, is as follows:
    (a) While the motion for temporary relief is before the 
administrative law judge, he may compel discovery on matters relating to 
remedy, the public interest, and bonding by respondents (as provided in 
Sec. 210.61). The administrative law judge also is authorized to make 
findings pertaining to the public interest, as provided in 
Sec. 210.66(a). Such findings may be superseded, however, by Commission 
findings on that issue as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) On the 65th day after institution in an ordinary case or on the 
110th day after institution in a ``more complicated'' investigation, all 
parties shall file written submissions with the Commission addressing 
those issues. The submissions shall refer to information and evidence 
already on the record, but additional information and evidence germane 
to the issues of appropriate relief, the statutory public interest 
factors, and bonding by respondents may be provided along with the 
parties' submissions. Pursuant to Sec. 210.50(a)(4), interested persons 
may also file written comments, on the aforesaid dates, concerning the 
issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding by the respondents.
    (c) On or before the 90-day or 150-day statutory deadline for 
determining whether to order temporary relief under section 337 (e)(1) 
and/or (f)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the Commission will determine 
what relief is appropriate in light of any violation that appears to 
exist, whether the public interest factors enumerated in the statute 
preclude the issuance of such relief, and the amount of the bond under 
which the respondents' merchandise will be permitted to enter the United 
States during the pendency of any temporary relief order issued by the 
Commission. In the event that Commission's findings on the public 
interest pursuant to this paragraph are inconsistent with findings made 
by the administrative law judge in the initial determination pursuant to 
Sec. 210.66(a),

[[Page 150]]

(150the Commission's findings are controlling.

Sec. 210.68  Complainant's temporary relief bond.

    (a) In every investigation under this part involving a motion for 
temporary relief, the question of whether the complainant shall be 
required to post a bond as a prerequisite to the issuance of such relief 
shall be addressed by the parties, the presiding administrative law 
judge, and the Commission in the manner described in Secs. 210.52, 
210.59, 210.61, 210.62, and 210.66. If the Commission determines that a 
bond should be required, the bond may consist of one or more of the 
following:
    (1) The surety bond of a surety or guarantee corporation that is 
licensed to do business with the United States in accordance with 31 
U.S.C. 9304-9306 and 31 CFR Parts 223 and 224;
    (2) The surety bond of an individual, a trust, an estate, or a 
partnership, or a corporation, whose solvency and financial 
responsibility will be investigated and verified by the Commission; or
    (3) A certified check, a bank draft, a post office money order, 
cash, a United States bond, a Treasury note, or other Government 
obligation within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9301 and 31 CFR Part 225, 
which is owned by the complainant and tendered in lieu of a surety bond, 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 9303(c) and 31 CFR Part 225.

The same restrictions and requirements applicable to individual and 
corporate sureties on Customs bonds, which are set forth in 19 CFR Part 
113, shall apply with respect to sureties on bonds filed with the 
Commission by complainants as a prerequisite to a temporary relief under 
section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. If the surety is an individual, 
the individual must file an affidavit of the type shown in Appendix A to 
Sec. 210.68. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, while the bond 
of the individual surety is in effect, an updated affidavit must be 
filed every four months (computed from the date on which the bond was 
approved by the Secretary or the Commission).
    (b) The bond and accompanying documentation must be submitted to the 
Commission within the time specified in the Commission notice, order, 
determination, or opinion requiring the posting of a bond, or within 
such other time as the Commission may order. If the bond is not 
submitted within the specified period (and an extension of time has not 
been granted), temporary relief will not be issued.
    (c) The corporate or individual surety on a bond or the person 
posting a certified check, a bank draft, a post office money order, 
cash, a United States bond, a Treasury note, or other Government 
obligation in lieu of a surety bond must provide the following 
information on the face of the bond or in the instrument authorizing the 
Government to collect or sell the bond, certified check, bank draft, 
post office money order, cash, United States bond, Treasury note, or 
other Government obligation in response to a Commission order requiring 
forfeiture of the bond pursuant to Sec. 210.70:
    (1) The investigation caption and docket number;
    (2) The names, addresses, and seals (if appropriate) of the 
principal, the surety, the obligee, as well as the ``attorney in fact'' 
and the registered process agent (if applicable) (see Customs Service 
regulations in 19 CFR Part 113 and Treasury Department regulations in 31 
CFR Parts 223, 224, and 225);
    (3) The terms and conditions of the bond obligation, including the 
reason the bond is being posted, the amount of the bond, the effective 
date and duration of the bond (as prescribed by the Commission order, 
notice, determination, or opinion requiring the complainant to post a 
bond); and
    (4) A section at the bottom of the bond or other instrument for the 
date and authorized signature of the Secretary to reflect Commission 
approval of the bond.
    (d) Complainants who wish to post a certified check, a bank draft, a 
post office money order, cash, a United States bond, a Treasury note, or 
other Government obligation in lieu of a surety bond must notify the 
Commission in writing immediately upon receipt of the Commission 
document requiring the posting of a bond, and must contact the Secretary 
to make arrangements for Commission receipt, handling, management, and 
deposit of the

[[Page 151]]

(151certified check, bank draft, post office money order, cash, United 
States bond, Treasury note, or other Government obligation tendered in 
lieu of a surety bond, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. Sec. 9303, 31 CFR 
Parts 202, 206, and 225 and other governing Treasury regulations and 
circular(s). If required by the governing Treasury regulations and 
circular, a certified check, a bank draft, a post office money order, 
cash, a United States bond, a Treasury note, or other government 
obligation tendered in lieu of a surety bond may have to be 
collateralized. See, e.g., 31 CFR 202.6 and the appropriate Treasury 
Circular.

Sec. 210.69  Approval of complainant's temporary relief bond.

    (a) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. Sec. 9304(b), all bonds posted by 
complainants must be approved by the Commission before the temporary 
relief sought by the complainant will be issued. See also 31 U.S.C. 
Sec. 9303(a) and 31 CFR 225.1 and 225.20. The Commission's bond approval 
officer for purposes of those provisions shall be the Secretary.
    (b) The bond approval process may entail investigation by the 
Secretary or the Commission's Office of Investigations to determine the 
veracity of all factual information set forth in the bond and the 
accompanying documentation (e.g., powers of attorney), as well as any 
additional verification required by 31 CFR Parts 223, 224, or 225. The 
Secretary may reject a bond on one or more of the following grounds:
    (1) Failure to comply with the instructions in the Commission 
determination, order, or notice directing the complainant to post a 
bond;
    (2) Failure of the surety or the bond to provide information or 
supporting documentation required by the Commission, the Secretary, 
Sec. 210.68 of this part, 31 CFR Parts 223 or 224, or other governing 
statutes, regulations, or Treasury circulars, or because of a limitation 
prescribed in a governing statute, regulation, or circular;
    (3) Failure of an individual surety to execute and file with the 
bond, an affidavit of the type shown in Appendix A to Sec. 210.68, which 
sets forth information about the surety's assets, liabilities, net 
worth, real estate and other property of which the initial surety is the 
sole owner, other bonds on which the individual surety is a surety (and 
which must be updated at 4-month intervals while the bond is in effect, 
measured from the date on which the bond is approved by the Secretary on 
behalf of the Commission or by the Commission);
    (4) Any question about the solvency or financial responsibility of 
the surety, or any question of fraud, misrepresentation, or perjury 
which comes to light as a result of the verification inquiry during the 
bond approval process; and
    (5) Any other reason deemed appropriate by the Secretary.
    (c) If the complainant believes that the Secretary's rejection of 
the bond was erroneous as a matter of law, the complainant may appeal 
the Secretary's rejection of the bond by filing a petition with the 
Commission in the form of a letter to the Chairman, within 10 days after 
service of the rejection letter.
    (d) After the bond is approved and temporary relief is issued, if 
any question concerning the continued solvency of the individual or the 
legality or enforceability of the bond or undertaking develops, the 
Commission may take the following action(s), sua sponte or on motion;
    (1) Revoke the Commission approval of the bond and require 
complainant to post a new bond; or
    (2) Revoke or vacate the temporary remedial order for public 
interest reasons or changed conditions of law or fact (criteria that are 
the basis for modification or rescission of final Commission action 
pursuant to Sec. 210.76(a)(1) and (b)); or
    (3) Notify the Treasury Department if the problem involves a 
corporate surety licensed to do business with the United States under 31 
U.S.C. Secs. 9303-9306 and 31 CFR Parts 223 and 224; or
    (4) Refer the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice if there is a 
suggestion of fraud, perjury, or related conduct.

Sec. 210.70  Forfeiture or return of complainant's temporary relief 
          bond.

    (a)(1) If the Commission determines that one or more of the 
respondents whose merchandise was covered by the temporary relief order 
has not violated

[[Page 153]]

(153section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to the extent alleged in the 
motion for temporary relief and provided for in the temporary relief 
order, proceedings to determine whether the complainant's bond should be 
forfeited to one or more respondents in whole or part may be initiated 
upon the filing of a motion by a respondent within 30 days after filing 
of the aforesaid Commission determination on violation.
    (2) A complainant may file a motion for the return of its bond.
    (b) Any nonmoving party may file a response to a motion filed under 
paragraph (a) of this section within 15 days after filing of the motion, 
unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge.
    (c) A motion for forfeiture or return of a complainant's temporary 
relief bond in whole or part will be adjudicated by the administrative 
law judge in an initial determination with a 45-day effective date, 
which shall be subject to review under the provisions of Secs. 210.42 
through 210.45. In determining whether to grant the motion, the 
administrative law judge and the Commission will be guided by practice 
under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

[59 FR 67629, Dec. 30, 1994]

Sec. 210.71  Information gathering.

    (a) Power to require information. (1) Whenever the Commission issues 
an exclusion order, the Commission may require any person to report 
facts available to that person that will help the Commission assist the 
U.S. Customs Service in determining whether and to what extent there is 
compliance with the order or whether and to what extent the conditions 
that led to the order are changed. Similarly, whenever the Commission 
issues a cease and desist order or a consent order, it may require any 
person to report facts available to that person that will aid the 
Commission in determining whether and to what extent there is compliance 
with the order or whether and to what extent the conditions that led to 
the order are changed.
    (2) The Commission may also include provisions that exercise any 
other information-gathering power available to the Commission by law, 
regardless of whether the order at issue is an exclusion order, a cease 
and desist order, or a consent order. The Commission may at any time 
request the cooperation of any person or agency in supplying it with 
information that will aid the Commission or the U.S. Customs Service in 
making the determinations described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Form and detail of reports. Reports under paragraph (a) of this 
section are to be in writing, under oath, and in such detail and in such 
form as the Commission prescribes.
    (c) Power to enforce informational requirements. Terms and 
conditions of exclusion orders, cease and desist orders, and consent 
orders for reporting and information gathering shall be enforceable by 
the Commission by a civil action under 19 U.S.C. Sec. 1333, or, at the 
Commission's discretion, in the same manner as any other provision of 
the exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order is 
enforced.
    (d) Term of reporting requirement. An exclusion order, cease and 
desist order, or consent order may provide for the frequency of 
reporting or information gathering and the date on which these 
activities are to terminate. If no date for termination is provided, 
reporting and information gathering shall terminate when the exclusion 
order, cease and desist order, or consent order or any amendment to it 
expires by its own terms or is terminated.

Sec. 210.72  Confidentiality of information.

    Confidential information (as defined in Sec. 201.6(a) of this 
chapter) that is provided to the Commission pursuant to exclusion order, 
cease and desist order, or consent order will be received by the 
Commission in confidence. Requests for confidential treatment shall 
comply with Sec. 201.6 of this chapter. The restrictions on disclosure 
and the procedures for handling such information (which are set out in 
Secs. 210.5 and 210.39) shall apply and, in a proceeding under 
Secs. 210.75 or 210.76, the Commission or the presiding administrative 
law judge may, upon motion or sua sponte, issue or continue appropriate 
protective orders.

[[Page 154]]

(154

Sec. 210.73  Review of reports.

    (a) Review to insure compliance. The Commission, through the Office 
of Unfair Import Investigations, will review reports submitted pursuant 
to any exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order and 
conduct such further investigation as it deems necessary to insure 
compliance with its orders.
    (b) Extension of time. The Director of the Office of Unfair Import 
Investigations may, for good cause shown, extend the time in which 
reports required by exclusion orders, cease and desist orders, and 
consent orders may be filed. An extension of time within which a report 
may be filed, or the filing of a report that does not evidence full 
compliance with the order, does not in any circumstances suspend or 
relieve a respondent from its obligation under the law with respect to 
compliance with such order.

Sec. 210.74  Modification of reporting requirements.

    (a) Exclusion and cease and desist orders. The Commission may modify 
reporting requirements of exclusion and cease and desist orders as 
necessary:
    (1) To help the Commission assist the U.S. Customs Service in 
ascertaining that there has been compliance with an outstanding 
exclusion order;
    (2) To help the Commission ascertain that there has been compliance 
with a cease and desist order;
    (3) To take account of changed circumstances; or
    (4) To minimize the burden of reporting or informational access.

An order to modify reporting requirements shall identify the reports 
involved and state the reason or reasons for modification. No reporting 
requirement will be suspended during the pendency of such a modification 
unless the Commission so orders. The Commission may, if the public 
interest warrants, announce that a modification of reporting is under 
consideration and ask for comment, but it may also modify any reporting 
requirement at any time without notice, consistent with the standards of 
this section.
    (b) Consent orders. Consistent with the standards set forth in 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission may modify reporting 
requirements of consent orders. The Commission shall serve notice of any 
proposed change, together with the reporting requirements to be modified 
and the reasons therefor, on each party subject to the consent order. 
Such parties shall be given the opportunity to submit briefs to the 
Commission, and the Commission may hold a hearing on the matter. Notice 
of any proposed change in the reporting requirements will be published 
in the Federal Register if the Commission determines to solicit public 
comment on the proposed change.

[59 FR 39039, Aug. 1, 1994, as amended at 60 FR 53121, Oct. 12, 1995]

Sec. 210.75  Proceedings to enforce exclusion orders, cease and desist 
          orders, consent orders, and other Commission orders.

    (a) Informal enforcement proceedings. Informal enforcement 
proceedings may be conducted by the Commission, through the Office of 
Unfair Import Investigations, with respect to any act or omission by any 
person in possible violation of any provision of an exclusion order, 
cease and desist order, or consent order. Such matters may be handled by 
the Commission through correspondence or conference or in any other way 
that the Commission deems appropriate. The Commission may issue such 
orders as it deems appropriate to implement and insure compliance with 
the terms of an exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent 
order, or any part thereof. Any matter not disposed of informally may be 
made the subject of a formal proceeding pursuant to this subpart.
    (b) Formal enforcement proceedings. (1) The Commission may institute 
an enforcement proceeding at the Commission level upon the filing by the 
complainant in the original investigation or his successor in interest, 
by the Office of Unfair Import Investigations, or by the Commission of a 
complaint setting forth alleged violations of any exclusion order, cease 
and desist order, or consent order. If a proceeding is instituted, the 
complaint shall be served upon the alleged violator and a notice of 
institution published in the Federal Register. Within 15 days after the 
date of service of such a complaint, the named respondent shall file a 
response

[[Page 155]]

(155to it. Responses shall fully advise the Commission as to the nature 
of any defense and shall admit or deny each allegation of the complaint 
specifically and in detail unless the respondent is without knowledge, 
in which case its answer shall so state and the statement shall operate 
as a denial. Allegations of fact not denied or controverted may be 
deemed admitted. Matters alleged as affirmative defenses shall be 
separately stated and numbered.
    (2) Upon the failure of a respondent to file and serve a response 
within the time and in the manner prescribed herein the Commission, in 
its discretion, may find the facts alleged in the complaint to be true 
and take such action as may be appropriate without notice or hearing, 
or, in its discretion, proceed without notice to take evidence on the 
allegations set forth in the complaint, provided that the Commission (or 
administrative law judge, if one is appointed) may permit late filings 
of an answer for good cause shown.
    (3) The Commission, in the course of a formal enforcement proceeding 
under this section may hold a public hearing and afford the parties to 
the enforcement proceeding the opportunity to appear and be heard. The 
hearing will not be subject to sections 554, 555, 556, 557, and 702 of 
title 5 of the United States Code. The Commission may delegate the 
hearing to the chief administrative law judge for designation of a 
presiding administrative law judge, who shall certify an initial 
determination to the Commission. That initial determination shall become 
the determination of the Commission 90 days after the date of service of 
the initial determination, unless the Commission, within 90 days after 
the date of such service shall have ordered review of the initial 
determination on certain issues therein, or by order shall have changed 
the effective date of the initial determination.
    (4) Upon conclusion of a formal enforcement proceeding under this 
section, the Commission may:
    (i) Modify a cease and desist order, consent order, and/or exclusion 
order in any manner necessary to prevent the unfair practices that were 
originally the basis for issuing such order;
    (ii) Bring civil actions in a United States district court pursuant 
to paragraph (c) of this section (and section 337(f)(2) of the Tariff 
Act of 1930) requesting the imposition of a civil penalty or the 
issuance of injunctions incorporating the relief sought by the 
Commission; or
    (iii) Revoke the cease and desist order or consent order and direct 
that the articles concerned be excluded from entry into the United 
States.
    (5) Prior to effecting any modification, revocation, or exclusion 
under this section, the Commission shall consider the effect of such 
action upon the public health and welfare, competitive conditions in the 
U.S. economy, the production of like or directly competitive articles in 
the United States, and U.S. consumers.
    (6) In lieu of or in addition to taking the action provided for in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Commission may issue, pursuant to 
section 337(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, an order providing that any 
article imported in violation of the provisions of section 337 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 and an outstanding final exclusion order issued 
pursuant to section 337(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930 be seized and 
forfeited to the United States, if the following conditions are 
satisfied:
    (i) The owner, importer, or consignee of the article (or the agent 
of such person) previously attempted to import the article into the 
United States;
    (ii) The article previously was denied entry into the United States 
by reason of a final exclusion order; and
    (iii) Upon such previous denial of entry, the Secretary of the 
Treasury provided the owner, importer, or consignee of the article (or 
the agent of such person) with written notice of the aforesaid exclusion 
order and the fact that seizure and forfeiture would result from any 
further attempt to import the article into the United States.
    (c) Court enforcement. To enforce an exclusion order, a cease and 
desist order, a consent order, or a sanctions order, the Commission may 
initiate a civil action in the U.S. district court

[[Page 156]]

(156pursuant to section 337(f)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, requesting 
the imposition of such civil penalty or the issuance of such injunctions 
as the Commission deems necessary to enforce its orders and protect the 
public interest. The Commission may initiate a proceeding to obtain 
judicial enforcement without any other type of proceeding otherwise 
available under section 337 or this subpart or without prior notice to 
any person, except as required by the court in which the civil action is 
initiated.

Sec. 210.76  Modification or rescission of exclusion orders, cease and 
          desist orders, and consent orders.

    (a) Petitions for modification or rescission of exclusion orders, 
cease and desist orders, and consent orders. (1) Whenever any person 
believes that changed conditions of fact or law, or the public interest, 
require that an exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent 
order be modified or set aside, in whole or in part, such person may 
file with the Commission a petition requesting such relief. The 
Commission may also on its own initiative consider such action. The 
petition shall state the changes desired and the changed circumstances 
warranting such action, shall include materials and argument in support 
thereof, and shall be served on all parties to the investigation in 
which the exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent order was 
issued. Any person may file an opposition to the petition within 10 days 
of service of the petition.
    (2) If the petitioner previously has been found by the Commission to 
be in violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and if its 
petition requests a Commission determination that the petitioner is no 
longer in violation of that section or requests modification or 
rescission of an order issued pursuant to section 337 (d), (e), (f), 
(g), or (i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, the burden of proof in any 
proceeding initiated in response to the petition pursuant to paragraph 
(b) of this section shall be on the petitioner. In accordance with 
section 337(k)(2) of the Tariff Act, relief may be granted by the 
Commission with respect to such petition on the basis of new evidence or 
evidence that could not have been presented at the prior proceeding or 
on grounds that would permit relief from a judgment or order under the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (b) Commission action upon receipt of petition. The Commission may 
thereafter institute a proceeding to modify or rescind the exclusion 
order, cease and desist order, or consent order by issuing a notice. The 
Commission may hold a public hearing and afford interested persons the 
opportunity to appear and be heard. After consideration of the petition, 
any responses thereto, and any information placed on the record at a 
public hearing or otherwise, the Commission shall take such action as it 
deems appropriate. The Commission may delegate any hearing under this 
section to the chief administrative law judge for designation of a 
presiding administrative law judge, who shall certify a recommended 
determination to the Commission.

[59 FR 39039, Aug. 1, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 43433, Aug. 23, 1996]

Sec. 210.77  Temporary emergency action.

    (a) Whenever the Commission determines, pending a formal enforcement 
proceeding under Sec. 210.75(b), that without immediate action a 
violation of an exclusion order, cease and desist order, or consent 
order will occur and that subsequent action by the Commission would not 
adequately repair substantial harm caused by such violation, the 
Commission may immediately and without hearing or notice modify or 
revoke such order and, if it is revoked, replace the order with an 
appropriate exclusion order.
    (b) Prior to taking any action under this section, the Commission 
shall consider the effect of such action upon the public health and 
welfare, competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, the production of 
like or directly competitive articles in the United States, and U.S. 
consumers. The Commission shall, if it has not already done so, 
institute a formal enforcement proceeding under Sec. 210.75(b) at the 
time of taking action

[[Page 157]]

(157under this section or as soon as possible thereafter, in order to 
give the alleged violator and other interested parties a full 
opportunity to present information and views regarding the continuation, 
modification, or revocation of Commission action taken under this 
section.

Sec. 210.78  Notice of enforcement action to Government agencies.

    (a) Consultation. The Commission may consult with or seek 
information from any Government agency when taking any action under this 
subpart.
    (b) Notification of Treasury. The Commission shall notify the 
Secretary of the Treasury of any action under this subpart that results 
in a permanent or temporary exclusion of articles from entry, or the 
revocation of an order to such effect, or the issuance of an order 
compelling seizure and forfeiture of imported articles.

Sec. 210.79  Advisory opinions.

    (a) Advisory opinions. Upon request of any person, the Commission 
may, upon such investigation as it deems necessary, issue an advisory 
opinion as to whether the person's proposed course of action or conduct 
would violate a Commission exclusion order, cease and desist order, or 
consent order. The Commission will consider whether the issuance of such 
an advisory opinion would facilitate the enforcement of section 337 of 
the Tariff Act of 1930, would be in the public interest, and would 
benefit consumers and competitive conditions in the United States, and 
whether the person has a compelling business need for the advice and has 
framed his request as fully and accurately as possible. Advisory opinion 
proceedings are not subject to sections 554, 555, 556, 557, and 702 of 
title 5 of the United States Code.
    (b) Revocation. The Commission may at any time reconsider any advice 
given under this section and, where the public interest requires, revoke 
its prior advice. In such event the person will be given notice of the 
Commission's intent to revoke as well as an opportunity to submit its 
views to the Commission. The Commission will not proceed against a 
person for violation of an exclusion order, cease and desist order, or 
consent order with respect to any action that was taken in good faith 
reliance upon the Commission's advice under this section, if all 
relevant facts were accurately presented to the Commission and such 
action was promptly discontinued upon notification of revocation of the 
Commission's advice.

Subpart A--General Provisions

Sec. 212.01  Purpose.

    (a) The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called ``the 
Act'' in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other 
expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties

[[Page 158]]

(158to certain administrative proceedings (called ``adversary 
adjudications'') before an agency. Under the Act an eligible party may 
receive an award when it prevails over an agency, unless the agency's 
position in the proceeding was substantially justified or special 
circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the 
parties eligible for awards and the Commission proceedings that are 
covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures 
and standards that the Commission will use to make them.

Sec. 212.02  When the Act applies.

    The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending before the 
Commission at any time between October 1, 1981 and September 30, 1984. 
This includes proceedings begun before October 1, 1981 if final 
Commission action has not been taken before that date, and proceedings 
pending on September 30, 1984, regardless of when they were initiated or 
when final Commission action occurs.

Sec. 212.03  Proceedings covered.

    (a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the 
Commission. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the 
position of the Commission is presented by an attorney or other 
representative who enters an appearance and participates in the 
proceeding. The Commission proceedings covered are those conducted under 
section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337. No award shall be 
made, however, for fees and expenses related to those portions of the 
proceedings conducted for the consideration of relief, the public 
interest, and bonding pursuant to subsections 337 (d), (e), and (f) of 
the Tariff Act of 1930 and 19 CFR 210.14.
    (b) An award may be made against the Commission only in connection 
with a proceeding brought by the Commission upon its own complaint.
    (c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and 
matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include 
only fees and expenses related to covered issues.

Sec. 212.04  Eligibility of applicants.

    (a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses 
under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary 
adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term party is defined in 5 
U.S.C. 551(3) and 19 CFR 210.04. The applicant must show that it meets 
all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart and in subpart B.
    (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
    (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $1 million;
    (2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth 
of not more than $5 million, including both personal and business 
interests, and not more than 500 employees;
    (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in 
section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) 
with not more than 500 employees;
    (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the 
Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1144j(a)) with not more than 500 
employees; and
    (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or 
private organization with a net worth of not more than $5 million and 
not more than 500 employees.
    (c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of 
employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the 
adversary adjudication was initiated.
    (d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be 
considered to be an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an 
unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails 
are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business 
interests.
    (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly 
perform services for remuneration for the applicant under the 
applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included 
on a proportional basis.
    (f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all 
of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any 
individual, corporation or other entity that directly

[[Page 159]]

(159or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or 
other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of 
which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority 
of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate 
for purposes of this part, unless the presiding officer determines that 
such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act 
in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In 
addition, the presiding officer may determine that financial 
relationships of the applicant other than those described in this 
paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award 
unjust.
    (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on 
behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible 
is not itself eligible for an award.

Sec. 212.05  Standards for awards.

    (a) The determination whether an applicant is a prevailing party 
shall be made on a case-by-case basis.
    (b) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with an adversary adjudication, or in a 
significant and discrete substantive portion of the adversary 
adjudication, unless the position of the Commission investigative 
attorney was substantially justified. The burden of proof that an award 
should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the 
Commission investigative attorney. An award may be avoided by showing 
that the position of the Commission was reasonable in law and fact.
    (c) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly 
or unreasonably protracted the adversary adjudication or if special 
circumstances make the award sought unjust. The burden of proof that an 
award should be reduced or denied for either of these reasons is on the 
Commission investigative attorney.

Sec. 212.06  Allowable fees and expenses.

    (a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons 
engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert 
witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at 
a reduced rate to the applicant.
    (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules 
may exceed $75.00 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may 
exceed the highest rate at which the Commission pays expert witnesses. 
However, an award may include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, 
agent, or expert witness as a separate item if the attorney, agent or 
expert witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.
    (c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an 
attorney, agent or expert witness, the presiding officer shall consider 
the following:
    (1) If the attorney, agent or expert witness is in private practice, 
his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the 
applicant, the fully allocated cost of the service;
    (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in 
which the attorney, agent or expert witness ordinarily performs 
services;
    (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
    (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or 
complexity of the issues in the adversary adjudication; and
    (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services 
provided.
    (d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, 
test, project or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be 
awarded to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed 
the prevailing rate for similar services and the study or other matter 
was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

Sec. 212.07  Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.

    (a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special 
circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to 
handle certain types of proceedings), the Commission may adopt 
regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher 
than $75 per hour in the proceedings covered by this part. The 
Commission will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose

[[Page 160]]

(160under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative 
Procedure Act.
    (b) Any person may file with the Commission a petition for 
rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees. The petition 
should identify the rate the petitioner believes the Commission should 
establish. It should also explain fully the reasons why the higher rate 
is warranted. The Commission will respond to the petition within 60 days 
after it is filed by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying the 
petition, or taking other appropriate action.


<R04>
Subpart B--Information Required From Applicants

Sec. 212.10  Contents of application.

    (a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act 
shall identify the applicant and the adversary adjudication for which an 
award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has 
prevailed and identify the position of the Commission investigative 
attorney that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. 
Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state 
the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type 
and purpose of its organization or business.
    (b) The application shall also include a statement that the 
applicant's net worth does not exceed $1 million (if an individual) or 
$5 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). 
However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
    (1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service 
that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of 
the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) or, in the case of a 
tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the 
Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that 
describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under 
such section; or
    (2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in 
section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)).
    (c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for 
which an award is sought.
    (d) The application may also include any other matters that the 
applicant wishes the Commission to consider in determining whether and 
in what amount an award should be made.
    (e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an 
authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain 
or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or under penalty 
of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and 
correct.

Sec. 212.11  Net worth exhibit.

    (a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or 
cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed 
exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as 
defined in Sec. 212.04(f) of this part) when the proceeding was 
initiated. The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant 
that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' 
assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the 
applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The presiding 
officer may require an applicant to file additional information to 
determine its eligibility for an award.
    (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public 
record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public 
disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes 
there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit 
that portion of the exhibit directly to the presiding officer in a 
sealed envelope labeled ``Confidential Financial Information,'' 
accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public 
disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be 
withheld and explain in detail why it falls within one or more of the 
specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the 
information would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is 
not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be 
served on the

[[Page 161]]

(161Commission investigative attorney or counsel representing another 
agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be 
served on any other party to the proceeding. If the presiding officer 
finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it 
shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any 
request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in 
accordance with the Commission's established procedures under the 
Freedom of Information Act, 19 CFR 201.17--201.21.

Sec. 212.12  Documentation of fees and expenses.

    The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the 
fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, 
engineering report, test, project or similar matter, for which an award 
is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each 
professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the 
application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding 
by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, 
the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which 
reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount 
paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for 
the services provided. The presiding officer may require the applicant 
to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses 
claimed.

Sec. 212.13  When an application may be filed.

    (a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed 
in the adversary adjudication or in a significant and discrete 
substantive portion of the adversary adjudication, but in no case later 
than 30 days after the Commission's final disposition of the adversary 
adjudication.
    (b) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a 
determination as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, 
proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final 
disposition of the underlying controversy.


<R04>
Subpart C--Procedures for Considering Applications

Sec. 212.20  Filing and service of documents.

    Any application for an award or other pleading or document related 
to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the 
adversary adjudication in the same manner as other pleadings in the 
adversary adjudication, except as provided in Sec. 212.11(b) for 
confidential financial information.

Sec. 212.21  Answer to application.

    (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, the Commission 
investigative attorney shall file an answer to the application.
    (b) If the applicant and the Commission investigative attorney 
believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may 
jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The 
filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for 
an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the 
presiding officer upon request by the applicant and the Commission 
investigative attorney.
    (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award 
requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the position of 
the Commission. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already 
in the record of the adversary adjudication, the Commission 
investigative attorney shall include with the answer supporting 
affidavits or a request for further proceedings under Sec. 212.25.

Sec. 212.22  Reply.

    Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a 
reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the 
record of the adversary adjudication, the applicant shall include with 
the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further 
proceedings under Sec. 212.25.

Sec. 212.23  Comments by other parties.

    Any party to the adversary adjudication other than the applicant and 
the Commission investigative attorney may file comments on an 
application within 30 days after it is served or on

[[Page 162]]

(162an answer within 15 days after it is served. A commenting party may 
not participate further in proceedings on the application unless the 
presiding officer determines that the public interest requires such 
participation in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in 
the comments.

Sec. 212.24  Settlement.

    The applicant and the Commission may agree on a proposed settlement 
of the award before final action on the application, either in 
connection with a settlement of the underlying adversary adjudication, 
or after the underlying adversary adjudication has been concluded. If a 
prevailing party and the Commission investigative attorney agree on a 
proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, 
the application shall be filed with the proposed settlement.

Sec. 212.25  Further proceedings.

    (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the 
basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant 
or the Commission investigative attorney, or on his or her own 
initiative, the presiding officer may in his or her discretion order 
further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, 
additional written submissions or an evidentiary hearing. Such further 
proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair 
resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be 
conducted as promptly as possible.
    (b) A request that the presiding officer order further proceedings 
under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or 
the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are 
necessary to resolve the issues.

Sec. 212.26  Determination.

    The presiding officer shall issue a recommended determination on the 
application within 90 days after completion of proceedings on the 
application. The determination shall include written findings and 
conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as prevailing 
party, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the 
amount requested and the amount awarded. The determination shall also 
include, if at issue, findings on whether the position of the Commission 
investigative attorney was substantially justified, whether the 
applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or whether special 
circumstances make an award unjust.

Sec. 212.27  Agency review.

    Except as otherwise authorized by the presiding officer, the parties 
shall be allowed ten (10) days from the date of service of the 
recommended determination to file exceptions to the recommended 
determination and alternative findings of fact and conclusions of law 
with the Commission. Upon receipt of the recommended determination, the 
Commission shall review the same and issue a final determination on the 
application or remand the application to the presiding officer for 
further proceedings.

Sec. 212.28  Judicial review.

    Judicial review of final Commission determinations on awards may be 
sought as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).

Sec. 212.29  Payment of award.

    An applicant seeking payment of an award shall submit to the Finance 
and Budget Division of the Commission a copy of the Commission's final 
determination granting the award, accompanied by a statement that the 
applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States 
courts. The address for submission to the Commission is: United States 
International Trade Commission, Finance and Budget Division, 500 E 
Street SW., Washington, DC 20436. The Commission will pay the amount to

    (a) Office. The Trade Remedy Assistance Office (hereinafter Office) 
provides general information to the public, upon request, and, to the 
extent feasible, assistance and advice to interested parties concerning

    (d) Technical Assistance. Technical assistance is informal advice 
and assistance, including informal legal advice, intended to enable 
eligible small businesses to determine the appropriateness of pursuing 
particular trade remedies, to prepare petitions and complaints (other

identified in Sec. 213.2(b). Technical assistance is available to

regarding proceedings under the trade laws listed in Sec. 213.2(b). 
Technical assistance does not include legal representation of an 
eligible small business or advocacy on its behalf and receipt of 
technical assistance does not ensure that the recipient will prevail in 
any trade remedy proceeding. The Office provides such technical 
assistance independently of other Commission staff but may consult with 
other staff as appropriate.
    (e) Applicant. An applicant is an individual, partnership, 
corporation, joint venture, trade or other association, cooperative, 
group of workers, or certified or recognized union, or other entity that 
applies for techincal assistance under this part.

applicant that the Office has determined to be entitled to technical 
assistance in accordance with the SBA size standards and the procedures 
set forth in this part.
    (g) SBA size standards. SBA size standards are the small business 
size standards of the Small Business Administration set forth in 13 CFR 
121.2. The SBA size standards categorize business concerns according to 
the Standard Industrial Classification (``SIC'') code of the Bureau of 
the Census and base the size determination upon the number of employees 
or annual receipts of the business concern in the appropriate SIC 
category.

Sec. 213.3  Determination of small business eligibility.

    (a) Application for technical assistance from small businesses. An 
applicant for technical assistance must certify that it qualifies as a 
small business under the appropriate size standard(s) and that it is an 
independently owned and operated company. An application for technical 
assistance is available from the Office. The application must be signed 
under oath by an officer or principal of the applicant. The completed 
application should be submitted to the Office at the address set forth 
in Sec. 213.2(a).
    (b) Application for technical assistance from joint applicants, 
trade associations and unions. If several businesses jointly or 
simultaneously from the same industry apply for technical assistance, 
each business must meet the appropriate SBA size standard(s) and so 
certify. If a trade association applies for technical assistance, an 
officer of the trade association must certify that eighty (80) percent 
of the trade association's members are companies that meet the 
appropriate size standard(s) and provide a listing of members of the 
association. If a union applies for technical assistance, an officer of 
the union must certify that the union has less than ten thousand 
(10,000) members within the industry for which trade relief is being 
sought. Applications for trade associations or for unions to request 
technical assistance are available from the Office. Applications must be 
signed under oath by an officer of the association or union and 
completed applications should be submitted to the Office as set forth in 
Sec. 213.2(a).
    (c) Determination of eligibility and notification of determination. 
The Office shall determine whether the applicant is eligible for 
technical assistance and notify the applicant of the determination 
within ten (10) days of receipt of a properly completed application. 
Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1339(c)(1), the Office's determination of 
eligibility is not reviewable by any other agency or by any court.
    (d) Notification to administering agencies. When an applicant seeks 
technical assistance on matters involving the trade laws, and the Office 
determines

[[Page 165]]

(165that the applicant is eligible for technical assistance, the Office 
shall:
    (1) Promptly notify the appropriate administering agency or agencies 
of the Office's determination that the applicant is eligible to receive 
technical assistance; and
    (2) Consult with the administering agency or agencies as to the 
provision of technical assistance to that applicant.

Sec. 213.4  Disclosure of receipt of technical assistance.

    An eligible small business that has received technical assistance 
from the Office must state that it has received technical assistance 
from the Trade Remedy Assistance Office in any resulting petition, 
complaint or application which is filed with the Commission or any other 
agency which administers the trade law under which remedies or benefits 
are sought.

Sec. 213.5  Access to Commission resources.

    Commission resources, in addition to the Office's resources, are 
available to an eligible small business to the same extent as those 
resources are available to members of the general public. No special 
rights of access to Commission resources shall be accorded to an 
eligible small business.

Sec. 213.6  Information concerning assistance.

    Any person may contact the Office with questions regarding 
eligibility for technical assistance. Summaries of the trade laws and 
the SBA size standards can be obtained by writing to the Trade Remedy 
Assistance Office, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street

which is subject to two or more orders under this part if the Secretary 
concludes from available information, including information in a request 
for monitoring under this paragraph, that:
    (i) There is reason to believe or suspect an extraordinary pattern 
of persistent injurious dumping exists with regard to shipments from one 
or more additional supplier countries; and
    (ii) This extraordinary pattern is causing a serious commercial 
problem for the industry.

Sec. 353.13  Determination of sufficiency of petition.

    (a) Determination of sufficiency--(1) In general. Except as provided 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, not later than 20 days after a 
petition is filed under Sec. 353.12, the Secretary will determine 
whether the petition properly alleges the basis on which an antidumping 
duty may be imposed under section 731 of the Act, contains information 
reasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations, is 
filed by an interested party as defined in paragraph (k)(3), (k)(4), 
(k)(5), or (k)(6) of Sec. 353.2, and is filed by or on behalf of the 
domestic industry.
    (2) Extension where polling required. Where the Secretary is 
required to poll or otherwise determine support for the petition by the 
domestic industry under section 732(c)(4)(D) of the Act, the Secretary 
may, in exceptional circumstances, apply paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section by substituting ``a maximum of 40 days'' for ``20 days''.
    (b) Notice of initiation. If the Secretary determines that the 
petition is sufficient under paragraph (a), the Secretary will initiate 
an investigation and publish in the Federal Register notice of 
``Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation.'' The notice will 
include the information described in Sec. 353.11(a)(2). The Secretary

directly involved in the proceeding all information upon which the 
Secretary based the initiation and which the Commission may consider 
relevant to its injury determinations.
    (c) Insufficiency of petition. If the Secretary determines that a 
petition is insufficient under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Secretary will dismiss the petition in whole or in part and, if 
appropriate, terminate the proceeding. The Secretary will notify the 
petitioner in writing of the reasons for dismissal, notify the 
Commission of the dismissal and publish in the Federal Register notice 
of ``Dismissal of Antidumping Duty Petition,'' summarizing the reasons 
for dismissal.

[54 FR 12769, Mar. 28, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 25134, May 11, 1995]

Sec. 353.14  Request for exclusion from antidumping duty order.

    (a) Any producer or reseller that desires exclusion from an 
antidumping duty order must submit to the Secretary, not later than 30 
days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation under 
Sec. 353.11 or 353.13, an irrevocable written request for exclusion.
    (b) The person must submit with the request: (1) The person's 
certification that:
    (i) There is no dumping margin on the merchandise sold or likely to 
be sold, as defined in Sec. 353.2(t), by the person during the minimum 
period described in Sec. 353.42(b)(1); and
    (ii) The person will not in the future sell the merchandise at less 
than foreign market value; and

[[Page 175]]

(175
    (2) If the person is not the producer of the merchandise, the 
certification under paragraph (b)(1) of this section of the suppliers 
and producers of the merchandise.
    (c) The Secretary will investigate requests for exclusion to the

Sec. 353.15  Preliminary determination.

    (a) In general. (1) Not later than 140 days after the date on which 
the Secretary initiates an investigation under Sec. 353.11 or 
Sec. 353.13, the Secretary will make a determination based on the 
available information at the time whether there is a reasonable basis to 
believe or suspect that the merchandise is being sold at less than fair 
value. The Secretary will not make the determination unless the 
Commission has made an affirmative preliminary determination.
    (2) The Secretary's determination will include:
    (i) The factual and legal conclusions on which the determination is 
based;
    (ii) The estimated weighted-average dumping margin, if any, for each 
person investigated and an appropriate rate for persons not 
investigated; and
    (iii) A preliminary finding on critical circumstances, if

    (3) If affirmative, the Secretary's determination will also:
    (i) Order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of the 
merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or 
after the date of publication of the notice of the Secretary's 
preliminary determination; and
    (ii) Impose provisional measures by instructing the Customs Service 
to require for each entry of the merchandise suspended under this 
paragraph a cash deposit or bond equal to the estimated weighted-average 
dumping margin.
    (4) The Secretary will publish in the Federal Register notice of 
``Affirmative (Negative) Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination,'' 
including the estimated weighted-average dumping margin, if any, and an 
invitation for argument consistent with Sec. 353.38.
    (5) The Secretary will notify all parties to the proceeding and the 
Commission.
    (b) Postponement in extraordinarily complicated investigation. If 
the Secretary decides the investigation is extraordinarily complicated, 
the Secretary may postpone the preliminary determination to not later 
than 190 days after the date on which the Secretary initiated the 
investigation. The Secretary will base the decision on express findings 
that:
    (1) The respondent parties to the proceeding are cooperating in the 
investigation;
    (2) The investigation is extraordinarily complicated by reason of:
    (i) The large number of complex nature of the transactions or 
adjustments under subpart D of this part;
    (ii) Novel issues raised; or
    (iii) The large number of producers and resellers; and
    (3) Additional time is needed to make the preliminary determination.
    (c) Postponement at the request of the petitioner. If the 
petitioner, not later than 25 days before the scheduled date for the 
Secretary's preliminary determination, requests a postponement and 
states the reasons for the request, the Secretary will postpone the 
preliminary determination to not later than 190 days after the date on 
which the Secretary initiated the investigation, unless the Secretary 
finds compelling reasons to deny the request.
    (d) Notice of postponement. If the Secretary decides to postpone the 
preliminary determination under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, 
the Secretary will notify all parties to the proceeding not later than 
20 days before the scheduled date for the Secretary's preliminary 
determination and will publish in the Federal Register notice of 
``Postponement of Preliminary Antidumping Duty Determination,'' stating 
the reasons for the postponement.
    (e) Expedited preliminary determination. Not later than 75 days 
after the initiation of an investigation under Sec. 353.13, the 
Secretary will review the record of the first 60 days of the 
investigation. If the available information is sufficient for the 
Secretary to make a preliminary determination, the Secretary will 
disclose to the petitioner, and any party to the proceeding that has 
requested disclosure, all available public and proprietary information

[[Page 176]]

(176(subject to the requirements of Sec. 353.34). If, not later than 
three business days after disclosure, each party to whom disclosure was 
made furnishes an irrevocable written waiver of verification and agrees 
to a preliminary determination based on information in the record on the 
60th day of the investigation, the Secretary will make an expedited 
preliminary determination not later than 90 days after initiation of the 
investigation.
    (f) Commission access to information. The Secretary will make 
available to the Commission and to employees of the Commission directly 
involved in the proceeding all information upon which the Secretary 
based the determination and which the Commission may consider relevant 
to its injury determination.
    (g) Disclosure. Promptly after making the preliminary determination, 
the Secretary will provide to parties to the proceeding which request 
disclosure a further explanation of the calculation methodology used in 
making the determination.

[54 FR 12769, Mar. 28, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 25134, May 11, 1995]

Sec. 353.16  Critical circumstances findings.

    (a) In general. If a petitioner submits to the Secretary a written 
allegation of critical circumstances, with reasonably available factual 
information supporting the allegation, not later than 21 days before the 
scheduled date of the Secretary's final determination, or on the 
Secretary's own initiative in an investigation under Sec. 353.11, the 
Secretary will make a finding whether:
    (1) (i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or 
elsewhere of the same class or kind of merchandise as the merchandise 
subject to the investigation; or
    (ii) The importer knew or should have known that the producer or 
reseller was selling the merchandise at less than its foreign market 
value: and
    (2) There have been massive imports of the merchandise over a 
relatively short period.
    (b) Preliminary finding. (1) lf the petitioner submits the 
allegation of critical circumstances not later than 30 days before the 
scheduled date for the Secretary's final determination under 
Sec. 353.20, the Secretary, based on the available information, will 
make a preliminary finding whether there is a reasonable basis to 
believe or suspect that critical circumstances as described in paragraph 
(a) of this section exist.
    (2) The Secretary will issue the preliminary finding:
    (i) Not later than the Secretary's preliminary determination under 
Sec. 353.15, if the allegation is submitted not later thar 20 days 
before the scheduled date for the preliminary determination; or
    (ii) Not later than 30 days after the petitioner submits the 
allegation, if the allegation is submitted later than 20 days before the 
scheduled date for the  Secretary's preliminary determination.

    The Secretary will notify the Commission and publish in the Federal 
Register notice of the preliminary finding.

    (c) Suspension of liquidation. If the Secretary makes an affirmative 
preliminary finding of critical circumstances, either before or at the 
time of an affirmative preliminary determination under Sec. 353.15, any 
suspension of liquidation ordered under Sec. 353.15 will apply to all 
entries of the merchandise covered by the finding entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse, for consumption on or after 90 days before the date of 
the order of suspension. If the Secretary makes an affirmative 
preliminary finding of critical circumstances after an affirmative 
preliminary determination under Sec. 353.15, the Secretary will amend 
the order suspending liquidation to apply to all entries of the 
merchandise covered by the finding entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, 
for consumption on or after 90 days before the date suspension of 
liquidation was first ordered.
    (d) Final finding. For any allegation submitted not later than 21 
days before the scheduled date for the Secretary's final determination 
under Sec. 353.20, the Secretary will make a final finding on critical 
circumstances. If the final finding is affirmative and if the Secretary 
did not make an affirmative preliminary finding of critical 
circumstances, the Secretary will order

[[Page 177]]

(177the suspension of liquidation of all entries of the merchandise 
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after 90 
days before the date the Secretary ordered suspension of liquidation 
either as part of an affirmative preliminary or final determination. If 
the final finding is negative and if the Secretary made an affirmative 
preliminary finding of critical circumstances, the Secretary will end 
the retroactive suspension of liquidation ordered under paragraph (c) of 
this section, and will instruct the Customs Service to release the cash 
deposit or bond.
    (e) Findings in self-initiated investigations. In investigations 
initiated under Sec. 353.11, the Secretary will make a preliminary and 
final finding on critical circumstances without regard to the time 
limits in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.
    (f) Massive imports. (1) In determining for the purpose of paragraph 
(a) of this section whether imports of the merchandise have been 
massive, the Secretary normally will examine:
    (i) The volume and value of the imports;
    (ii) Seasonal trends; and
    (iii) The share of domestic consumption accounted for by the 
imports.
    (2) In general, unless the imports during the period identified in 
paragraph (g) of this section have increased by at least 15 percent over 
the imports during an immediately preceding period of comparable 
duration, the Secretary will not consider the imports massive.
    (g) Relatively short period. For the purpose of paragraph (a) of 
this section, the Secretary normally will consider the period beginning 
on the date the proceeding begins and ending at least three months 
later. However, if the Secretary finds that importers, or exporting 
producers or resellers, had reason to believe, at some time prior to the 
beginning of the proceeding, that a proceeding was likely, then the 
Secretary may consider a period of not less than three months from that 
earlier time.

Sec. 353.17  Termination of investigation.

    (a) Withdrawal of petition. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section, the Secretary may terminate an investigation upon 
withdrawal of the petition by the petitioner, or on the Secretary's own 
initiative in an investigation initiated under Sec. 353.11, after 
notifying all parties to the proceeding and after consultation with the 
Commission. The Secretary may not terminate an investigation unless the 
Secretary concludes the termination is in the public interest.
    (2) If the Secretary terminates an investigation, the Secretary will 
publish in the Federal Register notice of ``Termination of Antidumping 
Duty Investigation'' together with, when appropriate, a copy of any 
correspondence with the petitioner forming the basis of the withdrawal 
and the termination.
    (b) Withdrawal of petition based on acceptance of quantitative 
restriction agreements. (1) The Secretary may not terminate under 
paragraph (a) of this section an investigation by accepting an 
understanding or other kind of agreement with the government of the home 
market country to restrict the volume of the merchandise unless the 
Secretary, taking into account the factors listed in section 
734(a)(2)(B) of the Act, is satisfied that termination is in the public 
interest.
    (2) In deciding for the purpose of paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
whether termination is in the public interest, the Secretary, to the 
extent practicable, will consult with representatives of potentially 
affected United States consuming industries and potentially affected 
persons in the industry, including persons not parties to the 
proceeding.
    (c) Negative determination. An investigation terminates, without 
further comment or action, upon publication in the Federal Register of 
the Secretary's negative final determination or the Commission's 
negative preliminary or final determination.
    (d) End of suspension of liquidation. If the Secretary previously 
ordered suspension of liquidation, the Secretary will order the 
suspension ended on the date of publication of the notice of termination 
under paragraph (a) of this section or on the date of publication of a 
negative determination referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, and 
will

[[Page 178]]

(178instruct the Customs Service to release any cash deposit or bond.

Sec. 353.18  Suspension of investigation.

    (a) Agreement to eliminate completely sales at less than foreign 
market value or to cease exports. If the Secretary is satisfied that 
suspension is in the public interest, the Secretary may suspend an 
investigation at any time before the Secretary's final determination by 
accepting an agreement with exporters (producers and resellers) that 
account for substantially all of the merchandise:
    (1) To eliminate completely sales at less than foreign market value 
with respect to the merchandise, effective on the date of suspension of 
investigation; or
    (2) To cease exports of the merchandise not later than 180 days 
after the date of publication of the notice of suspension of 
investigation.
    (b) Agreement eliminating injurious effect. (1) As provided in this 
paragraph and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Secretary may 
suspend an investigation at any time before the Secretary's final 
determination if the Secretary:
    (i) Is satisfied that the proposed suspension is in the public 
interest;
    (ii) Finds that extraordinary circumstances are present; and
    (iii) Finds that the agreement will eliminate completely the 
injurious effect of the merchandise.
    (2) The Secretary may suspend an investigation under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section by accepting an agreement with exporters 
(producers and resellers) that account for substantially all of the 
merchandise, if the Secretary finds that:
    (i) The agreement will prevent the suppression or undercutting by 
the merchandise of prices of like products produced in the United 
States; and
    (ii) The agreement will ensure that, for each entry of each 
exporter, the dumping margin will not exceed 15 percent of the weighted-
average dumping margin for that exporter stated in the Secretary's 
preliminary determination (or final determination in investigations 
continued under Sec. 353.18(i)).
    (c) Definition of ``substantially all.'' For purposes of paragraphs 
(a) and (b)(2) of this section, exporters which account for 
``substantially all'' of the merchandise means exporters (producers and 
resellers), that have accounted for not less than 85 percent by value or 
volume of the merchandise during the period for which the Department is 
measuring dumping in the investigation or such other period that the 
Secretary considers representative.
    (d) Definition of ``extraordinary circumstances.'' For purposes of 
paragraph (b) of this section, ``extraordinary circumstances'' means 
circumstances in which (1) suspension of the investigation will be more 
beneficial to the industry than continuation of the investigation, and 
(2) there are a large number of transactions or adjustments under 
subpart D of this part, the issues raised are novel, or the number of 
producers and resellers is large.
    (e) Monitoring. The Secretary will not accept an agreement unless 
effective monitoring of the agreement by the Secretary is practicable. 
In monitoring an agreement under paragraph (b) of this section, the 
Secretary will not be obliged to ascertain on a continuing basis the 
prices in the United States of the merchandise or of like products 
produced in the United States.
    (f) Exports not to increase during interim period. The Secretary 
will not accept an agreement under paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
unless the agreement ensures that the quantity of the merchandise 
exported during the interim period set forth in the agreement does not 
exceed the quantity of the merchandise exported during a period of 
comparable duration that the Secretary considers representative.
    (g) Procedure for suspension of investigation. (1) The exporters 
(producers and resellers) shall:
    (i) Submit to the Secretary a proposed agreement not later than 45 
days before the scheduled date for the Secretary's final determination 
under Sec. 353.20; and
    (ii) Serve a copy of an agreement preliminarily accepted by the 
Secretary on other parties to the proceeding not later than the day 
following the Secretary's preliminary acceptance.
    (2) The Secretary will:

[[Page 179]]

(179
    (i) Not later than 30 days before the date the Secretary suspends 
the investigation, notify all parties to the proceeding of the proposed 
suspension and provide to the petitioner a copy of the agreement 
preliminarily accepted by the Secretary (the agreement shall contain the 
procedures for monitoring compliance and a statement of the 
compatibility of the agreement with the requirements of this section); 
and
    (ii) Consult with the petitioner concerning the proposed suspension.
    (3) The Secretary will provide all interested parties and United 
States government agencies an opportunity to submit, not later than 10 
days before the scheduled date for the Secretary's final determination, 
written argument and factual information concerning the proposed 
suspension.
    (h) Acceptance of agreement. (1) If the Secretary accepts an 
agreement to suspend an investigation, the Secretary will publish in the 
Federal Register  notice of ``Suspension of Antidumping Duty 
Investigation,'' including the text of the agreement. If the Secretary 
has not already published notice of affirmative preliminary 
determination, the Secretary will include that notice. In accepting an 
agreement, the Secretary may rely on factual or legal conclusions the 
Secretary reached in or after the affirmative preliminary determination.
    (2) If the Secretary suspends an investigation based on an agreement 
under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will not order the 
suspension of liquidation of entries of the merchandise. If the 
Secretary previously ordered suspension of liquidation, the Secretary 
will order the suspension of liquidation ended on the effective date of 
notice of suspension of investigation and will instruct the Customs 
Service to release any cash deposit or bond.
    (3) If the Secretary suspends an investigation based on an agreement 
under paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will order the 
suspension of liquidation to continue or to begin, as appropriate. The 
suspension of liquidation will not end until the Commission completes 
any requested review, under section 734(h) of the Act, of the agreement. 
If the Commission receives no request for review within 20 days after 
the date of publication of the notice of suspension of investigation, 
the Secretary will order the suspension of liquidation ended on the 21st 
day after the date of publication, and will instruct the Customs Service 
to release any cash deposit or bond.
    (4) If the Commission undertakes a review of an agreement under 
section 734(h) of the Act and determines that the agreement will not 
eliminate the injurious effect, the Secretary will resume the 
investigation on the date of publication of the Commission's 
determination as if the Secretary's affirmative preliminary 
determination had been made on that date. If the Commission determines 
that the agreement will eliminate the injurious effect, the Secretary 
will continue the suspension of investigation, order the suspension of 
liquidation ended on the date of publication of the Commission's 
determination, and instruct the Customs Service to release any cash 
deposit or bond.
    (i) Continuation of investigation. (1) Not later than 20 days after 
the date of publication of the notice of suspension of investigation, an 
exporter or exporters accounting for a significant proportion of exports 
of the merchandise or an interested party, as defined in paragraph 
(k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of Sec. 353.2, may request in writing 
that the Secretary continue the investigation. The party shall 
simultaneously file a request with the Commission to continue its 
investigation.
    (2) Upon receiving the request, the Secretary and the Commission 
will continue the investigation.
    (i) If the Secretary and the Commission make affirmative final 
determinations, the suspension agreement will remain in effect in 
accordance with the factual and legal conclusions in the Secretary's 
final determination. This paragraph does not affect the provisions of 
paragraph (h) of this section regarding suspension of liquidation.
    (ii) If the Secretary or the Commission makes a negative final 
determination, the agreement shall have no force or effect.
    (j) Merchandise imported in excess of allowed quantity. (1) The 
Secretary may

[[Page 180]]

(180instruct the Customs Service not to accept entries, or withdrawals 
from warehouse, for consumption of the merchandise in excess of any 
quantity allowed by paragraph (f) or by an agreement under paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (2) Imports in excess of the quantity allowed by paragraph (f) or by 
an agreement under paragraph (a) of this section may be exported or 
destroyed under Customs service supervision.

Sec. 353.19  Violation of agreement.

    (a) Immediate determination. If the Secretary determines that a 
signatory exporter has violated a suspension agreement, the Secretary, 
without right of comment, will:
    (1) Order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of the 
merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or 
after the later of (i) 90 days before the date of publication of the 
notice of cancellation of agreement or (ii) the date of first entry, or 
withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of the merchandise the sale 
or export of which was in violation of the agreement;
    (2) If the investigation was not completed under Sec. 353.18(i), 
resume the investigation as if the Secretary made an affirmative 
preliminary determination on the date of publication of the notice of 
cancellation and impose provisional measures by instructing the Customs 
Service to require for each entry of the merchandise suspended under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section a cash deposit or bond equal to the 
estimated weighted-average dumping margin determined in the affirmative 
preliminary determination;
    (3) If the investigation was completed under Sec. 353.18(i), issue 
an antidumping duty order for all entries subject to suspension of 
liquidation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and instruct the 
Customs Service to require for each entry of the merchandise suspended 
under this paragraph a cash deposit equal to the estimated weighted-
average dumping margin determined in the affirmative final 
determination;
    (4) Notify all persons who are or were parties to the proceeding, 
the Commission, and if the Secretary determines that the violation was 
intentional, the Commissioner of Customs; and
    (5) Publish in the Federal Register notice of ``Antidumping Duty 
Order (Resumption of Antidumping Duty Investigation); Cancellation of 
Suspension Agreement.''
    (b) Determination after notice and comment. (1) If the Secretary has 
reason to believe that a signatory exporter has violated an agreement or 
that an agreement no longer meets the requirements of section 734(d) of 
the Act, but does not have sufficient information to take action under 
paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will publish in the Federal 
Register notice of ``Invitation for Comment on Antidumping Duty 
Suspension Agreement.''
    (2) After publication of the notice inviting comment and after 
consideration of comments received the Secretary will:
    (i) If the Secretary determines that any signatory exporter has 
violated the agreement, take appropriate action as described in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section; or
    (ii) If the Secretary determines that the agreement no longer meets 
the requirements of section 734(d) of the Act:
    (A) Take appropriate action as described in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (a)(5) of this section, except that, for paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the date shall be the date of first entry, or withdrawal 
from warehouse, for consumption of the merchandise the sale or export of 
which does not meet the requirements of section 734(d) of the Act;
    (B) Continue the suspension of investigation by accepting a revised 
suspension agreement under Sec. 353.18(a) (whether or not the Secretary 
accepted the original agreement under that paragraph) that, at the time 
the Secretary accepts the revised agreement, meets the applicable 
requirements of section 734(d) of the Act, and publish in the Federal 
Register notice of ``Revision of Agreement Suspending Antidumping Duty 
Investigation;'' or
    (C) Continue the suspension of investigation by accepting a revised 
suspension agreement under Sec. 353.18(b) (whether or not the Secretary 
accepted the original agreement under that paragraph) that, at the time 
the Secretary

[[Page 181]]

(181accepts the revised agreement, meets the applicable requirements of 
section 734(d) of the Act, and publish in the Federal Register notice of 
``Revision of Agreement Suspending Antidumping Duty Investigation.'' If 
the Secretary continues to suspend an investigation based on a revised 
agreement accepted under Sec. 353.18(b), the Secretary will order 
suspension of liquidation to begin. The suspension will not end until 
the Commission completes any requested review of the agreement under 
section 734(h) of the Act. If the Commission receives no request for 
review within 20 days after the date of publication of the notice of the 
revision, the Secretary will order the suspension of liquidation ended 
on the 21st day after the date of publication, and will instruct the 
Customs Service to release any cash deposit or bond. If the Commission 
undertakes a review under section 734(h) of the Act, the provisions of 
Sec. 353.18(h)(4) will apply.
    (iii) If the Secretary decides neither to consider the order 
violated nor to revise the agreement, the Secretary will publish in the 
Federal Register notice of the Secretary's decision under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, including a statement of the factual and legal 
conclusions on which the decision is based.
    (c) Additional signatories. If the Secretary decides that the 
agreement no longer meets the requirements of Sec. 353.18(b)(1)(iii) or 
that the signatory exporters no longer account for substantially all of 
the merchandise, the Secretary may revise the agreement to include 
additional signatory exporters.
    (d) Definition of ``violation.'' For the purpose of this section, 
``violation'' means noncompliance with the terms of a suspension 
agreement caused by an act or omission of a signatory exporter, except, 
at the discretion of the Secretary, an act or omission which is 
inadvertent or inconsequential.

Sec. 353.20  Final determination.

    (a) In general. (1) Not later than 75 days after the date of the 
Secretary's preliminary determination, the Secretary will make a final 
determination whether the merchandise is being sold at less than fair 
value.
    (2) The Secretary's determination will include:
    (i) The factual and legal conclusions on which the determination is 
based;
    (ii) The estimated weighted-average dumping margin, if any, for each 
person investigated; and
    (iii) If appropriate, a final finding on critical circumstances 
under Sec. 353.16.
    (3) If affirmative, the Secretary's determination will also:
    (i) Unless previously ordered by the Secretary, order the suspension 
of liquidation of all entries of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of 
the notice of the Secretary's final determination; and
    (ii) Instruct the Customs Service to require, for each suspended 
entry of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after the date of publication of the Secretary's final 
determination, a cash deposit or bond equal to the estimated weighted-
average dumping margin determined under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (4) The Secrerary will publish in the Federal Register notice of 
``Affirmative (Negative) Final Antidumping Duty Determination,'' 
including the estimated weighted-average dumping margins, if any.
    (5) The Secretary will notify all parties to the proceeding and the 
Commission.
    (b) Postponement of final determination. (1) If, not later than the 
scheduled date for the Secretary's final determination, the petitioner 
in a proceeding in which the Secretary issued a negative preliminary 
determination, or the producers or resellers of a significant proportion 
of the merchandise in a proceeding in which the Secretary issued an 
affirmative preliminary determination, request in writing a postponement 
and state the reasons for the request, the Secretary will postpone the 
final determination to not later than 135 days after the date of 
publication of the preliminary determination, unless the Secretary finds 
compelling reasons to deny the request.
    (2) If the Secretary decides to postpone the final determination 
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Secretary will notify all 
parties to the

[[Page 182]]

(182proceeding and will publish in the Federal Register notice of 
``Postponement of Final Antidumping Duty Determination,'' stating the 
reason for the postponement.
    (c) Commission access to information. The Secretary will make 
available to the Commission and to employees of the Commission directly 
involved in the proceeding all information upon which the Secretary 
based the final determination and which the Commission may consider 
relevant to its injury determination.
    (d) Effect of negative final determination. An investigation 
terminates, without further comment or action, upon publication in the 
Federal Register of the Secretary's or the Commission's negative final 
determination. If the Secretary previously ordered suspension of 
liquidation, the Secretary will order the suspension ended on the date 
of publication of the notice of negative final determination and will 
instruct the Customs Service to release any cash deposit or bond.
    (e) Disclosure. Promptly after making the final determination, the 
Secretary will provide to parties to the proceeding which request 
disclosure a further explanation of the calculation methodology used in 
making the determination.

Sec. 353.21  Antidumping duty order.

    Not later than seven days after receipt of notice of the 
Commission's affirmative final determination under section 735 of the 
Act, the Secretary will publish in the Federal Register an ``Antidumping 
Duty Order'' that:
    (a) Instructs the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on 
the merchandise, in accordance with the Secretary's instructions at the 
completion of each administrative review requested under Sec. 353.22(a) 
or, if not requested, in accordance with the Secretary's instructions 
under Sec. 353.22(e);
    (b) For each entry of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the 
order, instructs the Customs Service to require a cash deposit of 
estimated antidumping duties equal to the amount of the estimated 
weighted-average dumping margin stated in the Secretary's final 
determination;
    (c) Excludes from the application of the order any producer or 
reseller for which the Secretary finds that there was no weighted-
average dumping margin during the period for which the Department 
measured dumping in the investigation; and
    (d) Orders the suspension of liquidation ended for all entries of 
the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption 
before the date of publication of the Commission's final determination, 
and instructs the Customs Service to release the cash deposit or bond on 
those entries, if in its final determination, the Commission found a 
threat of material injury or material retardation of the establishment 
of an industry, unless the Commission in its final determination also 
found that, absent the suspension of liquidation ordered under 
Sec. 353.15(a), it would have found material injury.

Sec. 353.22  Administrative review of orders and suspension agreements.

    (a) Request for Administrative Review; Withdrawal of Request for

publication of the Secretary's

[[Page 185]]

    (8) Results of reviews. The results of a review under paragraph 
(h)(1) of this section shall be the basis for the assessment of 
antidumping duties on entries of merchandise covered by the 
determination and for deposits of estimated duties.
    (9) Multiple reviews. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, if a review (or a request for a review) under paragraph (a), 
(f), or (g) of this section covers merchandise of an exporter or 
producer subject to a review (or to a request for a review) under 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the Secretary may:

Sec. 353.23   Provisional measures deposit cap.

     This section applies to the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption before the date of publication of the 
Commission's notice of affirmative final determination. If the cash 
deposit or bond required under the Secretary's affirmative preliminary 
or affirmative final determination is different from the dumping margin 
the Secretary calculates under Sec. 353.22, the Secretary will instruct 
the Customs Service to disregard the difference to the extent that the 
cash deposit or bond is less than the dumping margin, and to assess 
antidumping duties equal to the dumping margin calculated under 
Sec. 353.22 if the cash deposit or bond is more than the dumping margin.

Sec. 353.24   Interest on certain overpayments and underpayments.

     (a) In general. The Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to 
pay or collect, as appropriate, interest on the difference between the 
cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties and the assessed 
antidumping duties on entries of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of 
an antidumping duty order.
     (b) Rate. The rate or rates of interest payable or collectible 
under paragraph (a) of this section for any period of time are the rates 
established under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
     (c) Period. The Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to 
calculate interest for each entry from the date that a cash deposit is 
required to be deposited for the entry through the date of liquidation 
of the entry.

Sec. 353.25   Revocation of orders; termination of suspended 
          investigation.

    (a) Revocation or termination based on absence of dumping. (1) The 
Secretary may revoke an order or terminate a suspended investigation if 
the Secretary concludes that:
     (i) All producers and resellers covered at the time of revocation 
by the order or the suspension agreement have sold the merchandise at 
not less

[[Page 188]]

(188than foreign market value for a period of at least three consecutive 
years; and
     (ii) It is not likely that those persons will in the future sell 
the merchandise at less than foreign market value.
     (2) The Secretary may revoke an order in part if the Secretary 
concludes that:
     (i) One or more producers or resellers covered by the order have 
sold the merchandise at not less than foreign market value for a period 
of at least three consecutive years;
     (ii) It is not likely that those persons will in the future sell 
the merchandise at less than foreign market value; and
     (iii) For producers or resellers that the Secretary previously has 
determined to have sold the merchandise at less than foreign market 
value, the producers or resellers agree in writing to their immediate 
reinstatement in the order, as long as any producer or reseller is 
subject to the order, if the Secretary concludes under Sec. 353.22(f) 
that the producer or reseller, subsequent to the revocation, sold the 
merchandise at less than foreign market value.
    (b) Request for revocation or termination. During the third and 
subsequent annual anniversary months of the publication of an order or 
suspension of investigation (the calendar month in which the anniversary 
of the date of publication of the order or suspension occurs), a 
producer or reseller may request in writing that the Secretary revoke an 
order or terminate a suspended investigation under paragraph (a) of this 
section with regard to that person if the person submits with the 
request:
    (1) The person's certification that the person sold the merchandise 
at not less than foreign market value during the period described in 
Sec. 353.22(b), and that in the future the person will not sell the 
merchandise at less than foreign market value; and
    (2) If applicable, the agreement described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) 
of this section.
    (c) Procedures. (1) After receipt of a timely request under 
paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will consider the request 
as including a request for an administrative review and will conduct a 
review under Sec. 353.22(c).
    (2) In addition to the requirements of Sec. 353.22(c), the Secretary 
will:
    (i) Publish with the notice of initiation, under Sec. 353.22(c)(1), 
notice of ``Request for Revocation of Order (in part)'' or, if 
appropriate, ``Request for Termination of Suspended Investigation;''
    (ii) Conduct a verification under Sec. 353.36;
    (iii) Include in the preliminary results of review, under 
Sec. 353.22(c)(4), the Secretary's decision whether there is a 
reasonable basis to believe that the requirements for revocation or 
termination are met;
    (iv) If the Secretary's preliminary decision under paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii) of this section is affirmative, publish with the notice of 
preliminary results of review, under Sec. 353.22(c)(5), notice of 
``Intent to Revoke Order (in Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Intent to 
Terminate Suspended Investigation;''
    (v) Include in the final results of review, under Sec. 353.22(c)(7), 
the Secretary's final decision whether the requirements for revocation 
or termination are met; and

this section is affirmative, publish with the notice of final results of 
review, under Sec. 353.22(c)(8), notice of ``Revocation of Order (in 
Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Termination of Suspended Investigation.''
    (3) If the Secretary revokes an order or revokes an order in part, 
the Secretary will order the suspension of liquidation ended for the 
merchandise covered by the revocation on the first day after the period 
under review, and will instruct the Customs Service to release any cash 
deposit or bond.
    (d) Revocation or termination based on changed circumstances. (1) 
The Secretary may revoke an order, revoke an order in part, or terminate 
a suspended investigation if the Secretary concludes that:
    (i) The order or suspended investigation no longer is of interest to 
interested parties, as defined in paragraphs (k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), and 
(k)(6) of Sec. 353.2; or
    (ii) Other changed circumstances sufficient to warrant revocation or 
termination exist.

[[Page 189]]

(189
    (2) If at any time the Secretary concludes from the available 
information, including an affirmative statement of no interest from the 
petitioner in the proceeding, that changed circumstances sufficient to 
warrant revocation or termination may exist, the Secretary will conduct 
an administrative review under Sec. 353.22(f).
    (3) In addition to the requirements of Sec. 353.22(f), the Secretary 
will:
    (i) Publish with the notice of initiation, under 
Sec. 353.22(f)(1)(i), notice of ``Consideration of Revocation of Order 
(in Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Consideration of Termination of

    (ii) If the Secretary's conclusion, as described in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section, is not based on a request, the Secretary, not later 
than the date of publication of the notice described in paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section, will serve written notice of the 
consideration of revocation or termination on each interested party 
listed on the Department's service list and on any other person which 
the Secretary has reason to believe is a producer or seller in the 
United States of the like product;
    (iii) Conduct a verification, if appropriate, under Sec. 353.36;
    (iv) Include in the preliminary results of review, under 
Sec. 353.22(f)(1)(iv), the Secretary's decision whether there is a 
reasonable basis to believe that the requirements for revocation or 
termination based on changed circumstances are met;
    (v) If the Secretary's preliminary decision under paragraph 
(d)(3)(iv) of this section is affirmative, publish with the notice of 
preliminary results of review, under Sec. 353.22(f)(1)(v), notice of 
``Intent to Revoke Order (in Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Intent to 
Terminate Suspended Investigation;''
    (vi) Include in the final results of review, under 
Sec. 353.22(f)(1)(viii), the Secretary's final decision whether the 
requirements for revocation or termination based on changed 
circumstances are met; and
    (vii) If the Secretary's final decision under paragraph (d)(3)(vi) 
of this section is affirmative, publish with the notice of final results 
of review, under Sec. 353.22(f)(1)(ix), notice of ``Revocation of Order 
(in Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Termination of Suspended 
Investigation.''
    (4)(i) If for four consecutive annual anniversary months no 
interested party has requested an administrative review, under 
Sec. 353.22(a), of an order or suspended investigation, not later than 
the first day of the fifth consecutive annual anniversary month, the 
Secretary will publish in the Federal Register notice of ``Intent to 
Revoke Order'' or, if appropriate, ``Intent to Terminate Suspended 
Investigation.''
    (ii) Not later than the date of publication of the notice described 
in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the Secretary will serve written 
notice of the intent to revoke or terminate on each interested party 
listed on the Department's service list and on any other person which 
the Secretary has reason to believe is a producer or seller in the 
United States of the like product.
    (iii) If by the last day of the fifth annual anniversary month no 
interested party objects, or requests an administrative review under 
Sec. 353.22(a), the Secretary at that time will conclude that the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) for revocation or termination are 
met, revoke the order or terminate the suspended investigation, and 
publish in the Federal Register the notice described in paragraph 
(d)(3)(vii) of this section.
    (5) If the Secretary under paragraph (d) of this section revokes an 
order or revokes an order in part, the Secretary will order the 
suspension of liquidation ended for the merchandise covered by the 
revocation on the effective date of the notice of revocation, and will 
instruct the Customs Service to release any cash deposit or bond.
    (e) Revocation or termination based on injury reconsideration. If 
the Commission determines in an administrative review under section 
751(b) of the Act that an industry in the United States would not be 
materially injured, or would not be threatened with material injury, or 
the establishment of an industry in the United States would not be 
materially retarded, by reason of imports of the merchandise covered by 
an antidumping duty order or suspension agreement, the Secretary will 
revoke, in whole or in part, the order or

[[Page 190]]

(190terminate the suspended investigation, and will publish in the 
Federal Register notice of ``Revocation of Order (in Part)'' or, if 
appropriate, ``Termination of Suspended Investigation.''

Sec. 353.26   Reimbursement of antidumping duties.

    (a) In general. (1) In calculating the United States price, the 
Secretary will deduct the amount of any antidumping duty which the 
producer or reseller:
    (i) Paid directly on behalf of the importer; or
    (ii) Reimbursed to the importer.
    (2) The Secretary will not deduct the amount of the antidumping duty 
paid or reimbursed if the producer or reseller granted to the importer 
before initiation of the investigation a warranty of nonapplicability of 
antidumping duties with respect to the merchandise which was:
    (i) Sold before the date of publication of the Secretary's order 
suspending liquidation; and
    (ii) Exported before the date of publication of the Secretary's 
final determination.
    Ordinarily, the Secretary will deduct for reimbursement of 
antidumping duties only once in the calculation of the United States 
price.
    (b) Certificate. The importer shall file prior to liquidation a 
certificate in the following form with the appropriate District Director 
of Customs:

    I hereby certify that I (have) (have not) entered into any agreement 
or understanding for the payment or for the refunding to me, by the 
manufacturer, producer, seller, or exporter, of all or any part of the 
antidumping duties assessed upon the following importations of ________ 
(commodity) from ________ (country): (List entry numbers) which have 
been purchased on or after ________ (date of publication of notice 
suspending liquidation in the Federal Register) or purchased before 
________ (same date) but exported on or after ________ (date of final 
determination of sales at less than fair value).

    (c) Presumption. The Secretary may presume from an importer's 
failure to file the certificate required in paragraph (b) that the 
producer or reseller paid or reimbursed the antidumping duties.

Sec. 353.27  Procedures for initiation of downstream product monitoring.

    (a) In general. A domestic producer of an article that is like a 
component part or a downstream product may file an application pursuant 
to this section requesting that the Secretary designate a downstream 
product for monitoring.
    (b) Contents of application. The application shall contain the 
following information, to the extent reasonably available to the 
applicant:
    (1) The name and address of the person requesting the monitoring and 
a description of the article it produces which is the basis for filing 
its application;
    (2) A detailed description of the downstream product in question;
    (3) A detailed description of the component product incorporated 
into such downstream product, including the value of the component part 
in relation to the value of the downstream product, and the extent to 
which the component part has been substantially transformed as a result 
of its incorporation into the downstream product;
    (4) The name of the home market country of both the downstream and 
component products and the name of any intermediate country through 
which these products are transshipped;
    (5) The name and address of all known producers of component parts 
and downstream products in the relevant countries and a detailed 
description of any relationship between such producers;
    (6) Whether the component part is already subject to monitoring to 
aid in the enforcement of a bilateral arrangement within the meaning of 
Section 804 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984;
    (7) A list of all antidumping or countervailing duty investigations 
suspended under Sec. 353.18 or Sec. 355.18, or antidumping or 
countervailing duty orders issued under Sec. 353.21 or Sec. 355.21 on 
merchandise related to the component part and manufactured in the same 
foreign country in which the component part is manufactured;

[[Page 191]]

(191
    (8) A list of all antidumping or countervailing duty investigations 
suspended under Sec. 353.18 or Sec. 355.18 or antidumping or 
countervailing orders issued under Sec. 353.21 or Sec. 355.21 on 
merchandise manufactured or exported by the manufacturer or exporter of 
the component part that is similar in description and use to the 
component part; and
    (9) The reasons for suspecting that the imposition of antidumping or 
countervailing duties has resulted in a diversion of exports of the 
component parts into increased production and exportation to the United 
States of such downstream product.
    (c) Determination of sufficiency of application--(1) In general. 
Within 14 days after an application is filed under paragraph (b) of this 
section, the Secretary will determine the sufficiency of the 
application. An application is considered to be filed at the time it is 
received by the Secretary. In order to determine that an application is 
sufficient, the Secretary must find:
    (i) There is a reasonable likelihood that imports of the downstream 
product into the United States will increase as an indirect result of 
any diversion with respect to the component part; and
    (ii) That--
    (A) The component part is already subject to monitoring with respect 
to the enforcement of a bilateral arrangement within the meaning of 
Section 804 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, or
    (B) Merchandise related to the component part and manufactured in 
the same foreign country in which the component part is manufactured has 
been the subject of a significant number of antidumping or 
countervailing duty investigations suspended under Sec. 353.18 or 
Sec. 355.18, or antidumping or countervailing duty orders issued under 
Sec. 353.21 or Sec. 355.21, or
    (C) Merchandise manufactured or exported by the manufacturer or 
exporter of the component part that is similar in description and use to 
the component part has been the subject of at least two antidumping or 
countervailing duty investigations suspended under Sec. 353.18 or 
Sec. 355.18, or antidumping or countervailing orders issued under 
Sec. 353.21 or Sec. 355.21.
    (2) In making a determination under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section, the Secretary will consider all factors the Secretary considers 
relevant and may, if appropriate, take into account such factors as:
    (i) The value of the component part in relation to the value of the 
downstream product;
    (ii) The extent to which the component part has been substantially 
transformed as a result of its incorporation into the downstream 
product; and
    (iii) The relationship between the producers of the component part 
and producers of the downstream product.
    (d) Notice of Determination. The Secretary will publish in the 
Federal Register notice of each affirmative or negative ``monitoring'' 
determination made under paragraph (c) of this section and if the 
determination under (c)(1)(i) and under any clause of (c)(1)(ii) are 
affirmative, will transmit to the Commission a copy of the determination 
and the application. The Secretary will make available to the 
Commission, and to its employees directly involved in the monitoring, 
all information upon which the Secretary based the initiation.
    (e) Action on basis of monitoring reports. The Secretary will review 
the information in any monitoring reports submitted to the Department by 
the Commission under section 780 of the Act and will:
    (1) Consider the information in determining whether to initiate an 
investigation under Sec. 353.11 regarding any downstream product; and
    (2) Request the Commission to cease monitoring any downstream 
product if the information indicates that imports into the United States 
are not increasing and there is no reasonable likelihood of diversion 
with respect to the component part.
    (f) Definitions--(1) Downstream product means any manufactured 
product imported into the United States into which a component part is 
incorporated.
    (2) Component part means any imported article which:
    (i) During the previous five-year period, ending on the date on 
which the application is filed under paragraph (b) of this section, has 
been subject to--

[[Page 192]]

(192
    (A) An antidumping or countervailing duty order issued under 
Sec. 353.21 or Sec. 355.21 that required the deposit of estimated 
antidumping or countervailing duties, applicable to the particular 
manufacturer or exporter, at a rate of at least 15 percent ad valorem 
or,
    (B) A suspension agreement entered into under Sec. 353.18 or 
Sec. 355.18 after a preliminary determination under Sec. 353.15 or 
Sec. 355.15 was made by the Secretary which included a determination 
that the estimated net antidumping margin or subsidy rate, applicable to 
the particular manufacturer or exporter, was at least 15 percent ad 
valorem; and
    (ii) Due to its inherent characteristics, is routinely used as a 
major part, material, component, assembly, or subassembly in a 
downstream product.
    (g) Where to file; time of filing; format and number of copies. The 
requirements of Sec. 353.31(d), (e), (f), and (g) apply to this section.

Sec. 353.28  Procedures for the correction of ministerial errors.

    (a) In general. The Secretary will disclose the calculations 
performed in connection with a final antidumping duty determination 
pursuant to Sec. 353.20, or in a final results of an administrative 
review of an antidumping duty order pursuant to Sec. 353.22, to any 
party to the proceeding making a request in accordance with this 
section. A party to the proceeding must file such a request in writing 
with the Secretary within five business days of the date of publication 
of the relevant final determination or final results of administrative 
review. A party to whom the Secretary has disclosed final calculations 
may submit comments concerning any ministerial errors in such 
calculations.
    (b) Time limits. Comments must be filed within five business days 
after the date of disclosure unless the Secretary extends the time limit 
based upon a written request for extension that is filed within five 
business days after the date of disclosure and showing cause for such 
extension. Comments shall be submitted in writing to the Secretary and 
shall be served on all interested parties on the Department's service 
list. Interested parties may file replies to any comments submitted 
under paragraph (a) of this section. Any replies must be filed with the 
Secretary within five business days after the date the relevant comments 
under paragraph (a) of this section are received by that party and shall 
be served on all interested parties on the Department's service list. 
All service of interested parties on the Department's service list 
pursuant to this paragraph shall be in accordance with Sec. 353.31(g). 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 353.34(d), the Secretary may 
permit representatives to retain proprietary information released under 
administrative protective order under Sec. 353.34 until the expiration 
of the time for filing for judicial review of the Secretary's correction 
of any ministerial errors. If the Secretary determines there are no 
ministerial errors, proprietary information will be returned in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 353.34(d).
    (c) Corrections. The Secretary will analyze any comments received 
and, if appropriate, correct any ministerial errors by amending the 
final antidumping determination or final results of administrative 
review. Such corrections will be published in the Federal Register. A 
correction notice does not alter the anniversary month of an order or 
suspension of investigation for purposes of requesting an administrative 
review under Sec. 353.22.
    (d) Definition of ``ministerial error.'' For purposes of this 
section, ``ministerial error'' means an error in addition, subtraction, 
or other arithmetic function, clerical error resulting from inaccurate 
copying, duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional 
error which the Secretary considers ministerial.

[55 FR 9048, Mar. 9, 1990]

Sec. 353.29  Scope determination.

    (a) Self-initiation. If the Secretary determines from available 
information that an inquiry is warranted to determine whether a product 
is included within the scope of an antidumping order, the Secretary will 
initiate an inquiry and notify all interested parties on the 
Department's service lists of its initiation of a scope inquiry.
    (b) By application. Any interested party, as defined in 
Sec. 353.2(k), may file an application to determine whether a

[[Page 193]]

(193particular product is within the scope of an order. The application 
shall contain the following, to the extent reasonably available to the 
interested party:
    (1) A detailed description of the product, including technical 
characteristics and uses of the product, and its current U.S. Tariff 
Classification number;
    (2) A statement of the interested party's position as to whether the 
product is within the scope of an antidumping order, including--
    (i) A summary of the reasons for this conclusion,
    (ii) Citations to any applicable statutory authority, and
    (iii) Attachment of any factual support for this position, including 
applicable portions of the Secretary's or the Commission's 
investigation.

Where all of these conditions are met, the Secretary will evaluate the 
application. If the Secretary determines that no inquiry is warranted to 
determine whether a product is included within the scope of an order, 
the Secretary will issue a final ruling as to whether the merchandise 
which is the subject of the application is included in the existing 
order. The Secretary will, by mail, notify all interested parties on the 
Department's service lists of its determination. If, however, the 
Secretary determines that a scope inquiry is warranted, the Secretary 
will, by mail, notify all interested parties on the Department's service 
lists of the initiation of a scope inquiry.
    (c) Notice. Any initiation of a scope inquiry issued pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section will include:
    (1) A description of the product that is the subject of the scope 
inquiry; and
    (2) An explanation of the reasons for the Secretary's decision to 
intiate a scope inquiry; and
    (3) A schedule for submission of comments.
    (d) Procedures for scope inquiry. Except as provided under paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section, the procedures for scope inquiries will be as 
follows:
    (1) Interested parties shall file any comments not later than twenty 
days after receipt of the notification described in paragraph (c) of 
this section, unless the Secretary alters this time limit;
    (2) Not later than the time limit stated in the notification 
described in paragraph (c) of this section (ordinarily five days after 
the time limit for filing the comments described in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section), any interested party may submit rebuttal comments;
    (3) Whenever the Secretary determines that a scope inquiry presents 
an issue of significant difficulty, the Secretary will issue a 
preliminary scope ruling, based upon the available information at the 
time, as to whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect 
that the product subject to a scope inquiry is included within the 
order. The Secretary will, by mail, notify all interested parties on the 
Department's service lists of its preliminary scope ruling and provide 
an invitation for comment. Unless otherwise specified, the Secretary 
will provide all interested parties thirty days from the date of receipt 
of the notification for comment;
    (4) The Secretary may issue questionnaries or verify submissions 
received, where appropriate;
    (5) The Secretary will issue a final ruling as to whether the 
product which is the subject of the scope inquiry is included in the 
existing order, including an explanation of the factual and legal 
conclusions on which the final ruling is based. The Secretary will, by 
certified mail, return receipt requested, notify all interested parties 
on the Department's service lists of its final scope ruling;
    (6) When a Sec. 353.22 review is in progress at the time the 
Secretary provides the notification outlined in paragraph (c) of this 
section, the scope inquiry, in the Secretary's discretion, may be 
conducted in conjunction with a Sec. 353.22(c) review;
    (7) Prior to issuing a ruling in accordance with paragraph (d) (3) 
or (5) of this section or Sec. 353.22(c)(4) or Sec. 353.22(c)(8) to 
include products within the scope of an order pursuant to--
    (i) Paragraph (e) of this section, other than operations in the 
United States involving minor completion or assembly,
    (ii) Paragraph (f) of this section, or
    (iii) Paragraph (h) of this section, with respect to later-developed 
products which incorporate a significant

[[Page 194]]

(194technological advance or significant alteration of an earlier 
product, the Secretary will notify the Commission in writing of the 
proposed inclusion of such products in the order. Upon the written 
request of the Commission, the Secretary will consult with the 
Commission regarding the proposed inclusion, and any such consultation 
will be completed within 15 days after the date of such request. If the 
Commission believes, after such consultation, that a significant injury 
issue is presented by the proposed inclusion, the Commission may provide 
written advice to the Secretary as to whether the inclusion would be 
inconsistent with the affirmative determination of the Commission on 
which the order is based; and
    (8) On a quarterly basis, the Secretary will publish in the Federal 
Register a list of scope rulings completed within the last three months. 
This list will include the case name, reference number, and a brief 
description of the ruling.
    (e) Products completed or assembled in the United States.
    (1) In General. If--
    (i) A product sold in the United States is of the same class or kind 
as merchandise that is the subject of an order, and
    (ii) Such product sold in the United States is completed or 
assembled in the United States from parts or components produced in the 
foreign country with respect to which such order applies, and
    (iii) The difference between the value of such product sold in the 
United States and the value of the imported parts and components 
referred to in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) is small,

the Secretary, after taking into account any advice provided by the 
Commission under paragraph (d)(7) of this section, may include within 
the scope of such order the imported parts or components referred to in 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii) that are used in the completion or assembly of the 
merchandise in the United States at any time such order is in effect.
    (2) Factors to consider. In determining whether to include parts or 
components in an order under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary will take into account such factors as:
    (i) The pattern of trade;
    (ii) Whether the manufacturer or exporter of the parts or components 
is related to the person who assembles or completes the merchandise sold 
in the United States from the parts or components produced in the 
foreign country with respect to which the order described in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section applies; and
    (iii) Whether imports into the United States of the parts or 
components produced in such foreign country have increased after the 
issuance of such order.
    (f) Products completed or assembled in other foreign countries--(1) 
In General. If--
    (i) A product imported into the United States is of the same class 
or kind as the merchandise that is the subject of an order,
    (ii) Before importation into the United States, such imported 
product is completed or assembled in another foreign country from 
merchandise which is subject to such order, or is produced in the 
foreign country with respect to which such order applies,
    (iii) The difference between the value of such imported product and 
the value of the merchandise described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) is small, 
and
    (iv) The Secretary determines that action is appropriate under this 
paragraph to prevent evasion of such order,
the Secretary, after taking into account any advice provided by the 
Commission under paragraph (d)(7) of this section, may include such 
imported products within the scope of such order at any time such order 
is in effect.
    (2) Factors to consider. In determining whether to include a product 
in an order under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Secretary will 
take into account such factors as:
    (i) The pattern of trade;
    (ii) Whether the manufacturer or exporter of the product described 
in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) is related to the person who uses the 
merchandise described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) to assemble or complete in 
the foreign country the product that is subsequently imported into the 
United States; and
    (iii) Whether imports into the foreign country of the product 
described in

[[Page 195]]

(195paragraph (f)(1)(ii) have increased after the issuance of such 
order.
    (g) Minor alterations of merchandise--(1) In general. The class or 
kind of merchandise subject to an investigation or order will include 
articles altered in form or appearance in minor respects (including raw 
agricultural products that have undergone minor processing), whether or 
not included in the same tariff classification.
    (2) Exception. Paragraph (g)(1) of this section will not apply with 
respect to altered merchandise if the Secretary determines that it would 
be unnecessary to consider the altered merchandise within the scope of 
the investigation or order.
    (h) Later-developed products--(1) In general. For purposes of 
determining whether a product developed after an antidumping 
investigation is initiated (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as 
the ``later-developed merchandise'') is within the scope of an order, 
the Secretary will consider whether:
    (i) The later-developed product has the same general physical 
characteristics as the merchandise with respect to which the order was 
originally issued (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the 
``earlier merchandise'');
    (ii) The expectations of the ultimate purchasers of the later-
developed product are the same as for the earlier merchandise;
    (iii) The ultimate use of the earlier merchandise and the later-
developed product are the same;
    (iv) The later-developed product is sold through the same channels 
of trade as the earlier merchandise; and
    (v) The later-developed product is advertised and displayed in a 
manner similar to the earlier merchandise.
    The Secretary will take into account any advice provided by the 
Commission under paragraph (d)(7) of this section before making a 
determination under this paragraph.
    (2) Exclusion from orders. The Secretary may not exclude later-
developed products from an order merely because the products:
    (i) Are classified under a tariff classification other than that 
identified in the petition or the Secretary's prior notices during the 
proceeding; or
    (ii) Permit the purchaser to perform additional functions, unless 
such additional functions constitute the primary use of the products and 
the cost of the additional functions constitute more than a significant 
proportion of the total cost of production of the products.
    (i) Other scope determinations. With respect to those scope 
determinations that are not covered under paragraph (e) through (h) of 
this section, in considering whether a particular product is within the 
class or kind of merchandise described in an existing order, the 
Secretary will take into account the following:
    (1) The descriptions of the merchandise contained in the petition, 
the initial investigation, and the determinations of the Secretary and 
the Commission.
    (2) When the above criteria are not dispositive, the Secretary will 
further consider:
    (i) The physical characteristics of the product;
    (ii) The expectations of the ultimate purchasers;
    (iii) The ultimate use of the product; and
    (iv) The channels of trade.
    (j) Suspension of liquidation.
    (1) When the Secretary initiates a scope inquiry pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this section, and the subject product is already 
subject to suspension of liquidation, that suspension of liquidation 
will be continued pending a preliminary or a final scope ruling. Any 
suspension of liquidation will be at the cash deposit of estimated duty 
rate that will apply if the subject product is ruled to be included 
within the scope of the order.
    (2) If the Secretary issues a preliminary scope ruling pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section to the effect that the subject product 
is included within the scope of the order, any suspension of liquidation 
described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section will continue. Where there 
has been no suspension of liquidation, the Secretary will instruct the 
Customs Service to suspend liquidation and require a cash deposit of 
estimated duties, at the applicable rate, for each suspended entry of 
the product entered, or withdrawn

[[Page 196]]

(196from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of the 
preliminary scope ruling. If the Secretary issues a preliminary scope 
ruling to the effect that the subject product is not included within the 
scope of the order, the Secretary will order any suspension of 
liquidation on the subject product ended and will instruct the Customs 
Service to refund any cash deposits or release any bonds relating to 
this product.
    (3) If the Secretary issues a final scope ruling, pursuant to either 
paragraph (b) or (d) (5) of this section, to the effect that the subject 
product is included within the scope of the order, any suspension of 
liquidation pursuant to paragraph (j)(1) or (j)(2) of this section will 
continue. Where there has been no suspension of liquidation, the 
Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to suspend liquidation and 
require a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable rate, for 
each entry of the product entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after the date of the final scope ruling. If the 
Secretary's final scope ruling is to the effect that the subject product 
is not included within the scope of the order, the Secretary will order 
any suspension of liquidation on the subject product ended and will 
instruct the Customs Service to refund any cash deposits or release any 
bonds relating to this product.
    (k) Where to file; time of filing; format and number of copies. The 
requirements of Sec. 353.31 (d), (e), (f), and (g) apply to this 
section.

Sec. 353.2, at any time prior to the deadline provided in this section 
for submission of such factual information or, if later, 10 days after 
the date such factual information is served on the interested party or, 
if appropriate, made available under administrative protective order to 
the interested party.
    (3) The Secretary will not consider in the final determination or 
the final results, or retain in the record of the proceeding, any 
factual information submitted after the applicable time limit. The 
Secretary will return such information to the submitter with written 
notice stating the reasons for return of the information.
    (b) Questionnaire responses and other submissions on request. (1) 
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may request 
any person to submit factual information at any time during a 
proceeding.
    (2) In the Secretary's written request to an interested party for a 
response to a questionnaire or for other factual information, the 
Secretary will specify the time limit for response. The Secretary 
normally will not consider or retain in the record of the proceeding

[[Page 197]]

(197of the Secretary's preliminary determination. The Secretary will 
return to the submitter, with written notice stating the reasons for 
return of the document, any untimely or unsolicited questionnaire 
responses rejected by the Department.
    (3) Ordinarily, the Secretary will not extend the time limit stated 
in the questionnaire or request for other factual information. Before 
the time limit expires, the recipient of the Secretary's request may

cost of production that is submitted by the petitioner or other 
interested party, as defined in paragraph (k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or 
(k)(6) of Sec. 353.2, later than:
    (i) In an investigation 45 days before the scheduled date for the

Secretary will determine the time limit;
    (ii) In an administrative review under Sec. 353.22 (c) or (f), 120 
days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the 
review, unless a relevant response is, in the Secretary's view, untimely 
or incomplete, in which case the Secretary will determine the time 
limit;
    (iii) In an administrative review under Sec. 353.22(h), 60 days 
after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the review, 
unless a relevant response is, in the Secretary's view, untimely or 
incomplete, in which case the Secretary will determine the time limit; 
or
    (iv) In an expedited review under Sec. 353.22(g), 10 days after the 
date of publication of the notice of initiation of the review.
    (2) Any interested party may request in writing not later than the 
time limits specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section an extension 
of those time limits. If the Assistant Secretary for Import 
Administration concludes that an extension would facilitate the proper 
administration of the law, the Assistant Secretary may grant an 
extension of not longer than 10 days in an investigation or 30 days in 
an administrative review.
    (d) Where to file; time of filing. Address and submit documents to 
the Secretary of Commerce, Attention: Import Administration, Central

Avenue and 14th St., NW., Washington, DC 20230, between the hours of 
8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on business days. For all time limits in this 
part, the Secretary will consider documents received when stamped by the 
Central Records Unit with the date and time of receipt. If the time 
limit expires on a non-business day, the Secretary will accept documents 
that are filed on the next following business day.
    (e) Format and number of copies--(1) In general. Unless the 
Secretary alters the requirements of this section, submitters shall make 
all submissions in the format specified in paragraph (e) of this 
section. The Secretary may refuse to accept for the record of the 
proceeding any submission that does not conform to the requirements of 
paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Documents. In an investigation, submit 10 copies of any 
document, except a computer printout, and, if a person has requested 
that the Secretary treat portions of the document as proprietary 
information, submit five copies of a public version of the document, 
including any public summaries required under Sec. 353.32(b) as 
substitutes for the portions for which the person has requested 
proprietary treatment;

[[Page 198]]

(198and if administrative protective order versions are required to be 
served pursuant to Sec. 353.31(g) (1) or (2), submit one copy of the 
cover page, marked as described in paragraph (e)(2)(v), together with 
only those pages that differ from the public or proprietary versions. In 
an administrative review, scope inquiry, or downstream product 
monitoring application, submit seven copies of any document, except a 
computer printout; and if a person has requested that the Secretary 
treat portions of the document as proprietary information, submit three 
copies of a public version of the document, as described above; and 
submit one copy of any administrative protective order versions required 
to be served pursuant to Sec. 353.31(g) (1) or (2), as described above. 
In an investigation, administrative review, scope inquiry, or downstream 
product monitoring application, submit documents, if prepared for that 
segment of the proceeding, on letter-size paper, single-sided and 
double-spaced. Securely bind each copy as a single document with any 
letter of transmittal as the first page of the document. Mark the first 
page of each document in the upper right-hand corner with the following 
information in the following format:
    (i) On the first line, except for a petition, the Department case 
number;
    (ii) On the second line, the total number of pages in the document 
including cover pages, appendices, and any unnumbered pages;
    (iii) On the third line, state whether the document is for an 
investigation, scope inquiry, downstream product monitoring application, 
or an administrative review and, if the latter, the inclusive dates of 
the review;
    (iv) On the fourth and subsequent lines, state whether any portion 
of the document contains classified, privileged, or proprietary 
information and, if so, list the applicable page numbers and state 
either ``Document May be Released Under APO'' or ``Document May Not be 
Released Under APO'' (see Secs. 353.32(c) and 353.34); and
    (v) For administrative protective order versions, described in 
Sec. 353.31(g) (1) or (2), complete the marking as required in 
paragraphs (i)-(iv) above for the proprietary document, but 
conspicuously mark the first page ``APO Version Prepared for [Name of 
party entitled to receive materials]''; and
    (vi) For public versions of proprietary documents, required by 
Sec. 353.32(b), complete the marking as required in paragraphs (e)(2) 
(i)-(iv) of this section for the proprietary document, but conspicuously 
mark the first page ``Public Version.''
    (3) Computer tapes and printouts. The Secretary may require 
submission of factual information on computer tape unless the Secretary 
decides that the submitter does not maintain records in computerized 
form and cannot supply the requested information on computer tape 
without unreasonable additional burden in time and expense. In an 
investigation or administrative review, the tape shall be accompanied by 
three copies of any computer printout and three copies of the public 
version of the printout.
    (f) Translation to English. Unless the Secretary waives in writing 
this requirement for an individual document, any document submitted 
which is in a foreign language must be accompanied by an English 
translation.
    (g) Service of copies on other parties. With the exception of 
petitions, proposed suspension agreements submitted under 
Sec. 353.18(g)(1)(i), and factual information submitted under 
Sec. 353.32(a) that is not required to be served on an interested party, 
the submitter of a document shall, at the same time, serve a copy of the 
document on all interested parties on the Department's service list by 
first class mail or personal service. In addition, where proprietary 
information is involved, the submitter shall serve the following 
administrative protective order versions.
    (1) With respect to parties to the proceeding that are subject to 
administrative protective orders under Sec. 353.34, the submitter of a 
document shall include that proprietary information that the interested 
party is entitled to receive under the terms of the administrative 
protective order, as well as the party's own proprietary information, 
but no other proprietary information;
    (2) With respect to interested parties that are not subject to an 
administrative protective order, but when the submission contains that 
interested

[[Page 199]]

(199party's proprietary information, the submitter of a document shall 
serve the interested party with a version that contains just the 
interested party's own proprietary information.
    The Secretary will not accept any document that is not accompanied 
by a certificate of service listing the parties served, the type of 
document served, and, for each, indicating the date and method of 
service.
    (h) Service list. The Central Records Unit will maintain and make 
available a service list for each proceeding. Each interested party 
which asks to be on the service list shall designate a person to receive 
service of documents filed in a proceeding.
    (i) Certifications. Any interested party which submits factual 
information to the Secretary must submit with the factual information 
the certification in paragraph (i)(1) and, if the party has legal 
counsel or another representative, the certification in paragraph (i)(2) 
of this section:
    (1) For the interested party's official responsible for presentation 
of the factual information:

    I, (name and title), currently employed by (interested party), 
certify that (1) I have read the attached submission, and (2) the 
information contained in this submission is, to the best of my 
knowledge, complete and accurate.

    (2) For interested party's legal counsel or other representative:

    I, (name), of (law or other firm), counsel or representative to 
(interested party), certify that (1) I have read the attached 
submission, and (2) based on the information made available to me by 
(interested party), I have no reason to believe that this submission 
contains any material misrepresentation or omission of fact.

FR 30902, July 13, 1992; 60 FR 25135, May 11, 1995]

Sec. 353.32  Request for proprietary treatment of information.

    (a) Submission and content of request. (1) Any person who submits 
factual information to the Secretary in connection with a proceeding may 
request that the Secretary treat that information, or any specified 
part, as proprietary.
    (2) The submitter shall identify proprietary information on each 
page by placing brackets around the proprietary information and clearly 
stating at the top of each page containing such information 
``Proprietary Treatment Requested'' and the warning ``Bracketing of 
proprietary information not final for one business day after date of 
filing.'' The bracketing becomes final one business day after the date 
of filing of the document, i.e., at the same time as the nonbusiness 
proprietary version of the document is due to be filed. Until the 
bracketing becomes final, recipients of the document may not divulge any 
part of the contents of the document to anyone not subject to the 
administrative protective order issued in the investigation. After the 
bracketing becomes final, recipients may divulge the pubic version of 
the document to anyone not subject to the administrative protective 
order. If the submitter discovers it has failed to bracket correctly, 
the submitter may file a corrected version or portion of the business 
proprietary document at the same time as the nonbusiness proprietary 
version is filed. No changes to the document other than bracketing and 
deletion of business proprietary information are permitted after the 
deadline. Failure to comply with this paragraph may result in the 
striking from the record of all or a portion of a submitter's document.
    (3) The submitter shall provide a full explanation why each piece of 
factual information subject to the request is entitled to proprietary 
treatment under Sec. 353.4. The request and explanation shall be a part 
of or securely bound with the document containing the information.
    (b) Public summary. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, not later than one business day after submitting information 
for which proprietary treatment is requested, any person who requests 
proprietary treatment shall provide to the Secretary.
    (1) An adequate public summary of all proprietary information, 
incorporated in the public version of the document (generally, numeric 
data are adequately summarized if grouped or presented in terms of 
indices, or figures

[[Page 200]]

(200within 10 percent of the actual figure, and if an individual portion 
of the data is voluminous, at least one percent representative of that 
portion is individually summarized in this manner); or
    (2) A statement itemizing those portions of the proprietary 
information which cannot be summarized adequately and all arguments 
supporting that conclusion for each portion.
    (3) All requests for proprietary treatment of information contained 
in petitions submitted under Sec. 353.12 and proposed suspension 
agreements submitted under Sec. 353.18(g)(1)(i) shall be accompanied by 
a public summary and statement described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) 
of this section.
    (c) Agreement to release. All requests for proprietary treatment 
shall include either an agreement to permit disclosure under 
administrative protective order, or a statement itemizing which portions 
of the proprietary information should not be released under 
administrative protective order and all arguments supporting that 
conclusion for each portion. The Secretary ordinarily will not provide 
the submitter further opportunity for argument on whether to grant a 
request for disclosure under administrative protective order.
    (d) Return of information as a result of nonconforming request. The 
Secretary may return to the submitter any factual information for which 
the submitter requested proprietary treatment when the request does not 
conform to the requirements of this section and in any event will not 
consider the information. If the Secretary returns the information, the 
Secretary will provide a written explanation of the reasons why it does 
not conform and will not consider it unless it is resubmitted with a new 
request which complies with the requirements of this section not later 
than two business days after receipt of the Department's explanation for 
rejection of the information.
    (e) Status during consideration of request. While considering 
whether to grant a request for proprietary treatment, the Secretary will 
not disclose or make public the information. The Secretary normally will 
decide not later than 14 days after the Secretary receives the request.
    (f) Treatment of proprietary information. Unless the Secretary 
otherwise provides, the person to whom the Secretary discloses 
information shall not disclose the information to any other person. The 
Secretary may disclose factual information which the Secretary decides 
is proprietary only to:
    (1) A representative of an interested party who requests and is 
granted an administrative protective order under Sec. 353.34;
    (2) An employee of the Department directly involved in the 
proceeding for which the information is submitted;
    (3) An employee of the Commission directly involved in the 
proceeding for which the information is submitted;
    (4) An employee of the Customs Service directly involved in 
conducting a fraud investigation relating to an antidumping duty 
proceeding on the merchandise;
    (5) Any person to whom the submitter specifically authorizes (in 
writing) disclosure; and
    (6) A charged party or counsel for the charged party under part 354 
of this title (19 CFR Part 354).
    (g) Denial of request for proprietary treatment. If the Secretary 
decides that the factual information does not warrant proprietary 
treatment in whole or in part, the Secretary will notify the submitter. 
Unless the submitter agrees that the information be considered public, 
the Secretary will return the information to the submitter with written 
notice stating the reasons for return of the information and will not 
consider it in the proceeding.

    Privileged or classified information is exempt from disclosure to 
the public or to representatives of interested parties.

Sec. 353.34  Disclosure of proprietary information under administrative 
          protective order.

    (a) In general. Upon receipt of an application (before or after 
receipt of the information requested) which describes

[[Page 201]]

(201in general terms the information requested and sets forth the 
reasons for the request, the Secretary shall require all proprietary 
information presented to, or obtained by it, during a segment of a 
proceeding (except privileged information, classified information, and 
specific information of a type for which there is a clear and compelling 
need to withhold from disclosure) to be disclosed to interested parties 
who are parties to the proceeding under a protective order described in 
this section, regardless of when the information is submitted during the 
segment of the proceeding.
    (b) Request for disclosure. (1) A representative must file a request 
for disclosure under administrative protective order not later than the 
later of:
    (i) 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register of 
the notice of initiation under Sec. 353.11 or Sec. 353.13, or the notice 
of initiation of administrative review under Sec. 353.22; or
    (ii) 30 days after the initiation of a scope inquiry pursuant to 
Sec. 353.29(a) or (b); or
    (iii) 10 days after the date the representative's client or employer 
becomes a party to the proceeding, but in no event later than the date 
the case briefs, under Sec. 353.38 are due.
    (2) The representative must file the request for disclosure on the 
standard form provided by the Secretary (Form ITA-367). The standard 
form will require only such particularity in the description of the 
requested information as is consistent with both the criteria the 
Secretary uses to decide whether to disclose, and with the fact that a 
request may be made for factual information not yet submitted.
    (3) The request shall obligate the representative:
    (i) Not to disclose the proprietary information to anyone other than 
the submitter and other persons authorized by an administrative 
protective order to have access to the information;
    (ii) To use the information solely for the segment of the proceeding 
in which it was submitted;
    (iii) To ensure the security of the proprietary information at all 
times; and
    (iv) To report promptly to the Secretary any apparent violation of 
the terms of the protective order.
    (4) The request shall contain an acknowledgment by the 
representative that:
    (i) A representative determined to have violated a protective order 
may be subject to any or all of the sanctions listed in part 354 of this 
title; and
    (ii) The firm of which a person determined to have violated a 
protective order is a partner, associate, or employee, and any partner, 
associate, employer, or employee of such person, may be subject to any 
or all of the sanctions listed in part 354 of this title.
    (5) The Secretary will decide whether to disclose information under 
administrative protective order:
    (i) Not later than 14 days after the date on which the information 
is submitted; or
    (ii) If--
    (A) The person who submitted the information raises objection to its 
release, or
    (B) The information is usually voluminous or complex,

not later than 30 days after the date on which the information is 
submitted.
    (6) If the Secretary decides that disclosure of information under 
administrative protective order is proper under paragraph (5), above:
    (i) With respect to proprietary information submitted to the 
Secretary on or before the date of the decision to disclose, the 
submitting party shall, within two business days of the date of 
decision, serve the party which requested such disclosure, in accordance 
with Sec. 353.31(g); and
    (ii) The submitting party shall serve all future submissions of 
proprietary information directly on the requesting party as required by 
Sec. 353.31(g).
    (c) Opportunity to withdraw proprietary information. If the 
Secretary decides to require disclosure of proprietary information under 
administrative protective order without the consent of the submitter, 
the Secretary will provide to the submitter written notice of the 
decision and the reasons therefor and will permit the submitter to 
withdraw the information from the official record within two business 
days. The Secretary will not consider

[[Page 202]]

(202withdrawn information. Furthermore, if the submitter does not 
withdraw the information but fails to serve the party requesting such 
information, in accordance with Sec. 353.34(b)(6), the Secretary will 
not consider such information.
    (d) Disposition of proprietary information disclosed under 
administrative protective order. (1) At the expiration of the time for 
filing for judicial review of a decision by the Secretary, if there is 
no filing by any party to the proceeding, or at an earlier date the 
Secretary decides appropriate, the representative must return or destroy 
all proprietary information released under this section and all other 
materials containing the proprietary information (such as notes or 
memoranda). The representative at that time must certify to the 
Secretary full compliance with the terms of the protective order and the 
return or destruction of all proprietary information.
    (2) The representative of a party to the proceeding that files for 
judicial review or intervenes in the judicial review may retain the 
proprietary information, provided that the party applies for a court 
protective order for the information not later than 15 days after the 
Secretary files the administrative record with the court. If the court 
denies the party's application for a court protective order, the 
representative must return or destroy the proprietary information and 
all other materials containing the proprietary information not later 
than 48 hours after the court's decision and certify to the Secretary as 
provided under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) Violation of administrative protective order. The procedures for 
investigating any alleged violation of an administrative protective 
order issued under this section and for imposing sanctions for a 
violation of such order are set forth in part 354 of this title (19 CFR 
Part 354).

[53 FR 12769, Mar. 28, 1988, as amended at 55 FR 9052, Mar. 9, 1990]

Sec. 353.35  Ex parte meeting.

    The Secretary will prepare for the official record a written 
memorandum of any ex parte meeting between any person providing factual 
information in connection with a proceeding and the person to whom the 
Secretary has delegated the authority to make the decision in question 
or the person making a final recommendation to that person. The 
memorandum will include the date, time, and place of the meeting, the 
identity and affiliation of all persons present, and a public summary of 
the factual information submitted.

Sec. 353.36  Verification of information.

    (a) In general. (1) The Secretary will verify all factual 
information the Secretary relies on in:
    (i) A final determination under Sec. 353.18(i) or Sec. 353.20;
    (ii) The final results of an expedited review under Sec. 353.22(g);
    (iii) A revocation under Sec. 353.25;
    (iv) The final results of an administrative review under Sec. 353.22 
(c) or (f) if the Secretary decides that good cause for verification 
exists; and
    (v) The final results of an administrative review under 
Sec. 353.22(c) if:
    (A) An interested party, as defined in paragraph (k)(3), (k)(4), 
(k)(5), or (k)(6) of Sec. 353.2, not later than 120 days after the date 
of publication of the notice of initiation of review, submits a written 
request for verification; and
    (B) The Secretary conducted no verification under this paragraph 
during either of the two immediately preceding administrative reviews.
    (2) If the Secretary decides that, because of the large number of 
producers and resellers included in an investigation or administrative 
review, it is impractical to verify relevant factual information for 
each person, the Secretary may select and verify a sample. The Secretary 
will apply the results of the verification of the sample to all 
producers and resellers included in the investigation or review.
    (b) Notice of verification. In publishing a notice of final 
determination, revocation, or final results of administrative review, 
the Secretary will report the methods and procedures used to verify 
under this section.
    (c) Procedures for verification. In verifying under this section, 
the Secretary will notify the government of the foreign country in which 
verification takes place that employees of the Department will visit 
with producers or

[[Page 203]]

(203resellers in order to verify the accuracy and completeness of 
submitted factual information. As part of the verification, employees of 
the Department will request access to all files, records, and personnel 
of the producers, resellers, importers, or unrelated purchasers which 
the Secretary considers relevant to factual information submitted.

Sec. 353.37  Best information available.

    (a) Use of best information available. The Secretary will use the 
best information available whenever the Secretary:
    (1) Does not receive a complete, accurate, and timely response to 
the Secretary's request for factual information; or
    (2) Is unable to verify, within the time specified, the accuracy and 
completeness of the factual information submitted.
    (b) What is best information available. The best information 
available may include the factual information submitted in support of 
the petition or subsequently submitted by interested parties, as defined 
in paragraph (k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of Sec. 353.2. If an 
interested party refuses to provide factual information requested by the 
Secretary or otherwise impedes the proceeding, the Secretary may take 
that into account in determining what is the best information available.

Sec. 353.38   Written argument and hearings.

    (a) Written argument. The Secretary will consider in making the 
final determination under Sec. 353.18(i) or Sec. 353.20 or the final 
results under Sec. 353.22 only written arguments in case or rebuttal 
briefs filed within the time limits in this section. The Secretary will 
not consider or retain in the record of the proceeding any written 
argument, unless requested by the Secretary (and received within the 
time limit specified by the Secretary), that is submitted after the time 
limits specified in this section. At any time during the proceeding, the 
Secretary may request written argument on any issue from any interested 
party or United States government agency. The Secretary will return to 
the submitter, with written notice stating the reasons for return of the 
document, any written argument submitted after the time limits specified 
in this section or by the Secretary.
    (b) Request for hearing. Not later than 10 days after the date of 
publication of the Secretary's preliminary determination or preliminary 
results of administrative review, unless the Secretary alters this time 
limit, any interested party may request that the Secretary hold a public 
hearing on arguments to be raised in case or rebuttal briefs. To the 
extent practicable, a party requesting a hearing shall identify 
arguments to be raised at the hearing. At the hearing, an interested 
party may make an affirmative presentation only on arguments included in 
that party's case brief and may make a rebuttal presentation only on 
arguments included in that party's rebuttal brief.
    (c) Case brief. (1) Any interested party or U.S. Government agency 
may submit a ``case brief'':
    (i) Not later than 50 days after the date of publication of the 
Secretary's preliminary determination in an investigation, unless the 
Secretary alters this time limit;
    (ii) Not later than 30 days after the date of publication of the 
preliminary results of administrative review under Sec. 353.22 (c) or 
(f); or
    (iii) At any time specified by the Secretary in an expedited review 
under Sec. 353.22(g).
    (2) The case brief shall separately present in full all arguments 
that continue in the submitter's view to be relevant to the Secretary's 
final determination or final results, including any arguments presented 
before the date of publication of the preliminary determination or 
preliminary results.
    (d) Rebuttal brief. Not later than the time limit stated in the 
notice of the Secretary's preliminary determination or preliminary 
results (or otherwise specified by the Secretary for an expedited review 
under Sec. 353.22(g)), ordinarily five days in an investigation and 
seven days in an administrative review after the time limit for filing 
the case brief, any interested party or U.S. Government agency may 
submit a ``rebuttal brief.'' The rebuttal brief shall separately present 
in full all rebuttal arguments, responding only to arguments raised in 
case briefs.

[[Page 204]]

(204
    (e) Service of briefs. The submitter of either a case or rebuttal 
brief shall serve a copy of that brief on any interested party on the 
Department's service list and on any U.S. Government agency that has 
submitted in the segment of the proceeding a case or rebuttal brief. If 
the party has designated under Sec. 353.31(h) an agent in the United 
States, service shall be either by personal service on the same day the 
brief is filed with the Secretary or by overnight mail or courier on the 
next day and, if the party has designated an agent outside the United 
States, service shall be by first class airmail. The submitter shall 
attach to each brief a certificate of service listing the parties 
(including agents) served and, for each, the date and method of service.
    (f) Hearings. If an interested party submits a request under 
paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will hold a public hearing 
on the date stated in the notice of the Secretary's preliminary 
determination or preliminary results of administrative review (or 
otherwise specified by the Secretary in an expedited review under 
Sec. 353.22(g)), unless the Secretary alters the date. Ordinarily, the 
hearing will be held, in an investigation, two days after the scheduled 
date for submission of rebuttal briefs and, in an administrative review, 
seven days after the scheduled date for submission of rebuttal briefs.
    (1) The Secretary will place a verbatim transcript of the hearing in 
the public and official records of the proceeding and will announce at 
the hearing how interested parties may obtain copies of the transcript.
    (2) One of the following employees of the Department will chair the 
hearing: the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration; the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration; the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Investigations; the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Compliance; or the office or division director responsible for the 
proceeding.
    (3) The hearing is not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Witness testimony, if any, shall not be under oath or subject to cross-

under this part, the Secretary will specify a date on which the 
Secretary will cease collecting information and on which the Secretary 
will release to parties that have participated in the investigation or 
review all information on which the parties have not previously had an 
opportunity to comment. Any such information that is business 
proprietary information will be released to persons authorized to obtain 
such information pursuant to Sec. 353.34. Parties shall have an 
opportunity to file written comments on any information released to 
them, and the date on which such comments must be filed will be

Subpart D--Calculation of United States Price, Fair Value, and Foreign Market Value

Sec. 353.41  Calculation of United States price.

    (a) In general. United States price means the purchase price or the 
exporter's sales price of the merchandise, as appropriate. In 
calculating the United States price, the Secretary will use sales or, in 
the absence of sales, likely sales, as defined in Sec. 353.2(t).
    (b) Purchase price. ``Purchase price'' means the price at which the 
merchandise is sold or likely to be sold prior to the date of 
importation, by a producer or reseller of the merchandise for 
exportation to the United States. The Secretary will make appropriate 
adjustments for costs and expenses under

[[Page 205]]

(205paragraph (d) of this section if they are not reflected in the sales 
price to the importer. Whenever purchase price is used and there is 
reason to believe that the sales price to the importer does not reflect 
the cost and expenses incident to bringing the merchandise from the 
country of exportation, then the Secretary will make appropriate 
adjustments for such cost and expenses under paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (c) Exporter's sales price. ``Exporter's sales price'' means the 
price at which merchandise is sold or likely to be sold in the United 
States, before or after the time of importation, by or for the account 
of the exporter (defined in section 771(13) of the Act), as adjusted 
under paragraphs (d) and (e).
    (d) Adjustments to United States price. (1) The Secretary will 
increase the United States price by:
    (i) When not included in the price, the cost of containers, 
coverings, and other expenses incident to placing the merchandise in 
condition packed ready for shipment to the United States;
    (ii) The amount of any import duties imposed by the country of 
exportation which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, 
by reason of exportation of the merchandise;
    (iii) The amount of any taxes imposed in the country of exportation 
directly on the exported merchandise or components thereof, which have 
been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the 
exportation of the merchandise, but only to the extent that such taxes 
are added to or included in the price of such or similar merchandise 
sold in the country of exportation; and
    (iv) The amount of any countervailing duty imposed on the 
merchandise to offset an export subsidy.
    (2) The Secretary will reduce the United States price by the amount, 
if included in the price, of:
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(iv), any cost and 
expenses, and United States import duties incident to bringing the 
merchandise from the place of shipment in the country of exportation to 
the place of delivery in the United States; and
    (ii) Any export tax, duty, or other charge imposed by the country of 
exportation on the exportation of the merchandise, other than an export 
tax, duty, or other charge described in section 771(6)(C) of the Act.
    (e) Additional adjustments to exporter's sales price. The Secretary 
also will reduce the exporter's sales price by the amount of:
    (1) Commissions for selling in the United States the merchandise;
    (2) Expenses generally incurred by or for the account of the 
exporter in selling the merchandise, or attributable under generally 
accepted accounting principles to the merchandise; and
    (3) Any increased value resulting from a process of production or 
assembly performed on the merchandise after importation and before sale 
to a person who is not the exporter of the merchandise, which value the 
Secretary generally will determine from the cost of material, 
fabrication, and other expenses incurred in such production or assembly.

Sec. 353.42  Fair value.

    (a) Relationship to foreign market value. Fair value, used during 
the investigation, is an estimate of foreign market value. Except as 
otherwise specifically noted, a reference in this subpart to ``foreign 
market value'' applies to ``fair value,'' but a reference to ``fair 
value'' in this subpart does not necessarily apply to ``foreign market 
value.''
    (b) Sales examined. (1) The Secretary normally will examine not less 
than 60 percent of the dollar value or volume of the merchandise sold 
during a period of at least 150 days prior to and 30 days after the 
first day of the month during which the petition was filed or the 
Secretary initiated the investigation under Sec. 353.11, but the 
Secretary may examine the merchandise for any additional or alternative 
period the Secretary concludes is appropriate.
    (2) If the Secretary examines less than 85 percent of the dollar 
value or volume of the merchandise sold during the period described in 
paragraph (b)(1), the Secretary will notify the affected foreign 
government what percentage of total sales are being examined.

[[Page 206]]

(206

Sec. 353.43  Sales used in calculating foreign market value.

    (a) Sales and offers for sale. In calculating foreign market value, 
the Secretary will use sales, as defined in Sec. 353.2(t), and offers 
for sale, but the Secretary normally will consider offers only in the 
absence of sales and only if the Secretary concludes that acceptance of 
the offer can be reasonably expected.
    (b) Fictitious sales and offers. In calculating foreign market 
value, the Secretary will reject any fictitious sale or offer.
    (c) Restricted sales. When sales used to calculate foreign market 
value are restricted, the Secretary will adjust the price, as 
appropriate, to compensate for restrictions that affect the value of the 
merchandise to the purchasers.

Sec. 353.44  Sales at varying prices.

    (a) Weighted-average price or prices. If the sales which the 
Secretary may use to calculate foreign market value vary in price (after 
allowances provided for in Secs. 353.55, 353.56, 353.57, and 353.58), 
the Secretary normally will calculate foreign market value based on the 
weighted average of those prices.
    (b) Preponderant price. If not less than 80 percent of the sales 
which the Secretary may use to calculate foreign market value during the 
period under examination were made at the same price, the Secretary will 
calculate foreign market value based on the sales at that price.
    (c) Other reasonable method. If the Secretary decides that paragraph 
(b) does not apply and that paragraph (a) is inappropriate, the 
Secretary will use any other method for calculating foreign market value 
which the Secretary deems appropriate.
    (d) Sales below cost of production. For purposes of paragraph (a) or 
(b), the Secretary will not use sales disregarded under Sec. 353.51.

Sec. 353.45  Transactions between related persons.

    (a) Sales to a related person. If a producer or reseller sold such 
or similar merchandise to a person related as described in section 
771(13) of the Act, the Secretary ordinarily will calculate foreign 
market value based on that sale only if satisfied that the price is 
comparable to the price at which the producer or reseller sold such or 
similar merchandise to a person not related to the seller.
    (b) Sales through a related person. If a producer or reseller sold 
such or similar merchandise through a person related as described in 
section 771(13) of the Act, the Secretary may calculate foreign market 
value based on the sale by such related person.

Sec. 353.46  Calculation of foreign market value based on price in the 
          home market country.

    (a) In general. (1) The Secretary ordinarily will calculate the 
foreign market value of the merchandise based on the price at which such 
or similar merchandise is sold or offered for sale in the principal 
markets of the home market country, in the usual commercial quantities 
and in the ordinary course of trade for home consumption, plus, when not 
included in the price, the cost of containers, coverings, and other 
expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed ready 
for shipment to the United States.
    (2) When United States price is based on purchase price, under 
Sec. 353.41(b), the Secretary will calculate foreign market value, under 
paragraph (a)(1), based on the price at the time the producer or 
reseller sells the merchandise for exportation to the United States.
    (3) When United States price is based on exporter's sales price, 
under Sec. 353.41(c), the Secretary will calculate foreign market value, 
under paragraph (a)(1), based on the price at the time the importer 
sells the merchandise in the United States to a person not related under 
section 773(e)(4) of the Act.
    (b) Ordinary course of trade. In determining the ordinary course of 
trade, the Secretary will consider the conditions and practices which, 
for a reasonable period prior to the time described in paragraph (a), 
have been normal in the trade of merchandise of the same class or kind 
in the home market country.
    (c) Transshipments. If the merchandise is not imported directly from 
the home market country but is merely transshipped through another 
country, the Secretary will not, except under

[[Page 207]]

(207Sec. 353.47, calculate foreign market value based on the price at 
which such or similar merchandise is sold in the country of 
transshipment.

Sec. 353.47  Exportation from an intermediate country.

    The Secretary will calculate the foreign market value of such or 
similar merchandise based on sales in the intermediate country rather 
than sales in the home market country if:
    (a) A reseller in an intermediate country purchases the merchandise 
from the producer;
    (b) The producer of the merchandise does not know (at the time of 
the sale to that reseller) the country to which such reseller intends to 
export the merchandise;
    (c) The merchandise enters the commerce of the intermediate country 
but is not substantially transformed in that country; and
    (d) The merchandise subsequently is exported to the United States.

Sec. 353.48  Calculation of foreign market value if sales in the home 
          market country are inadequate.

    (a) In general. Except as provided in Sec. 353.53, if the quantity 
of such or similar merchandise sold during the period being examined for 
consumption in the home market country is so small in relation to the 
quantity sold for exportation to third countries (normally, less than 
five percent of the amount sold to third countries) that it is an 
inadequate basis for the foreign market value of the merchandise, the 
Secretary will calculate the foreign market value of the merchandise 
under either Sec. 353.49 or Sec. 353.50.
    (b) Preference for third country sales. The Secretary normally will 
prefer foreign market value based on sales to a third country rather 
than on constructed value if adequate information is available and can 
be verified, if a verification is conducted, within the time required.
    (c) Definition of ``third country.'' For purposes of this section 
and of Sec. 353.49, a third country means any country other than the 
home market country or the United States.

Sec. 353.49  Calculation of foreign market value based on sales to a 
          third country.

    (a) In general. (1) If foreign market value is based on sales to a 
third country, the Secretary will calculate the foreign market value 
based on the price at which such or similar merchandise is sold or 
offered for sale to a third country, plus, when not included in the 
price, the cost of containers, coverings, and other expenses incident to 
placing the merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the 
United States.
    (2) When United States price is based on purchase price, under 
Sec. 353.41(b), the Secretary will calculate foreign market value, under 
paragraph (a)(1), based on the price at the time the producer or a 
reseller sells the merchandise for exportation to the United States.
    (3) When United States price is based on exporter's sales price, 
under Sec. 353.41(c), the Secretary will calculate foreign market value, 
under paragraph (a)(1), based on the price at the time the importer 
sells the merchandise in the United States to a person not related under 
section 773(e)(4) of the Act.
    (b) Selection of third country. The Secretary generally will select 
the third country based on the following criteria:
    (1) Such or similar merchandise exported to the country is more 
similar to the merchandise exported to the United States than is such or 
similar merchandise exported to other countries, and the Secretary 
decides that the volume of sales to the country is adequate;
    (2) The volume of sales to the country is the largest to any country 
other than the home market country or the United States; and
    (3) The market in the country, in terms of organization and 
development, is most like the United States market.
    (c) Selection of more than one third country. In order to find 
adequate sales under paragraph (b), the Secretary may aggregate sales to 
more than a single third country.

[[Page 208]]

(208

Sec. 353.50  Calculation of foreign market value based on constructed 
          value.

    (a) Method of calculating constructed value. If foreign market value 
is based on constructed value, the Secretary will calculate the foreign 
market value by adding:
    (1) The cost of materials used in producing such or similar 
merchandise (exclusive of any internal tax in the home market country 
applied directly to the materials or their disposition, but remitted or 
refunded upon exportation) and the cost of fabrication or other 
processing of any kind used in producing such or similar merchandise, at 
a time specified in paragraph (b) which would ordinarily permit the 
production of that particular merchandise in the ordinary course of 
business;
    (2) General expenses and profit usually reflected in sales of 
merchandise of the same class or kind as the merchandise by producers in 
the home market country, in the usual commercial quantities and in the 
ordinary course of trade, except that the amount for general expenses 
shall not be less than 10 percent of the cost under paragraph (a)(1) and 
the amount for profit shall not be less than 8 percent of the sum of the 
amount for general expenses and the cost under paragraph (a)(1); and
    (3) The cost of containers, coverings, and other expenses incident 
to placing the merchandise in condition packed ready for shipment to the 
United States.
    (b) Time for calculating constructed value. (1) When United States 
price is based on purchase price, under Sec. 353.41(b), the Secretary 
will calculate constructed value, under paragraph (a), based on the 
relevant costs and expenses at a time preceding the time the producer or 
a reseller sells the merchandise for exportation to the United States.
    (2) When United States price is based on exporter's sales price, 
under Sec. 353.41(c), the Secretary will calculate constructed value, 
under paragraph (a), based on the relevant costs and expenses at a time 
preceding the time the importer sells the merchandise in the United 
States to a person not related under section 773(e)(4) of the Act.
    (c) Transactions with related parties. In calculating constructed 
value under paragraph (a), the Secretary may disregard any direct or 
indirect transaction between persons related under section 773(e)(4) of 
the Act for any element of value required to be considered under 
paragraph (a) that does not fairly reflect the usual amount for sales in 
that market of that element. If the Secretary disregards a transaction 
and there are no other transactions available for consideration, the 
Secretary will calculate the amount based on available information as to 
what the amount would have been if the transaction had occurred between 
persons not related.

Sec. 353.51  Calculation of foreign market value if sales are made at 
          less than cost of production.

    (a) Disregarding sales at less than cost. If the Secretary has 
reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that the sales on which the 
Secretary could base the calculation of foreign market value under 
Sec. 353.46, Sec. 353.49, or Sec. 353.53 are at prices less than the 
cost of production, the Secretary, in calculating foreign market value, 
will disregard such sales if they:
    (1) Have been made over an extended period and in substantial 
quantities; and
    (2) Are not at prices which permit recovery of all costs within a 
reasonable period in the normal course of trade.
    (b) Use of constructed value if above-cost sales are inadequate. If 
the Secretary disregards sales under paragraph (a), and concludes that 
the remaining sales at not less than the cost of production are 
inadequate for calculating foreign market value, the Secretary will 
calculate foreign market value based on constructed value under 
Sec. 353.50.
    (c) Calculation of cost of production. The Secretary will calculate 
the cost of production based on the cost of materials, fabrication, and 
general expenses, but excluding profit, incurred in producing such or 
similar merchandise.

Sec. 353.52  Calculation of foreign market value of merchandise from 
          state-controlled-economy countries.

    (a) In general. If the Secretary determines that the economy of the 
home market country is state-controlled to the extent that sales or 
offers for sale of such or similar merchandise in that country or to a 
third country do not permit calculation of foreign market value under 
Sec. 353.46, Sec. 353.49, or Sec. 353.53, the Secretary will calculate 
foreign market value based on, in order of preference:
    (1) The prices, calculated in accordance with Sec. 353.46 or 
Sec. 353.49, at which such or similar merchandise produced in a non-
state-controlled-economy country is sold either:
    (i) For consumption in that country; or
    (ii) To another country, including the United States; or
    (2) The constructed value of such or similar merchandise in a non-
state-controlled-economy country, calculated in accordance with 
Sec. 353.50.
    (b) Comparability of economies. For purposes of paragraph (a), the 
Secretary will select, in order of preference, prices or costs in:
    (1) A non-state-controlled-economy country other than the United 
States at a stage of economic development that the Secretary concludes 
is comparable to that of the home market country, based on generally 
recognized criteria, including per capita gross national product and 
infrastructure development (particularly in the industry producing such 
or similar merchandise);
    (2) A non-state-controlled-economy country other than the United 
States that is not at a stage of economic development comparable to that 
of the home market country (in which case the Secretary will adjust the 
foreign market value for known differences in the costs of material and 
fabrication); or
    (3) The United States.
    (c) Use of factors of production. If such or similar merchandise is 
not produced in a non-state-controlled-economy country which the 
Secretary concludes to be comparable in terms of economic development to 
the home market country, the Secretary may calculate the foreign market 
value using constructed value based on factors of production incurred in 
the home market country in producing the merchandise, including, but not 
limited to, hours of labor required, quantities of raw materials 
employed, and amounts of energy consumed, if the Secretary obtains and 
verifies such information from the producer of the merchandise in the 
home market country. The Secretary will value the factors of production 
in a non-state-controlled-economy country which the Secretary considers 
comparable in economic development to the home market country. The 
Secretary will include in this calculation of constructed value an 
amount for general expenses and profit, as required by section 
773(e)(1)(B) of the Act, and the cost of containers, coverings, and 
other expenses, as required by section 773(e)(1)(C) of the Act.

Sec. 353.53  Calculation of foreign market value based on sales by a 
          multinational corporation.

    The Secretary will calculate the foreign market value of merchandise 
sold by certain multinational corporations described in section 773(d) 
of the Act in accordance with provisions of that section.

Sec. 353.54  Claims for adjustment to foreign market value.

    Any interested party that claims an adjustment under Secs. 353.55 
through 353.58 must establish the claim to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary.

Sec. 353.55  Differences in quantities.

    (a) In general. In comparing the United States price with foreign 
market value, the Secretary normally will use sales of comparable 
quantities of merchandise. The Secretary will make a reasonable 
allowance for any difference in quantities, to the extent that the 
Secretary is satisfied that the amount of any price differential is 
wholly or partly due to that difference in quantities. In making the 
allowance, the Secretary will consider, among other things, the practice 
of the industry in the relevant country with respect to affording 
quantity discounts to those which purchase in the ordinary course of 
trade.

[[Page 210]]

(210
    (b) Sales with quantity discount in calculating foreign market 
value. The Secretary will calculate foreign market value based on sales 
with quantity discounts if:
    (1) During the period examined or during a more representative 
period, the producer or reseller granted quantity discounts of at least 
the same magnitude on 20 percent or more of sales of such or similar 
merchandise for the relevant country; or
    (2) The producer demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that 
the discounts reflect savings specifically attributable to the 
production of the different quantities.
    (c) Sales with quantity discounts in calculating weighted-average 
foreign market value. If the producer or reseller does not satisfy the 
conditions in paragraph (b), the Secretary will calculate foreign market 
value based on a weighted-average price or prices that include sales at 
a discount.
    (d) In determining whether a discount has been given, the existence 
of a published price list reflecting such a discount will not be 
controlling. A price list ordinarily will be accepted only if, in the 
line of trade and market under consideration, the producer or reseller 
demonstrates that it has adhered to its price list.

Sec. 353.56  Differences in circumstances of sale.

    (a) In general. (1) In calculating foreign market value, the 
Secretary will make a reasonable allowance for a bona fide difference in 
the circumstances of the sales compared if the Secretary is satisfied 
that the amount of any price differential is wholly or partly due to 
such difference. In general, the Secretary will limit allowances to 
those circumstances which bear a direct relationship to the sales 
compared.
    (2) Differences in circumstances of sale for which the Secretary 
will make reasonable allowances normally are those involving differences 
in commissions, credit terms, guarantees, warranties, technical 
assistance, and servicing. The Secretary also will make reasonable 
allowances for differences in selling costs (such as advertising) 
incurred by the producer or reseller but normally only to the extent 
that such costs are assumed by the producer or reseller on behalf of the 
purchaser from that producer or reseller.
    (b) Special rule. (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), the Secretary 
normally will make a reasonable allowance for other selling expenses if 
the Secretary makes a reasonable allowance for commissions in one of the 
markets under consideration and no commission is paid in the other 
market under consideration, but the Secretary will limit the amount of 
such allowance to the amount of the other selling expenses incurred in 
the one market or the commissions allowed in the other market, whichever 
is less.
    (2) In comparisons with exporter's sales price, the Secretary will 
make a reasonable deduction from foreign market value for all expenses, 
other than those described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2), incurred in 
selling such or similar merchandise up to the amount of the expenses, 
other that those described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2), incurred in 
selling the merchandise.
    (c) Reasonable allowance. In deciding what is a reasonable allowance 
for any difference in circumstances of sale, the Secretary normally will 
consider the cost of such difference to the producer or reseller but, if 
appropriate, may also consider the effect of such difference on the 
market value of the merchandise.

Sec. 353.57  Differences in physical characteristics.

     (a) In general. In calculating foreign market value, the Secretary 
will make a reasonable allowance for differences in the physical 
characteristics of merchandise compared to the extent that the Secretary 
is satisfied that the amount of any price differential is wholly or 
partly due to such difference.
     (b) Reasonable allowance. In deciding what is a reasonable 
allowance for any difference in physical characteristics, the Secretary 
normally will consider differences in the cost of production but, where 
appropriate, may also consider differences in the market value. The 
Secretary will not consider differences in cost of production when 
compared merchandise has identical physical characteristics.

[[Page 211]]

(211

Sec. 353.58  Level of trade.

     The Secretary normally will calculate foreign market value and 
United States price based on sales at the same commercial level of 
trade. If sales at the same commercial level of trade are insufficient 
in number to permit an adequate comparison, the Secretary will calculate 
foreign market value based on sales of such or similar merchandise at 
the most comparable commercial level of trade as sales of the 
merchandise and make appropriate adjustments for differences affecting 
price comparability.

Sec. 353.59  Disregarding insignificant adjustments; use of averaging 
          and sampling.

     (a) Insignificant adjustments. The Secretary may disregard 
adjustments to foreign market value which are insignificant. Ordinarily, 
the Secretary will disregard individual adjustments having an ad valorem 
effect of less than 0.33 percent, or any group of adjustments having an 
ad valorem effect of less than 1.0 percent, of the foreign market value. 
Groups of adjustments are differences in circumstances of sale, 
differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, and 
differences in the levels of trade.
     (b) Averaging or sampling. (1) In calculating United States price 
or foreign market value, the Secretary may use averaging or generally 
recognized sampling techniques whenever a significant volume of sales or 
number of adjustments are involved.
     (2) The Secretary will select the appropriate representative 
samples.

Sec. 353.60  Conversion of currency.

     (a) Rule for conversion. The Secretary will convert, under section 
522 of the Act (31 U.S.C. 5151(c)), a foreign currency into the 
equivalent amount of United States currency at the rates in effect on 
the dates described in Sec. 353.46, Sec. 353.49, or Sec. 353.50, as 
appropriate.
     (b) Special rules for investigations. For purposes of 
investigations, producers, resellers, and importers will be expected to 
act within a reasonable period of time to take into account price 
differences resulting from sustained changes in prevailing exchange 
rates. When the price of the merchandise is affected by temporary 
exchange rate fluctuations, the Secretary will not take into account in 
fair value comparisons any difference between United States price and 
foreign market value resulting solely from such exchange rate 
fluctuation.

section would prevent the Department from complying with other 
requirements of law.

Sec. 354.1  Scope.

    This part sets forth the procedures for imposing sanctions for 
violation of an administrative protective order issued under 19 CFR 
353.30 or 355.20, or successor regulations, as authorized by 19 U.S.C. 
1677f(c).

Sec. 354.2  Definitions.

    For purposes of this part:
    (a) Affected party means a party against whom sanctions have been 
proposed but who is not a charged party;
    (b) APO Sanctions Board means the Administrative Protective Order 
Sanctions Board;
    (c) Charged party means a person who is charged by the Deputy Under 
Secretary with violating a protective order;
    (d) Chief Counsel means Chief Counsel for Import Administration, or 
designee;
    (e) Date of service means the day a document is deposited in the 
mail or delivered in person;
    (f) Days means calendar days, except that a deadline which falls on 
a weekend or holiday shall be extended to the next working day;

    (h) Deputy Under Secretary means Deputy Under Secretary for 
International Trade, or designee;
    (i) Director means an Office Director under the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Investigations, International Trade Administration, or 
designee, who shall be responsible for conducting an investigation of an 
alleged violation of an administrative protective order if the incident 
is discovered during an administrative review, or an Office Director 
under the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance, International Trade 
Administration, or designee, if the incident is discovered during any 
other time;
    (j) Lesser included sanction means a sanction of the same type but 
of more limited scope than the proposed sanction; thus a one-year bar on 
representations before the International Trade Administration is a 
lesser included sanction of a proposed seven-year bar;
    (k) Parties means the Department and the charged party or affected 
party in an action under this part;
    (l) Person means an individual, partnership, corporation, 
association, organization, or other entity;

Administration, the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade, the 
Chief Counsel for Import Administration, or a member of the APO 
Sanctions Board;
    (n) Proprietary information means information the disclosure of 
which the Secretary has decided is limited under 19 CFR 353.29 or 
355.19, including business or trade secrets; production costs; 
distribution costs; terms of sale; prices of individual sales, likely 
sales, or offers; names of customers, distributors, or suppliers; exact 
amounts of the gross net subsidies received and used by a person; names 
of particular persons from whom proprietary information was obtained; 
and any other business information the release of which to the public 
would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the 
submitter;
    (o) Protective order means an administrative protective order issued 
by the Secretary under 19 CFR 353.30 or 355.20; and
    (p) Under Secretary means Under Secretary for International Trade, 
or designee.

Sec. 354.3  Sanctions.

    (a) A person determined under this part to have violated a 
protective order

[[Page 214]]

(214may be subjected to any or all of the following sanctions:
    (1) Barring such person from appearing before the International 
Trade Administration to represent another for a designated time period 
from the date of publication in the Federal Register of a notice that a 
violation has been determined to exist;
    (2) Denying the person access to proprietary information for a 
designated time period from the date of publication in the Federal 
Register of a notice that a violation has been determined to exist;
    (3) Other appropriate administrative sanctions, including striking 
from the record any information or argument submitted by, or on behalf 
of, the violating party or the party represented by the violating party; 
terminating any proceeding then in progress; or revoking any order then 
in effect; and
    (4) Requiring the person to return material previously provided by 
the Department and all other materials containing the proprietary 
information, such as briefs, notes, or charts based on any such 
information received under an administrative protective order.
    (b) (1) The firm of which a person determined to have violated a 
protective order is a partner, associate or employee; any partner, 
associate, employer, or employee of such person; and any person 
represented by such person may be barred from appearing before the 
International Trade Administration for a designated time period from the 
date of publication in the Federal Register of notice that a violation 
has been determined to exist or may be subjected to the sanctions set 
forth in paragraph (a) of this section, as appropriate.
    (2) Each person against whom sanctions are proposed under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section is entitled to all the administrative rights set 
forth in this part separately and apart from rights provided to a person 
subject to sanctions under paragraph (a) of this section, including the 
right to a charging letter, right to representation, and right to a 
hearing, but subject to joinder or consolidation by a presiding official 
under Sec. 354.12(b).

Sec. 354.4  Suspension of rules.

    Upon request by the Deputy Under Secretary, a charged or affected 
party, or the APO Sanctions Board, a presiding official may modify or 
waive any rule in the part upon determining that no party will be unduly 
prejudiced and the ends of justice will thereby be served and upon 
notice to all parties.

Sec. 354.5  Report of violation and investigation.

    (a) An employee of the Department of Commerce who has information 
indicating that the terms of an administrative protective order have 
been violated will provide the information to the appropriate Director 
or the Chief Counsel.
    (b) Upon receiving information which indicates that a person may 
have violated the terms of an administrative protective order, from an 
employee of the Department of Commerce or any other person, the 
appropriate Director will conduct an investigation concerning whether 
there was a violation of a protective order, and who was responsible for 
the violation, if any. For purposes of this part, the Director will be 
supervised by the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade with 
guidance from the Chief Counsel. The Director will conduct an 
investigation only if the information is received within 30 days after 
the alleged violation occurred or, as determined by the Director, could 
have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable and ordinary 
care.
    (c) The appropriate Director will provide a report of the 
investigation to the Deputy Under Secretary, after review by the Chief 
Counsel, no later than 180 days after receiving information concerning a 
violation. Upon the appropriate Director's request, and if extraordinary 
circumstances exist, the Deputy Under Secretary may grant the 
appropriate Director up to an additional 180 days to conduct the 
investigation and submit the report.
    (d) The following examples of actions that constitute violations of 
an administrative protective order shall serve as guidelines to each 
person subject to a protective order. These examples do not represent an 
exhaustive list. Evidence that one of the acts described in

[[Page 215]]

(215the guidelines has been committed, however, shall be considered by 
the Deputy Under Secretary as reasonable cause to believe a person has 
violated a protective order, within the meaning of Sec. 354.6.
    (1) Disclosure of proprietary information to any person not granted 
access to that information by protective order, including an employee of 
the Department not directly concerned with carrying out the 
investigation in connection with which the information is submitted, an 
employee of any other United States Government agency, or a member of 
Congress.
    (2) Failure to follow the detailed procedures outlined in the 
protective order for safeguarding proprietary information, including 
maintaining a log showing when each proprietary document is used, and by 
whom, and requiring all employees who obtain access to proprietary 
information (under the terms of a protective order granted their 
employer) to sign and date a copy of that protective order.
    (3) Loss of proprietary information.
    (4) Failure to return or destroy all copies of the original 
documents and all notes, memoranda, and submissions containing 
proprietary information at the close of the proceeding for which the 
data were obtained by burning or shredding of the documents or by 
erasing electronic memory, computer disk, or tape memory, as set forth 
in the administrative protective order.
    (5) Failure to delete proprietary information from the public 
version of a brief or other correspondence filed with the Department.
    (6) Disclosure of proprietary information during a public hearing.
    (7) Use of proprietary information submitted for one investigation 
or administrative review during a different investigation or 
administrative review.
    (8) Use of proprietary information submitted in one investigation or 
administrative review in a separate investigation or administrative 
review of a product from the same or different country.
    (9) Use of proprietary information submitted for a countervailing 
duty investigation or administrative review during an antidumping duty 
investigation or administrative review, or vice versa.

Sec. 354.6  Initiation of proceedings.

    If the Deputy Under Secretary concludes, after an investigation and 
report by the appropriate Director under Sec. 354.5(c) and consultation 
with the Chief Counsel, that there is reasonable cause to believe that a 
person has violated a protective order and that sanctions are 
appropriate for the violation, the Deputy Under Secretary will initiate 
a proceeding under this part by issuing a charging letter as set forth 
in Sec. 354.7. In determining whether sanctions are appropriate and, if 
so, what sanctions to impose, the Deputy Under Secretary will consider 
the nature of the violation, the resulting harm, and other relevant 
circumstances of the case. The Deputy Under Secretary will decide 
whether to initiate a proceeding no later than 60 days after receiving a 
report of the investigation.

Sec. 354.7  Charging letter.

    (a) Contents of Letter. The Deputy Under Secretary will initiate 
proceedings by issuing a charging letter to each charged party and 
affected party which includes:
    (1) A statement of the allegation that a protective order has been 
violated and the basis thereof;
    (2) A statement of the proposed sanctions;
    (3) A statement that the charged or affected party is entitled to 
review the documents or other physical evidence upon which the charge is 
based and the method for requesting access to, or copies of, such 
documents;
    (4) A statement that the charged or affected party is entitled to a 
hearing before a presiding official if requested within 30 days of the 
date of service of the charging letter and the procedure for requesting 
a hearing, including the name, address, and telephone number of the 
person to contact if there are further questions;
    (5) A statement that the charged or affected party has a right, if a 
hearing is not requested, to submit documentary evidence to the Deputy 
Under Secretary and an explanation of the method for submitting evidence 
and the date by which it must be received; and

[[Page 216]]

(216
    (6) A statement that the charged or affected party has a right to 
retain counsel at the party's own expense for purposes of 
representation.
    (b) Settlement and amending the charging letter. The Deputy Under 
Secretary may amend, supplement, or withdraw the charging letter at any 
time with the approval of a presiding official if the interests of 
justice would thereby be served. If a hearing has not been requested, 
the Deputy Under Secretary will ask the Under Secretary to appoint a 
presiding official to make this determination. If a charging letter is 
withdrawn after a request for a hearing, the presiding official will 
determine whether the withdrawal will bar the Deputy Under Secretary 
from seeking sanctions at a later date for the same alleged violation. 
If there has been no request for a hearing, or if supporting information 
has not been submitted under Sec. 354.13, the withdrawal will not bar 
future actions on the same alleged violation. The Deputy Under Secretary 
and a charged or affected party may settle a charge brought under this 
part by mutual agreement at any time after service of the charging 
letter; approval of the presiding official or the APO Sanctions Board is 
not necessary.
    (c) Service of charging letter on a resident of the United States. 
(1) Service of a charging letter on a United States resident will be 
made by:
    (i) Mailing a copy by registered or certified mail addressed to the 
charged or affected party at the party's last known address;
    (ii) Leaving a copy with the charged or affected party or with an 
officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by 
appointment or by law to receive service for the party; or
    (iii) Leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion 
who resides at the party's last known dwelling.
    (2) Service made in the manner described in paragraph (c) (ii) or 
(iii) of this section shall be evidenced by a certificate of service 
signed by the person making such service, stating the method of service 
and the identity of the person with whom the charging letter was left.
    (d) Service of charging letter on a non-resident. If applicable laws 
or intergovernmental agreements or understandings make the methods of 
service set forth in paragraph (c) of this section inappropriate or 
ineffective, service of the charging letter on a person who is not a 
resident of the United States may be made by any method that is 
permitted by the country in which the person resides and that satisfies 
the due process requirements under United States law with respect to 
notice in administrative proceedings.

Sec. 354.8  Interim sanctions.

    (a) If the Deputy Under Secretary concludes, after issuing a 
charging letter under Sec. 354.7 and before a final decision is 
rendered, that interim sanctions are necessary to protect the interests 
of the Department or others, including the protection of proprietary 
information, the Deputy Under Secretary may petition a presiding 
official to impose such sanctions.
    (b) The presiding official may impose interim sanctions against a 
person upon determining that:
    (1) There is probable cause to believe that there was a violation of 
a protective order and the Department is likely to prevail in obtaining 
sanctions under this part,
    (2) The Department or others are likely to suffer irreparable harm 
if the interim sanctions are not imposed, and
    (3) The interim sanctions are a reasonable means for protecting the 
rights of the Department or others while preserving to the greatest 
extent possible the rights of the person against whom the interim 
sanctions are proposed.
    (c) Interim sanctions which may be imposed include any sanctions 
that are necessary to protect the rights of the Department or others, 
including, but not limited to:
    (1) Denying a person further access to proprietary information.
    (2) Barring a person from representing another person before the 
International Trade Administration.
    (3) Barring a person from appearing before the International Trade 
Administration, and
    (4) Requiring the person to return material previously provided by 
the Department and all other materials

[[Page 217]]

(217containing the proprietary information, such as briefs, notes, or 
charts based on any such information received under an administrative 
protective order.
    (d) The Deputy Under Secretary will notify the person against whom 
interim sanctions are sought of the request for interim sanctions and 
provide to that person the material submitted to the presiding official 
to support the request. The notice will include a reference to the 
procedures of this section.
    (e) A person against whom interim sanctions are proposed has a right 
to oppose the request through submission of material to the presiding 
official. The presiding official has discretion to permit oral 
presentations and to allow further submissions.
    (f) The presiding official will notify the parties of the decision 
on interim sanctions and the basis therefor within five days of the 
conclusion of oral presentations or the date of final written 
submissions.
    (g) If interim sanctions have been imposed, the investigation and 
any proceedings under this part will be conducted on an expedited basis.
    (h) An order imposing interim sanctions may be revoked at any time 
by the presiding official and expires automatically upon the issuance of 
a final order.
    (i) The presiding official may reconsider imposition of interim 
sanctions on the basis of new and material evidence or other good cause 
shown. The Deputy Under Secretary or a person against whom interim 
sanctions have been imposed may appeal a decision on interim sanctions 
to the APO Sanctions Board, if such an appeal is certified by the 
presiding official as necessary to prevent undue harm to the Department, 
a person against whom interim sanctions have been imposed or others, or 
is otherwise in the interests of justice. Interim sanctions which have 
been imposed remain in effect while an appeal is pending, unless the 
presiding official determines otherwise.
    (j) The Deputy Under Secretary may request a presiding official to 
impose emergency interim sanctions to preserve the status quo. Emergency 
interim sanctions may last no longer than 48 hours, excluding weekends 
and holidays. The person against whom such emergency interim sanctions 
are proposed need not be given prior notice or an opportunity to oppose 
the request for sanctions. The presiding official may impose emergency 
interim sanctions upon determining that the Department is, or others 
are, likely to suffer irreparable harm if such sanctions are not imposed 
and that the interests of justice would thereby be served. The presiding 
official will promptly notify a person against whom emergency sanctions 
have been imposed of the sanctions and their duration.
    (k) If a hearing has not been requested, the Deputy Under Secretary 
will ask the Under Secretary to appoint a presiding official for making 
determinations under this section.

Sec. 354.9  Request for a hearing.

    (a) Any party may request a hearing by submitted a written request 
to the Under Secretary within 30 days after the date of service of the 
charging letter. However, the Deputy Under Secretary may request a 
hearing only if the interests of justice would thereby be served.
    (b) Upon timely receipt of a request for a hearing, the Under 
Secretary will appoint a presiding official to conduct the hearing and 
render an initial decision.

Sec. 354.10  Discovery.

    (a) Voluntary discovery. All parties are encouraged to engage in 
voluntary discovery procedures regarding any matter, not privileged, 
which is relevant to the subject matter of the pending proceeding.
    (b) Interrogatories and requests for admissions or production of 
documents. A party may serve on any other party interrogatories, 
requests for admissions, or requests for production of documents for 
inspection and copying, and a party concerned may then apply to the 
presiding official for such enforcement or protective order as that 
party deems warranted concerning such discovery. The party will serve a 
discovery request at least 20 days before the scheduled date of a 
hearing, if a hearing has been requested and scheduled,

[[Page 218]]

(218unless the presiding official specifies a shorter time period. 
Copies of interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for 
production of documents and responses thereto will be served on all 
parties. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested will be 
deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request (at 
least 10 days after the date of service of the request, or within such 
further time as the presiding official may allow), the party to whom the 
request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement 
either admitting or denying specifically the matters of which admission 
is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party cannot 
truthfully either admit or deny such matters.
    (c) Depositions. Upon application of a party and for good cause 
shown, the presiding official may order the taking of the testimony of 
any person who is a party, or under the control or authority of a party, 
by deposition and the production of specified documents or materials by 
the person at the deposition. The application shall state the purpose of 
the deposition and shall set forth the facts sought to be established 
through the deposition.
    (d) Enforcement. The presiding official may order a party to answer 
designated questions, to produce specified documents or items, or to 
take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a 
party does not comply with such an order, the presiding official may 
make any determination or enter any order in the proceedings as he or 
she deems reasonable and appropriate. The presiding official may strike 
related charges or defenses in whole or in part, or may take particular 
facts relating to the discovery request to which the party failed or 
refused to respond as being established for purposes of the proceeding 
in accordance with the contentions of the party seeking discovery. In 
issuing a discovery order, the presiding official will consider the 
necessity to protect proprietary information and will not order the 
release of information in circumstances where it is reasonable to 
conclude that such release will lead to unauthorized dissemination of 
such information.
    (e) Role of the Under Secretary. If a hearing has not been 
requested, the party seeking enforcement will ask the Under Secretary to 
appoint a presiding official to rule on motions under this section.

Sec. 354.11  Prehearing conference.

    (a)(1) If an administrative hearing has been requested, the 
presiding official will direct the parties to attend a prehearing 
conference to consider:
    (i) Simplification of issues;
    (ii) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid 
unnecessary proof;
    (iii) Settlement of the matter;
    (iv) Discovery; and
    (v) Such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the 
proceedings.
    (2) Any relevant and significant stipulations or admissions will be 
incorporated into the initial decision.
    (b) If a prehearing conference is impractical, the presiding 
official will direct the parties to correspond with each other or to 
confer by telephone or otherwise to achieve the purposes of such a 
conference.

Sec. 354.12  Hearing.

    (a) Scheduling of hearing. The presiding official will schedule the 
hearing at a reasonable time, date, and place, which will be in 
Washington, DC, unless the presiding official determines otherwise based 
upon good cause shown that another location would better serve the 
interests of justice. In setting the date, the presiding official will 
give due regard to the need for the parties adequately to prepare for 
the hearing and the importance of expeditiously resolving the matter.
    (b) Joinder or consolidation. The presiding official may order 
joinder or consolidation if sanctions are proposed against more than one 
party or if violations of more than one protective order are alleged if 
to do so would expedite processing of the cases and not adversely affect 
the interests of the parties.
    (c) Hearing procedures. Hearings will be conducted in a fair and 
impartial manner by the presiding official, who may limit attendance at 
any hearing

[[Page 219]]

(219or portion thereof if necessary or advisable in order to protect 
proprietary information from improper disclosure. The rules of evidence 
prevailing in courts of law shall not apply, and all evidentiary 
material the presiding official determines to be relevant and material 
to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious may be received into 
evidence and given appropriate weight. The presiding official may make 
such orders and determinations regarding the admissibility of evidence, 
conduct of examination and cross-examination, and similar matters as are 
necessary or appropriate to ensure orderliness in the proceedings. The 
presiding official will ensure that a record of the hearing be taken by 
reporter or by electronic recording, and will order such part of the 
record to be sealed as is necessary to protect proprietary information.
    (d) Rights of parties. At a hearing each party shall have the right 
to:
    (1) Introduce and examine witnesses and submit physical evidence,
    (2) Confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses,
    (3) Present oral argument, and
    (4) Receive a transcript or recording of the proceedings, upon 
request, subject to the presiding official's orders regarding sealing 
the record.
    (e) Representation. Each charged or affected party has a right to 
represent himself or herself or to retain private counsel for that 
purpose. The Chief Counsel will represent the Department, unless the 
General Counsel determines otherwise. The presiding official may 
disallow a representative if such representation constitutes a conflict 
of interest or is otherwise not in the interests of justice and may 
debar a representative for contumacious conduct relating to the 
proceedings.
    (f) Ex parte communications. The parties and their representatives 
may not make any ex parte communications to the presiding official 
concerning the merits of the allegations or any matters at issue, except 
as provided in Sec. 354.8 regarding emergency interim sanctions.

Sec. 354.13  Proceeding without a hearing.

    If no party has requested a hearing, the Deputy Under Secretary, 
within 40 days after the date of service of a charging letter, will 
submit for inclusion into the record and provide each charged or 
affected party information supporting the allegations in the charging 
letter. Each charged or affected party has the right to file a written 
response to the information and supporting documentation within 30 days 
after the date of service of the information provided by the Deputy 
Under Secretary unless the Deputy Under Secretary alters the time period 
for good cause. The Deputy Under Secretary may allow the parties to 
submit further information and argument.

Sec. 354.14  Initial decision.

    (a) Initial decision. The presiding official, if a hearing was 
requested, or the Deputy Under Secretary will submit an initial decision 
to the APO Sanctions Board, providing copies to the parties. The 
presiding official or Deputy Under Secretary will ordinarily issue the 
decision within 20 days of the conclusion of the hearing, if one was 
held, or within 15 days of the date of service of final written 
submissions. The initial decision will be based solely on evidence 
received into the record, and the pleadings of the parties.
    (b) Findings and conclusions. The initial decision will state 
findings and conclusions as to whether a person has violated a 
protective order; the basis for those findings and conclusions; and 
whether the sanctions proposed in the charging letter, or lesser 
included sanctions, should be imposed against the charged or affected 
party. The presiding official or Deputy Under Secretary may impose 
sanctions only upon determining that the preponderance of the evidence 
supports a finding of violation of a protective order and that the 
sanctions are warranted against the charged or affected party. In 
determining whether sanctions are appropriate and, if so, what sanctions 
to impose, the presiding official or the Deputy Under Secretary will 
consider the nature of the violation, the resulting harm, and other 
relevant circumstances of the case.
    (c) Finality of decision. If the APO Sanctions Board has not issued 
a decision on the matter within 60 days after

[[Page 220]]

(220issuance of the initial decision, the initial decision becomes the 
final decision of the Department.

Sec. 354.15  Final decision.

    (a) APO Sanctions Board. Upon request of a party, the initial 
decision will be reviewed by the members of the APO Sanctions Board. The 
Board consists of the Under Secretary for International Trade, who shall 
serve as Chairperson, the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, and the 
General Counsel.
    (b) Comments on initial decision. Within 30 days after issuance of 
the initial decision, a party may submit written comments to the APO 
Sanctions Board on the initial decision, which the Board will consider 
when reviewing the initial decision. The parties have no right to an 
oral presentation, although the Board may allow oral argument in its 
discretion.
    (c) Final decision by the APO Sanctions Board. Within 60 days but 
not sooner than 30 days after issuance of an initial decision, the APO 
Sanctions Board may issue a final decision which adopts the initial 
decision in its entirety; differs in whole or in part from the initial 
decision, including the imposition of lesser included sanctions; or 
remands the matter to the presiding official or Deputy Under Secretary 
for further consideration. The only sanctions that the Board can impose 
are those sanctions proposed in the charging letter or lesser included 
sanctions.
    (d) Contents of final decision. If the final decision of the APO 
Sanctions Board does not remand the matter and differs from the initial 
decision, it will state findings and conclusions which differ from the 
initial decision, if any, the basis for those findings and conclusions, 
and the sanctions which are to be imposed, to the extent they differ 
from the sanctions in the initial decision.
    (e) Public notice of sanctions. If the final decision is that there 
has been a violation of a protective order and that sanctions are to be 
imposed, notice of the Department's decision will be published in the 
Federal Register. Such publication will be no sooner than 30 days after 
issuance of a final decision or after a motion to reconsider has been 
denied, if such a motion was filed. The Deputy Under Secretary will also 
provide such information to the ethics panel or other disciplinary body 
of the appropriate bar associations or other professional associations 
whenever the Deputy Under Secretary subjects a charged or affected party 
to a sanction under paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 354.3 and to any Federal 
agency likely to have an interest in the matter and will cooperate in 
any disciplinary actions by any association or agency.

Sec. 354.16  Reconsideration.

    Any party may file a motion for reconsideration with the APO 
Sanctions Board. The party must state with particularity the grounds for 
the motion, including any facts or points of law which the party claims 
the APO Sanctions Board has overlooked or misapplied. The party may file 
the motion within 30 days of the issuance of the final decision or the 
adoption of the initial decision as the final decision, except that if 
the motion is based on the discovery of new and material evidence which 
was not known, and could not reasonably have been discovered through due 
diligence prior to the close of the record, the party shall file the 
motion within 15 days of the discovery of the new and material evidence. 
The party shall provide a copy of the motion to all other parties. 
Opposing parties may file a response within 30 days of the date of 
service of the motion. The response shall be considered as part of the 
record. The parties have no right to an oral presentation on a motion 
for reconsideration, but the Board may permit oral argument at its 
discretion. If the motion to reconsider is granted, the Board will 
review the record and affirm, modify, or reverse the original decision 
or remand the matter for further consideration to a presiding official 
or the Deputy Under Secretary, as warranted.

Sec. 354.17  Confidentiality.

    (a) All proceedings involving allegations of a violation of a 
protective order shall be kept confidential until such time as the 
Department makes a final decision under these regulations, no longer 
subject to reconsideration, imposing a sanction.

    (b) The charged party or counsel for the charged party will be 
granted access to proprietary information in these proceedings, as 
necessary, under administrative protective order, consistent with the

Sec. 355.13  Determination of sufficiency of petition.

    (a) Determination of sufficiency--(1) In general. Except as provided 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, not later than 20 days after a 
petition is filed under Sec. 355.12, the Secretary will determine 
whether the petition properly alleges the basis on which a 
countervailing duty may be imposed under section 701(a) of the Act, 
contains information reasonably available to the petitioner supporting 
the allegations, is filed by an interested party as defined in paragraph 
(i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of Sec. 355.2, and is filed by or on 
behalf of the domestic industry.
    (2) Extension where polling required. Where the Secretary is 
required to poll or otherwise determine support for the petition by the 
domestic industry under section 702(c)(4)(D) of the Act, the Secretary 
may, in exceptional circumstances, apply paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section by substituting ``a maximum of 40 days'' for ``20 days''.
    (b) Notice of initiation. If the Secretary determines that the 
petition is sufficient under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Secretary will initiate an investigation and publish in the Federal 
Register notice of ``Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigation.'' 
The notice will include the information described in Sec. 355.11(a)(2). 
If the merchandise is from a country entitled to an injury test for the 
merchandise, the Secretary will notify the Commission at the time of 
initiation of the investigation and will make available to it and to its 
employees directly involved in the proceeding all information upon which 
the Secretary based the initiation and which the Commission may consider 
relevant to its injury determinations.
    (c) Insufficiency of petition. If the Secretary determines that a 
petition is insufficient under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Secretary will dismiss the petition in whole or in part and, if 
appropriate, terminate the proceeding. The Secretary will notify the 
petitioner in writing of the reasons for dismissal, notify the 
Commission of the dismissal, if appropriate, and publish in the Federal 
Register notice of ``Dismissal of Countervailing Duty Petition,'' 
summarizing the reasons for dismissal.

[53 FR 52344, Dec. 27, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 25136, May 11, 1995]

Sec. 355.14  Request for exclusion from countervailing duty order.

    (a) Any producer or exporter which exported the merchandise to the 
United States during the period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section and which desires exclusion from a countervailing duty order 
must submit to the Secretary, not later than 30 days after the date of 
publication of the notice of initiation under Sec. 355.11 or 
Sec. 355.13, an irrevocable written request for exclusion.
    (b) The person must submit with the request:
    (1) The person's certification that the person did not apply for or 
receive any net subsidy on the merchandise, during the period from the 
beginning of the last fiscal year for which the person has records to 
the date of filing of the petition, from any program listed in the 
Secretary's notice of initiation (except programs that the Secretary has 
previously found, in a notice published

[[Page 228]]

(228under Sec. 355.20 or Sec. 355.22(c)(8), not to be countervailable) 
and will not apply for or receive any subsidy on the merchandise in the 
future;
    (2) The certification of the government of the affected country that 
the government did not provide to that person any net subsidy during the 
period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
    (3) If the person is not the producer of the merchandise, the 
certification under paragraph (b)(1) of this section of the suppliers 
and producers of the merchandise and the certification under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section of the government regarding those suppliers and 
producers.
    (c) The Secretary will investigate requests for exclusion to the 
extent practicable in each investigation.

Sec. 355.15  Preliminary determination.

    (a) In general. (1) Not later than 65 days after the date on which 
the Secretary initiates an investigation under Sec. 355.11 or 
Sec. 355.13, the Secretary will make a determination based on the 
available information at the time whether there is a reasonable basis to 
believe or suspect that a subsidy is being provided with respect to the 
merchandise. If the merchandise is from a country entitled to an injury 
test for the merchandise, the Secretary will not make the determination 
unless the Commission has made an affirmative preliminary determination.
    (2) The Secretary's determination will include:
    (i) The factual and legal conclusions on which the determination is 
based;
    (ii) The individual countervailing duty rate for each person 
investigated and an all-others rate, if any, or, if section 
777A(e)(2)(B) of the Act applies, a single estimated country-wide 
subsidy rate; and
    (iii) A preliminary finding on critical circumstances, if 
appropriate, under Sec. 355.16(b)(2)(i).
    (3) If affirmative, the Secretary's determination will also:
    (i) Order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of the 
merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or 
after the date of publication of the notice of the Secretary's 
preliminary determination; and
    (ii) Impose provisional measures by instructing the Customs Service 
to require for each entry of the merchandise suspended under this 
paragraph a cash deposit or bond equal to the estimated net subsidy.
    (4) The Secretary will publish in the Federal Register notice of 
``Affirmative (Negative) Preliminary Countervailing Duty 
Determination,'' including the estimated individual countervailing duty 
rates, all-others rate, or country-wide subsidy rate, if any, and an 
invitation for argument consistent with Sec. 355.38.
    (5) The Secretary will notify all parties to the proceeding. If the 
merchandise is from a country entitled to an injury test for the 
merchandise, the Secretary also will notify the Commission.
    (b) Postponement in extraordinarily complicated investigation. If 
the Secretary decides the investigation is extraordinarily complicated, 
the Secretary may postpone the preliminary determination to not later 
than 130 days after the date on which the Secretary initiated the 
investigation. The Secretary will base the decision on express findings 
that:
    (1) The respondent parties to the proceeding are cooperating in the 
investigation;
    (2) The investigation is extraordinarily complicated by reason of:
    (i) The large number or complex nature of the alleged subsidies;
    (ii) Novel issues raised;
    (iii) The need to determine the extent to which particular subsidies 
are used by individual producers or exporters; or
    (iv) Large number of producers and exporters; and
    (3) Additional time is needed to make the preliminary determination.
    (c) Postponement at the request of the petitioner. If the 
petitioner, not later than 25 days before the scheduled date for the 
Secretary's preliminary determination, requests a postponement and 
states the reasons for the request, the Secretary will postpone the 
preliminary determination to not later than 130 days after the date on 
which the Secretary initiated the investigation,

[[Page 229]]

(229unless the Secretary finds compelling reasons to deny the request.
    (d) Postponement to investigate upstream subsidies. (1) Any 
interested party shall submit in writing any allegation of upstream 
subsidies not later than 10 days before the scheduled date for the 
Secretary's preliminary determination under this part.
    (2) If the Secretary decides to investigate an upstream subsidy 
allegation and concludes that additional time is needed to investigate 
the allegation, the Secretary may postpone the preliminary determination 
to not later than 250 days after the proceeding begins (up to 310 days 
if also postponed under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section).
    (e) Notice of postponement. (1) If the Secretary decides to postpone 
the preliminary determination under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section, the Secretary will notify all parties to the proceeding not 
later than 20 days before the scheduled date for the Secretary's 
preliminary determination and will publish in the Federal Register 
notice of ``Postponement of Preliminary Countervailing Duty 
Determination,'' stating the reasons for the postponement.
    (2) If the Secretary decides to postpone the preliminary 
determination under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Secretary will 
notify all parties to the proceeding not later than the scheduled date 
for the Secretary's preliminary determination and will publish in the 
Federal Register notice of ``Postponement of Preliminary Countervailing 
Duty Determination'' stating the reasons for the postponement.
    (f) Expedited preliminary determination. Not later than 55 days 
after the initiation of an investigation under Sec. 355.13, the 
Secretary will review the record of the first 50 days of the 
investigation. If the available information is sufficient for the 
Secretary to make a preliminary determination, the Secretary will 
disclose to the petitioner, and any interested party that has requested 
disclosure, all available public and proprietary information (subject to 
the requirements of Sec. 355.34). If, not later than three business days 
after disclosure, each party to whom disclosure was made furnishes an 
irrevocable written waiver of verification and agrees to a preliminary 
determination based on information in the record on the 50th day of the 
investigation, the Secretary will make an expedited preliminary 
determination.
    (g) Commission access to information. If the merchandise is from a 
country entitled to an injury test for the merchandise, the Secretary 
will make available to the Commission and to employees of the Commission 
directly involved in the proceeding all information upon which the 
Secretary based the determination and which the Commission may consider 
relevant to its injury determination.
    (h) Disclosure. Promptly after making the preliminary determination, 
the Secretary will provide to parties to the proceeding which request 
disclosure a further explanation of the calculation methodology used in 
making the determination.

[53 FR 52344, Dec. 27, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 25136, May 11, 1995]

Sec. 355.16  Critical circumstances findings.

    (a) In general. If the merchandise is from a country entitled to an 
injury test for the merchandise and if a petitioner submits to the 
Secretary a written allegation of critical circumstances, with 
reasonably available factual information supporting the allegation, not 
later than 21 days before the scheduled date of the Secretary's final 
determination, or on the Secretary's own initiative in an investigation 
under Sec. 355.11, the Secretary will make a finding whether:
    (1) Any alleged export subsidy that benefits the merchandise is 
inconsistent with the Agreement; and
    (2) There have been massive imports of the merchandise over a 
relatively short period.
    (b) Preliminary finding. (1) If the petitioner submits the 
allegation of critical circumstances not later than 30 days before the 
scheduled date for the Secretary's final determination under 
Sec. 355.20, the Secretary, based on the available information, will 
make a preliminary finding whether there is a reasonable basis to 
believe or suspect

[[Page 230]]

(230that critical circumstances as described in paragraph (a) of this 
section exist.
    (2) The Secretary will issue the preliminary finding:
    (i) Not later than the Secretary's preliminary determination under 
Sec. 355.15, if the allegation is submitted not later than 20 days 
before the scheduled date for the preliminary determination; or
    (ii) Not later than 30 days after the petitioner submits the 
allegation, if the allegation is submitted later than 20 days before the 
scheduled date for the Secretary's preliminary determination.
    The Secretary will notify the Commission and publish in the Federal 
Register notice of the preliminary finding.
    (c) Suspension of liquidation. If the Secretary makes an affirmative 
preliminary finding of critical circumstances, either before or at the 
time of an affirmative preliminary determination under Sec. 355.15, any 
suspension of liquidation ordered under Sec. 355.15 will apply to all 
entries of the merchandise covered by the finding entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse, for consumption on or after 90 days before the date of 
the order of suspension of liquidation. If the Secretary makes an 
affirmative preliminary finding of critical circumstances after an 
affirmative preliminary determination under Sec. 355.15, the Secretary 
will amend the order suspending liquidation to apply to all entries of 
the merchandise covered by the finding entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after 90 days before the date 
suspension of liquidation was first ordered.
    (d) Final finding. For any allegation submitted not later than 21 
days before the scheduled date for the Secretary's final determination 
under Sec. 355.20, the Secretary will make a final finding on critical 
circumstances. If the final finding is affirmative and if the Secretary 
did not make an affirmative preliminary finding of critical 
circumstances, the Secretary will order the suspension of liquidation of 
all entries of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after 90 days before the date the Secretary ordered 
suspension of liquidation either as part of an affirmative preliminary 
or final determination. If the final finding is negative and if the 
Secretary made an affirmative preliminary finding of critical 
circumstances, the Secretary will end the retroactive suspension of 
liquidation ordered under paragraph (c) of this section, and will 
instruct the Customs Service to release the cash deposit or bond.
    (e) Findings in self-initiated investigations. In investigations 
initiated under Sec. 355.11, the Secretary will make a preliminary and 
final finding on critical circumstances without regard to the time 
limits in paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section.
    (f) Massive imports. (1) In determining for the purpose of paragraph 
(a) of this section whether imports of the merchandise have been 
massive, the Secretary normally will examine:
    (i) The volume and value of the imports;
    (ii) Seasonal trends; and
    (iii) The share of domestic consumption accounted for by the 
imports.
    (2) In general, unless the imports during the period identified in 
paragraph (g) of this section have increased by at least 15 percent over 
the imports during an immediately preceding period of comparable 
duration, the Secretary will not consider the imports massive.
    (g) Relatively short period. For the purpose of paragraph (a) of 
this section, the Secretary normally will consider the period beginning 
on the date the proceeding begins and ending approximately three months 
later. However, if the Secretary finds that importers or exporters had 
reason to believe, at some time prior to the beginning of the 
proceeding, that a proceeding was likely, then the Secretary may 
consider a period of not less than three months from that earlier time.

Sec. 355.17  Termination of investigation.

    (a) Withdrawal of petition. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section, the Secretary may terminate an investigation upon 
withdrawal of the petition by the petitioner, or on the Secretary's own 
initiative in an investigation initiated under Sec. 355.11, after 
notifying all parties to the proceeding

[[Page 231]]

(231and, if the merchandise is from a country entitled to an injury test 
on the merchandise, after consultation with the Commission. The 
Secretary may not terminate an investigation unless the Secretary 
concludes the termination is in the public interest.
    (2) If the Secretary terminates an investigation, the Secretary will 
publish in the Federal Register notice of ``Termination of 
Countervailing Duty Investigation'' together with, when appropriate, a 
copy of any correspondence with the petitioner forming the basis of the 
withdrawal and the termination.
    (b) Withdrawal of petition based on acceptance of quantitative 
restriction agreements. (1) The Secretary may not terminate under 
paragraph (a) of this section an investigation by accepting an 
understanding or other kind of agreement with the government of the 
affected country to restrict the volume of the merchandise unless the 
Secretary, taking into account the factors listed in section 
704(a)(2)(B) of the Act, is satisfied that termination is in the public 
interest.
    (2) In deciding for the purpose of paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
whether termination is in the public interest, the Secretary, to the 
extent practicable, will consult with representatives of potentially 
affected United States consuming industries and potentially affected 
persons in the industry, including persons not parties to the 
proceeding.
    (3) At the direction of the President of the United States or a 
designee, the Secretary will modify any understanding or other kind of 
quantitative restriction agreement accepted under paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section as a result of consultations entered into under section 
761(a) of the Act.
    (c) Negative determination. An investigation terminates, without 
further comment or action, upon publication in the Federal Register of 
the Secretary's negative final determination or the Commission's 
negative preliminary or final determination.
    (d) End of suspension of liquidation. If the Secretary previously 
ordered suspension of liquidation, the Secretary will order the 
suspension ended on the date of publication of the notice of termination 
under paragraph (a) of this section or on the date of publication of a 
negative determination referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, and 
will instruct the Customs Service to release any cash deposit or bond.

Sec. 355.18  Suspension of investigation.

    (a) Agreement to eliminate or offset completely a subsidy or to 
cease exports. If the Secretary is satisfied that suspension is in the 
public interest, the Secretary may suspend an investigation at any time 
before the Secretary's final determination by accepting an agreement 
with the government of the affected country or exporters that account 
for substantially all of the merchandise:
    (1) To eliminate or to offset completely the net subsidy with 
respect to the merchandise; or
    (2) To cease exports of the merchandise not later than 180 days 
after the date of publication of the notice of suspension of 
investigation.
    (b) Agreement eliminating injurious effect. (1) As provided in this 
paragraph and paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3), the Secretary may suspend an 
investigation at any time before the Secretary's final determination if 
the merchandise is from a country entitled to an injury test for the 
merchandise and if the Secretary:
    (i) Is satisfied that the proposed suspension is in the public 
interest;
    (ii) Finds that extraordinary circumstances are present; and
    (iii) Finds that the agreement will eliminate completely the 
injurious effect of the merchandise.
    (2) The Secretary may suspend an investigation under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section by accepting an agreement with the government of 
the affected country or exporters that account for substantially all of 
the merchandise, if the Secretary finds that:
    (i) The agreement will prevent the suppression or undercutting by 
the merchandise of prices of like products produced in the United 
States; and
    (ii) The agreement will eliminate or offset completely at least 85 
percent of the net subsidy.
    (3) The Secretary may suspend an investigation under paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section by accepting an agreement

[[Page 232]]

(232with the government of the affected country to restrict the volume 
of the merchandise. In considering for the purpose of this paragraph 
whether suspension is in the public interest, the Secretary will take 
into account, in addition to other factors the Secretary considers 
appropriate, the factors listed in section 704(a)(2)(B) of the Act. To 
the extent practicable, the Secretary will consult with representatives 
of potentially affected United States consuming industries and 
potentially affected persons in the industry, including persons not 
party to the proceeding.
    (c) Definition of ``substantially all.'' For purposes of paragraphs 
(a) and (b)(2) of this section, exporters which account for 
``substantially all'' of the merchandise means exporters that have 
accounted for not less than 85 percent by value or volume of the 
merchandise during the period for which the Department is measuring 
benefits in the investigation or such other period that the Secretary 
considers representative.
    (d) Definition of ``extraordinary circumstances.'' For purposes of 
paragraph (b) of this section, extraordinary circumstances means 
circumstances in which (1) suspension of the investigation will be more 
beneficial to the industry than continuation of the investigation and 
(2) there are a large number of alleged subsidy practices which are 
complicated, the issues raised are novel, or the number of exporters is 
large.
    (e) Monitoring. The Secretary will not accept an agreement unless 
effective monitoring of the agreement by the Secretary is practicable. 
In monitoring an agreement under paragraph (b) of this section, the 
Secretary will not be obliged to ascertain on a continuing basis the 
prices in the United States of the merchandise or of like products 
produced in the United States.
    (f) Exports not to increase during interim period. The Secretary 
will not accept an agreement under paragraph (a) of this section unless 
the agreement ensures that the quantity of the merchandise exported 
during the interim period set forth in the agreement does not exceed the 
quantity of the merchandise exported during a period of comparable 
duration that the Secretary considers representative.
    (g) Procedure for suspension of investigation. (1) The government of 
the affected country or the exporters, as appropriate, shall:
    (i) Submit to the Secretary a proposed agreement not later than 45 
days before the scheduled date for the Secretary's final determination 
under Sec. 355.20; and
    (ii) Serve a copy of an agreement preliminarily accepted by the 
Secretary on other parties to the proceeding not later than the day 
following the Secretary's preliminary acceptance.
    (2) The Secretary will:
    (i) Not later than 30 days before the date the Secretary suspends 
the investigation, notify all parties to the proceeding of the proposed 
suspension and provide to the petitioner a copy of the agreement 
preliminarily accepted by the Secretary (the agreement shall contain the 
procedures for monitoring compliance and a statement of the 
compatibility of the agreement with the requirements of this section); 
and
    (ii) Consult with the petitioner concerning the proposed suspension.
    (3) The Secretary will provide all interested parties and United 
States Government agencies an opportunity to submit, not later than 10 
days before the scheduled date for the Secretary's final determination, 
written argument and factual information concerning the proposed 
suspension.
    (h) Acceptance of agreement. (1) If the Secretary accepts an 
agreement to suspend an investigation, the Secretary will publish in the 
Federal Register notice of ``Suspension of Countervailing Duty 
Investigation,'' including the text of the agreement. If the Secretary 
has not already published notice of affirmative preliminary 
determination, the Secretary will include that notice. In accepting an 
agreement, the Secretary may rely on factual or legal conclusions the 
Secretary reached in or after the affirmative preliminary determination.
    (2) If the Secretary suspends an investigation based on an agreement 
under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will not order the 
suspension of liquidation of entries of the merchandise. If the 
Secretary previously

[[Page 233]]

(233ordered suspension of liquidation, the Secretary will order the 
suspension of liquidation ended on the effective date of notice of 
suspension of investigation and will instruct the Customs Service to 
release any cash deposit or bond.
    (3) If the Secretary suspends an investigation based on an agreement 
under paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will order the 
suspension of liquidation to continue or to begin, as appropriate. The 
suspension of liquidation will not end until the Commission completes 
any requested review, under section 704(h) of the Act, of the agreement. 
If the Commission receives no request for review within 20 days after 
the date of publication of the notice of suspension of investigation, 
the Secretary will order the suspension of liquidation ended on the 21st 
day after the date of publication and will instruct the Customs Service 
to release any cash deposit or bond.
    (4) If the Commission undertakes a review of an agreement under 
section 704(h) of the Act and determines that the agreement will not 
eliminate the injurious effect, the Secretary will resume the 
investigation on the date of publication of the Commission's 
determination as if the Secretary's affirmative preliminary 
determination had been made on that date. If the Commission determines 
that the agreement will eliminate the injurious effect, the Secretary 
will continue the suspension of investigation, order the suspension of 
liquidation ended on the date of publication of the Commission's 
determination, and instruct the Customs Service to release any cash 
deposit or bond.
    (i) Continuation of investigation. (1) An interested party, as 
defined in paragraph (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of 
Sec. 355.2, not later than 20 days after the date of publication of the 
notice of suspension of investigation, may request in writing that the 
Secretary continue the investigation. If the merchandise is from a 
country entitled to an injury test for the merchandise, the party shall 
simultaneously file a request with the Commission to continue its 
investigation.
    (2) Upon receiving the request, the Secretary and, if appropriate, 
the Commission will continue the investigation.
    (i) If the Secretary and the Commission make affirmative final 
determinations, the suspension agreement will remain in effect in 
accordance with the factual and legal conclusions in the Secretary's 
final determination. This paragraph does not affect the provisions of 
paragraph (h) of this section regarding suspension of liquidation.
    (ii) If the Secretary or the Commission makes a negative final 
determination, the agreement shall have no force or effect.
    (j) Merchandise imported in excess of allowed quantity. (1) The 
Secretary may instruct the Customs Service not to accept entries, or 
withdrawals from warehouse, for consumption of the merchandise in excess 
of any quantity allowed by paragraph (f) or by an agreement under 
paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
    (2) Imports in excess of the quantity allowed by an agreement may be 
exported or destroyed under Customs Service supervision, except that if 
the agreement is under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the excess 
merchandise may be held for future opening under the agreement by 
placing it in a foreign trade zone or by entering it for warehouse.
    (k) Modification of quantitative restriction agreements. At the 
direction of the President or a designee, the Secretary will modify an 
agreement accepted under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as a result of 
consultation under section 761(a) of the Act.

Sec. 355.19  Violation of agreement.

    (a) Immediate determination. If the Secretary determines that the 
signatory foreign government or exporters have violated a suspension 
agreement, the Secretary, without right of comment, will:
    (1) Order the suspension of liquidation of all entries of the 
merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or 
after the later of (i) 90-days before the date of publication of the 
notice of cancellation of agreement or (ii) the date of first entry, or 
withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of the merchandise

[[Page 234]]

(234the sale or export of which was in violation of the agreement;
    (2) If the investigation was not completed under Sec. 355.18(i), 
resume the investigation as if the Secretary made an affirmative 
preliminary determination on the date of publication of the notice of 
cancellation and impose provisional measures by instructing the Customs 
Service to require for each entry of the merchandise suspended under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section a cash deposit or bond equal to the 
estimated net subsidy determined in the affirmative preliminary 
determination;
    (3) If the investigation was completed under Sec. 355.18(i), issue a 
countervailing duty order for all entries subject to suspension of 
liquidation under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and instruct the 
Customs Service to require for each entry of the merchandise suspended 
under this paragraph a cash deposit equal to the estimated net subsidy 
determined in the affirmative final determination;
    (4) Notify all persons who are or were parties to the proceeding, 
the Commission if appropriate, and if the Secretary determines that the 
violation was intentional, the Commissioner of Customs; and
    (5) Publish in the Federal Register notice of ``Countervailing Duty 
Order (Resumption of Countervailing Duty Investigation); Cancellation of 
Suspension Agreement.''
    (b) Determination after notice and comment. (1) Notwithstanding 
paragraph (a) of this section, if the Secretary has reason to believe 
that the signatory government or exporters have violated an agreement or 
that an agreement no longer meets the requirements of section 704(d)(1) 
of the Act, the Secretary will publish in the Federal Register notice of 
``Invitation for Comment on Countervailing Duty Suspension Agreement.''
    (2) After publication of the notice inviting comment and after 
consideration of comments received the Secretary will:
    (i) If the Secretary determines that the signatory government or 
exporters have violated the agreement, take appropriate action as 
described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section; or
    (ii) If the Secretary determines that the agreement no longer meets 
the requirements of section 704(d)(1) of the Act:
    (A) Take appropriate action as described in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (a)(5) of this section, except that, for paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
this section, the date shall be the date of first entry, or withdrawal 
from warehouse, for consumption of the merchandise the sale or export of 
which does not meet the requirements of section 704(d)(1) of the Act;
    (B) Continue the suspension of investigation by accepting a revised 
suspension agreement under Sec. 355.18(a) (whether or not the Secretary 
accepted the original agreement under that paragraph) that, at the time 
the Secretary accepts the revised agreement, meets the applicable 
requirements of section 704(d)(1) of the Act, and publish in the Federal 
Register notice of ``Revision of Agreement Suspending Countervailing 
Duty Investigation;'' or
    (C) Continue the suspension of investigation by accepting a revised 
suspension agreement under Sec. 355.18(b) (whether or not the Secretary 
accepted the original agreement under that paragraph) that, at the time 
the Secretary accepts the revised agreement, meets the applicable 
requirements of section 704(d)(1) of the Act, and publish in the Federal 
Register notice of ``Revision of Agreement Suspending Countervailing 
Duty Investigation.'' If the Secretary continues to suspend an 
investigation based on a revised agreement accepted under 
Sec. 355.18(b), the Secretary will order suspension of liquidation to 
begin. The suspension will not end until the Commission completes any 
requested review of the agreement under section 704(h) of the Act. If 
the Commission receives no request for review within 20 days after the 
date of publication of the notice of the revision, the Secretary will 
order the suspension of liquidation ended on the 21st day after the date 
of publication, and will instruct the Customs Service to release any 
cash deposit or bond. If the Commission undertakes a review under 
section 704(h) of the Act, the provisions of Sec. 355.18(h)(4) will 
apply.
    (iii) If the Secretary decides neither to consider the order 
violated nor to

[[Page 235]]

(235revise the agreement, the Secretary will publish in the Federal 
Register notice of the Secretary's decision under paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, including a statement of the factual and legal conclusions 
on which the decision is based.
    (c) Additional signatories. If the Secretary decides that the 
agreement no longer meets the requirements of Sec. 355.18(b)(1)(iii) or 
that the signatory exporters no longer account for substantially all of 
the merchandise, the Secretary may revise the agreement to include 
additional signatory exporters.
    (d) Definition of ``violation.'' For the purpose of this section, 
violation means noncompliance with the terms of a suspension agreement 
caused by an act or omission of a signatory foreign government or 
exporter, except, at the discretion of the Secretary, an act or omission 
which is inadvertent or inconsequential.

Sec. 355.20  Final determination.

    (a) In general. (1) Not later than 75 days after the date of the 
Secretary's preliminary determination, the Secretary will make a final

under Sec. 355.16.
    (3) If affirmative, the Secretary's determination will also:
    (i) Unless previously ordered by the Secretary, order the suspension 
of liquidation of all entries of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of 
the notice of the Secretary's final determination; and
    (ii) If the merchandise is from a country not entitled to an injury 
test for the merchandise, instruct the Customs Service to require a cash 
deposit, as provided in Sec. 355.21(b), for each suspended entry of the 
merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or 
after the date of publication of the countervailing duty order under 
Sec. 355.21; or
    (iii) If the merchandise is from a country entitled to an injury 
test for the merchandise, instruct the Customs Service to require, for 
each suspended entry of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the 
Secretary's final determination, a cash deposit or bond equal to the 
estimated net subsidy determined under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (4) The Secretary will publish in the Federal Register notice of 
``Affirmative (Negative) Final Countervailing Duty Determination,'' 
including the estimated individual countervailing duty rates, all-others 
rate, or country-wide subsidy rate, if any.
    (5) The Secretary will notify all parties to the proceeding. If the 
merchandise is from a country entitled to an injury test for the 
merchandise, the Secretary will also notify the Commission.
    (b) Postponement to investigate upstream subsidies. (1) Any 
interested party shall submit in writing any allegation of upstream 
subsidies not later than 15 days before the scheduled date for the 
Secretary's final determination under this part.
    (2) If the Secretary decides to investigate an upstream subsidy 
allegation and concludes that additional time is needed to investigate 
the allegation, the Secretary may:
    (i) If the Secretary's preliminary determination was negative, 
postpone the final determination under this section to not later than 
165 days after the preliminary determination;
    (ii) If the Secretary's preliminary determination was affirmative:
    (A) Postpone the final decision concerning upstream subsidization 
until the conclusion of the first administrative review of a 
countervailing duty order, if any; or
    (B) At the written request of the petitioner:
    (i) Make the decision concerning upstream subsidization in the final 
determination under this section;

[[Page 236]]

(236
    (ii) Postpone the final determination to not later than 165 days 
after the preliminary determination; and
    (iii) End the suspension of liquidation ordered in the preliminary 
determination not later than 120 days after the date of publication of

    (3) If the Secretary decides to postpone the final determination 
under paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the 
Secretary will notify all parties to the proceeding not later than the 
scheduled date for the Secretary's final determination and will publish 
in the Federal Register notice of ``Postponement of Final Countervailing 
Duty Determination'' stating the reason for the postponement.
    (c) Postponement for simultaneous investigations. (1) If the 
Secretary simultaneously initiated antidumping and countervailing duty 
investigations on the merchandise (from the same or other countries), 
the Secretary will:
    (i) At the petitioner's request, postpone the final determination 
under this part to the date of the final determination under part 353, 
unless the Secretary's final determination under this part is due on a 
later date as the result of postponement under paragraph (b) of this 
section or Sec. 355.15; and
    (ii) If the Secretary postpones the final determination, end any 
suspension of liquidation ordered in the preliminary determination not 
later than 120 days after the date of publication of the preliminary 
determination, and not resume it unless and until the Secretary

    (2) The petitioner shall submit any such request in writing not

    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Effect of decision not to exclude from order. If the Secretary 
finds that a person requesting exclusion under Sec. 355.14 received, 
during the period for which the Department measured benefits in the 
investigation, any net subsidy from any program that the Secretary 
determines countervailable in the affirmative final determination, the 
Secretary will state in the affirmative final determination an 
individual rate for that person, and that rate will be the basis for the 
cash deposit or bond, as appropriate, of estimated countervailing duties 
for that person. The individual rate will be either the individual rate 
calculated for that person, the all-others rate, or, if section 
777A(e)(2)(B) of the Act applies, the country-wide subsidy rate.
    (f) Commission access to information. If the merchandise is from a 
country entitled to an injury test for the merchandise, the Secretary 
will make available to the Commission and to employees of the Commission 
directly involved in the proceeding all information upon which the 
Secretary based the final determination and which the Commission may 
consider relevant to its injury determination.
    (g) Effect of negative final determination. An investigation 
terminates, without further comment or action, upon publication in the 
Federal Register of the Secretary's or the Commission's negative final 
determination. If the Secretary previously ordered suspension of 
liquidation, the Secretary will order the suspension ended on the date 
of publication of the notice of negative final determination and will 
instruct the Customs Service to release any cash deposit or bond.
    (h) Disclosure. Promptly after making the final determination, the 
Secretary will provide to parties to the proceeding which request 
disclosure a further explanation of the calculation methodology used in 
making the determination.

Sec. 355.21  Countervailing duty order.

    Not later than seven days after receipt of notice of the 
Commission's affirmative final determination under section 705 of the 
Act, or simultaneously with publication of the Secretary's affirmative 
final determination if the merchandise is from a country not entitled to 
an injury test for the merchandise, the Secretary will publish in the 
Federal Register a ``Countervailing Duty Order'' that:
    (a) Instructs the Customs Service to assess countervailing duties on 
the merchandise, in accordance with the Secretary's instructions at the 
completion of each administrative review requested under Sec. 355.22(a) 
or, if not requested, in accordance with the Secretary's instructions 
under Sec. 355.22(g);
    (b) For each entry of the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of the 
order, instructs the Customs Service to require a cash deposit of 
estimated countervailing duties equal to the net subsidy stated in the 
Secretary's final determination;
    (c) Excludes from the application of the order any producer or 
exporter that the Secretary finds did not receive directly or 
indirectly, during the period for which the Department measured benefits 
in the investigation, any net subsidy on the merchandise from any 
program that the Secretary determined countervailable in the affirmative 
final determination; and
    (d) Orders the suspension of liquidation ended for all entries of 
the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption 
before the date of publication of the Commission's final determination, 
and instructs the Customs Service to release the cash deposit or bond on 
those entries, if in its final determination, the Commission found a 
threat of material injury or material retardation of the establishment 
of an industry, unless the Commission in its final determination also 
found that, absent the suspension of liquidation ordered under 
Sec. 355.15(a), it would have found material injury.

Sec. 355.22  Administrative review of orders and suspension agreements.

    (a) Request for administrative review; withdrawal of request for

    (2) During the same month, a producer or exporter covered by an 
order may request in writing that the Secretary conduct an 
administrative review of only that person.

suspension of investigation (the calendar month in which the anniversary 
of the date of publication of the suspension of investigation occurs), 
an interested party, as defined in Sec. 355.2(i), may request in writing 
that the Secretary conduct an administrative review of all producers or 
exporters covered by an agreement on which suspension of investigation 
was based.
    (5) The Secretary may permit a party that requests a review under 
paragraph (a) of this section to withdraw the request not later than 90 
days after the date of publication of notice of initiation of the 
requested review. The Secretary may extend this time limit if the 
Secretary decides that it is reasonable to do so. When a request for

notice of ``Termination of Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'' 
or, if appropriate, ``Partial Termination of Countervailing Duty 
Administrative Review.''

countervailing duty rates or country-wide subsidy rate, if any, and 
notify all parties to the proceeding;
    (ix) Promptly after issuing the final results, provide to parties to 
the proceeding which request disclosure of a further explanation of the 
calculation methodology used in reaching the final results; and
    (x) Promptly after publication of the notice of final results,

merchandise described in paragraph (j)(4) of this section, and to 
collect a cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties on future 
entries.
    (7) Time limits--(i) In general. The Secretary will issue 
preliminary results in a review conducted under paragraph (j)(1) of this

are issued.
    (ii) Exception. If the Secretary concludes that the case is 
extraordinarily complicated, the Secretary may extend the 180-day period 
to 300 days, and may extend the 90-day period to 150 days.
    (8) Results of reviews. The results of a review under paragraph 
(j)(1) of this section shall be the basis for the assessment of 
countervailing duties on entries of merchandise covered by the 
determination and for deposits of estimated duties.
    (9) Multiple reviews. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, if a review (or a request for a review) under paragraph (a), 
(f), or (g) of this section covers merchandise of an exporter or 
producer subject to a review (or to a request for a review) under 
paragraph (j)(1) of this section, the Secretary may:
    (i) Terminate, in whole or in part, a review in progress under this 
section; or
    (ii) Decline to commence, in whole or in part, a review under this

Sec. 355.23  Provisional measures deposit cap.

    This section applies to the merchandise entered, or withdrawn from 
warehouse, for consumption before the date of publication of the 
Commission's notice of affirmative final determination or, if the 
merchandise is from a country not entitled to an injury test for the 
merchandise, the date of the Secretary's notice of affirmative final 
determination. If the cash deposit or bond required under the 
Secretary's affirmative preliminary or affirmative final determination 
is different from the net subsidy the Secretary calculates under 
Sec. 355.22, the Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to 
disregard the difference to the extent that the cash deposit or bond is 
less than the net subsidy, and to assess countervailing duties equal to 
the net subsidy calculated under Sec. 355.22 if the cash deposit or bond 
is more than the net subsidy.

Sec. 355.24  Interest on certain overpayments and underpayments.

    (a) In general. The Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to 
pay or collect, as appropriate, interest on the difference between the 
cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties and the assessed 
countervailing duties on entries of the merchandise entered, or

[[Page 243]]

(243withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of 
publication of a countervailing duty order.
    (b) Rate. The rate or rates of interest payable or collectible under 
paragraph (a) of this section for any period of time are the rates 
established under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
    (c) Period. The Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to 
calculate interest for each entry from the date that a cash deposit is 
required to be deposited for the entry through the date of liquidation 
of the entry.

Sec. 355.25  Revocation of orders; termination of suspended 
          investigation.

    (a) Revocation or termination based on absence of subsidy. (1) The 
Secretary may revoke an order or terminate a suspended investigation if 
the Secretary concludes that:
    (i) The government of the affected country has eliminated all 
subsidies on the merchandise by abolishing for the merchandise, for a 
period of at least three consecutive years, all programs that the 
Secretary has found countervailable; and
    (ii) It is not likely that the government of the affected country 
will in the future reinstate for the merchandise those programs or 
substitute other countervailable programs.
    (2) The Secretary may revoke an order or terminate a suspended 
investigation if the Secretary concludes that:
    (i) All producers and exporters covered at the time of revocation by 
the order or the suspension agreement have not applied for or received 
any net subsidy on the merchandise for a period of at least five 
consecutive years; and
    (ii) It is not likely that those persons will in the future apply 
for or receive any net subsidy on the merchandise from those programs 
the Secretary has found countervailable in any proceeding involving the 
affected country or from other countervailable programs.
    (3) The Secretary may revoke an order in part if the Secretary 
concludes that:
    (i) One or more producers or exporters covered by the order have not 
applied for or received any net subsidy on the merchandise for a period 
of at least five consecutive years;
    (ii) It is not likely that those persons will in the future apply 
for or receive any net subsidy on the merchandise from those programs 
the Secretary has found countervailable in any proceeding involving the 
affected country or from other countervailable programs; and
    (iii) Except for producers or exporters that the Secretary 
previously has determined have not received any net subsidy on the 
merchandise, the producers or exporters agree in writing to their 
immediate reinstatement in the order, as long as any producer or 
exporter is subject to the order, if the Secretary concludes under 
Sec. 355.22(h) that the producer or exporter, subsequent to the 
revocation, has received any net subsidy on the merchandise.
    (b) Request for revocation or termination. (1) During the third and 
subsequent annual anniversary months of the publication of an order or 
suspension of investigation (the calendar month in which the anniversary 
of the date of publication of the order or suspension occurs), the 
government of the affected country may request in writing that the 
Secretary revoke an order or terminate a suspended investigation under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the government submits with the 
request its certification that it has satisfied, during the period 
described in Sec. 355.22(b)(1), the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(i) 
of this section and that it shall not reinstate for the merchandise 
those programs or substitute other countervailable programs; or
    (2) During the fifth and subsequent annual anniversary months of the 
publication of an order or suspended investigation, the government of 
the affected country may request in writing that the Secretary revoke an 
order or terminate a suspended investigation under paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section if the government submits with the request:
    (i) The certifications required under Sec. 355.22(a)(2) for all 
producers and exporters covered by the order or suspension agreement; 
and
    (ii) Those producers' and exporters' certifications that they shall 
not apply for or receive any net subsidy on the

[[Page 244]]

(244merchandise from any program described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of 
this section.
    (3) During the fifth and subsequent annual anniversary months of 
publication of an order or suspension of investigation, a producer or 
exporter may request in writing that the Secretary revoke an order with 
regard to that person if the person submits with the request:
    (i) The certifications required under Sec. 355.22(a)(2);
    (ii) The certifications described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this 
section for the merchandise covered by the request; and
    (iii) The agreement described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this 
section.
    (c) Procedures. (1) After receipt of a timely request under 
paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will consider the request 
as including a request for an administrative review and will conduct a 
review under Sec. 355.22(c).
    (2) In addition to the requirements of Sec. 355.22(c), the Secretary 
will:
    (i) Publish with the notice of initiation, under Sec. 355.22(c)(1), 
notice of ``Request for Revocation of Order (in Part)'' or, if 
appropriate, ``Request for Termination of Suspended Investigation;''
    (ii) Conduct a verification under Sec. 355.36;
    (iii) Include in the preliminary results of review, under 
Sec. 355.22(c)(4), the Secretary's decision whether there is a 
reasonable basis to believe that the requirements for revocation or 
termination are met;
    (iv) If the Secretary's preliminary decision under paragraph 
(c)(2)(iii) of this section is affirmative, publish with the notice of 
preliminary results of review, under Sec. 355.22(c)(5), notice of 
``Intent to Revoke Order (in Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Intent to 
Terminate Suspended Investigation;''
    (v) Include in the final results of review, under Sec. 355.22(c)(7), 
the Secretary's final decision whether the requirements for revocation 
or termination are met; and
    (vi) If the Secretary's final decision under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of 
this section is affirmative, publish with the notice of final results of 
review, under Sec. 355.22(c)(8), notice of ``Revocation of Order (in 
Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Termination of Suspended Investigation.''
    (3) If the Secretary revokes an order or revokes an order in part, 
the Secretary will order the suspension of liquidation ended for the 
merchandise covered by the revocation on the first day after the period 
under review, and will instruct the Customs Service to release any cash 
deposit or bond.
    (d) Revocation or termination based on changed circumstances. (1) 
The Secretary may revoke an order or terminate a suspended investigation 
if the Secretary concludes that:
    (i) The order or suspended investigation no longer is of interest to 
interested parties, as defined in paragraphs (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), and 
(i)(6) of Sec. 355.2; or
    (ii) Other changed circumstances sufficient to warrant revocation or 
termination exist.
    (2) If at any time the Secretary concludes from the available 
information, including an affirmative statement of no interest from the 
petitioner in the proceeding, that changed circumstances sufficient to 
warrant revocation or termination may exist, the Secretary will conduct 
an administrative review under Sec. 355.22(h).
    (3) In addition to the requirements of Sec. 355.22(h), the Secretary 
will:
    (i) Publish with the notice of initiation, under 
Sec. 355.22(h)(1)(i), notice of ``Consideration of Revocation of Order 
(in Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Consideration of Termination of 
Suspended Investigation;''
    (ii) If the Secretary's conclusion, as described in paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section, is not based on a request, the Secretary, not later 
than the date of publication of the notice described in paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section, will serve written notice of the 
consideration of revocation or termination on each interested party 
listed on the Department's service list and on any other person which 
the Secretary has reason to believe is a producer or seller in the 
United States of the like product;
    (iii) Conduct a verification, if appropriate, under Sec. 355.36;
    (iv) Include in the preliminary results of review, under 
Sec. 355.22(h)(1)(iv), the Secretary's decision whether there

[[Page 245]]

(245is a reasonable basis to believe that the requirements for 
revocation or termination based on changed circumstances are met;
    (v) If the Secretary's preliminary decision under paragraph 
(d)(3)(iv) of this section is affirmative, publish with the notice of 
preliminary results of review, under Sec. 355.22(h)(1)(v), notice of 
``Intent to Revoke Order (in Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Intent to 
Terminate Suspended Investigation;''
    (vi) Include in the final results of review, under 
Sec. 355.22(h)(1)(viii), the Secretary's final decision whether the 
requirements for revocation or termination based on changed 
circumstances are met; and
    (vii) If the Secretary's final decision under paragraph (d)(3)(vi) 
of this section is affirmative, publish with the notice of final results 
of review, under Sec. 355.22(h)(1)(ix), a notice of ``Revocation of 
Order (in Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Termination of Suspended 
Investigation.''
    (4)(i) If for four consecutive annual anniversary months no 
interested party has requested an administrative review, under 
Sec. 355.22(a), of an order or suspended investigation, not later than 
the first day of the fifth consecutive annual anniversary month, the 
Secretary will publish in the Federal Register notice of ``Intent to 
Revoke Order'' or, if appropriate, ``Intent to Terminate Suspended 
Investigation.''
    (ii) Not later than the date of publication of the notice described 
in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section, the Secretary will serve written 
notice of the intent to revoke or terminate on each interested party 
listed on the Department's service list and on any other person which 
the Secretary has reason to believe is a producer or seller in the 
United States of the like product.
    (iii) If by the last day of the fifth annual anniversary month no 
interested party objects, or requests an administrative review under 
Sec. 355.22(a), the Secretary at that time will conclude that the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section for revocation or 
termination are met, revoke the order or terminate the suspended 
investigation, and publish in the Federal Register the notice described 
in paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section.
    (5) If the Secretary under paragraph (d) of this section revokes an 
order or revokes an order in part, the Secretary will order the 
suspension of liquidation ended for the merchandise covered by the 
revocation on the effective date of the notice of revocation, and will 
instruct the Customs Service to release any cash deposit or bond.
    (e) Revocation or termination based on injury reconsideration. If 
the Commission determines in an administrative review under section 
751(b) of the Act that an industry in the United States would not be 
materially injured, or would not be threatened with material injury, or 
the establishment of an industry in the United States would not be 
materially retarded, by reason of imports of the merchandise covered by 
a countervailing duty order or suspension agreement, the Secretary will 
revoke, in whole or in part, the order or terminate the suspended 
investigation, and will publish in the Federal Register notice of 
``Revocation of Order (in Part)'' or, if appropriate, ``Termination of 
Suspended Investigation.''

Sec. 355.27  Procedures for initiation of downstream product monitoring.

    (a) In general. A domestic producer of an article that is like a 
component part or a downstream product may file an application pursuant 
to this section requesting that the Secretary designate a downstream 
product for monitoring.
    (b) Contents of application. The application shall contain the 
following information, to the extent reasonably available to the 
applicant:
    (1) The name and address of the person requesting the monitoring and 
a description of the article it produces which is the basis for filing 
its application;
    (2) A detailed description of the downstream product in question;
    (3) A detailed description of the component product incorporated 
into such downstream product, including the value of the component part 
in relation to the value of the downstream product, and the extent to 
which the component part has been substantially transformed as a result 
of its incorporation into the downstream product;

[[Page 246]]

(246
    (4) The name of the home market country of both the downstream and 
component products and the name of any intermediate country through 
which these products are transshipped;
    (5) The name and address of all known producers of the component 
part and downstream product in the relevant countries and a detailed 
description of any relationship between such producers;
    (6) Whether the component part is already subject to monitoring to 
aid in the enforcement of a bilateral arrangement within the meaning of 
Section 804 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984;
    (7) A list of all antidumping or countervailing duty investigations 
suspended under Sec. 353.18 or Sec. 355.18, or antidumping or

merchandise related to the component part and manufactured in the same 
foreign country in which the component part is manufactured;
    (8) A list of all antidumping or countervailing duty investigations 
suspended under Sec. 353.18 or Sec. 355.18, or antidumping or 
countervailing orders issued under Sec. 353.21 or Sec. 355.21 on 
merchandise manufactured or exported by the manufacturer or exporter of 
the component part that is similar in description and use to the 
component part; and
    (9) The reasons for suspecting that the imposition of antidumping or 
countervailing duties has resulted in a diversion of exports of the 
component part into increased production and exportation to the United 
Sates of such downstream product.
    (c) Determination of sufficiency of application--(1) In general. 
Within 14 days after an application is filed under paragraph (b) of this 
section the Secretary will determine the sufficiency of the application. 
An application is considered to be filed at the time it is received by 
the Secretary. In order to determine that an application is sufficient, 
the Secretary must find:
    (i) There is a reasonable likelihood that imports of the downstream 
product into the United States will increase as an indirect result of 
any diversion with respect to the component part; and
    (ii) That--
    (A) The component part is already subject to monitoring with respect 
to the enforcement of a bilateral arrangement within the meaning of 
Section 804 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, or
    (B) Merchandise related to the component part and manufactured in 
the same foreign country in which the component part is manufactured has 
been the subject of a significant number of antidumping or 
countervailing duty investigations suspended under Sec. 353.18 or 
Sec. 355.18, or antidumping or countervailing duty orders issued under 
Sec. 353.21 or Sec. 355.21, or
    (C) Merchandise manufactured or exported by the manufacturer or 
exporter of the component part that is similar in description and use to 
the component part has been the subject of at least two antidumping or 
countervailing duty investigations suspended under Sec. 353.18 or 
Sec. 355.18, or antidumping or countervailing duty orders issued under 
Sec. 353.21 or Sec. 355.21.
    (2) In making a determination under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this 
section, the Secretary will consider all factors the Secretary considers 
relevant and may, if appropriate, take into account such factors as:
    (i) The value of the component part in relation to the value of the 
downstream product;
    (ii) The extent to which the component part has been substantially 
transformed as a result of its incorporation into the downstream 
product; and
    (iii) The relationship between the producers of the component part 
and producers of the downstream product.
    (d) Notice of determination. The Secretary will publish in the 
Federal Register notice of each affirmative or negative ``monitoring'' 
determination made under paragraph (c) of his section and if the 
determination under (c)(1)(i) and under any clause of (c)(1)(ii) are 
affirmative, will transmit to the Commission a copy of the determination 
and the application. The Secretary will make available to the Commission 
and to its employees directly involved in the monitoring all information 
upon which the Secretary based the initiation.
    (e) Action on basis of monitoring reports. The Secretary will review 
the information in any monitoring reports

[[Page 247]]

(247submitted to the Department by the Commission under Section 780 of 
the Act and will:
    (1) Consider the information in determining whether to initiate an 
investigation under Sec. 355.11 regarding any downstream product; and
    (2) Request the Commission to cease monitoring any downstream 
product if the information indicates that imports into the United States 
are not increasing and there is no reasonable likelihood of diversion 
with respect to the component part.
    (f) Definitions--(1) Downstream product means any manufactured 
product imported into the United States into which a component part is 
incorporated.
    (2) Component part means any imported article which:
    (i) During the previous five-year period, ending on the date on 
which the application is filed under paragraph (b) of this section, has 
been subject to--
    (A) An antidumping or countervailing duty order issued under 
Sec. 353.21 or Sec. 355.21 that required the deposit of estimated 
antidumping or countervailing duties, applicable to the particular 
manufacturer or exporter, at a rate of at least 15 percent ad valorem 
or,
    (B) A suspension agreement entered into under Sec. 353.18 or 
Sec. 355.18 after a preliminary determination under Sec. 353.15 or 
Sec. 355.15 was made by the Secretary which included a determination 
that the estimated net antidumping margin or subsidy rate, applicable to 
the particular manufacturer or exporter, was at least 15 percent ad 
valorem; and
    (ii) Due to its inherent characteristics, is routinely used as a 
major part, material, component, assembly, or subassembly in a 
downstream product.
    (g) Where to file; time of filing; format and number of copies. The 
requirements of Sec. 355.31 (d), (e), (f), and (g) apply to this 
section.

Sec. 355.28  Procedures for the correction of ministerial errors.

    (a) In general. The Secretary will disclose the calculations 
performed in connection with a final countervailing duty determination 
pursuant to Sec. 355.20, or in a final results of an administrative 
review of a countervailing duty order pursuant to Sec. 355.22, to any 
party to the proceeding making a request in accordance with this 
section. A party to the proceeding must file such a request in writing 
with the Secretary within five business days of the date of publication 
of the relevant final determination or final results of administrative 
review. A party to whom the Secretary has disclosed final calculations 
may submit comments concerning any ministerial errors in such 
calculations.
    (b) Time limits. Comments must be filed within five business days 
after the date of disclosure unless the Secretary extends the time limit 
based upon a written request for extension that is filed within five 
business days after the date of disclosure and showing cause for such 
extension. Comments shall be submitted in writing to the Secretary and 
shall be served on all interested parties on the Department's service 
list. Interested parties may file replies to any comments submitted 
under paragraph (a) of this section. Any replies must be filed with the 
Secretary within five business days after the date the relevant comments 
under paragraph (a) are received by that party and shall be served on 
all interested parties on the Department's service list. All service of 
interested parties on the Department's service list pursuant to this 
paragraph shall be in accordance with Sec. 355.31(g). Notwithstanding 
the provisions of Sec. 355.34(d), the Secretary may permit 
representatives to retain proprietary information released under 
administrative protective order under Sec. 355.34 until the expiration 
of the time for filing for judicial review of the Secretary's correction 
of any ministerial errors. If the Secretary determines there are no 
ministerial errors, proprietary information will be returned in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 355.34(d).
    (c) Corrections. The Secretary will analyze any comments received 
and will correct any ministerial errors by amending the final 
countervailing duty determination or final results of administrative 
review. Such corrections will be published in the Federal Register. A 
correction notice does not alter the anniversary month of an order or 
suspension of investigation for

[[Page 248]]

(248purposes of requesting an administrative review under Sec. 355.22.
    (d) Definition of ``ministerial error''. For purposes of this 
section, ministerial error means an error in addition, subtraction, or 
other arithmetic function, clerical error resulting from inaccurate 
copying, duplication, or the like, and any other type of unintentional 
error which the Secretary considers ministerial.

[55 FR 9053, Mar. 9, 1990]

Sec. 355.29  Scope determination.

    (a) Self-initiation. If the Secretary determines from available 
information that an inquiry is warranted to determine whether a product 
is included within the scope of a countervailing duty order, the 
Secretary will initiate an inquiry and notify all interested parties on 
the Department's service lists of its initiation of a scope inquiry.
    (b) By application. Any interested party, as defined in 
Sec. 355.2(i), may file an application to determine whether a particular 
product is within the scope of an order. The application shall contain 
the following, to the extent reasonably available to the interested 
party:
    (1) A detailed description of the product, including technical 
characteristics and uses of the product, and its current U.S. Tariff 
Classification number;
    (2) A statement of the interested party's position as to whether the 
product is within the scope of an order, including--
    (i) A summary of the reasons for this conclusion,
    (ii) Citations to any applicable statutory authority, and
    (iii) Attachment of any factual support for this position, including 
applicable portions of the Secretary's or the Commission's 
investigation.
    Where all of these conditions are met, the Secretary will evaluate 
the application. If the Secretary determines that no inquiry is 
warranted to determine whether a product is included within the scope of 
an order, the Secretary will issue a final ruling as to whether the 
merchandise which is the subject of the application is included in the 
existing order. The Secretary will, by mail, notify all interested 
parties on the Department's service lists of its determination. If, 
however, the Secretary determines that a scope inquiry is warranted, the 
Secretary will, by mail, notify all interested parties on the 
Department's service lists of the initiation of a scope inquiry.
    (c) Notice. Any initiation of a scope inquiry issued pursuant to 
paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section will include:
    (1) A description of the product that is the subject of the scope 
inquiry; and
    (2) An explanation of the reasons for the Secretary's decision to 
initiate a scope inquiry; and
    (3) A schedule for submission of comments.
    (d) Procedures for scope inquiry. Except as provided under paragraph 
(d)(6) of this section, the procedures for scope inquiries will be as 
follows:
    (1) Interested parties shall file any comments not later than twenty 
days after receipt of the notification described in paragraph (c) of 
this section, unless the Secretary alters this time limit;
    (2) Not later than the time limit stated in the notification 
described in paragraph (c) of this section (ordinarily five days after 
the time limit for filing the comments described in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section), any interested party may submit rebuttal comments;
    (3) Whenever the Secretary determines that a scope inquiry presents 
an issue of significant difficulty, the Secretary will issue a 
preliminary scope ruling based upon the available information at the 
time, as to whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect 
that the product subject to a scope inquiry is included within the 
order. The Secretary will, by mail, notify all interested parties on the 
Department's service lists of its preliminary scope ruling and provide 
an invitation for comment. Unless otherwise specified, the Secretary 
will provide all interested parties thirty days from the date of receipt 
of the notification for comment;
    (4) The Secretary may issue questionnaires or verify submissions 
received, where appropriate;
    (5) The Secretary will issue a final ruling as to whether the 
product which is the subject of the scope inquiry is included in the 
existing order, including an explanation of the factual and legal

[[Page 249]]

(249conclusions on which the final ruling is based. The Secretary will, 
by certified mail, return receipt requested, notify all interested 
parties on the Department's service lists of its final scope ruling;
    (6) When a Sec. 355.22 review is in progress at the time the 
Secretary provides the notification outlined in paragraph (c) of this 
section, the scope investigation, in the Secretary's discretion, may be 
conducted in conjunction with a Sec. 355.22(c) review;
    (7) With respect to countervailing duty proceedings in which the 
Commission made an affirmative injury determination, prior to issuing a 
ruling in accordance with paragraph (3) or (5) of this section or 
Sec. 355.22(c)(4) or Sec. 355.22(c)(8) to include products within the 
scope of an order pursuant to--
    (i) Paragraph (e) of this section, other than operations in the 
United States involving minor completion or assembly,
    (ii) Paragraph (f) of this section, or
    (iii) Paragraph (h) of this section, with respect to later-developed 
products which incorporate a signficant technological advance or 
significant alteration of an earlier product,

 the Secretary will notify the Commission in writing of the proposed 
inclusion of such products in the order. Upon the written request of the 
Commission, the Secretary will consult with the Commission regarding the 
proposed inclusion and any such consultation will be completed within 15 
days after the date of such request. If the Commission believes, after 
such consultation, that a significant injury issue is presented by the 
proposed inclusion, the Commission may provide written advice to the 
Secretary as to whether the inclusion would be inconsistent with the 
affirmative determination of the Commission on which the order is based; 
and
    (8) On a quarterly basis, the Secretary will publish in the Federal 
Register a list of scope rulings completed within the last three months. 
This list will include the case name, reference number and a brief 
description of the ruling.
    (e) Products completed or assembled in the United States--(1) In 
General. If--
    (i) A product sold in the United States is of the same class or kind 
as merchandise that is the subject of an order, and
    (ii) Such product sold in the United States is completed or 
assembled in the United States from parts or components produced in the 
foreign country with respect to which such order applies, and
    (iii) The difference between the value of such product sold in the 
United States and the value of the imported parts and components 
referred to in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) is small,

the Secretary, after taking into account any advice provided by the 
Commission under paragraph (d)(7) of this section, may include within 
the scope of such order the imported parts or components referred to in 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii) that are used in the completion or assembly of the 
merchandise in the United States at any time such order is in effect.
    (2) Factors to consider. In determining whether to include parts or 
components in an order under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the 
Secretary will take into account such factors as:
    (i) The pattern of trade;
    (ii) Whether the manufacturer or exporter of the parts or components 
is related to the person who assembles or completes the merchandise sold 
in the United States from the parts or components produced in the 
foreign country with respect to which the order described in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section applies; and
    (iii) Whether imports into the United States of the parts or 
components produced in such foreign country have increased after the 
issuance of such order or finding.
    (f) Products completed or assembled in other foreign countries--(1) 
In General. If--
    (i) A product sold in the United States is of the same class or kind 
as the merchandise that is the subject of an order,
    (ii) Before importation into the United States, such imported 
product is completed or assembled in another foreign country from 
merchandise which is subject to such order, or is produced in the 
foreign country with respect to which such order applies,

[[Page 250]]

(250
    (iii) The difference between the value of such imported products and 
the value of the merchandise described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) is small, 
and
    (iv) The Secretary determines that action is appropriate under this 
paragraph to prevent evasion of such order,

the Secretary, after taking into account any advice provided by the 
Commission under paragraph (d)(7) of this section, may include such 
imported products within the scope of such order at any time such order 
is in effect.
    (2) Factors to consider. In determining whether to include a product 
in an order under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Secretary will 
take into account such factors as:
    (i) The pattern of trade;
    (ii) Whether the manufacturer or exporter of the product described 
in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) is related to the person who uses the 
merchandise described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) to assemble or complete in 
the foreign country the product that is subsequently imported into the 
United States; and
    (iii) Whether imports into the foreign country of the product 
described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) have increased after the issuance of 
such order.
    (g) Minor alterations of merchandise--(1) In general. The class or 
kind of merchandise subject to an investigation or order will include 
articles altered in form or appearance in minor respects (including raw 
agricultural products that have undergone minor processing), whether or 
not included in the same tariff classification.
    (2) Exception. Paragraph (g)(1) of this section will not apply with 
respect to altered merchandise if the Secretary determines that it would 
be unnecessary to consider the altered merchandise within the scope of 
the investigation or order.
    (h) Later-developed products--(1) In general. For purposes of 
determining whether a product developed after a countervailing duty 
investigation is initiated (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as 
the ``later-developed merchandise'') is within the scope of an order, 
the Secretary will consider whether:
    (i) The later-developed product has the same general physical 
characteristics as the merchandise with respect to which the order was 
originally issued (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as the 
``earlier merchandise'');
    (ii) The expectations of the ultimate purchasers of the later-
developed product are the same as for the earlier merchandise;
    (iii) The ultimate use of the earlier merchandise and the later-
developed product are the same;
    (iv) The later-developed product is sold through the same channels 
of trade as the earlier merchandise; and
    (v) The later-developed product is advertised and displayed in a 
manner similar to the earlier merchandise.

    The Secretary will take into account any advice provided by the 
Commission under paragraph (d)(7) of this section before making a 
determination under this paragraph.
    (2) Exclusion from orders. The Secretary may not exclude later-
developed products from an order merely because the products:
    (i) Are classified under the tariff classification other than that 
identified in the petition or the Secretary's prior notices during the 
proceeding; or
    (ii) Permit the purchaser to perform additional functions, unless 
such additional functions constitute the primary use of the products and 
the cost of the additional functions constitute more than a significant 
proportion of the total cost of production of the products.
    (i) Other scope determinations. With respect to those scope 
determinations that are not covered under paragraphs (e) through (h) of 
this section, in considering whether a particular product is within the 
class or kind of merchandise described in an existing order, the 
Secretary will take into account the following:
    (1) The descriptions of the product contained in the petition, the 
initial investigation, and the determinations of the Secretary and the 
Commission.
    (2) When the above criteria are not dispositive, the Secretary will 
further consider:
    (i) The physical characteristics of the product;
    (ii) The expectations of the ultimate purchasers;
    (iii) The ultimate use of the product; and

[[Page 251]]

(251
    (iv) The channels of trade.
    (j) Suspension of liquidation. (1) When the Secretary initiates a 
scope inquiry pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, and the subject 
product is already subject to suspension of liquidation, that suspension 
of liquidation will be continued pending a preliminary or a final scope 
ruling. Any suspension of liquidation will be at the cash desposit of 
estimated duty rate that will apply if the subject product is ruled to 
be included within the scope of the order.
    (2) If the Secretary issues a preliminary scope ruling pursuant to 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section to the effect that the subject product 
is included within the scope of the order, any suspension of liquidation 
described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section will continue. Where there 
has been no suspension of liquidation, the Secretary will instruct the 
Customs Service to suspend liquidation and require a cash deposit of 
estimated duties, at the applicable rate, for each suspended entry of 
the product entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or 
after the date of the preliminary scope ruling. If the Secretary issues 
a preliminary scope ruling to the effect that the subject product is not 
included within the scope of the order, the Secretary will order any 
suspension of liquidation on the subject product ended and will instruct 
the Customs Service to refund any cash deposits or release any bonds 
relating to this product.
    (3) If the Secretary issues a final scope ruling, pursuant to either 
paragraph (b) or (d)(5) of this section, to the effect that the subject 
product is included within the scope of the order, any suspension of 
liquidation pursuant to paragraph (j)(1) or (j)(2) of this section will 
continue. Where there has been no suspension of liquidation, the 
Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to suspend liquidation and 
require a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable rate, for 
each entry of the product entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for 
consumption on or after the date of the final scope ruling. If the 
Secretary's final scope ruling is to the effect that the subject product 
is not included within the scope of the order, the Secretary will order 
any suspension of liquidation on the subject product ended and will 
instruct the Customs Service to refund any cash deposits or release any 
bonds relating to this product.
    (k) Where to file; time of filing; format and number of copies. The 
requirements of Sec. 355.31 (d), (e), (f), and (g) apply to this 
section.

<R04>
Subpart C--Information and Argument

Sec. 355.31  Submission of factual information.

    (a) Time limits in general. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(2) and (b) of this section, submissions of factual information for 
the Secretary's consideration shall be submitted not later than:
    (i) For the Secretary's final determination, the day before the 
scheduled date on which the verification is to commence;
    (ii) For the Secretary's final results of an administrative review 
other than a review under Sec. 355.22(j), the earlier of the date of 
publication of notice of preliminary results of review or 180 days after 
the date of publication of notice of initiation of the review; or
    (iii) For the Secretary's final results of an administrative review 
under Sec. 355.22(j), the earlier of the date of publication of notice 
of preliminary results of review or 120 days after the date of 
publication of notice of initiation of the review.
    (2) Any interested party, as defined in paragraphs (i)(3), (i)(4), 
(i)(5), and (i)(6) of Sec. 355.2, may submit factual information to 
rebut, clarify, or correct factual information submitted by an 
interested party, as defined in paragraph (i)(1) or (i)(2) of 
Sec. 355.2, at any time prior to the deadline provided in this section 
for submission of such factual information or, if later, 10 days after 
the date such factual information is served on the interested party, or, 
if appropriate, made available under administrative protective order to 
the interested party.

[[Page 252]]

(252
    (3) The Secretary will not consider in the final determination or 
the final results, or retain in the record of the proceeding, any 
factual information submitted after the applicable time limit. The 
Secretary will return such information to the submitter with written 
notice stating the reasons for return of the information.
    (b) Questionaire responses and other submissions on request. (1) 
Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary may request 
any person to submit factual information at any time during a 
proceeding.
    (2) In the Secretary's written request to an interested party for a 
response to a questionnaire or for other factual information, the 
Secretary will specify the time limit for response. The Secretary 
normally will not consider or retain in the record of the proceeding 
unsolicited questionnaire responses, and in no event will the Secretary 
consider unsolicited questionnaire responses submitted after the date of 
publication of the Secretary's preliminary determination. The Secretary 
will return to the submitter, with written notice stating the reasons 
for return of the document, any untimely or unsolicited questionnaire 
responses rejected by the Department.
    (3) Ordinarily, the Secretary will not extend the time limit stated 
in the questionnnaire or request for other factual information. Before 
the time limit expires, the recipient of the Secretary's request may 
request an extension. The request must be in writing and state the 
reasons for the request. Only the following employees of the Department 
may approve an extension: the Assistant Secretary for Import 
Administration, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import 
Administration, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investigations, the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance, and the office or division 
director responsible for the proceeding. An extension must be approved 
in writing.
    (4) Except as provided in Sec. 355.32(b) and subject to the other 
provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, questionnaire responses in 
administrative reviews must be submitted not later than 60 days after 
the date of receipt of the questionnaire.
    (c) Time limits for allegations of subsidies. (1) Except for an 
allegation of upstream subsidies submitted in an investigation (see 
Secs. 355.15(d) and 355.20(b)), the Secretary will not consider any 
subsidy allegation submitted by the petitioner or other interested 
party, as defined in paragraph (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of 
Sec. 355.2, later than:
    (i) In an investigation, 40 days before the scheduled date for the 
Secretary's preliminary determination;
    (ii) In an administrative review other than a review under 
Sec. 355.22(j), 120 days after the date of publication of the notice of 
initiation of the review; or
    (iii) In an administrative review under Sec. 355.22(j), 60 days 
after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the review.
    (2) Any interested party may request in writing not later than the 
time limits specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section an extension 
of those time limits. If the Assistant Secretary for Import 
Administration concludes that an extension would facilitate the proper 
administration of the law, the Assistant Secretary may grant an 
extension of not longer than 10 days in an investigation or 30 days in 
an administrative review.
    (d) Where to file; time of filing. Address and submit documents to 
the Secretary of Commerce, Attention: Import Administration, Central 
Records Unit, Room B-099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania 
Avenue and 14th St., NW., Washington, DC 20230, between the hours of 
8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on business days. For all time limits in this 
part, the Secretary will consider documents received when stamped by the 
Central Records Unit with the date and time of receipt. If the time 
limit expires on a non-business day, the Secretary will accept documents 
that are filed on the next following business day.
    (e) Format and number of copies. (1) In general. Unless the 
Secretary alters the requirements of this section, submitters shall make 
all submissions in the format specified in paragraph (e) of this 
section. The Secretary may refuse

[[Page 253]]

(253to accept for the record of the proceeding any submission that does 
not conform to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Documents. In an investigation, submit 10 copies of any 
document, except a computer printout, and, if a person has requested 
that the Secretary treat portions of the document as proprietary 
information, submit five copies of a public version of the document, 
including any public summaries required under Sec. 355.32(b) as 
substitutes for the portions for which the person has requested 
proprietary treatment; and if administrative protective order versions 
are required to be served pursuant to Sec. 355.31(g) (1) or (2), submit 
one copy of the cover page, marked as described in paragraph (e)(2)(v), 
together with only those pages that differ from the public or 
proprietary versions. In an administrative review, scope inquiry, or 
downstream product monitoring application, submit seven copies of any 
document, except a computer printout; and if a person has requested that 
the Secretary treat portions of the document as proprietary information, 
submit three copies of a public version of the document, as described 
above; and submit one copy of any administrative protective order 
versions required to be served pursuant to Sec. 355.31(g) (1) or (2), as 
described above. In an investigation, administrative review, scope 
inquiry, or downstream product monitoring application, submit documents, 
if prepared for that segment of the proceeding, on letter-size paper, 
single-sided and double-spaced. Securely bind each copy as a single 
document with any letter of transmittal as the first page of the 
document. Mark the first page of each document in the upper right-hand 
corner with the following information in the following format:
    (i) On the first line, except for a petition, the Department case 
number;
    (ii) On the second line, the total number of pages in the document 
including cover pages, appendices, and any unnumbered pages;
    (iii) On the third line, state whether the document is for an 
investigation, scope inquiry, downstream product monitoring application, 
or an administrative review and, if the latter, the inclusive dates of 
the review;
    (iv) On the fourth and subsequent lines, state whether any portion 
of the document contains classified, privileged, or proprietary 
information and, if so, list the applicable page numbers and state 
either ``Document May be Released Under APO'' or ``Document May Not be 
Released Under APO'' (see Secs. 355.32(c) and 355.34);
    (v) For administrative protective order versions, described in 
Sec. 355.31(g) (1) or (2), complete the marking as required in 
paragraphs (i)-(iv) above for the proprietary document, but 
conspicuously mark the first page ``APO Version Prepared for [Name of 
party entitled to receive materials]''; and
    (vi) For public versions of proprietary documents, required by 
Sec. 355.32(b), complete the marking as required in paragraphs (e)(2) 
(i) through (iv) of this section for the proprietary document, but 
conspicuously mark the first page ``Public Version.''
    (3) Computer tapes and printouts. The Secretary may require 
submission of factual information on computer tape unless the Secretary 
decides that the submitter does not maintain records in computerized 
form and cannot supply the requested information on computer tape 
without unreasonable additional burden in time and expense. In an 
investigation or administrative review, the tape shall be accompanied by 
three copies of any computer printout and three copies of the public 
version of the printout.
    (f) Translation to English. Unless the Secretary waives in writing 
this requirement for an individual document, any document submitted 
which is in a foreign language must be accompanied by an English 
translation.
    (g) Service of copies on other parties. With the exception of 
petitions, proposed suspension agreements submitted under 
Sec. 355.18(g)(1)(i), and factual information submitted under 
Sec. 355.32(a) that is not required to be served on an interested party, 
the submitter of a document shall, at the same time, serve a copy of the 
document, on all interested parties on the Department's service list by 
first class mail or personal service. In addition, where proprietary 
information is involved, the

[[Page 254]]

(254submitter shall serve the following administrative protective order 
versions:
    (1) With respect to parties to the proceeding that are subject to 
administrative protective orders under Sec. 355.34, the submitter of a 
document shall include that proprietary information that the interested 
party is entitled to receive under the terms of the administrative 
protective order, as well as the party's own proprietary information, 
but no other proprietary information;
    (2) With respect to interested parties that are not subject to an 
administrative protective order, but when the submission contains that 
interested party's proprietary information, the submitter of a document 
shall serve the interested party with a version that contains just the 
interested party's own proprietary information.
    The Secretary will not accept any document that is not accompanied 
by a certificate of service listing the parties served, the type of 
document served, and, for each, indicating the date and method of 
service.
    (h) Service list. The Central Records Unit will maintain and make 
available a service list for each proceeding. Each interested party 
which asks to be on the service list shall designate a person to receive 
service of documents filed in a proceeding.
    (i) Certifications. Any interested party which submits factual 
information to the Secretary must submit with the factual information 
the certification in paragraph (i)(1) and, if the party has legal 
counsel or another representative, the certification in paragraph (i)(2) 
of this section:
    (1) For the interested party's official responsible for presentation 
of the factual information: ``I, (name and title), currently employed by 
(interested party), certify that (1) I have read the attached 
submission, and (2) the information contained in this submission is, to 
the best of my knowledge, complete and accurate.''
    (2) For interested party's legal counsel or other representative: 
``I, (name), of (law or other firm), counsel or representative to 
(interested party), certify that (i) I have read the attached 
submission, and (ii) based on the information made available to me by 
(interested party), I have no reason to believe that this submission 
contains any material misrepresentation or omission of fact.''

[53 FR 52344, Dec. 27, 1988, as amended at 55 FR 9056, Mar. 9, 1990; 57 
FR 30903, July 13, 1992; 60 FR 25139, May 11, 1995]

Sec. 355.32  Request for proprietary treatment of information.

    (a) Submission and content of request. (1) Any person who submits 
factual information to the Secretary in connection with a proceeding may 
request that the Secretary treat that information, or any specified 
part, as proprietary.
    (2) The submitter shall identify proprietary information on each 
page by placing brackets around the proprietary information and clearly 
stating at the top of each page containing such information 
``Proprietary Treatment Requested'' and the warning ``Bracketing of 
proprietary information not final for one business day after date of 
filing.'' The bracketing becomes final one business day after the date 
of filing of the document, i.e., at the same time as the nonbusiness 
proprietary version of the document is due to be filed. Until the 
bracketing becomes final, recipients of the document may not divulge any 
part of the contents of the document to anyone not subject to the 
administrative protective order issued in the investigation. After the 
bracketing becomes final, recipients may divulge the public version of 
the document to anyone not subject to the administrative protective 
order. If the submitter discovers it has failed to bracket correctly, 
the submitter may file a corrected version or portion of the business 
proprietary document at the same time as the nonbusiness proprietary 
version is filed. No changes to the document other than bracketing and 
deletion of business proprietary information are permitted after the 
deadline. Failure to comply with this paragraph may result in the 
striking from the record of all or a portion of a submitter's document.
    (3) The submitter shall provide a full explanation why each piece of 
factual information subject to the request is entitled to proprietary 
treatment under Sec. 355.4. The request and explanation shall be a part 
of or securely

[[Page 255]]

(255bound with the document containing the information.
    (b) Public Summary. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, not later than one business day after submitting information 
for which proprietary treatment is requested, any person who requests 
proprietary treatment shall provide to the Secretary:
    (1) An adequate public summary of all proprietary information, 
incorporated in the public version of the document (generally, numeric 
data are adequately summarized if grouped or presented in terms of 
indices, or figures within 10 percent of the actual figure, and if an 
individual portion of the data is voluminous, at least one percent 
representative of that portion is individually summarized in this 
manner); or
    (2) A statement itemizing those portions of the proprietary 
information which cannot be summarized adequately and all arguments 
supporting that conclusion for each portion.
    (3) All requests for proprietary treatment of information contained 
in petitions submitted under Sec. 355.12 and proposed suspension 
agreements submitted under Sec. 355.18(g)(1)(i) shall be accompanied by 
a pubic summary and statement described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) 
of this section.
    (c) Agreement to release. All requests for proprietary treatment 
shall include either an agreement to permit disclosure under 
administrative protective order, or a statement itemizing which portions 
of the proprietary information should not be released under 
administrative protective order and all arguments supporting that 
conclusion for each portion. The Secretary ordinarily will not provide 
the submitter further opportunity for argument on whether to grant a 
request for disclosure under administrative protective order.
    (d) Return of information as a result of nonconforming request. The 
Secretary may return to the submitter any factual information for which 
the submitter requested proprietary treatment when the request does not 
conform to the requirements of this section and in any event will not 
consider the information. If the Secretary returns the information, the 
Secretary will provide a written explanation of the reasons why it does 
not conform and will not consider it unless it is resubmitted with a new 
request which complies with the requirements of this section not later 
than two business days after receipt of the Department's explanation for 
rejection of the information.
    (e) Status during consideration of request. While considering 
whether to grant a request for proprietary treatment, the Secretary will 
not disclose or make public the information. The Secretary normally will 
decide not later than 14 days after the Secretary receives the request.
    (f) Treatment of proprietary information. Unless the Secretary 
otherwise provides, the person to whom the Secretary discloses 
information shall not disclose the information to any other person. The 
Secretary may disclose factual information which the Secretary decides 
is proprietary only to:
    (1) A representative of an interested party who requests and is 
granted an administrative protective order under Sec. 355.34;
    (2) An employee of the Department directly involved in the 
proceeding for which the information is submitted;
    (3) An employee of the Commission directly involved in the 
proceeding for which the information is submitted;
    (4) An employee of the Customs Service directly involved in 
conducting a fraud investigation relating to a countervailing duty 
proceeding on the merchandise;
    (5) Any person to whom the submitter specifically authorizes (in 
writing) disclosure; and
    (6) A charged party or counsel for the charged party under Part 354 
of this title (19 CFR part 354).
    (g) Denial of request for proprietary treatment. If the Secretary 
decides that the factual information does not warrant proprietary 
treatment in whole or in part, the Secretary will notify the submitter. 
Unless the submitter agrees that the information be considered public, 
the Secretary will return the information to the submitter with written 
notice stating the reasons for return of the information and will not 
consider it in the proceeding.

Sec. 355.33  Information exempt from disclosure.

    Privileged or classified information is exempt from disclosure to 
the public or to representatives of interested parties.

Sec. 355.34  Disclosure of proprietary information under administrative 
          protective order.

    (a) In general. Upon receipt of an application (before or after 
receipt of the information requested) which describes in general terms 
the information requested and sets forth the reasons for the request, 
the Secretary shall require all proprietary information presented to, or 
obtained by it, during a segment of a proceeding (except privileged 
information, classified information, and specific information of a type 
for which there is a clear and compelling need to withhold from 
disclosure) to be disclosed to interested parties who are parties to the 
proceeding under a protective order described in this section, 
regardless of when the information is submitted during the segment of 
the proceeding.
    (b) Request for disclosure. (1) A representative must file a request 
for disclosure under administrative protective order not later than the 
later of:
    (i) 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register of 
the notice of initiation under Sec. 355.11 or Sec. 355.13, or the notice 
of initiation of administrative review under Sec. 355.22; or
    (ii) 30 days after the initiation of a scope inquiry pursuant to 
Sec. 355.29 (a) or (b); or
    (iii) 10 days after the date the representative's client or employer 
becomes a party to the proceeding, but in no event later than the date 
the case briefs, under Sec. 355.38 are due.
    (2) The representative must file the request for disclosure on the 
standard form provided by the Secretary (Form ITA-367). The standard 
form will require only such particularity in the description of the 
requested information as is consistent with both the criteria the 
Secretary uses to decide whether to disclose, and with the fact that a 
request may be made for factual information not yet submitted.
    (3) The request shall obligate the representative:
    (i) Not to disclose the proprietary information to anyone other than 
the submitter and other persons authorized by an administrative 
protective order to have access to the information;
    (ii) To use the information solely for the segment of the proceeding 
in which it was submitted;
    (iii) To ensure the security of the proprietary information at all 
times; and
    (iv) To report promptly to the Secretary any apparent violation of 
the terms of the protective order.
    (4) The request shall contain an acknowledgement by the 
representative that:
    (i) A representative determined to have violated a protective order 
may be subject to any or all of the sanctions listed in part 354 of this 
title; and
    (ii) The firm of which a person determined to have violated a 
protective order is a partner, associate, or employee, and any partner, 
associate, employer, or employee of such person, may be subject to any 
or all of the sanctions listed in part 354 of this title.
    (5) The Secretary will decide whether to disclose information under 
administrative protective order:
    (i) Not later than 14 days after the date on which the information 
is submitted; or
    (ii) If--
    (A) The person who submitted the information raises objection to its 
release, or
    (B) The information is unusually voluminous or complex,

not later than 30 days after the date on which the information is 
submitted.
    (6) If the Secretary decides that disclosure of information under 
administrative protective order is proper under paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section:
    (i) With respect to proprietary information submitted to the 
Secretary on or before the date of the decision to disclose, the 
submitting party shall, within two business days of the date of 
decision, serve the party which requested such disclosure, in accordance 
with Sec. 355.31(g); and
    (ii) The submitting party shall serve all future submissions of 
proprietary information directly on the requesting party as required by 
Sec. 355.31(g).

[[Page 257]]

(257
    (c) Opportunity to withdraw proprietary information. If the 
Secretary decides to require disclosure of proprietary information under 
administrative protective order without the consent of the submitter, 
the Secretary will provide to the submitter written notice of the 
decision and the reasons therefor and will permit the submitter to 
withdraw the information from the official record within two business 
days. The Secretary will not consider withdrawn information. 
Furthermore, if the submitter does not withdraw the information but 
fails to serve the party requesting such information, in accordance with 
Sec. 355.34(b)(6), the Secretary will not consider such information.
    (d) Disposition of proprietary information disclosed under 
administrative protective order. (1) At the expiration of the time for 
filing for judicial review of a decision by the Secretary, if there is 
no filing by any party to the proceeding, or at an earlier date the 
Secretary decides appropriate, the representative must return or destroy 
all proprietary information released under this section and all other 
materials containing the proprietary information (such as notes or 
memoranda). The representative at that time must certify to the 
Secretary full compliance with the terms of the protective order and the 
return or destruction of all proprietary information.
    (2) The representative of a party to the proceeding that files for 
judicial review or intervenes in the judicial review may retain the 
proprietary information, provided that the party applies for a court 
protective order for the information not later than 15 days after the 
Secretary files the administrative record with the court. If the court 
denies the party's application for a court protective order, the 
representative must return or destroy the proprietary information and 
all other materials containing the proprietary information not later 
than 48 hours after the court's decision and certify to the Secretary as 
provided under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (e) Violation of administrative protective order. The procedures for 
investigating any alleged violation of an administrative protective 
order issued under this section and for imposing sanctions for a 
violation of such order are set forth in part 354 of this title (19 CFR 
part 354).

Sec. 355.35  Ex parte meeting.

    The Secretary will prepare for the official record a written 
memorandum of any ex parte meeting between any person providing factual 
information in connection with a proceeding and the person to whom the 
Secretary has delegated the authority to make the decision in question 
or the person making a final recommendation to that person. The 
memorandum will include the date, time, and place of the meeting, the 
identity and affiliation of all persons present, and a public summary of 
the factual information submitted.

Sec. 355.36  Verification of information.

    (a) In general. (1) The Secretary will verify all factual 
information the Secretary relies on in:
    (i) A final determination under Sec. 355.18(i) or Sec. 355.20;
    (ii) A revocation under Sec. 355.25;
    (iii) The final results of an administrative review under 
Sec. 355.22(c), (h), or (i) if the Secretary decides that good cause for 
verification exists; and
    (iv) The final results of an administrative review under 
Sec. 355.22(c) if:
    (A) An interested party, as defined in paragraph (i)(3), (i)(4), 
(i)(5), or (i)(6) of Sec. 355.2, not later than 120 days after the date 
of publication of the notice of initiation of review, submits a written 
request for verification; and
    (B) The Secretary conducted no verification under this paragraph 
during either of the two immediately preceding administrative reviews.
    (2) If the Secretary decides that, because of the large number of 
producers and exporters included in an investigation or administrative 
review, it is impractical to verify relevant factual information for 
each person, the Secretary may select and verify a sample. The Secretary 
will apply the results of the verification of the sample to all 
producers and exporters included in the investigation or review.
    (b) Notice of verification. In publishing a notice of final 
determination, revocation, or final results of administrative

[[Page 258]]

(258review, the Secretary will report the methods and procedures used to 
verify under this section.
    (c) Procedures for verification. In verifying under this section, 
the Secretary will notify the government of the affected country in 
which verification takes place that employees of the Department will 
visit with producers, exporters, or government agencies in order to 
verify the accuracy and completeness of submitted factual information. 
As part of the verification, employees of the Department will request 
access to all files, records, and personnel of the producers, exporters, 
or the government agencies which the Secretary considers relevant to 
factual information submitted by those persons.

Sec. 355.37  Best information available.

    (a) Use of best information available. The Secretary may use the 
best information available whenever the Secretary:
    (1) Does not receive a complete, accurate, and timely response to 
the Secretary's request for factual information; or
    (2) Is unable to verify, within the time specified, the accuracy and 
completeness of the factual information submitted.
    (b) What is best information available. The best information 
available may include the factual information submitted in support of 
the petition or subsequently submitted by interested parties, as defined 
in paragraph (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of Sec. 355.2. If an 
interested party refuses to provide factual information requested by the 
Secretary or otherwise impedes the proceeding, the Secretary may take 
that into account in determining what is the best information available.

Sec. 355.38  Written argument and hearings.

    (a) Written argument. The Secretary will consider in making the 
final determination under Sec. 355.18(i) or Sec. 355.20 or the final 
results under Sec. 355.22 only written arguments in case or rebuttal 
briefs filed within the time limits in this section. The Secretary will 
not consider or retain in the record of the proceeding any written 
argument, unless requested by the Secretary (and received within the 
time limit specified by the Secretary), that is submitted after the time 
limits specified in this section. At any time during the proceeding, the 
Secretary may request written argument on any issue from any interested 
party or United States Government agency. The Secretary will return to 
the submitter, with written notice stating the reasons for return of the 
document, any written argument submitted after the time limits specified

limit, any interested party may request that the Secretary hold a public 
hearing on arguments to be raised in case or rebuttal briefs. To the 
extent practicable, a party requesting a hearing shall identify 
arguments to be raised at the hearing. At the hearing, an interested 
party may make an affirmative presentation only on arguments included in 
that party's case brief and may make a rebuttal presentation only on 
arguments included in that party's rebuttal brief.
    (c) Case brief. (1) Any interested party or U.S. Government agency 
may submit a ``case brief'':
    (i) Not later than 50 days after the date of publication of the 
Secretary's preliminary determination in an investigation, unless the 
Secretary alters this time limit; or
    (ii) Not later than 30 days after the date of publication of the 
preliminary results of administrative review.
    (2) The case brief shall separately present in full all arguments 
that continue in the submitter's view to be relevant to the Secretary's 
final determination or final results, including any arguments presented 
before the date of publication of the preliminary determination or 
preliminary results.
    (d) Rebuttal brief. Not later than the time limit stated in the 
notice of the Secretary's preliminary determination or preliminary 
results, ordinarily five days in an investigation and seven days in an 
administrative review after the time limit for filing the case brief, 
any interested party or U.S. Government

[[Page 259]]

(259agency may submit a ``rebuttal brief.'' The rebuttal brief shall 
separately present in full all rebuttal arguments, responding only to 
arguments raised in case briefs.
    (e) Service of briefs. The submitter of either a case or rebuttal 
brief shall serve a copy of that brief on the government of the affected 
country, on any interested party on the Department's service list, and 
on any U.S. Government agency that has submitted in the segment of the 
proceeding a case or rebuttal brief. If the party has designated under 
Sec. 355.31(h) an agent in the United States, service shall be either by 
personal service on the same day the brief is filed with the Secretary 
or by overnight mail or courier on the next day and, if the party has 
designated an agent outside the United States, service shall be by first 
class airmail. The submitter shall attach to each brief a certificate of 
service listing the parties (including agents) served and, for each, the 
date and method of service.
    (f) Hearings. If an interested party submits a request under 
paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will hold a public hearing 
on the date stated in the notice of the Secretary's preliminary 
determination or preliminary results of administrative review, unless 
the Secretary alters the date. Ordinarily, the hearing will be held, in 
an investigation, two days after the scheduled date for submission of 
rebuttal briefs and, in an administrative review, seven days after the 
scheduled date for submission of rebuttal briefs.
    (1) The Secretary will place a verbatim transcript of the hearing in 
the public and official records of the proceeding and will announce at 
the hearing how interested parties may obtain copies of the transcript.
    (2) One of the following employees of the Department will chair the 
hearing: the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Investigations, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Compliance, or the office or division director responsible for the 
proceeding.
    (3) The hearing is not subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Witness testimony, if any, shall not be under oath or subject to cross-
examination by another interested party or witness. During the hearing, 
the chair may question any interested party or witness and may request 
interested parties to present additional written argument.
    (g) Where to file; time of filing. The requirements in 
Sec. 355.31(d) apply to this section.
    (h) Format and number of copies. The requirements in Sec. 355.31(e) 
apply to this section, except that in an administrative review submit 10 
copies of each brief and five copies of the public version, including 
the public summary required under Sec. 355.32(b).
    (i) Public comment on information. In any investigation or review 
under this part, the Secretary will specify a date on which the 
Secretary will cease collecting information and on which the Secretary 
will release to parties that have participated in the investigation or 
review all information on which the parties have not previously had an 
opportunity to comment. Any such information that is business 
proprietary information will be released to persons authorized to obtain 
such information pursuant to Sec. 355.34. Parties shall have an 
opportunity to file written comments on any information released to 
them, and the date on which such comments must be filed will be 
specified by the Secretary. The Secretary will disregard comments 
containing new factual information.

Sec. 355.39  Subsidy practice discovered during investigation or review.

    (a) Inclusion in proceeding. If during an investigation or an 
administrative review the Secretary discovers a practice which appears 
to provide a subsidy with respect to the merchandise and the practice 
was not alleged or examined in the proceeding, the Secretary will 
examine the practice if the Secretary concludes that sufficient time 
remains before the scheduled date for the Secretary's final 
determination or final results of review.
    (b) Deferral of examination. If the Secretary concludes that 
insufficient time remains, before the scheduled date for

[[Page 260]]

(260the Secretary's final determination or final results of review, to 
examine the practice described in paragraph (a) of this section, the 
Secretary will:
    (1) During an investigation, allow the petitioner to withdraw the 
petition without prejudice and resubmit it with an allegation with 
regard to the newly discovered practice; or
    (2) During an investigation or review, defer consideration of the 
newly discovered practice until the next review under Sec. 355.22(c).
    (c) Notice. The Secretary will notify the parties to the proceeding 
of any practice the Secretary discovered and whether or not it will be 
included in the then ongoing proceeding.

Sec. 355.40  Likelihood of continued subsidization; revocation under 
          section 753 of the Act.

request that reviews of outstanding antidumping orders or findings and 
countervailing duty orders under section 751(c) of the Act involving the 
same or comparable merchandise be expedited.
    (3) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``domestic 
interested parties'' means interested parties described in paragraphs

Customs Service to suspend liquidation with respect to entries of 
subject merchandise made on or after:

[[Page 276]]

Sec. 356.14  Report of violation and investigation.

    (a) An employee of the Department or any other person who has 
information indicating that the terms of a protective order or a 
disclosure undertaking have been violated will provide the information 
to a Director or the Chief Counsel.
    (b) Upon receiving information which indicates that a person may

violation of a protective order or a disclosure undertaking, and who was 
responsible for the violation, if any. For purposes of this subpart, the 
Director will be supervised by the Deputy Under Secretary with guidance 
from the Chief Counsel. The Director will conduct an investigation only 
if the information is received within 30 days after the alleged

discovered through the exercise of reasonable and ordinary care.
    (c) The Director will provide a report of the investigation to the 
Deputy Under Secretary, after review by the Chief Counsel, no later than 
180 days after receiving information concerning a violation. Upon the

Director as reasonable cause to believe a person has violated a 
protective order within the meaning of Sec. 356.15.

access to that information by protective order, including an official of 
the Department or member of the Secretariat staff not directly involved

employer) to sign and date a copy of that protective order.
    (3) Loss of proprietary information.
    (4) Failure to return or destroy all copies of the original

in the protective order.
    (5) Failure to delete proprietary information from the public 
version of a brief or other correspondence filed with the Secretariat.
    (6) Disclosure of proprietary information during a public hearing.

Sec. 356.15  Initiation of proceedings.

    (a) If the Deputy Under Secretary concludes, after an investigation 
and report by the Director under Sec. 356.14(c) and consultation with 
the Chief Counsel, that there is reasonable cause to believe that a 
person has violated a protective order or a disclosure undertaking and 
that sanctions are appropriate for the violation, the Deputy Under 
Secretary will, at the Deputy Under Secretary's discretion, either 
initiate a proceeding under this subpart by issuing a charging letter as 
set forth in Sec. 356.16 or request that the authorized agency of the 
involved FTA country initiate a proceeding by issuing a request to 
charge as set forth in Sec. 356.17. In determining whether sanctions are 
appropriate and, if so, what sanctions to impose, the Deputy Under 
Secretary will consider the nature of

the violation, the resulting harm, and other relevant circumstances of 
the case. The Deputy Under Secretary will decide whether to initiate a 
proceeding no later than 60 days after receiving a report of the 
investigation.
    (b) If the Department receives a request to charge from an 
authorized agency of a FTA country, the Deputy Under Secretary will 
promptly initiate proceedings under this part by issuing a charging 
letter as set forth in Sec. 356.16.

Sec. 356.16  Charging letter.

    (a) Contents of letter. The Deputy Under Secretary will initiate 
proceedings by issuing a charging letter to each charged party and 
affected party which includes:
    (1) A statement of the allegation that a protective order or a 
disclosure undertaking has been violated and the basis thereof;
    (2) A statement of the proposed sanctions;
    (3) A statement that the charged or affected party is entitled to 
review the documents or other physical evidence upon which the charge is 
based and the method for requesting access to, or copies of, such 
documents;
    (4) A statement that the charged or affected party is entitled to a 
hearing before an administrative law judge if requested within 30 days 
of the date of service of the charging letter and the procedure for 
requesting a hearing, including the name, address, and telephone number 
of the person to contact if there are further questions;
    (5) A statement that the charged or affected party has a right, if a 
hearing is not requested, to submit documentary evidence to the Deputy 
Under Secretary and an explanation of the method for submitting evidence 
and the date by which it must be received; and
    (6) A statement that the charged or affected party has a right to 
retain counsel at the party's own expense for purposes of 
representation.
    (b) Settlement and amendment of the charging letter. The Deputy 
Under Secretary may amend, supplement, or withdraw the charging letter 
at any time with the approval of an administrative law judge if the 
interests of justice would thereby be served. If a hearing has not been 
requested, the Deputy Under Secretary will ask the Under Secretary to 
appoint an administrative law judge to make this determination. If a 
charging letter is withdrawn after a request for a hearing, the 
administrative law judge will determine whether the withdrawal will bar 
the Deputy Under Secretary from seeking sanctions at a later date for 
the same alleged violation. If there has been no request for a hearing, 
or if supporting information has not been submitted under Sec. 356.28, 
the withdrawal will not bar future actions on the same alleged 
violation. The Deputy Under Secretary and a charged or affected party 
may settle a charge brought under this subpart by mutual agreement at 
any time after service of the charging letter; approval of the 
administrative law judge or the APO Sanctions Board is not necessary.
    (c) Service of charging letter on a resident of the United States. 
(1) Service of a charging letter on a United States resident will be 
made by:
    (i) Mailing a copy by registered or certified mail addressed to the 
charged or affected party at the party's last known address;
    (ii) Leaving a copy with the charged or affected party or with an 
officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by 
appointment or by law to receive service for the party; or
    (iii) Leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion 
who resides at the party's last known dwelling.
    (2) Service made in the manner described in paragraph (c)(1) (ii) or 
(iii) of this section shall be evidenced by a certificate of service 
signed by the person making such service, stating the method of service 
and the identity of the person with whom the charging letter was left.
    (d) Service of charging letter on a non-resident. If applicable laws 
or intergovernmental agreements or understandings make the methods of 
service set forth in paragraph (c) of this section inappropriate or 
ineffective, service of the charging letter on a person who is not a 
resident of the United States may be made by any method that is 
permitted by the country in which the person resides and that, in the 
opinion

[[Page 278]]

of the Deputy Under Secretary, satisfies due process requirements under 
United States law with respect to notice in administrative proceedings.

Sec. 356.17  Request to charge.

    Upon deciding to initiate a proceeding pursuant to Sec. 356.15, the 
Deputy Under Secretary will request the authorized agency of the 
involved FTA country to initiate a proceeding for imposing sanctions for 
violation of a protective order or a disclosure undertaking by issuing a 
letter of request to charge that includes a statement of the allegation 
that a protective order or a disclosure undertaking has been violated 
and the basis thereof.

Sec. 356.18  Interim sanctions.

    (a) If the Deputy Under Secretary concludes, after issuing a 
charging letter under Sec. 356.16 and before a final decision is 
rendered, that interim sanctions are necessary to protect the interests 
of the Department, an authorized agency of the involved FTA country, or 
others, including the protection of proprietary information, the Deputy 
Under Secretary may petition an administrative law judge to impose such 
sanctions.
    (b) The administrative law judge may impose interim sanctions 
against a person upon determining that:
    (1) There is probable cause to believe that there was a violation of 
a protective order or a disclosure undertaking and the Department is 
likely to prevail in obtaining sanctions under this subpart;
    (2) The Department, authorized agency of the involved FTA country, 
or others are likely to suffer irreparable harm if the interim sanctions 
are not imposed; and
    (3) The interim sanctions are a reasonable means for protecting the 
rights of the Department, authorized agency of the involved FTA country, 
or others while preserving to the greatest extent possible the rights of 
the person against whom the interim sanctions are proposed.
    (c) Interim sanctions which may be imposed include any sanctions 
that are necessary to protect the rights of the Department, authorized 
agency of the involved FTA country, or others, including, but not 
limited to:
    (1) Denying a person further access to proprietary information;
    (2) Barring a person from representing another person before the 
Department;
    (3) Barring a person from appearing before the Department; and
    (4) Requiring the person to return material previously provided by 
the Department or the investigating authority of the involved FTA 
country, and all other materials containing the proprietary information, 
such as briefs, notes, or charts based on any such information received 
under a protective order or disclosure undertaking.
    (d) The Deputy Under Secretary will notify the person against whom 
interim sanctions are sought of the request for interim sanctions and 
provide to that person the material submitted to the administrative law 
judge to support the request. The notice will include a reference to the 
procedures of this section.
    (e) A person against whom interim sanctions are proposed has a right 
to oppose the request through submission of material to the 
administrative law judge. The administrative law judge has discretion to 
permit oral presentations and to allow further submissions.
    (f) The administrative law judge will notify the parties of the 
decision on interim sanctions and the basis therefor within five days of 
the conclusion of oral presentations or the date of final written 
submissions.
    (g) If interim sanctions have been imposed, the investigation and 
any proceedings under this subpart will be conducted on an expedited 
basis.
    (h) An order imposing interim sanctions may be revoked at any time 
by the administrative law judge and expires automatically upon the 
issuance of a final order.
    (i) The administrative law judge may reconsider imposition of 
interim sanctions on the basis of new and material evidence or other 
good cause shown. The Deputy Under Secretary or a person against whom 
interim sanctions have been imposed may appeal a decision on interim 
sanctions to the APO Sanctions Board, if such an appeal is

[[Page 279]]

certified by the administrative law judge as necessary to prevent undue 
harm to the Department or authorized agency of the involved FTA country, 
a person against whom interim sanctions have been imposed or others, or 
is otherwise in the interests of justice. Interim sanctions which have 
been imposed remain in effect while an appeal is pending, unless the 
administrative law judge determines otherwise.
    (j) The Deputy Under Secretary may request an administrative law 
judge to impose emergency interim sanctions to preserve the status quo. 
Emergency interim sanctions may last no longer than 48 hours, excluding 
weekends and holidays. The person against whom such emergency interim 
sanctions are proposed need not be given prior notice or an opportunity 
to oppose the request for sanctions. The administrative law judge may 
impose emergency interim sanctions upon determining that the Department 
or authorized agency of the involved FTA country is, or others are, 
likely to suffer irreparable harm if such sanctions are not imposed and 
that the interests of justice would thereby be served. The 
administrative law judge will promptly notify a person against whom 
emergency sanctions have been imposed of the sanctions and their 
duration.
    (k) If a hearing has not been requested, the Deputy Under Secretary 
will request that the Under Secretary appoint an administrative law 
judge for making determinations under this section.
    (l) The Deputy Under Secretary will notify the Secretariat 
concerning the imposition or revocation of interim sanctions or 
emergency interim sanctions.

Sec. 356.19  Request for a hearing.

    (a) Any party may request a hearing by submitting a written request 
to the Under Secretary within 30 days after the date of service of the 
charging letter. However, the Deputy Under Secretary may request a 
hearing only if the interests of justice would thereby be served.
    (b) Upon timely receipt of a request for a hearing, the Under 
Secretary will appoint an administrative law judge to conduct the 
hearing and render an initial decision.

Sec. 356.20  Discovery.

    (a) Voluntary discovery. All parties are encouraged to engage in 
voluntary discovery procedures regarding any matter, not privileged, 
which is relevant to the subject matter of the pending sanctions 
proceeding.
    (b) Limitations on discovery. The administrative law judge shall 
place such limits upon the kind or amount of discovery to be had or the 
period of time during which discovery may be carried out as shall be 
consistent with the time limitations set forth in this Part.
    (c) Interrogatories and requests for admissions or production of 
documents. A party may serve on any other party interrogatories, 
requests for admissions, or requests for production of documents for 
inspection and copying, and the party may then apply to the 
administrative law judge for such enforcement or protective order as 
that party deems warranted concerning such discovery. The party will 
serve a discovery request at least 20 days before the scheduled date of 
a hearing, if a hearing has been requested and scheduled, unless the 
administrative law judge specifies a shorter time period. Copies of 
interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production of 
documents and responses thereto will be served on all parties. Matters 
of fact or law of which admission is requested will be deemed admitted 
unless, within a period designated in the request (at least 10 days 
after the date of service of the request, or within such further time as 
the administrative law judge may allow), the party to whom the request 
is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either 
admitting or denying specifically the matters of which admission is 
requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party cannot 
truthfully either admit or deny such matters.
    (d) Depositions. Upon application of a party and for good cause 
shown, the administrative law judge may order the taking of the 
testimony of any person who is a party, or under the control or 
authority of a party, by deposition and the production of specified 
documents

[[Page 280]]

or materials by the person at the deposition. The application shall 
state the purpose of the deposition and shall set forth the facts sought 
to be established through the deposition.
    (e) Supplementation of responses. A party who has responded to a 
request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is 
under no duty to supplement the party's response to include information 
thereafter acquired, except as follows:
    (1) A party is under a duty to seasonably supplement the party's 
response with respect to any question directly addressed to:
    (i) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of 
discoverable matters; and
    (ii) The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert 
witness at a hearing, the subject matter on which the witness is 
expected to testify, and the substance of the testimony.
    (2) A party is under a duty to seasonably amend a prior response if 
the party obtains information upon the basis of which the party:
    (i) Knows the response was incorrect when made; or
    (ii) Knows that the response, though correct when made, is no longer 
true, and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the 
response is in substance a knowing concealment.
    (3) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the 
administrative law judge, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior 
to a hearing through new requests for supplementation of prior 
responses.
    (f) Enforcement. The administrative law judge may order a party to 
answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or items, or 
to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a 
party does not comply with such an order, the administrative law judge 
may make any determination or enter any order in the proceedings as the 
administrative law judge deems reasonable and appropriate. The 
administrative law judge may strike related charges or defenses in whole 
or in part, or may take particular facts relating to the discovery 
request to which the party failed or refused to respond as being 
established for purpose of the proceeding in accordance with the 
contentions of the party seeking discovery. In issuing a discovery 
order, the administrative law judge will consider the necessity to 
protect proprietary information and will not order the release of 
information in circumstances where it is reasonable to conclude that 
such release will lead to unauthorized dissemination of such 
information.

Sec. 356.21  Subpoenas.

    (a) Application for issuance of a subpoena. An application for 
issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear and depose or 
testify at the taking of a deposition or at a hearing shall be made to 
the administrative law judge. An application for issuance of a subpoena 
requiring a person to appear and depose or testify and to produce 
specified documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits at the 
taking of a deposition, at a prehearing conference, at a hearing, or 
under any other circumstances, shall be made in writing to the 
administrative law judge and shall specify the material to be produced 
as precisely as possible, showing the general relevancy of the material 
and the reasonableness of the scope of the subpoena.
    (b) Use of subpoena for discovery. Subpoenas may be used by any 
party for purposes of discovery or for obtaining documents, papers, 
books, or other physical exhibits for use in evidence, or for both 
purposes. When used for discovery purposes, a subpoena may require a 
person to produce and permit the inspection and copying of nonprivileged 
documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits which constitute or 
contain evidence relevant to the subject matter involved and which are 
in the possession, custody, or control of such person.
    (c) Application for subpoenas for nonparty department records or 
personnel or for records or personnel of other Government agencies. (1) 
An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring the production of 
nonparty documents, papers, books, physical exhibits, or other material 
in the records of the Department, or requiring the appearance of an 
official or employee of the Department, or requiring the production of

[[Page 281]]

records or personnel of other Government agencies shall specify as 
precisely as possible the material to be produced, the nature of the 
information to be disclosed, or the expected testimony of the official 
or employee, and shall contain a statement showing the general relevancy 
of the material, information, or testimony and the reasonableness of the 
scope of the application, together with a showing that such material, 
information, or testimony or their substantial equivalent could not be 
obtained without undue hardship by alternative means.
    (2) Such applications shall be ruled upon by the administrative law 
judge. To the extent that the motion is granted, the administrative law 
judge shall provide such terms and conditions for the production of the 
material, the disclosure of the information, or the appearance of the 
official or employee as may appear necessary and appropriate for the 
protection of the public interest.
    (3) No application for a subpoena for production of documents 
grounded upon the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) shall be 
entertained by the administrative law judge.
    (d) Motion to limit or quash. Any motion to limit or quash a 
subpoena shall be filed within 10 days after service thereof, or within 
such other time as the administrative law judge may allow.
    (e) Ex parte rulings on applications for subpoenas. Applications for 
the issuance of subpoenas pursuant to this section may be made ex parte, 
and, if so made, such applications and rulings thereon shall remain ex 
parte unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge.
    (f) Role of the Under Secretary. If a hearing has not been 
requested, the party seeking enforcement will ask the Under Secretary to 
appoint an administrative law judge to rule on applications for issuance 
of a subpoena under this section.

Sec. 356.22  Prehearing conference.

    (a)(1) If an administrative hearing has been requested, the 
administrative law judge will direct the parties to attend a prehearing 
conference to consider:
    (i) Simplification of issues;
    (ii) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid 
unnecessary proof;
    (iii) Settlement of the matter;
    (iv) Discovery; and
    (v) Such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the 
proceedings.
    (2) Any relevant and significant stipulations or admissions will be 
incorporated into the initial decision.
    (b) If a prehearing conference is impractical, the administrative 
law judge will direct the parties to correspond with each other or to 
confer by telephone or otherwise to achieve the purposes of such a 
conference.

Sec. 356.23  Hearing.

    (a) Scheduling of hearing. The administrative law judge will 
schedule the hearing at a reasonable time, date, and place, which will 
be in Washington, DC, unless the administrative law judge determines 
otherwise based upon good cause shown, that another location would 
better serve the interests of justice. In setting the date, the 
administrative law judge will give due regard to the need for the 
parties adequately to prepare for the hearing and the importance of 
expeditiously resolving the matter.
    (b) Joinder or consolidation. The administrative law judge may order 
joinder or consolidation if sanctions are proposed against more than one 
party or if violations of more than one protective order or disclosure 
undertaking are alleged if to do so would expedite processing of the 
cases and not adversely affect the interests of the parties.
    (c) Hearing procedures. Hearings will be conducted in a fair and 
impartial manner by the administrative law judge, who may limit 
attendance at any hearing or portion thereof if necessary or advisable 
in order to protect proprietary information from improper disclosure. 
The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law shall not apply, and 
all evidentiary material the administrative law judge determines to be 
relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious may 
be received into evidence and

[[Page 282]]

given appropriate weight. The administrative law judge may make such 
orders and determinations regarding the admissibility of evidence, 
conduct of examination and cross-examination, and similar matters as are 
necessary or appropriate to ensure orderliness in the proceedings. The 
administrative law judge will ensure that a record of the hearing will 
be taken by reporter or by electronic recording, and will order such 
part of the record to be sealed as is necessary to protect proprietary 
information.
    (d) Rights of parties. At a hearing each party shall have the right 
to:
    (1) Introduce and examine witnesses and submit physical evidence;
    (2) Confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses;
    (3) Present oral argument; and
    (4) Receive a transcript or recording of the proceedings, upon 
request, subject to the administrative law judge's orders regarding 
sealing the record.
    (e) Representation. Each charged or affected party has a right to 
represent himself or herself or to retain private counsel for that 
purpose. The Chief Counsel will represent the Department, unless the 
General Counsel of the Department determines otherwise. The 
administrative law judge may disallow a representative if such 
representation constitutes a conflict of interest or is otherwise not in 
the interests of justice and may debar a representative for contumacious 
conduct relating to the proceedings.
    (f) Ex parte communications. The parties and their representatives 
may not make any ex parte communications to the administrative law judge 
concerning the merits of the allegations or any matters at issue, except 
as provided in Sec. 356.18(j) regarding emergency interim sanctions.

Sec. 356.24  Proceeding without a hearing.

    If no party has requested a hearing, the Deputy Under Secretary, 
within 40 days after the date of service of a charging letter, will 
submit for inclusion into the record and provide each charged or 
affected party information supporting the allegations in the charging 
letter. Each charged or affected party has the right to file a written 
response to the information and supporting documentation within 30 days 
after the date of service of the information provided by the Deputy 
Under Secretary unless the Deputy Under Secretary alters the time period 
for good cause. The Deputy Under Secretary may allow the parties to 
submit further information and argument.

Sec. 356.25  Witnesses.

    Witnesses summoned before the Department shall be paid the same fees 
and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.

Sec. 356.26  Initial decision.

    (a) Initial decision. The administrative law judge, if a hearing was 
requested, or the Deputy Under Secretary will submit an initial decision 
to the APO Sanctions Board, providing copies to the parties. The 
administrative law judge or the Deputy Under Secretary will ordinarily 
issue the decision within 20 days of the conclusion of the hearing, if 
one was held, or within 15 days of the date of service of final written 
submissions. The initial decision will be based solely on evidence 
received into the record and the pleadings of the parties.
    (b) Findings and conclusions. The initial decision will state 
findings and conclusions as to whether a person has violated a 
protective order or a disclosure undertaking; the basis for those 
findings and conclusions; and whether the sanctions proposed in the 
charging letter, or lesser included sanctions, should be imposed against 
the charged or affected party. The administrative law judge or the 
Deputy Under Secretary may impose sanctions only upon determining that 
the preponderance of the evidence supports a finding of violation of a 
protective order or a disclosure undertaking and that the sanctions are 
warranted against the charged or affected party.
    (c) Finality of decision. If the APO Sanctions Board has not issued 
a decision on the matter within 60 days after issuance of the initial 
decision, the initial decision becomes the final decision of the 
Department.

Sec. 356.27  Final decision.

    (a) APO Sanctions Board. Upon request of a party, the initial 
decision

[[Page 283]]

will be reviewed by the members of the APO Sanctions Board. The Board 
consists of the Under Secretary for International Trade, who shall serve 
as Chairperson, the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, and the 
General Counsel.
    (b) Comments on initial decision. Within 30 days after issuance of 
the initial decision, a party may submit written comments to the APO 
Sanctions Board on the initial decision, which the Board will consider 
when reviewing the initial decision. The parties have no right to an 
oral presentation, although the Board may allow oral argument in its 
discretion.
    (c) Final decision by the APO Sanctions Board. Within 60 days but 
not sooner than 30 days after issuance of an initial decision, the APO 
Sanctions Board may issue a final decision which adopts the initial 
decision in its entirety; differs in whole or in part from the initial 
decision, including the imposition of lesser included sanctions; or 
remands the matter to the administrative law judge or the Deputy Under 
Secretary for further consideration. The only sanctions that the Board 
can impose are those sanctions proposed in the charging letter or lesser 
included sanctions.
    (d) Content's of final decision. If the final decision of the APO 
Sanctions Board does not remand the matter and differs from the initial 
decision, it will state findings and conclusions which differ from the 
initial decision, if any, the basis for those findings and conclusions, 
and the sanctions which are to be imposed, to the extent they differ 
from the sanctions in the initial decision.
    (e) Public notice of sanctions. If the final decision is that there 
has been a violation of a protective order or a disclosure undertaking 
and that sanctions are to be imposed, notice of the decision will be 
published in the Federal Register and forwarded to the United States 
section of the Secretariat. Such publication will be no sooner than 30 
days after issuance of a final decision or after a motion to reconsider 
has been denied, if such a motion was filed. If the final decision is 
made in a proceeding based upon a request to charge by an authorized 
agency of an FTA country, the decision will be forwarded to the 
Secretariat of the involved FTA country for transmittal to the 
authorized agency of the FTA country for publication in the official 
publication or other appropriate action. The Deputy Under Secretary will 
also provide such information to the ethics panel or other disciplinary 
body of the appropriate bar associations or other professional 
associations whenever the Deputy Under Secretary subjects a charged or 
affected party to a sanction under Sec. 356.12(a)(2) and to any Federal 
agency likely to have an interest in the matter and will cooperate in 
any disciplinary actions by any association or agency.

Sec. 356.28  Reconsideration.

    Any party may file a motion for reconsideration with the APO 
Sanctions Board. The party must state with particularity the grounds for 
the motion, including any facts or points of law which the party claims 
the APO Sanctions Board has overlooked or misapplied. The party may file 
the motion within 30 days of the issuance of the final decision or the 
adoption of the initial decision as the final decision, except that if 
the motion is based on the discovery of new and material evidence which 
was not known, and could not reasonably have been discovered through due 
diligence prior to the close of the record, the party shall file the 
motion within 15 days of the discovery of the new and material evidence. 
The party shall provide a copy of the motion to all other parties. 
Opposing parties may file a response within 30 days of the date of 
service of the motion. The response shall be considered as part of the 
record. The parties have no right to an oral presentation on a motion 
for reconsideration, but the Board may permit oral argument at its 
discretion. If the motion to reconsider is granted, the Board will 
review the record and affirm, modify, or reverse the original decision 
or remand the matter for further consideration to an administrative law 
judge or the Deputy Under Secretary, as warranted.

Sec. 356.29  Confidentiality.

    (a) All proceedings involving allegations of a violation of a 
protective order or a disclosure undertaking shall

[[Page 284]]

be kept confidential until such time as the Department makes a final 
decision under these regulations, which is no longer subject to 
reconsideration, imposing a sanction.
    (b) The charged party or counsel for the charged party will be, to 
the extent possible, granted access to proprietary information in these 
proceedings, as necessary, under administrative protective order, 
consistent with the provisions of Sec. 356.10.

Sec. 356.30  Sanctions for violations of a protective order for 
          privileged information.

    The provisions of this subpart shall apply to persons who are 
alleged to have violated a Protective Order for Privileged Information.

Implementation Act, Pub. L. No. 101-221, 103 Stat. 1886 (1989).

    Source: 55 FR 1349, Jan. 12, 1990, unless otherwise noted:

Sec. 357.101   Definitions.

    (a) Arrangement means an arrangement between the United States 
Government and a foreign government whereby the foreign government 
agrees to restrain voluntarily certain steel exports to, or destined for 
consumption in, the United States for the period of October 1, 1989, 
through March 31, 1992.
    (b) Aberration means a domestic price which is out of the ordinary 
and present course of normal pricing trends.
    (c) Interested party means (1) A U.S. producer or consumer of the 
product; (2) a U.S. importer/distributor of the product; or (3) a 
foreign producer of the product (through its government, if such 
government is a party to the arrangement under which a short supply 
allowance is requested).
    (d) Prevailing domestic market prices means current prices in the 
United States market for domestically produced and imported product, as 
reflected in actual purchases and sales (but does not include import 
prices which the Secretary decides are likely to be significantly 
affected by dumping or subsidy practices).
    (e) The product means the steel product for which a short supply 
allowance is requested or material that possesses the same physical and 
mechanical characteristics, and which can be used for the same 
applications without imposing any significant retooling costs on the 
consumer.
    (f) The Secretary means the Secretary of Commerce and the person to 
whom the authority to make the short supply determination has been 
delegated (the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration) or the 
person making a final recommendation for decision to that person (the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.)
    (g) Short supply exists for a product when there is not a sufficient 
supply of that product available to meet market demand in the United 
States. In determining whether short supply exists, the Secretary will 
not consider one factor alone to be dispositive, but will consider all 
relevant factors, including:
    (1) To the extent information is available, the recent levels of 
capacity utilization for domestic facilities producing the product or 
product sector;
    (2) The quantity of additional imports of the product requested by 
the petitioner and the ability of domestic producers to supply the 
product in such quantity;
    (3) The willingness of the producers of the product to supply the 
product at a price that is not an aberration from prevailing domestic 
market prices;
    (4) Reasonable specifications requested by the purchaser or any end 
user, such as metallurgical, dimensional, quality, service requirements, 
and supply only by a qualified supplier

[[Page 285]]

if such qualification is required by the purchaser's customers, and
    (5) Delivery times to the purchaser and to end users of the product.
    (h) A short supply allowance means an authorization to import into 
the United States a quantity of the product in excess of the aggregate 
quantitative import limitation under an arrangement.

Sec. 357.102   Short supply allowances.

    (a) The Secretary will authorize a short supply allowance if:
    (1) The product is covered by an arrangement that provides for the 
authorization of a short supply allowance;
    (2) An adequate petition is filed with the Secretary requesting a 
short supply allowance with respect to the product; and
    (3) The Secretary determines that short supply exists with respect 
to the product.

The Secretary's short supply determination will be based only on 
information included in the official record. Any determination by the 
Secretary that is found to be based on inaccurate information will be 
reconsidered immediately.
    (b) Address and submit petitions and all other documents concerning 
a short supply review (accompanied by four copies) to the Secretary of 
Commerce, Attention: Import Administration, Room 7866, U.S. Department 
of Commerce, Pennsylvania Avenue and 14th Street NW., Washington, DC 
20230. All documents submitted must reference the name or number of the 
particular short supply review.
    (c) The Secretary generally will consider petitions for short supply 
allowances for up to one calendar year. For annual requests for products 
that are produced domestically, but for which the domestic industry has 
minimal available production capacity, the Secretary may grant a short 
supply allowance for less than a full year, if the Secretary believes 
that the situation may be significantly altered prior to the end of one 
year.
    (d) If the Secretary grants only a portion of the short supply 
request, or grants a short supply allowance for less than a full year, 
the petitioner must file a new petition to receive an allowance for any 
subsequent period in the same year. The petitioner must file a new 
petition if it subsequently modifies its request to the extent that the 
modification represents a substantial change in its request.

Sec. 357.103   Petitions for short supply allowances.

    An interested party may file a petition with the Secretary 
requesting a short supply allowance.
    (a) All short supply petitions shall contain, at a minimum, the 
following information:

made, including dimensions, metallurgical specifications, and unique 
characteristics;
    (2) A detailed explanation of how the product will be used;
    (3) An explanation of why the petitioner believes the product is in 
short supply;
    (4) The exact quantity of the short supply allowance requested and 
justification for the tonnage level. If the request is for more than one 
type and size of a product, specific quantity information for each type 
and size. If petitioner's request would represent an increase over 
previous consumption levels, a full explanation for the increase;
    (5) The period of time for which a short supply allowance is 
requested; and
    (6) A certification that the factual information contained in the 
petition is accurate and complete to the best of the petitioner's 
knowledge.
    (b) If the petitioner is a U.S. company that processes the product 
in some manner, the petition shall contain, in addition to the 
information required under paragraph (a), the following information:
    (1) A list of all U.S. and foreign producers of the product that 
have refused to sell the product to the petitioner during the past three 
years, indicating when they were contacted and the reason for their 
refusal;
    (2) A list of all offers to sell the product to the petitioner by 
U.S. and foreign producers in the past three years

[[Page 286]]

that have been rejected by the petitioner, indicating the reasons for 
the rejection;
    (3) A list of all domestic and foreign suppliers from whom the 
petitioner has purchased the product during the past three years, 
including the quantity purchased from each mill during this period;
    (4) A list of potential foreign suppliers of the product; and
    (5) Documentation indicating that petitioner has made efforts to 
purchase the product domestically.
    (c) If the petitioner is a U.S. importer/distributor, the petition 
shall contain, in addition to the information required under paragraph 
(a), the following information:
    (1) A list of all U.S. customers which have purchased the product 
from the petitioner during the past three years, along with 
documentation from these customers demonstrating that they support the 
request and have been unable to buy the product domestically;
    (2) A list of all of petitioner's sales (by quantity) to U.S. 
customers of the product in each of the last three years;
    (3) A list of all domestic and foreign firms that have supplied the 
product to the petitioner during the past three years, with the total 
quantity purchased from each supplier annually.
    (4) A list of potential foreign suppliers of the product;
    (d) If the petitioner is a foreign producer of the product applying 
through its government, the petition shall contain, in addition to the 
information required under paragraph (a), the following information:
    (1) A list of all U.S. customers that have purchased the product 
from the foreign company during the past three years, along with 
documentation from these customers demonstrating that they support the 
petition and have been unable to purchase the product domestically;
    (2) A list of all the foreign company's sales (by quantity) to U.S. 
customers of the product in each of the last three years.

Sec. 357.104  Determination of adequacy of petition, notice of review 
          and opportunity for comment.

    (a) Within 24 hours after a petition is filed, excluding weekends 
and holidays, the Secretary will determine whether the petition is 
adequate.
    (b) If the Secretary determines that the petition is adequate, the 
Secretary promptly will cause to be published in the Federal Register a 
notice that a petition with respect to the product is under review and 
provide interested parties with the opportunity to submit written 
comments on the petition. Comments will be accepted for a period of 
seven days from the date notice of the review of the petition is 
published in the Federal Register. Interested parties may file replies 
to any comments submitted under this section. Any replies must be filed 
with the Secretary within five days after the closing date of the 
comment period. Interested parties shall certify that the factual 
information contained in any submission they make is accurate and 
complete to the best of their knowledge.
    (c) If the Secretary determines that the petition is inadequate, the 
Secretary immediately will return the petition to the petitioner along 
with an explanation of why it is inadequate.

Sec. 357.105  Questionnaires.

    For reviews conducted under section 106(b)(2), the Secretary 
normally will send questionnaires to potential producers/suppliers of 
the product to determine whether it is in short supply. Questionnaires 
shall be completed and delivered to the Secretary within 8 days after 
being sent by the Secretary. Questionnaire responses not received within 
this period will be deemed favorable to the petition.

Sec. 357.106  Time limits.

    (a) The Secretary will determine, no later than the day specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section--
    (1) Whether short supply exists with respect to the product; and
    (2) If short supply is determined to exist, the quantity of the 
short supply allowance.

[[Page 287]]

    (b) The Secretary will make a short supply determination not later 
than--
    (1) The 15th day after the day on which an adequate petition is 
received if--
    (i) A twelve week moving average of raw steel making capacity 
utilization in the United States, as published by the American Iron and 
Steel Institute, equals or exceeds 90 percent, or
    (ii) The Secretary has granted short supply allowances for the 
product during each of the two immediately preceding years. This 
requirement will be satisfied by a full or partial grant of a short 
supply allowance for the product for a one-year period during each of 
the two immediately preceding years, or for a six-month period during 
each of the two immediately preceding years, provided that there was not 
within the two immediately preceding years a formal negative 
determination by the Secretary as to the existence of short supply for 
the product; or
    (iii) The Secretary, on the basis of available information (and 
whether or not in the context of a determination under section 102 of 
this part), finds that the product is not produced in the United States.
    In making a determination with respect to which section 106(b)(1) of 
this part applies, the Secretary will apply a rebuttable presumption 
that the product is in short supply. The burden of proof will lie on a 
domestic steel producer to prove that it can and will produce and supply 
the product within the requested period of time provided it represents a 
normal order to delivery period. Unless such proof is provided, the 
Secretary will issue a short supply allowance within 15 days of receipt 
of an adequate petition.
    (2) In all other circumstances, the Secretary will make a 
determination within 30 days after the day on which an adequate petition 
is received.

Sec. 357.107  Publication of determinations and notification of foreign 
          governments.

    The Secretary will publish in the Federal Register a notice of each 
short supply determination setting forth the basis for that 
determination. If the determination authorizes a short supply allowance, 
the Secretary will notify a representative of the appropriate foreign 
government and issue to the petitioner the necessary documentation to 
permit the importation.

Sec. 357.108  Disclosure of information.

    Promptly after making a short supply determination, the Secretary 
will disclose to each interested party which requests such disclosure 
the rationale for the determination, along with all non-proprietary 
information forming the basis of the determination.

Sec. 357.109  Request for reconsideration.

    Interested parties may file a request for reconsideration with the 
Secretary. The interested party must state with particularity the 
grounds for the request, including any alleged inaccurate information 
upon which the short supply determination was based, or facts or points 
of law which the interested party claims the Secretary has overlooked or 
misapplied. The interested party shall file the request for 
reconsideration within 5 days after the publication of the short supply 
determination in the Federal Register. If the request for 
reconsideration is granted, the Secretary will review and affirm, 
modify, or reverse the original determination and publish such decision 
in the Federal Register.

Sec. 357.110  Record of review.

    (a) The Secretary will maintain in the Import Administration Central 
Records Unit an official record of each short supply review. The 
Secretary will include in the record all relevant factual information, 
written argument, or other material developed or obtained by the 
Secretary during the course of the proceeding. The record will include 
governmental memoranda pertaining to the proceeding, memoranda of ex 
parte meetings, determinations, notices published in the Federal 
Register. The official record will include both public and proprietary 
information.
    (b) Examination and copying of information. In general, all public 
information in the official record will be available for inspection or 
copying at the Import Administration Central Records Unit, Room B-099, 
by any person during business hours. With respect to documents prepared 
by an officer or

[[Page 288]]

employee of the United States Government, facts (as distinguished from 
advice, recommendations, opinions and evaluations) contained in any such 
documents will be made available by summary or otherwise on the same 
basis as information contained in documents submitted by other persons.
    (c) Ex Parte meetings. Written memoranda will be prepared as 
expeditiously as possible of any ex parte meeting between the Secretary 
and any interested party or other person providing factual information 
relating to the short supply determination. A memorandum of an ex parte 
meeting will include the date, time, and place of the meeting, the 
identity of all the persons present, and a non-proprietary summary of 
the matters discussed and/or facts submitted.

Sec. 357.111  Public and proprietary information.

    (a) Any person who submits information in connection with a short 
supply review may designate that information, or any part thereof, as 
proprietary, thereby requesting that the Secretary treat that 
information as proprietary. The Secretary normally will not treat as 
proprietary any information not designated as proprietary by the 
submitter. The submitter must file four copies of a public version of 
the proprietary information, including any public summaries as 
substitutes for the portions for which the person has requested 
proprietary treatment. The submitter must conspicuously mark in the 
upper right corner of both versions, the words ``proprietary document'' 
or ``public version of proprietary document'', as appropriate. Each 
separate designation of information as proprietary shall be accompanied 
by:
    (1) A full statement of the reason or reasons why the submitter 
believes that the information is entitled to proprietary treatment; and
    (2) Either (i) A full public summary or approximated presentation of 
all proprietary information, incorporated in the public version of the 
document (generally data in numerical form relating to prices and costs, 
operating rates, and deliveries of individual firms shall be presented 
in figures ranged within 10 percent of the actual figure); or,
    (ii) A statement that the information is not susceptible to such a 
summary or presentation, accompanied by a full statement of the reasons 
supporting this conclusion.
    (b) Proprietary treatment. The Secretary normally will consider the 
following factual information to be business proprietary, if so 
designated by the submitter:
    (1) Business or trade secrets concerning the nature of a product or 
production process, if unique or not known to the industry;
    (2) Price information;
    (3) Operating rates;
    (4) The names or identifiers of particular customers, distributors, 
or suppliers;
    (5) Normal and current order-to-delivery periods; and
    (6) Any other specific business information which the submitter can 
reasonably demonstrate would be likely to cause substantial harm to the 
submitter's competitive position if released.
    (c) Confidentiality maintained. Information that the Secretary 
designates as proprietary will not be disclosed to any person (other 
than officers or employees of the United States Government who are 
directly concerned with the short supply determination) without the 
consent of the submitter unless disclosure is ordered by a court of 
competent jurisdiction.
    (d) Public information. The Secretary normally will consider the 
following to be public information:
    (1) Factual information and written argument that is not designated 
business proprietary by the submitter;
    (2) Exact tonnages sought or offered for each product included in a 
request, if applicable;
    (3) Physical and mechanical properties of products offered as 
substitutes;
    (4) Product specifications;
    (5) End use(s) to which the product(s) will be put;
    (6) Suppliers contacted, when they were contacted, and the reasons 
they cannot supply the product, and
    (7) Offers by U.S. and foreign producers for the product that have 
been rejected.

[[Page 289]]

    (e) Treatment of information where request for proprietary treatment 
is denied. If the Secretary denies a request for proprietary treatment 
of information submitted in connection with a request for a short supply 
allowance, or determines that information claimed not susceptible to a 
non-proprietary summary is in fact capable of such summary, the 
Secretary promptly will notify the submitter of that determination. 
Unless the submitter thereafter agrees that the information (including 
any summarized or approximated presented thereof) may be treated as 
public information, or provides a summary of matters found to be capable 
of such summary, such information (including any summarized approximated 
presentation thereof) will be returned to the submitter and not 
considered in the short supply determination.
