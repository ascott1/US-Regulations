                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 2006), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

 Subpart ZZZZ_National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
        for Stationary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines

    Source: 69 FR 33506, June 15, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.6580  What is the purpose of subpart ZZZZ?

    Subpart ZZZZ establishes national emission limitations and operating 
limitations for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from stationary 
reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE) located at major 
sources

[[Page 16]]

of HAP emissions. This subpart also establishes requirements to 
demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission 
limitations and operating limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 63.6585  Am I subject to this subpart?

    You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a stationary 
RICE at a major source of HAP emissions, except if the stationary RICE 
is being tested at a stationary RICE test cell/stand.
    (a) A stationary RICE is any internal combustion engine which uses 
reciprocating motion to convert heat energy into mechanical work and 
which is not mobile. Stationary RICE differ from mobile RICE in that a 
stationary RICE is not a non-road engine as defined at 40 CFR 1068.30, 
and is not used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for 
competition.
    (b) A major source of HAP emissions is a plant site that emits or 
has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 
megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 
tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year, except that for oil and gas 
production facilities, a major source of HAP emissions is determined for 
each surface site.


<R05>
Sec. 63.6590  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    This subpart applies to each affected source.
    (a) Affected source. An affected source is any existing, new, or 
reconstructed stationary RICE with a site-rating of more than 500 brake 
horsepower located at a major source of HAP emissions, excluding 
stationary RICE being tested at a stationary RICE test cell/stand.
    (1) Existing stationary RICE. A stationary RICE is existing if you 
commenced construction or reconstruction of the stationary RICE before 
December 19, 2002. A change in ownership of an existing stationary RICE 
does not make that stationary RICE a new or reconstructed stationary 
RICE.
    (2) New stationary RICE. A stationary RICE is new if you commenced 
construction of the stationary RICE on or after December 19, 2002.
    (3) Reconstructed stationary RICE. A stationary RICE is 
reconstructed if you meet the definition of reconstruction in Sec. 63.2 
and reconstruction is commenced on or after December 19, 2002.
    (b) Stationary RICE subject to limited requirements. (1) An affected 
source which meets either of the criteria in paragraph (b)(1)(i) through 
(ii) of this section does not have to meet the requirements of this 
subpart and of subpart A of this part except for the initial 
notification requirements of Sec. 63.6645(d).
    (i) The stationary RICE is a new or reconstructed emergency 
stationary RICE; or
    (ii) The stationary RICE is a new or reconstructed limited use 
stationary RICE.
    (2) A new or reconstructed stationary RICE which combusts landfill 
or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the gross heat input 
on an annual basis must meet the initial notification requirements of 
Sec. 63.6645(d) and the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.6625(c), 
63.6650(g), and 63.6655(c). These stationary RICE do not have to meet 
the emission limitations and operating limitations of this subpart.
    (3) A stationary RICE which is an existing spark ignition 2 stroke 
lean burn (2SLB) stationary RICE, an existing spark ignition 4 stroke 
lean burn (4SLB) stationary RICE, an existing compression ignition (CI) 
stationary RICE, an existing emergency stationary RICE, an existing 
limited use stationary RICE, or an existing stationary RICE that 
combusts landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more 
of the gross heat input on an annual basis, does not have to meet the 
requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part. No initial 
notification is necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 63.6595  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) Affected sources. (1) If you have an existing stationary RICE, 
you must comply with the applicable emission limitations and operating 
limitations no later than June 15, 2007.
    (2) If you start up your new or reconstructed stationary RICE before 
August 16, 2004, you must comply with the applicable emission 
limitations and operating limitations in this subpart no later than 
August 16, 2004.

[[Page 17]]

    (3) If you start up your new or reconstructed stationary RICE after 
August 16, 2004, you must comply with the applicable emission 
limitations and operating limitations in this subpart upon startup of 
your affected source.
    (b) Area sources that become major sources. If you have an area 
source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that 
it becomes a major source of HAP, the compliance dates in paragraphs 
(b)(1) and (2) of this section apply to you.
    (1) Any stationary RICE for which construction or reconstruction is 
commenced after the date when your area source becomes a major source of 
HAP must be in compliance with this subpart upon startup of your 
affected source.
    (2) Any stationary RICE for which construction or reconstruction is 
commenced before your area source becomes a major source of HAP must be 
in compliance with this subpart within 3 years after your area source 
becomes a major source of HAP.
    (c) If you own or operate an affected source, you must meet the 
applicable notification requirements in Sec. 63.6645 and in 40 CFR part 
63, subpart A.

                   Emission and Operating Limitations


<R05>
Sec. 63.6600  What emission limitations and operating limitations
must I meet?

    (a) If you own or operate an existing, new, or reconstructed spark 
ignition 4 stroke rich burn (4SRB) stationary RICE located at a major 
source of HAP emissions, you must comply with the emission limitations 
in Table 1a of this subpart and the operating limitations in Table 1b of 
this subpart which apply to you.
    (b) If you own or operate a new or reconstructed 2SLB or 4SLB 
stationary RICE or a new or reconstructed CI stationary RICE located at 
a major source of HAP emissions, you must comply with the emission 
limitations in Table 2a of this subpart and the operating limitations in 
Table 2b of this subpart which apply to you.
    (c) If you own or operate: An existing 2SLB stationary RICE, an 
existing 4SLB stationary RICE, or an existing CI stationary RICE; a 
stationary RICE that combusts landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 
10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis; an 
emergency stationary RICE; or a limited use stationary RICE, you do not 
need to comply with the emission limitations in Tables 1a and 2a of this 
subpart or operating limitations in Tables 1b and 2b of this subpart.

                     General Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.6605  What are my general requirements for complying with
this subpart?

    (a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitations and 
operating limitations in this subpart that apply to you at all times, 
except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
    (b) If you must comply with emission limitations and operating 
limitations, you must operate and maintain your stationary RICE, 
including air pollution control and monitoring equipment, in a manner 
consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing 
emissions at all times, including during startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction.

               Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.6610  By what date must I conduct the initial performance 
tests or other initial compliance demonstrations?

    (a) You must conduct the initial performance test or other initial 
compliance demonstrations in Table 4 of this subpart that apply to you 
within 180 days after the compliance date that is specified for your 
stationary RICE in Sec. 63.6595 and according to the provisions in 
Sec. 63.7(a)(2).
    (b) If you commenced construction or reconstruction between December 
19, 2002 and June 15, 2004, you must demonstrate initial compliance with 
either the proposed emission limitations or the promulgated emission 
limitations no later than February 10, 2005 or no later than 180 days 
after startup of the source, whichever is later, according to Sec. 
63.7(a)(2)(ix).
    (c) If you commenced construction or reconstruction between December 
19, 2002 and June 15, 2004, and you chose to comply with the proposed 
emission

[[Page 18]]

limitations when demonstrating initial compliance, you must conduct a 
second performance test to demonstrate compliance with the promulgated 
emission limitations by December 13, 2007 or after startup of the 
source, whichever is later, according to Sec. 63.7(a)(2)(ix).
    (d) An owner or operator is not required to conduct an initial 
performance test on units for which a performance test has been 
previously conducted, but the test must meet all of the conditions 
described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) The test must have been conducted using the same methods 
specified in this subpart, and these methods must have been followed 
correctly.
    (2) The test must not be older than 2 years.
    (3) The test must be reviewed and accepted by the Administrator.
    (4) Either no process or equipment changes must have been made since

    (b) Each performance test must be conducted according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.7(e)(1) and under the specific conditions that 
this subpart specifies in Table 4. The test must be conducted at any 
load condition within plus or minus 10 percent of 100 percent load.
    (c) You may not conduct performance tests during periods of startup, 
shutdown, or malfunction, as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(1).
    (d) You must conduct three separate test runs for each performance 
test required in this section, as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(3). Each 
test run must last at least 1 hour.
    (e)(1) You must use Equation 1 of this section to determine 
compliance with the percent reduction requirement:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15JN04.012

Where:

C<INF>i</INF> = concentration of CO or formaldehyde at the control 
device inlet,
C<INF>o</INF> = concentration of CO or formaldehyde at the control 
device outlet, and
R = percent reduction of CO or formaldehyde emissions.

    (2) You must normalize the carbon monoxide (CO) or formaldehyde 
concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the control device to a dry 
basis and to 15 percent oxygen, or an equivalent percent carbon dioxide 
(CO<INF>2</INF>). If pollutant concentrations are to be corrected to 15 
percent oxygen and CO<INF>2</INF> concentration is measured in lieu of 
oxygen concentration measurement, a CO<INF>2</INF> correction factor is 
needed. Calculate the CO<INF>2</INF> correction factor as described in 
paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Calculate the fuel-specific F<INF>o</INF> value for the fuel 
burned during the test using values obtained from Method 19, section 
5.2, and the following equation:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15JN04.013

Where:

F<INF>o</INF> = Fuel factor based on the ratio of oxygen volume to the 
ultimate CO<INF>2</INF> volume produced by the fuel at zero percent 
excess air.
0.209 = Fraction of air that is oxygen, percent/100.
F<INF>d</INF> = Ratio of the volume of dry effluent gas to the gross 
calorific value of the fuel from Method 19, dsm\3\/J (dscf/10\6\ Btu).
F<INF>c</INF> = Ratio of the volume of CO<INF>2</INF> produced to the 
gross calorific value of the fuel from Method 19, dsm\3\/J (dscf/10\6\ 
Btu).

    (ii) Calculate the CO<INF>2</INF> correction factor for correcting 
measurement data to 15 percent oxygen, as follows:

[[Page 19]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15JN04.014

Where:

X<INF>co2</INF> = CO<INF>2</INF> correction factor, percent.
5.9 = 20.9 percent O<INF>2</INF>-15 percent O<INF>2</INF>, the defined 
O<INF>2</INF> correction value, percent.

    (iii) Calculate the NO<INF>X</INF> and SO<INF>2</INF> gas 
concentrations adjusted to 15 percent O<INF>2</INF> using CO<INF>2</INF> 
as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15JN04.015

Where:

%CO<INF>2</INF> = Measured CO<INF>2</INF> concentration measured, dry 
basis, percent.

    (f) If you comply with the emission limitation to reduce CO and you 
are not using an oxidation catalyst, if you comply with the emission 
limitation to reduce formaldehyde and you are not using NSCR, or if you 
comply with the emission limitation to limit the concentration of 
formaldehyde in the stationary RICE exhaust and you are not using an 
oxidation catalyst or NSCR, you must petition the Administrator for 
operating limitations to be established during the initial performance 
test and continuously monitored thereafter; or for approval of no 
operating limitations. You must not conduct the initial performance test 
until after the petition has been approved by the Administrator.
    (g) If you petition the Administrator for approval of operating 
limitations, your petition must include the information described in 
paragraphs (g)(1) through (5) of this section.
    (1) Identification of the specific parameters you propose to use as 
operating limitations;
    (2) A discussion of the relationship between these parameters and 
HAP emissions, identifying how HAP emissions change with changes in 
these parameters, and how limitations on these parameters will serve to 
limit HAP emissions;
    (3) A discussion of how you will establish the upper and/or lower 
values for these parameters which will establish the limits on these 
parameters in the operating limitations;
    (4) A discussion identifying the methods you will use to measure and 
the instruments you will use to monitor these parameters, as well as the 
relative accuracy and precision of these methods and instruments; and
    (5) A discussion identifying the frequency and methods for 
recalibrating the instruments you will use for monitoring these 
parameters.
    (h) If you petition the Administrator for approval of no operating 
limitations, your petition must include the information described in 
paragraphs (h)(1) through (7) of this section.
    (1) Identification of the parameters associated with operation of 
the stationary RICE and any emission control device which could change 
intentionally (e.g., operator adjustment, automatic controller 
adjustment, etc.) or unintentionally (e.g., wear and tear, error, etc.) 
on a routine basis or over time;
    (2) A discussion of the relationship, if any, between changes in the 
parameters and changes in HAP emissions;
    (3) For the parameters which could change in such a way as to 
increase HAP emissions, a discussion of whether establishing limitations 
on the parameters would serve to limit HAP emissions;
    (4) For the parameters which could change in such a way as to 
increase HAP emissions, a discussion of how you could establish upper 
and/or lower values for the parameters which would establish limits on 
the parameters in operating limitations;
    (5) For the parameters, a discussion identifying the methods you 
could use to measure them and the instruments you could use to monitor 
them, as well as the relative accuracy and precision of the methods and 
instruments;
    (6) For the parameters, a discussion identifying the frequency and 
methods for recalibrating the instruments you could use to monitor them; 
and
    (7) A discussion of why, from your point of view, it is infeasible 
or unreasonable to adopt the parameters as operating limitations.
    (i) The engine percent load during a performance test must be 
determined by documenting the calculations, assumptions, and measurement 
devices used to measure or estimate the percent load in a specific 
application. A written report of the average percent

[[Page 20]]

load determination must be included in the notification of compliance 
status. The following information must be included in the written 
report: the engine model number, the engine manufacturer, the year of 
purchase, the manufacturer's site-rated brake horsepower, the ambient 
temperature, pressure, and humidity during the performance test, and all 
assumptions that were made to estimate or calculate percent load during 
the performance test must be clearly explained. If measurement devices 
such as flow meters, kilowatt meters, beta analyzers, stain gauges, etc. 
are used, the model number of the measurement device, and an estimate of 
its accurate in percentage of true value must be provided.

Sec. 63.6625  What are my monitoring, installation, operation, and
maintenance requirements?

    (a) If you elect to install a CEMS as specified in Table 5 of this 
subpart, you must install, operate, and maintain a CEMS to monitor CO 
and either oxygen or CO<INF>2</INF> at both the inlet and the outlet of 
the control device according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (4) of this section.
    (1) Each CEMS must be installed, operated, and maintained according 
to the applicable performance specifications of 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
B.
    (2) You must conduct an initial performance evaluation and an annual 
relative accuracy test audit (RATA) of each CEMS according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.8 and according to the applicable performance 
specifications of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B as well as daily and 
periodic data quality checks in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
F, procedure 1.
    (3) As specified in Sec. 63.8(c)(4)(ii), each CEMS must complete a 
minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data 
recording) for each successive 15-minute period. You must have at least 
two data points, with each representing a different 15-minute period, to 
have a valid hour of data.
    (4) The CEMS data must be reduced as specified in Sec. 63.8(g)(2) 
and recorded in parts per million or parts per billion (as appropriate 
for the applicable limitation) at 15 percent oxygen or the equivalent 
CO<INF>2</INF> concentration.
    (b) If you are required to install a continuous parameter monitoring 
system (CPMS) as specified in Table 5 of this subpart, you must install, 
operate, and maintain each CPMS according to the requirements in Sec. 
63.8.
    (c) If you are operating a new or reconstructed stationary RICE 
which fires landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or 
more of the gross heat input on an annual basis, you must monitor and 
record your fuel usage daily with separate fuel meters to measure the 
volumetric flow rate of each fuel. In addition, you must operate your 
stationary RICE in a manner which reasonably minimizes HAP emissions.


<R05>
Sec. 63.6630  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the 
emission limitations and operating limitations?

    (a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each emission and 
operating limitation that applies to you according to Table 5 of this 
subpart.
    (b) During the initial performance test, you must establish each

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.6635  How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate 
continuous compliance?

    (a) If you must comply with emission and operating limitations, you 
must monitor and collect data according to this section.
    (b) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and 
required quality assurance or control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), 
you must monitor continuously at all times that the stationary RICE is 
operating.
    (c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities 
in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating 
levels. You

[[Page 21]]

must, however, use all the valid data collected during all other 
periods.


<R05>
Sec. 63.6640  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the 
emission limitations and operating limitations?

    (a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission 
limitation and operating limitation in Tables 1a and 1b and Tables 2a 
and 2b of this subpart that apply to you according to methods specified 
in Table 6 of this subpart.
    (b) You must report each instance in which you did not meet each 
emission limitation or operating limitation in Tables 1a and 1b and 
Tables 2a and 2b of this subpart that apply to you. These instances are 
deviations from the emission and operating limitations in this subpart. 
These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in Sec. 
63.6650. If you change your catalyst, you must reestablish the values of 
the operating parameters measured during the initial performance test. 
When you reestablish the values of your operating parameters, you must 
also conduct a performance test to demonstrate that you are meeting the 
required emission limitation applicable to your stationary RICE.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations 
from the emission or operating limitations that occur during a period of 
startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not violations if you demonstrate 
to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating in 
accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1). For new, reconstructed, and rebuilt 
stationary RICE, deviations from the emission or operating limitations 
that occur during the first 200 hours of operation from engine startup 
(engine burn-in period) are not violations.
    Rebuilt stationary RICE means a stationary RICE that has been 
rebuilt as that term is defined in 40 CFR Sec. 94.11(a).
    (e) You must also report each instance in which you did not meet the 
requirements in Table 8 of this subpart that apply to you. If you own or 
operate an existing 2SLB stationary RICE, an existing 4SLB stationary 
RICE, an existing CI stationary RICE, an existing emergency stationary 
RICE, an existing limited use emergency stationary RICE, or an existing 
stationary RICE which fires landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 
10 percent or more of the gross heat input on an annual basis, you do 
not need to comply with the requirements in Table 8 of this subpart. If 
you own or operate a new or reconstructed stationary RICE that combusts 
landfill gas or digester gas equivalent to 10 percent or more of the 
gross heat input on an annual basis, a new or reconstructed emergency 
stationary RICE, or a new or reconstructed limited use stationary RICE, 
you do not need to comply with the requirements in Table 8 of this 
subpart, except for the initial notification requirements.

operations, or equipment that are not part of the same oil and gas 
production facility, as defined in Sec. 63.1271 of subpart HHH of this 
part, shall not be aggregated;
    (3) For production field facilities, only HAP emissions from glycol 
dehydration units, storage vessel with the potential for flash 
emissions, combustion turbines and reciprocating internal combustion 
engines shall be aggregated for a major source determination; and
    (4) Emissions from processes, operations, and equipment that are not

reciprocating internal combustion engine which uses reciprocating motion 
to convert heat energy into mechanical work and which is not mobile. 
Stationary RICE differ from mobile RICE in that a stationary RICE is not 
a non-road engine as defined at 40 CFR 1068.30, and is not used to 
propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition.

  you may reduce the frequency of subsequent performance tests to
  annually. If the results of any subsequent annual performance test
  indicate the stationary RICE is not in compliance with the CO or

 Subpart AAAAA_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
                      for Lime Manufacturing Plants

    Source: 69 FR 416, Jan. 5, 2004, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.7080  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) for lime manufacturing plants. This subpart also 
establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous 
compliance with the emission limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7081  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a lime 
manufacturing plant (LMP) that is a major source, or that is located at, 
or is part of, a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) 
emissions, unless the LMP is located at a kraft pulp mill, soda pulp 
mill, sulfite pulp mill, beet sugar manufacturing plant, or only 
processes sludge containing calcium carbonate from water softening 
processes.
    (1) An LMP is an establishment engaged in the manufacture of lime 
product (calcium oxide, calcium oxide with magnesium oxide, or dead 
burned dolomite) by calcination of limestone, dolomite, shells or other 
calcareous substances.
    (2) A major source of HAP is a plant site that emits or has the 
potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) 
or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams 
(25 tons) or more per year from all emission sources at the plant site.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 63.7082  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each existing or new lime kiln(s) and 
their associated cooler(s), and processed stone handling (PSH) 
operations system(s) located at an LMP that is a major source.
    (b) A new lime kiln is a lime kiln, and (if applicable) its 
associated lime cooler, for which construction or reconstruction began

    You must conduct a performance test within 5 years following the 
initial performance test and within 5 years following each subsequent 
performance test thereafter.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7112  What performance tests, design evaluations, and other
procedures must I use?

    (a) You must conduct each performance test in Table 4 to this 
subpart that applies to you.
    (b) Each performance test must be conducted according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.7(e)(1) and under the specific conditions

[[Page 41]]

    (e) The emission rate of particulate matter (PM) from each lime kiln 
(and each lime cooler if there is a separate exhaust to the atmosphere 
from the lime cooler) must be computed for each run using Equation 1 of 
this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05JA04.000

Where:

E = Emission rate of PM, pounds per ton (lb/ton) of stone feed.
C<INF>k</INF> = Concentration of PM in the kiln effluent, grain/dry 
standard cubic feet (gr/dscf).
Q<INF>k</INF> = Volumetric flow rate of kiln effluent gas, dry standard 
cubic feet per hour (dscf/hr).
C<INF>c</INF> = Concentration of PM in the cooler effluent, grain/dscf. 
This value is zero if there is not a separate cooler exhaust to the 
atmosphere.
Q<INF>c</INF> = Volumetric flow rate of cooler effluent gas, dscf/hr. 
This value is zero if there is not a separate cooler exhaust to the 
atmosphere.
P = Stone feed rate, tons per hour (ton/hr).
K = Conversion factor, 7000 grains per pound (grains/lb).

    (f)(1) If you choose to meet a weighted average emission limit as 
specified in item 4 of Table 1 to this subpart, you must calculate a 
combined particulate emission rate from all kilns and coolers within 
your LMP using Equation 2 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05JA04.001

Where:

E<INF>T</INF> = Emission rate of PM from all kilns and coolers, lb/ton 
of stone feed.
E<INF>i</INF> = Emission rate of PM from kiln i, or from kiln/cooler 
combination i, lb/ton of stone feed.
P<INF>i</INF> = Stone feed rate to kiln i, ton/hr.
n = Number of kilns you wish to include in averaging.

    (2) You do not have to include every kiln in this calculation, only 
include kilns you wish to average. Kilns that have a PM emission limit 
of 0.60 lb/tsf are ineligible for any averaging.
    (g) The weighted average PM emission limit from all kilns and 
coolers for which you are averaging must be calculated using Equation 3 
of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05JA04.002

Where:

E<INF>TN</INF> = Weighted average PM emission limit for all kilns and 
coolers being included in averaging at the LMP, lb/ton of stone feed.
E<INF>j</INF> = PM emission limit (0.10 or 0.12) for kiln j, or for 
kiln/cooler combination j, lb/ton of stone feed.
P<INF>j</INF> = Stone feed rate to kiln j, ton/hr.
m = Number of kilns and kiln/cooler combinations you are averaging at 
your LMP. You must include the same kilns in the calculation of 
E<INF>T</INF> and E<INF>TN</INF>. Kilns that have a PM emission limit of 
0.60 lb/tsf are ineligible for any averaging.

    (h) Performance test results must be documented in complete test 
reports that contain the information required by paragraphs (h)(1) 
through (10) of this section, as well as all other relevant information.

    (3) If you use wet dust suppression to control PM from PSH 
operations, a visible mist is sometimes generated by the spray. The 
water mist must not be confused with particulate matter emissions and is 
not to be considered VE. When a water mist of this nature is present, 
you must observe emissions at a point in the plume where the mist is no 
longer visible.

    (i) A test must include three or more runs in which a pair of 
samples is obtained simultaneously for each run according to section 
11.2.6 of ASTM Method D6735-01.
    (ii) You must calculate the test run standard deviation of each set 
of paired samples to quantify data precision, according to Equation 1 of 
this section:

[[Page 49]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05JA04.003

Where:

RSD<INF>a</INF> = The test run relative standard deviation of sample 
pair a, percent.
C1<INF>a</INF> and C2<INF>a</INF> = The HCl concentrations, milligram/
dry standard cubic meter(mg/dscm), from the paired samples.

    (iii) You must calculate the test average relative standard 
deviation according to Equation 2 of this section:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR05JA04.004

Where:

RSD<INF>TA</INF> = The test average relative standard deviation, 
percent.
RSD<INF>a</INF> = The test run relative standard deviation for sample 
pair a.
p = The number of test runs, <ls-thn-eq>=3.

    (iv) If RSD\TA\ is greater than 20 percent, the data are invalid and 
the test must be repeated.
    (v) The post-test analyte spike procedure of section 11.2.7 of ASTM 
Method D6735-01 is conducted, and the percent recovery is calculated 
according to section 12.6 of ASTM Method D6735-01.
    (vi) If the percent recovery is between 70 percent and 130 percent, 
inclusive, the test is valid. If the percent recovery is outside of this 
range, the data are considered invalid, and the test must be repeated.
    (b) If you conduct tests to determine the rates of emission of 
specific organic HAP from lime kilns at LMP for use in applicability 
determinations under Sec. 63.7081, you may use either:
    (1) Method 320 of appendix A to this part, or
    (2) Method 18 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter, or
    (3) ASTM D6420-99, Standard Test Method for Determination of Gaseous 
Organic Compounds by Direct Interface Gas Chromatography-Mass 
Spectrometry (GC/MS), provided that the provisions of paragraphs 
(b)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section are followed:

volume and 100 parts per million by volume;
    (iii) For target compound(s) not listed in Table 1.1 of ASTM D6420-
99, but potentially detected by mass spectrometry, the additional system 
continuing calibration check after each run, as detailed in section 
10.5.3 of ASTM D6420-99, is conducted, met, documented, and submitted 
with the data report, even if there is no moisture condenser used or the 
compound is not considered water soluble; and
    (iv) For target compound(s) not listed in Table 1.1 of ASTM D6420-
99, and not amenable to detection by mass spectrometry, ASTM D6420-99 
may not be used.
    (c) It is left to the discretion of the permitting authority whether 
or not idled kilns must be tested for (HCl) to claim area source status. 
If the facility has kilns that use common feed materials and fuel, are 
essentially identical in design, and use essentially identical emission 
controls, the permitting authority may also determine if one kiln can be 
tested, and the HCl emissions for the other essentially identical kilns 
be estimated from that test.

to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission 
standards.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7181  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a 
semiconductor manufacturing process unit that is a major source of 
hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions or that is located at, or is 
part of, a major source of HAP emissions.
    (b) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or 
group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under 
common control that emits or has the potential to emit, considering 
controls, in the aggregate, any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons per year 
(tpy) or more or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tpy or more.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7182  What parts of my facility does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing 
affected source that you own or operate that manufactures 
semiconductors.
    (b) An affected source subject to this subpart is the collection of 
all semiconductor manufacturing process units used to manufacture p-type 
and n-type semiconductors and active solid-state devices from a wafer 
substrate, including research and development activities integrated into 
a semiconductor manufacturing process unit. A semiconductor 
manufacturing process unit includes the equipment assembled and 
connected by ductwork or hard-piping including furnaces and associated 
unit operations; associated wet and dry work benches; associated 
recovery devices; feed, intermediate, and product storage tanks; product 
transfer racks and connected ducts and piping; pumps, compressors, 
agitators, pressure-relief devices, sampling connecting systems, open-
ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, and instrumentation systems; 
and control devices.
    (c) Your affected source is a new affected source if you commence 
construction of the affected source after May 8, 2002, and you meet the 
applicability criteria in Sec. 63.7181 at the time you commence 
construction.
    (d) Your affected source is a reconstructed affected source if you 
meet the criteria for ``reconstruction,'' as defined in Sec. 63.2.
    (e) Your source is an existing affected source if it is not a new or 
reconstructed affected source.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7183  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have a new or reconstructed affected source, you must 
comply with this subpart according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this 
section.
    (1) If you start up your affected source before May 22, 2003, then 
you must comply with the emission standards for new and reconstructed 
sources in this subpart no later than May 22, 2003.
    (2) If you start up your affected source after May 22, 2003, then 
you must comply with the emission standards for new and reconstructed 
sources in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.
    (b) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with 
the emission standards for existing sources no later than 3 years from 
May 22, 2003.
    (c) If you have an area source that increases its emissions or its 
potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP and an 
affected source subject to this subpart, paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of 
this section apply.
    (1) Any portion of your existing facility that is a new affected 
source as specified at Sec. 63.7182(c), or a reconstructed affected

                           Emission Standards


<R05>
Sec. 63.7184  What emission limitations, operating limits, and work
practice standards must I meet?

    (a) If you have a new, reconstructed, or existing affected source, 
as defined in Sec. 63.7182(b), you must comply with all applicable 
emission limitations in this section on and after the compliance dates 
specified in Sec. 63.7183.
    (b) Process vents--organic HAP emissions. For each process vent that 
emits organic HAP, other than process vents from storage tanks, you must 
limit organic HAP emissions to the level specified in paragraph (b)(1) 
or (2) of this section. These limitations can be met by venting 
emissions from your process vent through a closed vent system to any 
combination of control devices meeting the requirements of Sec. 
63.982(a)(2).
    (1) Reduce the emissions of organic HAP from the process vent stream 
by 98 percent by weight.
    (2) Reduce or maintain the concentration of emitted organic HAP from 
the process vent to less than or equal to 20 parts per million by volume 
(ppmv).
    (c) Process vents--inorganic HAP emissions. For each process vent 
that emits inorganic HAP, other than process vents from storage tanks, 
you must limit inorganic HAP emissions to the level specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section. These limitations can be met by 
venting emissions from your process vent through a closed vent system to 
a halogen scrubber meeting the requirements of Sec. Sec. 63.983 (closed 
vent system requirements) and 63.994 (halogen scrubber requirements); 
the applicable general monitoring requirements of Sec. 63.996; the 
applicable performance test requirements; and the monitoring, 
recordkeeping and reporting requirements referenced therein.
    (1) Reduce the emissions of inorganic HAP from the process vent 
stream by 95 percent by weight.
    (2) Reduce or maintain the concentration of emitted inorganic HAP 
from the process vent to less than or equal to 0.42 ppmv.
    (d) Storage tanks. For each storage tank, 1,500 gallons or larger, 
you must limit total HAP emissions to the level specified in paragraph 
(d)(1) or (2) of this section if the emissions from the storage tank 
vent contains greater than 0.42 ppmv inorganic HAP. These limitations 
can be met by venting emissions from your storage tank through a closed 
vent system to a halogen scrubber meeting the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
63.983 (closed vent system requirements) and 63.994 (halogen scrubber 
requirements); the applicable general monitoring requirements of Sec. 
63.996; the applicable performance test requirements; and the 
monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements referenced therein.
    (1) Reduce the emissions of inorganic HAP from each storage tank by 
95 percent by weight.
    (2) Reduce or maintain the concentration of emitted inorganic HAP 
from the process vent to less than or equal to 0.42 ppmv.
    (e) You must comply with the applicable work practice standards and 
operating limits contained in Sec. 63.982(a)(1) and (2). The closed 
vent system inspection requirements of Sec. 63.983(c), as referenced by 
Sec. 63.982(a)(1) and (2), do not apply.

                         Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.7185  What are my general requirements for 
complying with this subpart?

    (a) You must be in compliance with the requirements of Sec. 63.7184 
at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction.
    (b) You must always operate and maintain your affected source, 
including air pollution control and monitoring equipment, according to 
the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i).
    (c) You must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction 
plan (SSMP). Your SSMP must be prepared in accordance with the 
provisions in Sec. 63.6(e)(3).
    (d) You must perform all the items listed in paragraphs (d)(1) 
through (3) of this section:
    (1) Submit the necessary notifications in accordance with Sec. 
63.7189.
    (2) Submit the necessary reports in accordance with Sec. 63.7190.

[68 FR 27925, May 22, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 20467, Apr. 20, 2006]


<R05>
Sec. 63.7186  By what date must I conduct performance tests or other
initial compliance demonstrations?

    For each process vent or storage tank vent emission limitation in 
Sec. 63.7184 for which initial compliance is demonstrated by meeting a 
percent by weight HAP emissions reduction, or a HAP concentration 
limitation, you must conduct performance tests or an initial compliance 
demonstration within 180 days after the compliance date that is 
specified for your source in Sec. 63.7183 and according to the 
provisions in Sec. 63.7(a)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 63.7187  What performance tests and other compliance procedures
must I use?

    (a) You must conduct each performance test in Table 1 to this 
subpart that applies to you as specified for process vents in Sec. 
63.982(a)(2) and storage tanks in Sec. 63.982(a)(1). Performance tests 
must be conducted under maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions 
potential. Section 63.982(a)(1) and (2) only includes methods to measure 
the total organic regulated material or total organic carbon (TOC) 
concentration. The EPA Methods 26 and 26A are included in Table 1 to 
this subpart in addition to the test methods contained within Sec. 
63.982(a)(1) and (2). The EPA Method 26 or 26A must be used for testing 
regulated material containing inorganic HAP. Method 320 of 40 CFR part 
63, appendix A, must be used to measure total vapor phase organic and 
inorganic HAP concentrations.
    (b) If, without the use of a control device, your process vent 
stream has an organic HAP concentration of 20 ppmv or less or an 
inorganic HAP concentration of 0.42 ppmv or less, or your storage tank 
vent stream has an inorganic HAP concentration of 0.42 ppmv or less, you 
may demonstrate that the vent stream is compliant by engineering 
assessments and calculations or by conducting the applicable performance 
test requirements specified in Table 1 to this subpart. Your engineering 
assessments and calculations, as with performance tests (as specified in 
Sec. 63.982(a)(1) and (2)), must represent your maximum operating 
conditions or HAP emissions potential and must be approved by the 
Administrator. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by certifying 
that your operations will not exceed the maximum operating conditions or 
HAP emissions potential represented by your engineering assessments, 
calculations, or performance test.
    (c) If you are using a control device to comply with the emission 
limitations in Sec. 63.7184 and the inlet concentration of HAP to the 
control device is 20 ppmv or less, then you may demonstrate that the 
control device meets the percent by weight HAP emission reduction 
limitation in Sec. 63.7184(c)(1) or (d)(1) by conducting a design 
evaluation as specified in paragraph (i) of this section. Your design 
evaluation must represent your maximum operating conditions or HAP 
emissions potential and must be approved by the Administrator. You must 
demonstrate continuous compliance by certifying that your operations 
will not exceed the maximum operating conditions or HAP emissions 
potential represented by your design evaluation.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) For each monitoring system required in this section, you must 
develop and submit for approval a site-specific monitoring plan that 
addresses the criteria specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of 
this section.
    (1) Installation of the continuous monitoring system (CMS) sampling 
probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to each 
affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of 
control of the exhaust emissions (e.g., on or downstream of the last 
control device);
    (2) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample 
interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, 
and the data collection and reduction system; and
    (3) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g., 
calibrations).

[[Page 65]]

    (f) In your site-specific monitoring plan, you must also address the 
procedural processes in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Ongoing operation and maintenance procedures in accordance with 
the general requirements of Sec. 63.8(c)(1), (3), (4)(ii), (7), and 
(8);
    (2) Ongoing data quality assurance procedures in accordance with the 
general requirements of Sec. 63.8(d); and
    (3) Ongoing recordkeeping and reporting procedures in accordance 
with the general requirements of Sec. 63.10(c), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i).
    (g) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CMS in 
accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan.
    (h) You must operate and maintain the CMS in continuous operation 
according to the site-specific monitoring plan.
    (i) Design evaluation. To demonstrate that a control device meets 
the required percent by weight inorganic HAP emission reduction 
limitation in Sec. 63.7184(c)(1) or (d)(1), a design evaluation must 
address the composition of the inorganic HAP concentration of the vent 
stream entering the control device. A design evaluation also must 
address other vent stream characteristics and control device operating 
parameters as specified in any one of paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of 
this section, depending on the type of control device that is used. If 
the vent stream is not the only inlet to the control device, the 
efficiency demonstration must also consider all other vapors, gases, and 
liquids, other than fuels, received by the control device.
    (1) For a condenser, the design evaluation shall consider the vent 
stream flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall establish 
the design outlet organic HAP compound concentration level, design 
average temperature of the condenser exhaust vent stream, and the design 
average temperatures of the coolant fluid at the condenser inlet and 
outlet. The temperature of the gas stream exiting the condenser must be 
measured and used to establish the outlet organic HAP concentration.
    (2) For a carbon adsorption system that regenerates the carbon bed 
directly onsite in the control device such as a fixed-bed adsorber, the 
design evaluation shall consider the vent stream flow rate, relative 
humidity, and temperature and shall establish the design exhaust vent 
stream organic compound concentration level, adsorption cycle time, 
number and capacity of carbon beds, type and working capacity of 
activated carbon used for carbon beds, design total regeneration stream 
mass or volumetric flow over the period of each complete carbon bed 
regeneration cycle, design carbon bed temperature after regeneration, 
design carbon bed regeneration time, and design service life of carbon. 
For vacuum desorption, the pressure drop shall be included.
    (3) For a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the 
carbon bed directly onsite in the control device such as a carbon 
canister, the design evaluation shall consider the vent stream mass or 
volumetric flow rate, relative humidity, and temperature and shall 
establish the design exhaust vent stream organic compound concentration 
level, capacity of carbon bed, type and working capacity of activated 
carbon used for carbon bed, and design carbon replacement interval based 
on the total carbon working capacity of the control device and source 
operating schedule.
    (4) For a scrubber, the design evaluation shall consider the vent 
stream composition, constituent concentrations, liquid-to-vapor ratio, 
scrubbing liquid flow rate and concentration, temperature, and the 
reaction kinetics of the constituents with the scrubbing liquid. The 
design evaluation shall establish the design exhaust vent stream organic 
compound concentration level and will include the additional information 
in paragraphs (i)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section for trays and a packed 
column scrubber.
    (i) Type and total number of theoretical and actual trays;
    (ii) Type and total surface area of packing for entire column, and 
for individual packed sections if column contains more than one packed 
section.

Sec. 63.7195  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 
Sec. Sec. 63.2 and 63.981, the General Provisions of this part (40 CFR 
part 63, subpart A), and in this section as follows:
    Control device means a combustion device, recovery device, recapture 
device, or any combination of these devices used for the primary purpose 
of reducing emissions to comply with this subpart. Devices that are 
inherent to a process or are integral to the operation of a process are 
not considered control devices for the purposes of this subpart, even 
though these devices may have the secondary effect of reducing 
emissions.
    Process vent means the point at which HAP emissions are released to 
the atmosphere from a semiconductor manufacturing process unit or 
storage tank by means of a stack, chimney, vent, or other functionally 
equivalent opening. The HAP emission points originating from wastewater 
treatment equipment, other than storage tanks, are not considered to be 
a process vent, unless the wastewater treatment equipment emission 
points are connected to a common vent or exhaust plenum with other 
process vents.
    Semiconductor manufacturing means the collection of semiconductor 
manufacturing process units used to manufacture p-type and n-type 
semiconductors or active solid state devices from a wafer substrate, 
including processing from crystal growth through wafer fabrication, and 
testing and assembly. Examples of semiconductor or related solid state 
devices include semiconductor diodes, semiconductor stacks, rectifiers, 
integrated circuits, and transistors.
    Semiconductor manufacturing process unit means the collection of 
equipment used to carry out a discrete operation in the semiconductor 
manufacturing process. These operations include, but are not limited to, 
crystal growing; solvent stations used to prepare and clean materials 
for subsequent processing or for parts cleaning; wet chemical stations 
used for cleaning (other than solvent cleaning); photoresist 
application, developing, and stripping; etching; gaseous operation 
stations used for stripping, cleaning, doping, etching, and layering; 
separation; encapsulation; and testing. Research and development 
operations associated with semiconductor manufacturing and conducted at 
a semiconductor manufacturing facility are considered to be 
semiconductor manufacturing process units.
    Storage tank means a stationary unit that is constructed primarily 
from nonearthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or 
plastic) which provides structural support and is designed to hold an 
accumulation of liquids or other materials used in or generated by a 
semiconductor manufacturing process unit. The following are not storage 
tanks for the purposes of this subpart:
    (1) Tanks permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, 
railcars, barges, or ships;
    (2) Flow-through tanks where wastewater undergoes treatment (such as 
pH adjustment) before discharge, and are not used to accumulate 
wastewater;
    (3) Bottoms receiver tanks; and
    (4) Surge control tanks.

 Subpart CCCCC_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
         for Coke Ovens: Pushing, Quenching, and Battery Stacks

    Source: 68 FR 18025, Apr. 14, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.7280  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) for pushing, soaking, quenching, and battery 
stacks at coke oven batteries. This subpart also establishes 
requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with all 
applicable emission limitations, work practice standards, and operation 
and maintenance requirements in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7281  Am I subject to this subpart?

    You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a coke oven 
battery at a coke plant that is (or is part of) a major source of 
hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions. A major source of HAP is a 
plant site that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a 
rate of 10 tons or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 
25 tons or more per year.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7282  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each new or existing affected source at 
your coke plant. The affected source is each coke oven battery.
    (b) This subpart covers emissions from pushing, soaking, quenching, 
and battery stacks from each affected source.
    (c) An affected source at your coke plant is existing if you 
commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source before 
July 3, 2001.
    (d) An affected source at your coke plant is new if you commenced 
construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or after July 
3, 2001. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition 
of ``reconstruction'' in Sec. 63.2.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7283  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with 
each emission limitation, work practice standard, and operation and 
maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you no later 
than April 14, 2006.
    (b) If you have a new affected source and its initial startup date 
is on or before April 14, 2003, you must comply with each emission 
limitation, work practice standard, and operation and maintenance 
requirement in this subpart that applies to you by April 14, 2003.
    (c) If you have a new affected source and its initial startup date 
is after April 14, 2003, you must comply with each emission limitation, 
work practice standard, and operation and maintenance requirement in 
this subpart that applies to you upon initial startup.
    (d) You must meet the notification and schedule requirements in 
Sec. 63.7340.

[[Page 72]]

Several of these notifications must be submitted before the compliance 
date for your affected source.

            Emission Limitations and Work Practice Standards


<R05>
Sec. 63.7290  What emission limitations must I meet for capture
systems and control devices applied to pushing emissions?

    (a) You must not discharge to the atmosphere emissions of 
particulate matter from a control device applied to pushing emissions 
from a new or existing coke oven battery that exceed the applicable 
limit in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:
    (1) 0.01 grain per dry standard cubic foot (gr/dscf) if a cokeside 
shed is used to capture emissions;
    (2) 0.02 pound per ton (lb/ton) of coke if a moveable hood vented to 
a stationary control device is used to capture emissions;
    (3) If a mobile scrubber car that does not capture emissions during 
travel is used:
    (i) 0.03 lb/ton of coke for a control device applied to pushing 
emissions from a short battery, or
    (ii) 0.01 lb/ton of coke for a control device applied to pushing 
emissions from a tall battery; and
    (4) 0.04 lb/ton of coke if a mobile control device that captures 
emissions during travel is used.
    (b) You must meet each operating limit in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(4) of this section that applies to you for a new or existing coke oven 
battery.
    (1) For each venturi scrubber applied to pushing emissions, you must 
maintain the daily average pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate at 
or above the minimum levels established during the initial performance 
test.
    (2) For each hot water scrubber applied to pushing emissions, you 
must maintain the daily average water pressure and water temperature at 
or above the minimum levels established during the initial performance 
test.
    (3) For each capture system applied to pushing emissions, you must 
maintain the daily average volumetric flow rate at the inlet of the 
control device at or above the minimum level established during the 
initial performance test; or
    (i) For each capture system that uses an electric motor to drive the 
fan, you must maintain the daily average fan motor amperes at or above 
the minimum level established during the initial performance test; and
    (ii) For each capture system that does not use a fan driven by an

Sec. 63.7291  What work practice standards must I meet for fugitive 
pushing emissions if I have a by-product coke oven battery 

with vertical flues?

    (a) You must meet each requirement in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) 
of this section for each new or existing by-product coke oven battery 
with vertical flues.
    (1) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive pushing emissions 
from each oven at least once every 90 days. If an oven cannot be 
observed during a 90-day period due to circumstances that were not 
reasonably avoidable, you must observe the opacity of the first push of 
that oven following the close of the 90-day period that is capable of 
being observed in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 63.7334(a), 
and you must document why the oven was not observed within a 90-day 
period. All opacity observations of fugitive pushing emissions for 
batteries with vertical flues must be made using the procedures in Sec. 
63.7334(a).
    (2) If two or more batteries are served by the same pushing 
equipment and

[[Page 73]]

total no more than 90 ovens, the batteries as a unit can be considered a 
single battery.
    (3) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive pushing emissions for 
at least four consecutive pushes per battery each day. Exclude any push 
during which the observer's view is obstructed or obscured by 
interferences and observe the next available push to complete the set of 
four pushes. If necessary due to circumstances that were not reasonably 
avoidable, you may observe fewer than four consecutive pushes in a day; 
however, you must observe and record as many consecutive pushes as 
possible and document why four consecutive pushes could not be observed. 
You may observe and record one or more non-consecutive pushes in 
addition to any consecutive pushes observed in a day.
    (4) Do not alter the pushing schedule to change the sequence of 
consecutive pushes to be observed on any day. Keep records indicating 
the legitimate operational reason for any change in your pushing 
schedule which results in a change in the sequence of consecutive pushes 
observed on any day.
    (5) If the average opacity for any individual push exceeds 30 
percent opacity for any short battery or 35 percent opacity for any tall 
battery, you must take corrective action and/or increase coking time for 
that oven. You must complete corrective action or increase coking time 
within either 10 calendar days or the number of days determined using 
Equation 1 of this section, whichever is greater:

X = 0.55 * Y (Eq. 1)

Where:

X = Number of calendar days allowed to complete corrective action or 
increase coking time; and
Y = Current coking time for the oven, hours.


For the purpose of determining the number of calendar days allowed under 
Equation 1 of this section, day one is the first day following the day 
you observed an opacity in excess of 30 percent for any short battery or 
35 percent for any tall battery. Any fraction produced by Equation 1 of 
this section must be counted as a whole day. Days during which the oven 
is removed from service are not included in the number of days allowed 
to complete corrective action.
    (6)(i) You must demonstrate that the corrective action and/or 
increased coking time was successful. After a period of time no longer 
than the number of days allowed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, 
observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes for the oven 
capable of being observed using the procedures in Sec. 63.7334(a). The 
corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful if the 
average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a 
short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery. If the 
corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful, you may 
return the oven to the 90-day reading rotation described in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. If the average opacity of either push exceeds 30 
percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, the 
corrective action and/or increased coking time was unsuccessful, and you 
must complete additional corrective action and/or increase coking time 
for that oven within the number of days allowed in paragraph (a)(5) of 
this section.
    (ii) After implementing any additional corrective action and/or 
increased coking time required under paragraph (a)(6)(i) or (a)(7)(ii) 
of this section, you must demonstrate that corrective action and/or 
increased coking time was successful. After a period of time no longer 
than the number of days allowed in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, you 
must observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes for the oven 
capable of being observed using the procedures in Sec. 63.7334(a). The 
corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful if the 
average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a 
short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery. If the 
corrective action and/or increased coking time was successful, you may 
return the oven to the 90-day reading rotation described in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. If the average opacity of either push exceeds 30 
percent for a short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, the 
corrective action and/or increased coking time was unsuccessful, and you 
must follow the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section.

[[Page 74]]

    (iii) If the corrective action and/or increased coking time was 
unsuccessful as described in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, you 
must repeat the procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section until 
the corrective action and/or increased coking time is successful. You 
must report to the permitting authority as a deviation each unsuccessful 
attempt at corrective action and/or increased coking time under 
paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (7)(i) If at any time you place an oven on increased coking time as 
a result of fugitive pushing emissions that exceed 30 percent for a 
short battery or 35 percent for a tall battery, you must keep the oven 
on the increased coking time until the oven qualifies for decreased 
coking time using the procedures in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) or (a)(7)(iii) 
of this section.
    (ii) To qualify for a decreased coking time for an oven placed on 
increased coking time in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) or (6) of this 
section, you must operate the oven on the decreased coking time. After 
no more than two coking cycles on the decreased coking time, you must 
observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes that are capable 
of being observed using the procedures in Sec. 63.7334(a). If the 
average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a 
short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery, you may keep the 
oven on the decreased coking time and return the oven to the 90-day 
reading rotation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the 
average opacity of either push exceeds 30 percent for a short battery or 
35 percent for a tall battery, the attempt to qualify for a decreased 
coking time was unsuccessful. You must then return the oven to the 
previously established increased coking time, or implement other 
corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time. If you implement 
other corrective action and/or a coking time that is shorter than the 
previously established increased coking time, you must follow the 
procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section to confirm that the 
corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time was successful.
    (iii) If the attempt to qualify for decreased coking time was 
unsuccessful as described in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section, you 
may again attempt to qualify for decreased coking time for the oven. To 
do this, you must operate the oven on the decreased coking time. After 
no more than two coking cycles on the decreased coking time, you must 
observe and record the opacity of the first two pushes that are capable 
of being observed using the procedures in Sec. 63.7334(a). If the 
average opacity for each of the two pushes is 30 percent or less for a 
short battery or 35 percent or less for a tall battery, you may keep the 
oven on the decreased coking time and return the oven to the 90-day 
reading rotation described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the 
average opacity of either push exceeds 30 percent for a short battery or 
35 percent for a tall battery, the attempt to qualify for a decreased 
coking time was unsuccessful. You must then return the oven to the 
previously established increased coking time, or implement other 
corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time. If you implement 
other corrective action and/or a coking time that is shorter than the 
previously established increased coking time, you must follow the 
procedures in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section to confirm that the 
corrective action(s) and/or increased coking time was successful.
    (iv) You must report to the permitting authority as a deviation the 
second and any subsequent consecutive unsuccessful attempts on the same 
oven to qualify for decreased coking time as described in paragraph 
(a)(7)(iii) of this section.
    (b) As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), you may request to use an 
alternative to the work practice standards in paragraph (a) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7292  What work practice standards must I meet for fugitive 
pushing emissions if I have a by-product coke oven 

battery with horizontal flues?

    (a) You must comply with each of the requirements in paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) Prepare and operate by a written plan that will eliminate or 
minimize incomplete coking for each by-product coke oven battery with 
horizontal flues. You must submit the plan and

[[Page 75]]

supporting documentation to the Administrator (or delegated authority) 
for approval no later than 90 days after completing all observations and 
measurements required for the study in paragraph (a)(3) of this section 
or April 14, 2004, whichever is earlier. You must begin operating by the 
plan requirements by the compliance date that is specified in Sec. 
63.7283. The written plan must identify minimum flue temperatures for 
different coking times and a battery-wide minimum acceptable flue 
temperature for any oven at any coking time.
    (2) Submit the written plan and supporting documentation to the 
Administrator (or delegated authority) for review and approval. Include 
all data collected during the study described in paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section. If the Administrator (or delegated authority) disapproves 
the plan, you must revise the plan as directed by the Administrator (or 
delegated authority) and submit the amended plan for approval. The 
Administrator (or delegated authority) may require you to collect and 
submit additional data. You must operate according to your submitted 
plan (or submitted amended plan, if any) until the Administrator (or 
delegated authority) approves your plan.
    (3) You must base your written plan on a study that you conduct that 
meets each of the requirements listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through 
(x) of this section.
    (i) Initiate the study by July 14, 2003. Notify the Administrator 
(or delegated authority) at least 7 days prior to initiating the study 
according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7340(f).
    (ii) Conduct the study under representative operating conditions, 
including but not limited to the range of moisture content and volatile 
matter in the coal that is charged.
    (iii) Include every oven in the study and observe at least two 
pushes from each oven.
    (iv) For each push observed, measure and record the temperature of 
every flue within 2 hours before the scheduled pushing time. Document 
the oven number, date, and time the oven was charged and pushed, and 
calculate the net coking time.
    (v) For each push observed, document the factors to be used to 
identify pushes that are incompletely coked. These factors must include 
(but are not limited to): average opacity during the push, average 
opacity during travel to the quench tower, average of six highest 
consecutive observations during both push and travel, highest single 
opacity reading, color of the emissions (especially noting any yellow or 
brown emissions), presence of excessive smoke during travel to the 
quench tower, percent volatile matter in the coke, percent volatile 
matter and percent moisture in the coal that is charged, and the date 
the oven was last rebuilt or completely relined. Additional 
documentation may be provided in the form of pictures or videotape of 
emissions during the push and travel. All opacity observations must be 
conducted in accordance with the procedures in Sec. 63.7334(a)(3) 
through (7).
    (vi) Inspect the inside walls of the oven after each observed push 
for cool spots as indicated by a flue that is darker than others (the 
oven walls should be red hot) and record the results.
    (vii) For each push observed, note where incomplete coking occurs if 
possible (e.g., coke side end, pusher side end, top, or center of the 
coke mass). For any push with incomplete coking, investigate and 
document the probable cause.
    (viii) Use the documented factors in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this 
section to identify pushes that were completely coked and those that 
were not completely coked. Provide a rationale for the determination 
based on the documentation of factors observed during the study.
    (ix) Use only the flue temperature and coking time data for pushes 
that were completely coked to identify minimum flue temperatures for 
various coking times. Submit the criteria used to determine complete 
coking, as well as a table of coking times and corresponding 
temperatures for complete coking as part of your plan.
    (x) Determine the battery-wide minimum acceptable flue temperature 
for any oven. This temperature will be equal to the lowest temperature 
that

[[Page 76]]

provided complete coking as determined in paragraph (a)(3)(ix) of this 
section.
    (4) You must operate according to the coking times and temperatures 
in your approved plan and the requirements in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) 
through (viii) of this section.
    (i) Measure and record the percent volatile matter in the coal that 
is charged.
    (ii) Measure and record the temperature of all flues on two ovens 
per day within 2 hours before the scheduled pushing time for each oven. 
Measure and record the temperature of all flues on each oven at least 
once each month.
    (iii) For each oven observed in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(ii) 
of this section, record the time each oven is charged and pushed and 
calculate and record the net coking time. If any measured flue 
temperature for an oven is below the minimum flue temperature for an 
oven's scheduled coking time as established in the written plan, 
increase the coking time for the oven to the coking time in the written 
plan for the observed flue temperature before pushing the oven.
    (iv) If you increased the coking time for any oven in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, you must investigate the 
cause of the low flue temperature and take corrective action to fix the 
problem. You must continue to measure and record the temperature of all 
flues for the oven within 2 hours before each scheduled pushing time 
until the measurements meet the minimum temperature requirements for the 
increased coking time for two consecutive pushes. If any measured flue 
temperature for an oven on increased coking time falls below the minimum 
flue temperature for the increased coking time, as established in the 
written plan, you must increase the coking time for the oven to the 
coking time specified in the written plan for the observed flue 
temperature before pushing the oven. The oven must continue to operate 
at this coking time (or at a longer coking time if the temperature falls 
below the minimum allowed for the increased coking time) until the 
problem has been corrected, and you have confirmed that the corrective 
action was successful as required by paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this 
section.
    (v) Once the heating problem has been corrected, the oven may be 
returned to the battery's normal coking schedule. You must then measure 
and record the flue temperatures for the oven within 2 hours before the 
scheduled pushing time for the next two consecutive pushes. If any flue 
temperature measurement is below the minimum flue temperature for that 
coking time established in the written plan, repeat the procedures in 
paragraphs (a)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this section.
    (vi) If any flue temperature measurement is below the battery-wide 
minimum acceptable temperature for complete coking established in the 
written plan for any oven at any coking time, you must remove the oven 
from service for repairs.
    (vii) For an oven that has been repaired and returned to service 
after being removed from service in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(vi) 
of this section, you must measure and record the temperatures of all 
flues for the oven within 2 hours before the first scheduled pushing 
time. If any flue temperature measurement is below the minimum flue 
temperature for the scheduled coking time, as established in the written 
plan, you must repeat the procedures described in paragraphs (a)(4)(iii) 
and (iv) of this section.
    (viii) For an oven that has been repaired and returned to service 
after removal from service in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(vi) of 
this section, you must report as a deviation to the permitting authority 
any flue temperature measurement made during the initial coking cycle 
after return to service that is below the lowest acceptable minimum flue 
temperature.
    (b) As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), you may request to use an 
alternative to the work practice standards in paragraph (a) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7293  What work practice standards must I meet for fugitive 
pushing emissions if I have a non-recovery coke oven battery?

    (a) You must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of 
this section for each new and existing non-recovery coke oven battery.

[[Page 77]]

    (1) You must visually inspect each oven prior to pushing by opening 
the door damper and observing the bed of coke.
    (2) Do not push the oven unless the visual inspection indicates that 
there is no smoke in the open space above the coke bed and that there is 
an unobstructed view of the door on the opposite side of the oven.
    (b) As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), you may request to use an 
alternative to the work practice standard in paragraph (a) of this

Sec. 63.7294  What work practice standard must I meet for soaking?

    (a) For each new and existing by-product coke oven battery, you must 
prepare and operate at all times according to a written work practice 
plan for soaking. Each plan must include measures and procedures to:
    (1) Train topside workers to identify soaking emissions that require 
corrective actions.
    (2) Damper the oven off the collecting main prior to opening the 
standpipe cap.
    (3) Determine the cause of soaking emissions that do not ignite 
automatically, including emissions that result from raw coke oven gas 
leaking from the collecting main through the damper, and emissions that 
result from incomplete coking.
    (4) If soaking emissions are caused by leaks from the collecting 
main, take corrective actions to eliminate the soaking emissions. 
Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, reseating the 
damper, cleaning the flushing liquor piping, using aspiration, putting 
the oven back on the collecting main, or igniting the emissions.
    (5) If soaking emissions are not caused by leaks from the collecting 
main, notify a designated responsible party. The responsible party must 
determine whether the soaking emissions are due to incomplete coking. If 
incomplete coking is the cause of the soaking emissions, you must put 
the oven back on the collecting main until it is completely coked or you 
must ignite the emissions.
    (b) As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), you may request to use an 
alternative to the work practice standard in paragraph (a) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7295  What requirements must I meet for quenching?

    (a) You must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of 
this section for each quench tower and backup quench station at a new or 
existing coke oven battery.

63.7352, as makeup water for quenching.
    (b) For each quench tower at a new or existing coke oven battery and 
each backup quench station at a new coke oven battery, you must meet 
each of the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this 
section.
    (1) You must equip each quench tower with baffles such that no more 
than 5 percent of the cross sectional area of the tower may be uncovered 
or open to the sky.
    (2) You must wash the baffles in each quench tower once each day 
that the tower is used to quench coke, except as specified in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) You are not required to wash the baffles in a quench tower if 
the highest measured ambient temperature remains less than 30 degrees 
Fahrenheit throughout that day (24-hour period). If the measured ambient 
temperature rises to 30 degrees Fahrenheit or more during the day, you 
must resume daily washing according to the schedule in your operation 
and maintenance plan.
    (ii) You must continuously record the ambient temperature on days 
that the baffles were not washed.
    (3) You must inspect each quench tower monthly for damaged or 
missing baffles and blockage.

alternative to the work practice standards in paragraph (b) of this 
section.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7296  What emission limitations must I meet
for battery stacks?

    You must not discharge to the atmosphere any emissions from any 
battery stack at a new or existing by-product coke oven battery that 
exhibit an opacity greater than the applicable limit in paragraphs (a) 
and (b) of this section.
    (a) Daily average of 15 percent opacity for a battery on a normal 
coking cycle.
    (b) Daily average of 20 percent opacity for a battery on batterywide 
extended coking.

                 Operation and Maintenance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.7300  What are my operation and maintenance requirements?

    (a) As required by Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i), you must always operate and 
maintain your affected source, including air pollution control and 
monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution 
control practices for minimizing emissions at least to the levels 
required by this subpart.
    (b) You must prepare and operate at all times according to a written 
operation and maintenance plan for the general operation and maintenance 
of new or existing by-product coke oven batteries. Each plan must 
address, at a minimum, the elements listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through 
(6) of this section.
    (1) Frequency and method of recording underfiring gas parameters.
    (2) Frequency and method of recording battery operating temperature, 
including measurement of individual flue and cross-wall temperatures.
    (3) Procedures to prevent pushing an oven before it is fully coked.
    (4) Procedures to prevent overcharging and undercharging of ovens, 
including measurement of coal moisture, coal bulk density, and 
procedures for determining volume of coal charged.
    (5) Frequency and procedures for inspecting flues, burners, and

battery. Each plan must address at a minimum the elements in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Monthly inspections of the equipment that are important to the 
performance of the total capture system (e.g., pressure sensors, 
dampers, and damper switches). This inspection must include observations 
of the physical appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of holes in 
ductwork or hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated 
dust in ductwork, and fan erosion). In the event a defect or deficiency 
is found in the capture system (during a monthly inspection or between 
inspections), you must complete repairs within 30 days after the date 
that the defect or deficiency is discovered. If you determine that the 
repairs cannot be completed within 30 days, you must submit a written 
request for an extension of time to complete the repairs that must be 
received by the permitting authority not more than 20 days after the 
date that the defect or deficiency is discovered. The request must 
contain a description of the defect or deficiency, the steps needed and 
taken to correct the problem, the interim steps being taken to mitigate 
the emissions impact of the defect or deficiency, and a proposed 
schedule for completing the repairs. The request shall be deemed 
approved unless and until such time as the permitting authority notifies 
you that it objects to the request. The permitting authority may 
consider all relevant factors in deciding whether to approve or deny the 
request (including feasibility and safety). Each approved schedule must 
provide for completion of repairs as expeditiously as practicable, and 
the permitting authority may request modifications to the proposed 
schedule as part of the approval process.

[[Page 79]]

    (2) Preventative maintenance for each control device, including a 
preventative maintenance schedule that is consistent with the 
manufacturer's instructions for routine and long-term maintenance.

emissions. In the event a bag leak detection system alarm is triggered, 
you must initiate corrective action to determine the cause of the alarm 
within 1 hour of the alarm, initiate corrective action to correct the 
cause of the problem within 24 hours of the alarm, and complete the 
corrective action as soon as practicable. Actions may include, but are 
not limited to:
    (i) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or 
filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in 
emissions.
    (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
    (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise 
repairing the control device.
    (iv) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment.
    (v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe, or otherwise 
repairing the bag leak detection system.
    (vi) Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.

    (a) You must conduct each performance test that applies to your 
affected source according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) To determine compliance with the emission limit for particulate 
matter from a control device applied to pushing emissions where a 
cokeside shed is the capture system, follow the test methods and 
procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. To determine 
compliance with a process-weighted mass rate of particulate matter (lb/
ton of coke) from a control device applied to pushing emissions where a 
cokeside shed is not used, follow the test methods and procedures in 
paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) Determine the concentration of particulate matter according to 
the following test methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
    (i) Method 1 to select sampling port locations and the number of 
traverse points. Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the 
control device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.

periods of actual pushing when the capture system fan and control device 
are engaged. Collect a minimum sample volume of 30 dry standard cubic 
feet of gas during each test run. Three valid test runs are needed to 
comprise a performance test. Each run must start at the beginning of a 
push and finish at the end of a push (i.e., sample for an integral 
number of pushes).
    (3) Determine the total combined weight in tons of coke pushed 
during the duration of each test run according to the procedures in your 
source test plan for calculating coke yield from the quantity of coal 
charged to an individual oven.
    (4) Compute the process-weighted mass emissions (E<INF>p</INF>) for 
each test run using Equation 1 of this section as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14AP03.001

Where:

E<INF>p</INF> = Process weighted mass emissions of particulate matter, 
lb/ton;
C = Concentration of particulate matter, gr/dscf;
Q = Volumetric flow rate of stack gas, dscf/hr;
T = Total time during a run that a sample is withdrawn from the stack

Sec. 63.7332  How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate 
continuous compliance?

    (a) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and 
required quality assurance or control activities (including as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), 
you must monitor continuously (or collect data at all required 
intervals) at all times the affected source is operating.
    (b) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities 
in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating 
levels, or in fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement, if 
applicable. You must use all the data collected during all other periods 
in assessing compliance. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, 
infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitor to provide 
valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor 
maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.

<R05>
Sec. 63.7334  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the 
work practice standards that apply to me?

    (a) For each by-product coke oven battery with vertical flues 
subject to the work practice standards for fugitive pushing emissions in 
Sec. 63.7291(a), you must demonstrate continuous compliance according 
to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section:
    (1) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive emissions for four 
consecutive pushes per operating day, except you may make fewer or non-
consecutive observations as permitted by Sec. 63.7291(a)(3). Maintain 
records of the pushing schedule for each oven and records indicating the 
legitimate operational reason for any change in the pushing schedule 
according to Sec. 63.7291(a)(4).
    (2) Observe and record the opacity of fugitive emissions from each 
oven in a battery at least once every 90 days. If an oven cannot be 
observed during a 90-day period, observe and record the opacity of the 
first push of that oven following the close of the 90-day period that 
can be read in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) 
through (8) of this section.
    (3) Make all observations and calculations for opacity observations 
of fugitive pushing emissions in accordance with Method 9 in appendix A 
to 40 CFR part 60 using a Method 9 certified observer unless you have an 
approved alternative procedure under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
    (4) Record pushing opacity observations at 15-second intervals as 
required in section 2.4 of Method 9 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). The 
requirement in section 2.4 of Method 9 for a minimum of 24 observations 
does not apply, and the data reduction requirements in section 2.5 of 
Method 9 do not apply. The requirement in Sec. 63.6(h)(5)(ii)(B) for 
obtaining at least 3 hours of observations (thirty 6-minute averages) to 
demonstrate initial compliance does not apply.
    (5) If fewer than six but at least four 15-second observations can 
be made, use the average of the total number of observations to 
calculate average opacity for the push. Missing one or more observations 
during the push (e.g., as the quench car passes behind a building) does 
not invalidate the observations before or after the interference for 
that push. However, a minimum of four 15-second readings must be made 
for a valid observation.
    (6) Begin observations for a push at the first detectable movement 
of the coke mass. End observations of a push when the quench car enters 
the quench tower.
    (i) For a battery without a cokeside shed, observe fugitive pushing 
emissions from a position at least 10 meters from the quench car that 
provides an unobstructed view and avoids interferences from the topside 
of the battery. This may require the observer to be positioned at an 
angle to the quench car rather than perpendicular to it. Typical 
interferences to avoid include emissions from open standpipes and 
charging. Observe the opacity of emissions above the battery top with 
the sky as the background where possible. Record the oven number of any 
push not observed because of obstructions or interferences.
    (ii) For a battery with a cokeside shed, the observer must be in a 
position that provides an unobstructed view and avoids interferences 
from the topside of the battery. Typical interferences to avoid include 
emissions from open standpipes and charging. Observations must include 
any fugitive emissions that escape from the top of the shed, from the 
ends of the shed, or from the area where the shed is joined to the 
battery. If the observer does not have a clear view to identify when a 
push starts or ends, a second person can be positioned to signal the 
start or

[[Page 90]]

end of the push and notify the observer when to start or end the 
observations. Radio communications with other plant personnel (e.g., 
pushing ram operator or quench car operator) may also serve to notify 
the observer of the start or end of a push. Record the oven number of 
any push not observed because of obstructions or interferences.
    (iii) You may reposition after the push to observe emissions during 
travel if necessary.
    (7) If it is infeasible to implement the procedures in paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (6) of this section for an oven due to physical 
obstructions, nighttime pushes, or other reasons, you may apply to your 
permitting authority for permission to use an alternative procedure. The 
application must provide a detailed explanation of why it is infeasible 
to use the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section, 
identify the oven and battery numbers, and describe the alternative 
procedure. An alternative procedure must identify whether the coke in 
that oven is not completely coked, either before, during, or after an 
oven is pushed.
    (8) For each oven observed that exceeds an opacity of 30 percent for 
any short battery or 35 percent for any tall battery, you must take 
corrective action and/or increase the coking time in accordance with 
Sec. 63.7291(a). Maintain records documenting conformance with the 
requirements in Sec. 63.7291(a).
    (b) For each by-product coke oven battery with horizontal flues 
subject to the work practice standards for fugitive pushing emissions in 
Sec. 63.7292(a), you must demonstrate continuous compliance by having 
met the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section:
    (1) Measuring and recording the temperature of all flues on two 
ovens per day within 2 hours before the oven's scheduled pushing time 
and ensuring that the temperature of each oven is measured and recorded 
at least once every month;
    (2) Recording the time each oven is charged and pushed and 
calculating and recording the net coking time for each oven; and
    (3) Increasing the coking time for each oven that falls below the 
minimum flue temperature trigger established for that oven's coking time 
in the written plan required in Sec. 63.7292(a)(1), assigning the oven 
to the oven-directed program, and recording all relevant information 
according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7292(a)(4) including, but not 
limited to, daily pushing schedules, diagnostic procedures, corrective 
actions, and oven repairs.
    (c) For each non-recovery coke oven battery subject to the work 
practice standards in Sec. 63.7293(a), you must demonstrate continuous 
compliance by maintaining records that document each visual inspection 
of an oven prior to pushing and that the oven was not pushed unless 
there was no smoke in the open space above the coke bed and there was an 
unobstructed view of the door on the opposite side of the oven.
    (d) For each by-product coke oven battery subject to the work 
practice standard for soaking in Sec. 63.7294(a), you must demonstrate 
continuous compliance by maintaining records that document conformance 
with requirements in Sec. 63.7294(a)(1) through (5).
    (e) For each coke oven battery subject to the work practice standard 
for quenching in Sec. 63.7295(b), you must demonstrate continuous 
compliance according to the requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) through 
(3) of this section:
    (1) Maintaining baffles in each quench tower such that no more than 
5 percent of the cross-sectional area of the tower is uncovered or open 
to the sky as required in Sec. 63.7295(b)(1);
    (2) Maintaining records that document conformance with the washing, 
inspection, and repair requirements in Sec. 63.7295(b)(2), including 
records of the ambient temperature on any day that the baffles were not 
washed; and
    (3) Maintaining records of the source of makeup water to document 
conformance with the requirement for acceptable makeup water in Sec. 
63.7295(a)(2).


<R05>
Sec. 63.7335  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the 
operation and maintenance requirements that apply to me?

document conformance with these requirements; and
    (3) Initiating and completing corrective action for a bag leak 
detection system alarm according to Sec. 63.7300(c)(3) and recording 
all information needed to document conformance with these requirements. 
This includes records of the times the bag leak detection system alarm 
sounds, and for each valid alarm, the time you initiated corrective 
action, the corrective action(s) taken, and the date on which corrective 
action is completed.
    (c) To demonstrate continuous compliance with the operation and 
maintenance requirements for a baghouse applied to pushing emissions 
from a coke oven battery in Sec. 63.7331(a), you must inspect and 
maintain each baghouse according to the requirements in Sec. 
63.7331(a)(1) through (8) and record all information needed to document 
conformance with these requirements. If you increase or decrease the 
sensitivity of the bag leak detection system beyond the limits specified 
in Sec. 63.7331(a)(6), you must include a copy of the required written 
certification by a responsible official in the next semiannual 
compliance report.
    (d) You must maintain a current copy of the operation and 
maintenance plans required in Sec. 63.7300(b) and (c) onsite and 
available for inspection upon request. You must keep the plans for the

       Testing, Fuel Analyses, and Initial Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.7510  What are my initial compliance requirements and by what
date must I conduct them?

    (a) For affected sources that elect to demonstrate compliance with 
any of the emission limits of this subpart through performance testing, 
your initial compliance requirements include conducting performance 
tests according to Sec. 63.7520 and Table 5 to this subpart, conducting 
a fuel analysis for each type of fuel burned in your boiler or process 
heater according to Sec. 63.7521 and Table 6 to this subpart, 
establishing operating limits according to Sec. 63.7530 and Table 7 to 
this subpart, and conducting CMS performance evaluations according to 
Sec. 63.7525.
    (b) For affected sources that elect to demonstrate compliance with 
the emission limits for HCl, mercury, or TSM through fuel analysis, your 
initial compliance requirement is to conduct a fuel analysis for each 
type of fuel burned in your boiler or process heater according to Sec. 
63.7521 and Table 6 to this subpart and establish operating limits 
according to Sec. 63.7530 and Table 8 to this subpart.
    (c) For affected sources that have an applicable work practice 
standard, your initial compliance requirements depend on the subcategory 
and rated capacity of your boiler or process heater. If your boiler or 
process heater is in any of the limited use subcategories or has a heat 
input capacity less than 100 MMBtu per hour, your initial compliance 
demonstration is conducting a performance test for carbon monoxide 
according to Table 5 to this subpart. If your boiler or process heater 
is in any of the large subcategories and has a heat input capacity of 
100 MMBtu per hour or greater, your initial compliance demonstration is 
conducting a performance evaluation of your continuous emission 
monitoring system for carbon monoxide according to Sec. 63.7525(a).
    (d) For existing affected sources, you must demonstrate initial 
compliance no later than 180 days after the compliance date that is 
specified for your source in Sec. 63.7495 and according to the

[[Page 102]]

applicable provisions in Sec. 63.7(a)(2) as cited in Table 10 to this 
subpart.
    (e) If your new or reconstructed affected source commenced 
construction or reconstruction between January 13, 2003 and November 12, 
2004, you must demonstrate initial compliance with either the proposed 
emission limits and work practice standards or the promulgated emission 
limits and work practice standards no later than 180 days after November 
12, 2004 or within 180 days after startup of the source, whichever is 
later, according to Sec. 63.7(a)(2)(ix).
    (f) If your new or reconstructed affected source commenced 
construction or reconstruction between January 13, 2003, and November 
12, 2004, and you chose to comply with the proposed emission limits and 
work practice standards when demonstrating initial compliance, you must 
conduct a second compliance demonstration for the promulgated emission 
limits and work practice standards within 3 years after November 12, 
2004 or within 3 years after startup of the affected source, whichever 
is later.
    (g) If your new or reconstructed affected source commences 
construction or reconstruction after November 12, 2004, you must 
demonstrate initial compliance with the promulgated emission limits and 
work practice standards no later than 180 days after startup of the 
source.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7515  When must I conduct subsequent performance tests
or fuel analyses?

    (a) You must conduct all applicable performance tests according to 
Sec. 63.7520 on an annual basis, unless you follow the requirements 
listed in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section. Annual performance 
tests must be completed between 10 and 12 months after the previous 
performance test, unless you follow the requirements listed in 
paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
    (b) You can conduct performance tests less often for a given 
pollutant if your performance tests for the pollutant (particulate 
matter, HCl, mercury, or TSM) for at least 3 consecutive years show that 
you comply with the emission limit. In this case, you do not have to 
conduct a performance test for that pollutant for the next 2 years. You 
must conduct a performance test during the third year and no more than 
36 months after the previous performance test.
    (c) If your boiler or process heater continues to meet the emission 
limit for particulate matter, HCl, mercury, or TSM, you may choose to 
conduct performance tests for these pollutants every third year, but 
each such performance test must be conducted no more than 36 months 
after the previous performance test.
    (d) If a performance test shows noncompliance with an emission limit 
for particulate matter, HCl, mercury, or TSM, you must conduct annual 
performance tests for that pollutant until all performance tests over a 
consecutive 3-year period show compliance.
    (e) If you have an applicable work practice standard for carbon 
monoxide and your boiler or process heater is in any of the limited use 
subcategories or has a heat input capacity less than 100 MMBtu per hour, 
you must conduct annual performance tests for carbon monoxide according 
to Sec. 63.7520. Each annual performance test must be conducted between 
10 and 12 months after the previous performance test.
    (f) You must conduct a fuel analysis according to Sec. 63.7521 for 
each type of fuel burned no later than 5 years after the previous fuel 
analysis for each fuel type. If you burn a new type of fuel, you must 
conduct a fuel analysis before burning the new type of fuel in your 
boiler or process heater. You must still meet all applicable continuous 
compliance requirements in Sec. 63.7540.
    (g) You must report the results of performance tests and fuel 
analyses within 60 days after the completion of the performance tests or 
fuel analyses. This report should also verify that the operating limits 
for your affected source have not changed or provide documentation of 
revised operating parameters established according to Sec. 63.7530 and 
Table 7 to this subpart, as applicable. The reports for all subsequent 
performance tests and fuel analyses should include all applicable 
information required in Sec. 63.7550.

[[Page 103]]


<R05>
Sec. 63.7520  What performance tests and procedures must I use?

    (a) You must conduct all performance tests according to Sec. 
63.7(c), (d), (f), and (h). You must also develop a site-specific test 
plan according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7(c) if you elect to 
demonstrate compliance through performance testing.
    (b) You must conduct each performance test according to the 
requirements in Table 5 to this subpart.
    (c) New or reconstructed boilers or process heaters in one of the 
liquid fuel subcategories that burn only fossil fuels and other gases 
and do not burn any residual oil must demonstrate compliance according 
to Sec. 63.7506(a).
    (d) You must conduct each performance test under the specific 
conditions listed in Tables 5 and 7 to this subpart. You must conduct 
performance tests at the maximum normal operating load while burning the 
type of fuel or mixture of fuels that have the highest content of 
chlorine, mercury, and total selected metals, and you must demonstrate 
initial compliance and establish your operating limits based on these 
tests. These requirements could result in the need to conduct more than 
one performance test.
    (e) You may not conduct performance tests during periods of startup, 
shutdown, or malfunction.
    (f) You must conduct three separate test runs for each performance 
test required in this section, as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(3). Each 
test run must last at least 1 hour.
    (g) To determine compliance with the emission limits, you must use 
the F-Factor methodology and equations in sections 12.2 and 12.3 of EPA 
Method 19 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter to convert the 
measured particulate matter concentrations, the measured HCl 
concentrations, the measured TSM concentrations, and the measured 
mercury concentrations that result from the initial performance test to 
pounds per million Btu heat input emission rates using F-factors.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7521  What fuel analyses and procedures must I use?

    (a) You must conduct fuel analyses according to the procedures in 
paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section and Table 6 to this subpart, 
as applicable.

before the date that you intend to demonstrate compliance.
    (2) You must include the information contained in paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section in your fuel analysis plan.
    (i) The identification of all fuel types anticipated to be burned in 
each boiler or process heater.
    (ii) For each fuel type, the notification of whether you or a fuel 
supplier will be conducting the fuel analysis.
    (iii) For each fuel type, a detailed description of the sample 
location and specific procedures to be used for collecting and preparing 
the composite samples if your procedures are different from paragraph 
(c) or (d) of this section. Samples should be collected at a location 
that most accurately represents the fuel type, where possible, at a 
point prior to mixing with other dissimilar fuel types.
    (iv) For each fuel type, the analytical methods, with the expected 
minimum detection levels, to be used for the measurement of selected 
total metals, chlorine, or mercury.
    (v) If you request to use an alternative analytical method other 
than those required by Table 6 to this subpart, you must also include a 
detailed description of the methods and procedures that will be used.
    (vi) If you will be using fuel analysis from a fuel supplier in lieu 
of site-specific sampling and analysis, the fuel supplier must use the 
analytical methods required by Table 6 to this subpart.
    (c) At a minimum, you must obtain three composite fuel samples for 
each fuel type according to the procedures in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of 
this section.
    (1) If sampling from a belt (or screw) feeder, collect fuel samples 
according to paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) Stop the belt and withdraw a 6-inch wide sample from the full

[[Page 104]]

section of the stopped belt to obtain a minimum two pounds of sample. 
Collect all the material (fines and coarse) in the full cross-section. 
Transfer the sample to a clean plastic bag.
    (ii) Each composite sample will consist of a minimum of three 
samples collected at approximately equal intervals during the testing 
period.
    (2) If sampling from a fuel pile or truck, collect fuel samples 
according to paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) For each composite sample, select a minimum of five sampling 
locations uniformly spaced over the surface of the pile.
    (ii) At each sampling site, dig into the pile to a depth of 18 
inches. Insert a clean flat square shovel into the hole and withdraw a 
sample, making sure that large pieces do not fall off during sampling.
    (iii) Transfer all samples to a clean plastic bag for further 
processing.

monitoring system (CEMS) for carbon monoxide according to the procedures 
in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section by the compliance date 
specified in Sec. 63.7495.
    (1) Each CEMS must be installed, operated, and maintained according 
to Performance Specification (PS) 4A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, and

to the requirements in Sec. 63.8 and according to PS 4A of 40 CFR part 
60, appendix B.
    (3) Each CEMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation 
(sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute 
period.
    (4) The CEMS data must be reduced as specified in Sec. 63.8(g)(2).
    (5) You must calculate and record a 30-day rolling average emission 
rate on a daily basis. A new 30-day rolling average emission rate is 
calculated as the average of all of the hourly CO emission data for the 
preceding 30 operating days.
    (6) For purposes of calculating data averages, you must not use data 
recorded during periods of monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, 
out-of-control periods, required quality assurance or control 
activities, or when your boiler or process heater is operating at less 
than 50 percent of its rated capacity. You must use all the data 
collected during all other periods in assessing compliance. Any period 
for which the monitoring system is out of control and data are not 
available for required calculations constitutes a deviation from the 
monitoring requirements.
    (b) If you have an applicable opacity operating limit, you must 
install, operate, certify and maintain each continuous opacity 
monitoring system (COMS) according to the procedures in paragraphs 
(b)(1) through (7) of this section by the compliance date specified in 
Sec. 63.7495.
    (1) Each COMS must be installed, operated, and maintained according 
to PS 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B.
    (2) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each COMS according 
to the requirements in Sec. 63.8 and according to PS 1 of 40 CFR part 
60, appendix B.

procedures and acceptance criteria for operating and maintaining each 
COMS according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8(d). At a minimum, the 
monitoring plan must include a daily calibration drift assessment, a 
quarterly performance audit, and an annual zero alignment audit of each 
COMS.
    (6) You must operate and maintain each COMS according to the 
requirements in the monitoring plan and the requirements of Sec. 
63.8(e). Identify periods the COMS is out of control including any 
periods that the COMS fails to pass a daily calibration drift 
assessment, a quarterly performance audit, or an annual zero alignment 
audit.
    (7) You must determine and record all the 6-minute averages (and 1-
hour block averages as applicable) collected for periods during which 
the COMS is not out of control.
    (c) If you have an operating limit that requires the use of a CMS, 
you must install, operate, and maintain each continuous parameter 
monitoring system (CPMS) according to the procedures in paragraphs 
(c)(1) through (5) of this section by the compliance date specified in 
Sec. 63.7495.

required quality assurance or control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), 
you must conduct all monitoring in continuous operation at all times 
that the unit is operating. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, 
infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring to 
provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor 
maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.
    (3) For purposes of calculating data averages, you must not use data 
recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out of 
control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities. 
You must use all the data collected during all other periods in 
assessing compliance. Any period for which the monitoring system is out-
of-control and data are not available for required calculations 
constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.
    (4) Determine the 3-hour block average of all recorded readings, 
except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

transducer calibration monthly.
    (6) Conduct calibration checks any time the sensor exceeds the 
manufacturer's specified maximum operating pressure range or install a 
new pressure sensor.
    (f) If you have an operating limit that requires the use of a pH 
measurement device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c) and 
(f)(1) through (3) of this section.

equipment to monitor voltage and secondary current (or total power 
input) of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP), you must use voltage and 
secondary current monitoring equipment to measure voltage and secondary 
current to the ESP.

hopper, or hopper flow measurement device), you must meet the 
requirements in paragraphs (c) and (h)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Locate the device in a position(s) that provides a 
representative measurement of the total sorbent injection rate.
    (2) Install and calibrate the device in accordance with 
manufacturer's procedures and specifications.

comply with the requirements of this subpart, you must install, 
calibrate, maintain, and continuously operate a bag leak detection 
system as specified in paragraphs (i)(1) through (8) of this section.
    (1) You must install and operate a bag leak detection system for

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.7535  How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate 
continuous compliance?

    (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section and 
the site-specific monitoring plan required by Sec. 63.7505(d).
    (b) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and 
required quality assurance or control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), 
you must monitor continuously (or collect data at all required 
intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating.
    (c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, or required quality assurance or control activities 
in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating 
levels. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in 
assessing the operation of the control device and associated control 
system. Boilers and process heaters that have an applicable carbon 
monoxide work practice standard and are required to install and operate 
a CEMS, may not use data recorded during periods when the boiler or 
process heater is operating at less than 50 percent of its rated 
capacity.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7540  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the 
emission limits and work practice standards?

    (a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission 
limit, operating limit, and work practice standard in Tables 1 through 4 
to this subpart that applies to you according to the methods specified 
in Table 8 to this subpart and paragraphs (a)(1) through (10) of this 
section.
    (1) Following the date on which the initial performance test is 
completed or is required to be completed under Sec. Sec. 63.7 and 
63.7510, whichever date comes first, you must not operate above any of 
the applicable maximum operating limits or below any of the applicable 
minimum operating limits listed in Tables 2 through 4 to this subpart at 
all times except during periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction. 
Operating limits do not apply during performance tests. Operation above 
the established maximum or below the established minimum operating 
limits shall constitute a deviation of established operating limits.
    (2) You must keep records of the type and amount of all fuels burned 
in each boiler or process heater during the reporting period to 
demonstrate that all fuel types and mixtures of fuels burned would 
either result in lower emissions of TSM, HCl, and mercury, than the 
applicable emission limit for each pollutant (if you demonstrate 
compliance through fuel analysis), or result in lower fuel input of TSM, 
chlorine, and mercury than the maximum values calculated during the last 
performance

[[Page 113]]

tests (if you demonstrate compliance through performance testing).
    (3) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable HCl emission 
limit through fuel analysis and you plan to burn a new type of fuel, you 
must recalculate the HCl emission rate using Equation 9 of Sec. 63.7530 
according to paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) You must determine the chlorine concentration for any new fuel 
type in units of pounds per million Btu, based on supplier data or your 
own fuel analysis, according to the provisions in your site-specific 
fuel analysis plan developed according to Sec. 63.7521(b).
    (ii) You must determine the new mixture of fuels that will have the 
highest content of chlorine.
    (iii) Recalculate the HCl emission rate from your boiler or process 
heater under these new conditions using Equation 9 of Sec. 63.7530. The 
recalculated HCl emission rate must be less than the applicable emission 
limit.
    (4) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable HCl emission 
limit through performance testing and you plan to burn a new type of 
fuel type or a new mixture of fuels, you must recalculate the maximum 
chlorine input using Equation 5 of Sec. 63.7530. If the results of 
recalculating the maximum chlorine input using Equation 5 of Sec. 
63.7530 are higher than the maximum chlorine input level established 
during the previous performance test, then you must conduct a new 
performance test within 60 days of burning the new fuel type or fuel 
mixture according to the procedures in Sec. 63.7520 to demonstrate that 
the HCl emissions do not exceed the emission limit. You must also 
establish new operating limits based on this performance test according 
to the procedures in Sec. 63.7530(c).
    (5) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable TSM emission 
limit through fuel analysis, and you plan to burn a new type of fuel, 
you must recalculate the TSM emission rate using Equation 10 of Sec. 
63.7530 according to the procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) 
through (iii) of this section.
    (i) You must determine the TSM concentration for any new fuel type 
in units of pounds per million Btu, based on supplier data or your own 
fuel analysis, according to the provisions in your site-specific fuel 
analysis plan developed according to Sec. 63.7521(b).
    (ii) You must determine the new mixture of fuels that will have the 
highest content of TSM.
    (iii) Recalculate the TSM emission rate from your boiler or process 
heater under these new conditions using Equation 10 of Sec. 63.7530. 
The recalculated TSM emission rate must be less than the applicable 
emission limit.
    (6) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable TSM emission 
limit through performance testing, and you plan to burn a new type of 
fuel or a new mixture of fuels, you must recalculate the maximum TSM 
input using Equation 6 of Sec. 63.7530. If the results of recalculating 
the maximum total selected metals input using Equation 6 of Sec. 
63.7530 are higher than the maximum TSM input level established during 
the previous performance test, then you must conduct a new performance 
test within 60 days of burning the new fuel type or fuel mixture 
according to the procedures in Sec. 63.7520 to demonstrate that the TSM 
emissions do not exceed the emission limit. You must also establish new 
operating limits based on this performance test according to the 
procedures in Sec. 63.7530(c).
    (7) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable mercury 
emission limit through fuel analysis, and you plan to burn a new type of 
fuel, you must recalculate the mercury emission rate using Equation 11 
of Sec. 63.7530 according to the procedures specified in paragraphs 
(a)(7)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) You must determine the mercury concentration for any new fuel 
type in units of pounds per million Btu, based on supplier data or your 
own fuel analysis, according to the provisions in your site-specific 
fuel analysis plan developed according to Sec. 63.7521(b).
    (ii) You must determine the new mixture of fuels that will have the 
highest content of mercury.
    (iii) Recalculate the mercury emission rate from your boiler or 
process heater under these new conditions using Equation 11 of Sec. 
63.7530. The recalculated mercury emission rate must be less than the 
applicable emission limit.

[[Page 114]]

    (8) If you demonstrate compliance with an applicable mercury 
emission limit through performance testing, and you plan to burn a new 
type of fuel or a new mixture of fuels, you must recalculate the maximum 
mercury input using Equation 7 of Sec. 63.7530. If the results of 
recalculating the maximum mercury input using Equation 7 of Sec. 
63.7530 are higher than the maximum mercury input level established 
during the previous performance test, then you must conduct a new 
performance test within 60 days of burning the new fuel type or fuel 
mixture according to the procedures in Sec. 63.7520 to demonstrate that 
the mercury emissions do not exceed the emission limit. You must also 
establish new operating limits based on this performance test according 
to the procedures in Sec. 63.7530(c).
    (9) If your unit is controlled with a fabric filter, and you 
demonstrate continuous compliance using a bag leak detection system, you 
must initiate corrective action within 1 hour of a bag leak detection 
system alarm and complete corrective actions as soon as practical, and 
operate and maintain the fabric filter system such that the alarm does 
not sound more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month 
period. You must also keep records of the date, time, and duration of 
each alarm, the time corrective action was initiated and completed, and 
a brief description of the cause of the alarm and the corrective action 
taken. You must also record the percent of the operating time during 
each 6-month period that the alarm sounds. In calculating this operating 
time percentage, if inspection of the fabric filter demonstrates that no 
corrective action is required, no alarm time is counted. If corrective 
action is required, each alarm shall be counted as a minimum of 1 hour. 
If you take longer than 1 hour to initiate corrective action, the alarm 
time shall be counted as the actual amount of time taken to initiate 
corrective action.
    (10) If you have an applicable work practice standard for carbon 
monoxide, and you are required to install a CEMS according to Sec. 
63.7525(a), then you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(10)(i) 
through (iii) of this section.
    (i) You must continuously monitor carbon monoxide according to 
Sec. Sec. 63.7525(a) and 63.7535.
    (ii) Maintain a carbon monoxide emission level below your applicable 
carbon monoxide work practice standard in Table 1 to this subpart at all 
times except during periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and when 
your boiler or process heater is operating at less than 50 percent of 
rated capacity.
    (iii) Keep records of carbon monoxide levels according to Sec. 
63.7555(b).
    (b) You must report each instance in which you did not meet each 
emission limit, operating limit, and work practice standard in Tables 1 
through 4 to this subpart that apply to you. You must also report each 
instance during a startup, shutdown, or malfunction when you did not 
meet each applicable emission limit, operating limit, and work practice 
standard. These instances are deviations from the emission limits and 
work practice standards in this subpart. These deviations must be 
reported according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7550.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations 
that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not 
violations if you demonstrate to the EPA Administrator's satisfaction 
that you were operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1). The EPA 
Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur during a 
period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations, according to 
the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).

information concerning deviations from any emission limit, operating 
limit, or work practice requirement in this subpart, submission of the 
compliance report satisfies any obligation to report the same deviations 
in the semiannual monitoring report. However, submission of a compliance 
report does not otherwise affect any obligation the affected source may 
have to report deviations from permit requirements to the permit 
authority.
    (g) If you operate a new gaseous fuel unit that is subject to the

Appendix A to Subpart DDDDD--Methodology and Criteria for Demonstrating 
        Eligibility for the Health-Based Compliance Alternatives

                         1. Purpose/Introduction

    This appendix provides the methodology and criteria for 
demonstrating that your affected source is eligible for the compliance 
alternative for the HCl emission limit and/or the total selected metals 
(TSM) emission limit. This appendix specifies emissions testing methods 
that you must use to determine HCl, chlorine, and manganese emissions 
from the affected units and what parts of the affected source facility 
must be included in the eligibility demonstration. You must demonstrate 
that your affected source is eligible for the health-based compliance 
alternatives using either a look-up table analysis (based on the look-up 
tables included in this appendix) or a site-specific compliance 
demonstration performed according to the criteria specified in this 
appendix. This appendix also specifies how and when you file any 
eligibility demonstrations for your affected source and how to show that 
your affected source remains eligible for the health-based compliance 
alternatives in the future.

2. Who Is Eligible To Demonstrate That They Qualify for the Health-Based 
                        Compliance Alternatives?

    Each new, reconstructed, or existing affected source may demonstrate 
that they are eligible for the health-based compliance alternatives. 
Section 63.7490 of subpart DDDDD defines the affected source and 
explains which affected sources are new, existing, or reconstructed.

  3. What Parts of My Facility Have To Be Included in the Health-Based 
                       Eligibility Demonstration?

    If you are attempting to determine your eligibility for the 
compliance alternative for HCl, you must include every emission point 
subject to subpart DDDDD that emits either HCl or Cl<INF>2</INF> in the 
eligibility demonstration.
    If you are attempting to determine your eligibility for the 
compliance alternative for TSM, you must include every emission point 
subject to subpart DDDDD that emits manganese in the eligibility 
demonstration.

      4. How Do I Determine HAP Emissions From My Affected Source?

    (a) You must conduct HAP emissions tests or fuel analysis for every 
emission point covered under subpart DDDDD within the affected source 
facility according to the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (f) of 
this section and the methods specified in Table 1 of this appendix.
    (1) If you are attempting to determine your eligibility for the 
compliance alternative for HCl, you must test the subpart DDDDD units at 
your facility for both HCl and Cl<INF>2</INF>. When conducting fuel 
analysis, you must assume any chlorine detected will be emitted as 
Cl<INF>2</INF>.
    (2) If you are attempting to determine your eligibility for the 
compliance alternative for TSM, you must test the subpart DDDDD units at 
your facility for manganese.
    (b) Periods when emissions tests must be conducted. (1) You must not 
conduct emissions tests during periods of startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction, as specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(1).
    (2) You must test under worst-case operating conditions as defined 
in this appendix. You must describe your worst-case operating conditions 
in your performance test report for the process and control systems (if 
applicable) and explain why the conditions are worst-case.
    (c) Number of test runs. You must conduct three separate test runs 
for each test required in this section, as specified in Sec. 
63.7(e)(3). Each test run must last at least 1 hour.
    (d) Sampling locations. Sampling sites must be located at the outlet 
of the control device and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.
    (e) Collection of monitoring data for HAP control devices. During 
the emissions test, you must collect operating parameter monitoring 
system data at least every 15 minutes during the entire emissions test 
and establish the site-specific operating requirements in Tables 3 or 4, 
as appropriate, of subpart DDDDD using data from the monitoring system 
and the procedures specified in Sec. 63.7530 of subpart DDDDD.
    (f) Nondetect data. You may treat emissions of an individual HAP as 
zero if all of the test runs result in a nondetect measurement and the 
condition in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is met for the manganese 
test method. Otherwise, nondetect data for individual HAP must be 
treated as one-half of the method detection limit.
    (1) For manganese measured using Method 29 in appendix A to 40 CFR 
part 60, you analyze samples using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).
    (g) You must determine the maximum hourly emission rate for each 
appropriate emission point according to Equation 1 of this appendix. An 
appropriate emission point is any emission point emitting HCl, 
Cl<INF>2</INF>, or Manganese from a subpart DDDDD emission unit.

Where:

E<INF>i,s</INF> = maximum hourly emission rate for HAP i at each 
emission point s associated with a subpart DDDDD emission unit j, lbs/hr
i = applicable HAP, where i = (HCl, Cl<INF>2</INF>, or Manganese) s = 
individual emission point
j = each subpart DDDDD emission unit associated with an emission point, 
s
t = total number of subpart DDDDD emission units associated with an 
emission point s
R<INF>i,j</INF> = emission rate (the 3-run average as determined 
according to table 1 of this appendix or the pollutant concentration in 
the fuel samples analyzed according to Sec. 63.7521) for HAP i at 
subpart DDDDD emission unit j associated with emission point s, lb per 
million Btu.
I<INF>j</INF> = Maximum rated heat input capacity of each subpart DDDDD 
unit j emitting HAP i associated with emission point s, million Btu per 
hour.

5. What Are the Criteria for Determining If My Facility Is Eligible for 
                the Health-Based Compliance Alternatives?

    (a) Determine the HAP emissions from each appropriate emission point 
within the affected source facility using the procedures specified in 
section 4 of this appendix.
    (b) Demonstrate that your facility is eligible for either of the 
health-based compliance alternatives using either the methods described 
in section 6 of this appendix (look-up table analysis) or section 7 of 
this appendix (site-specific compliance demonstration).
    (c) Your facility is eligible for the health-based compliance 
alternative for HCl if one of the following two statements is true:
    (1) The calculated HCl-equivalent emission rate is below the 
appropriate value in the look-up table;
    (2) Your site-specific compliance demonstration indicates that none 
of your HI values for HCl and CL<INF>2</INF> are greater than 1.0 at 
locations where people live or congregate (e.g., schools, daycare 
centers, etc.);
    (d) Your facility is eligible for the health-based compliance 
alternative for TSM if one of the following two statements is true:
    (1) The manganese emission rate for all your subpart DDDDD sources 
is below the appropriate value in the look-up table;
    (2) Your site-specific compliance demonstration indicates that none 
of your HQ values for manganese are greater than 1.0 at locations where 
people live or congregate (e.g., schools, daycare centers, etc.).

              6. How Do I Conduct a Look-Up Table Analysis?

    You may use look-up tables to demonstrate that your facility is 
eligible for either the compliance alternative for HCl emissions limit 
or the compliance alternative for the TSM emissions limit, unless your 
permitting authority determines that the look-up table analysis in this 
section is not applicable to your facility on technical grounds due to 
site-specific variations that are not accounted for in the look-up table 
analysis (e.g. presence of complex terrain, rain caps, or building 
downwash effects).
    (a) HCl compliance alternative. (1) Using the emission rates for HCl 
and Cl<INF>2</INF> determined according to section 4 of this appendix, 
calculate, using equation 2 of this appendix, the toxicity-weighted 
emission rate (expressed in HCl-equivalents) for each emission point 
that emits HCl or Cl<INF>2</INF> from any subpart DDDDD sources. Then, 
calculate the weighted average stack height using equation 3 of this 
appendix.

Where:

TW<INF>s</INF> = the toxicity-weighted emission rate (in HCl-equivalent) 
for each emission point s, lb/hr.
s = individual emission points
E<INF>HCl,s</INF> = the maximum hourly emission rate for HCl at emission 
point s, lb/hr
E<INF>Cl2,s</INF> = the maximum hourly emission rate for Cl<INF>2</INF> 
at emission point s, lb/hr
RV<INF>Cl2</INF> = the reference value for Cl<INF>2</INF>
RV<INF>HCl</INF> = the reference value for HCl
(reference values for HCl and Cl<INF>2</INF> can be found at http://
www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/toxsource/summary.html).

[[Page 143]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28DE05.002

Where:

H<INF>HCl</INF> = weighted average stack height for determining the 
maximum allowable HCl-equivalent emission rate (in Table 2 to this 
appendix), m.
s = individual emission points
n = total number of emission points
TW<INF>s</INF> = toxicity-weighted HCl-equivalent emission rate from 
each emission point (from equation 2), lb/hr.
H<INF>s</INF> = height of each individual stack, m
TW<INF>T</INF> = total toxicity-weighted HCl-equivalent emission rate 
from the source (summed for all emission points), lb/hr.

    (2) Calculate the total toxicity-weighted emission rate for your 
affected source by summing the toxicity-weighted emission rate for each 
appropriate subpart DDDDD emission point.
    (3) Using the weighted average stack height and the minimum distance 
between any appropriate subpart DDDDD emission point at the source and 
the property boundary, identify the appropriate maximum allowable 
toxicity weighted emission rate for your affected source, expressed in 
HCl-equivalents, from table 2 of this appendix. Appropriate emission 
points are those that emit HCl or Cl<INF>2</INF>, or both, from subpart 
DDDDD units. If one or both of these values does not match the exact 
values in the look-up tables, then use the next lowest table value. 
(Note: If your weighted average stack height is less than 5 meters (m), 
you must use the 5 meter row.) Your affected source is eligible to 
comply with the health-based alternative for HCl emissions if the value 
calculated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, determined using the 
methods specified in this appendix, does not exceed the appropriate 
value in table 2 of this appendix.
    (b) TSM Compliance Alternative. Using the emission rates for 
manganese determined according to section 4 of this appendix, calculate 
the total manganese emission rate for your affected source by summing 
the maximum hourly manganese emission rates for all your subpart DDDDD 
units. Identify the appropriate allowable emission rate in table 3 of 
this appendix for your affected source using the weighted average stack 
height value and the minimum distance between any appropriate subpart 
DDDDD emission point at the facility and the property boundary. 
Appropriate emission points are those that emit manganese from subpart 
DDDDD units. If one or both of these values does not match the exact 
values in the look-up tables, then use the next lowest table value. 
(Note: If your weighted average stack height is less than 5 meters, you 
must use the 5 meter row.) Your affected source is eligible to comply 
with the health-based alternative for manganese emissions and may 
exclude manganese when demonstrating compliance with the TSM emission 
limit if the total manganese emission rate, determined using the methods 
specified in this appendix, does not exceed the appropriate value 
specified in table 3 of this appendix.

H<INF>Mn</INF> = weighted average stack height for determining the 
maximum allowable emission rate for manganese (in table 3 to this 
appendix), m.
s = individual emission points
n = total number of emission points
E<INF>Mn,s</INF>= maximum hourly manganese emissions from emission point 
s, lbs/hr.
H<INF>s</INF> = height of each individual stack s
E<INF>Mn,T</INF> = total maximum hourly manganese emissions from 
affected source (sum emission rates from all emission points), lb/hr

      7. How Do I Conduct a Site-Specific Compliance Demonstration?

    If you fail to demonstrate that your facility is able to comply with 
one or both of the alternative health-based emission standards using the 
look-up table approach, you may choose to perform a site-specific 
compliance

[[Page 144]]

demonstration for your facility. You may use any scientifically-accepted 
peer-reviewed risk assessment methodology for your site-specific 
compliance demonstration. An example of one approach for performing a 
site-specific compliance demonstration for air toxics can be found in 
the EPA's ``Air Toxics Risk Assessment Reference Library, Volume 2, 
Site-Specific Risk Assessment Technical Resource Document'', which may 
be obtained through the EPA's Air Toxics Web site at http://www.epa.gov/
ttn/fera/risk--atoxic.html.
    (a) Your facility is eligible for the HCl alternative compliance 
option if your site-specific compliance demonstration shows that the 
maximum HI for HCl and Cl<INF>2</INF> from your subpart DDDDD sources is 
less than or equal to 1.0.
    (b) Your facility is eligible for the TSM alternative compliance 
option if your site-specific compliance demonstration shows that the 
maximum HQ for manganese from your subpart DDDDD sources is less than or 
equal to 1.0.
    (c) At a minimum, your site-specific compliance demonstration must:
    (1) Estimate long-term inhalation exposures through the estimation 
of annual or multi-year average ambient concentrations;
    (2) Estimate the inhalation exposure for the individual most exposed 
to the facility's emissions;
    (3) Use site-specific, quality-assured data wherever possible;
    (4) Use health-protective default assumptions wherever site-specific 
data are not available, and;
    (5) Contain adequate documentation of the data and methods used for 
the assessment so that it is transparent and can be reproduced by an 
experienced risk assessor and emissions measurement expert.
    (d) Your site-specific compliance demonstration need not:
    (1) Assume any attenuation of exposure concentrations due to the 
penetration of outdoor pollutants into indoor exposure areas;
    (2) Assume any reaction or deposition of the emitted pollutants 
during transport from the emission point to the point of exposure.

     8. What Must My Health-Based Eligibility Demonstration Contain?

    (a) Your health-based eligibility demonstration must contain, at a 
minimum, the information specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of 
this section.
    (1) Identification of each appropriate emission point at the 
affected source facility, including the maximum rated capacity of each 
appropriate emission point.
    (2) Stack parameters for each appropriate emission point including, 
but not limited to, the parameters listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) 
through (iv) below:
    (i) Emission release type.

from each appropriate emission point.
    (3) Emission test reports for each pollutant and appropriate 
emission point which has been tested using the test methods specified in 
Table 1 of this appendix, including a description of the process 
parameters identified as being worst case. Fuel analyses for each fuel 
and emission point which has been conducted including collection and 
analytical methods used.
    (4) Identification of the RfC values used in your look-up table 
analysis or site-specific compliance demonstration.
    (5) Calculations used to determine the HCl-equivalent or manganese 
emission rates according to sections 6(a) or (b) of this appendix.
    (6) Identification of the controlling process factors (including, 
but not limited to, fuel type, heat input rate, type of control devices, 
process parameters reflecting the emissions rates used for your 
eligibility demonstration) that will become Federally enforceable permit 
conditions used to show that your facility remains eligible for the 
health-based compliance alternatives.
    (b) If you use the look-up table analysis in section 6 of this 
appendix to demonstrate that your facility is eligible for either 
health-based compliance alternative, your eligibility demonstration must 
contain, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) 
through (3) of this section.
    (1) Calculations used to determine the weighted average stack height 
of the subpart DDDDD emission points that emit manganese, HCl, or 
Cl<INF>2</INF>.
    (2) Identification of the subpart DDDDD emission point, that emits

the property boundary of the facility.
    (3) Comparison of the values in the look-up tables (Tables 2 and 3 
of this appendix) to your maximum HCl-equivalent or manganese emission 
rates.
    (c) If you use a site-specific compliance demonstration as described 
in section 7 of this appendix to demonstrate that your facility is 
eligible, your eligibility demonstration must contain, at a minimum, the 
information in paragraphs (a) and (c)(1) through (7) of this section:
    (1) Identification of the risk assessment methodology used.
    (2) Documentation of the fate and transport model used.
    (3) Documentation of the fate and transport model inputs, including 
the information described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this 
section converted to the dimensions required for the model and all of

that apply: meteorological data; building, land use, and terrain data; 
receptor locations and population data; and other facility-specific 
parameters input into the model.
    (4) Documentation of the fate and transport model outputs.
    (5) Documentation of any exposure assessment and risk 
characterization calculations.
    (6) Comparison of the HQ HI to the limit of 1.0.
    (d) To be eligible for either health-based compliance alternative, 
the parameters that defined your affected source as eligible for the 
health-based compliance alternatives must be submitted to your 
permitting authority for incorporation into your title V permit, as 
federally enforceable limits, at the same time you submit your health-
based eligibility demonstration. These parameters include, but are not 
limited to, fuel type, fuel mix (annual average), emission rate, type of 
control devices, process parameters (e.g., maximum heat input), and non-
process parameters (e.g., stack height).

  9. When Do I Have To Complete and Submit My Health-Based Eligibility 
                             Demonstration?

    (a) If you have an existing affected source, you must complete and 
submit your eligibility demonstration to your permitting authority, 
along with a signed certification that the demonstration is an accurate 
depiction of your facility, no later than the date one year prior to the 
compliance date of subpart DDDDD. A separate copy of the eligibility 
demonstration must be submitted to: U.S. EPA, Risk and Exposure 
Assessment Group, Emission Standards Division (C404-01), Attn: Group 
Leader, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, electronic mail 
address REAG@epa.gov.
    (b) If you have a new or reconstructed affected source that starts 
up before the effective date of subpart DDDDD, or an affected source 
that is an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to 
emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP before the effective 
date of subpart DDDDD, then you may submit an eligibility demonstration 
at any time after September 13, 2004 but you must comply with the 
emissions limits in table 1 to this subpart and all other requirements 
of subpart DDDDD until your eligibility demonstration is submitted to 
your permitting authority in accordance with the requirements of section 
10 of this appendix.
    (c) If you have a new or reconstructed affected source that starts 
up after the effective date of subpart DDDDD, or an affected source that 
is an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit 
such that it becomes a major source of HAP after the effective date for 
subpart DDDDD, then you must follow the schedule in paragraphs (c)(1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (1) You must complete and submit a preliminary eligibility 
demonstration based on the information (e.g., equipment types, estimated 
emission rates, process and non-process parameters, reference values, 
etc.) that will be used to apply for your title V permit. This 
preliminary eligibility demonstration must be submitted with your 
application for approval of construction or reconstruction. You must 
base your preliminary eligibility demonstration on the maximum emissions 
allowed under your title V permit. If the preliminary eligibility 
demonstration indicates that your affected source facility is eligible 
for either compliance alternative, then you may start up your new 
affected source and your new affected source will be considered in 
compliance with the alternative standard and subject to the compliance 
requirements in this appendix.
    (2) You must conduct the emission tests or analyses specified in 
section 4 of this appendix upon initial startup and use the results of 
these emissions tests to complete and submit your eligibility 
demonstration within 180 days following your initial startup date.

     10. When Do I Become Eligible for the Health-Based Compliance 
                              Alternatives?

    (a) For existing sources, new sources, or reconstructed sources that 
start up before the effective date of subpart DDDDD, or an affected 
source that is an area source that increases its emissions or its 
potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP before the 
effective date of subpart DDDDD, you are eligible to comply with a 
health-based compliance alternative upon submission of a complete 
demonstration meeting all the requirements of paragraph 8 for the 
applicable alternative. However, your eligibility demonstration may be 
reviewed by the permitting authority or by EPA to verify that the 
demonstration meets the requirements of appendix A to this subpart and 
is technically sound (i.e. use of the look-up tables is appropriate or 
the site-specific assessment is technically valid). If you are notified 
by the permitting authority or by EPA of any deficiencies in your 
submission, then you are not eligible for the health-based compliance 
alternative until the permitting authority or EPA verifies that the 
deficiencies are corrected.
    (b) For new or reconstructed sources that start up after the 
effective date of subpart DDDDD, you are eligible to comply with a the 
health-based compliance alternatives upon submission of a complete 
preliminary eligibility determination in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(1) of section 9 that demonstrates your affected source is eligible 
for the applicable alternative. You may then start up your source and 
conduct the necessary testing in accordance with paragraph

[[Page 146]]

(c)(2) of section 9. The eligibility demonstration submitted in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of section 9 may be reviewed by the 
permitting authority or by EPA to verify that the demonstration meets 
the requirements of appendix A to this subpart and is technically sound 
(i.e. use of the look-up tables is appropriate or the site-specific 
assessment is technically valid). If you are notified in writing by the 
permitting authority of any deficiencies in your submission, then you 
have 30 days to correct the deficiencies unless the permitting authority 
agrees to extend this time to a period not to exceed 90 days. If the 
deficiencies are not corrected within the applicable time period, you 
will not be eligible for the health-based compliance alternative until 
the permitting authority verifies that the deficiencies are corrected.
    (c) If the title V permit conditions requested in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of section 8 are disapproved by the permitting authority, 
then your affected source must comply with the applicable emission 
limits, operating limits, and work practice standards in subpart DDDDD 
by the compliance dates specified in Sec. 63.7495. Until the requested 
conditions (or alternative conditions meeting the requirements of 
paragraph (d) of section 8) are incorporated into the permit, compliance 
with the proposed conditions shall be considered compliance with the 
health-based alternative.

  11. How Do I Ensure That My Facility Remains Eligible for the Health-
                     Based Compliance Alternatives?

    (a) You must update your eligibility demonstration and resubmit it 
each time that any of the parameters that defined your affected source 
as eligible for the health-based compliance alternatives changes in a 
way that could result in increased HAP emissions or increased risk from 
exposure to emissions. These parameters include, but are not limited to, 
fuel type, fuel mix (annual average), type of control devices, HAP 
emission rate, stack height, process parameters (e.g., heat input 
capacity), relevant reference values, and locations where people live).
    (b) If you are updating your eligibility demonstration to account 
for an action in paragraph (a) of this section that is under your 
control (e.g. change in heat input capacity of your boiler), you must 
submit your revised eligibility demonstration to the permitting 
authority prior to making the change and revise your permit to 
incorporate the change. If your affected source is no longer eligible 
for the health-based compliance alternatives, then you must comply with 
the applicable emission limits, operating limits, and compliance 
requirements in subpart DDDDD prior to making the process change and 
revising your permit. If you are updating your eligibility demonstration 
to account for an action in paragraph (a) of this section that is 
outside of your control (e.g. change in a reference value), and that 
change causes your source to no longer be able to meet the criteria for 
the health-based compliance alternatives, your source must comply with 
the applicable emission limits, operating limits, and compliance 
requirements in subpart DDDDD within 3 years.
    (c) Your revised eligibility demonstration may be reviewed by the 
permitting authority or EPA to verify that the demonstration meets the 
requirements of appendix A to this subpart and is technically sound 
(i.e. use of the look-up tables is appropriate or the site-specific 
assessment is technically valid). If you are notified by the permitting 
authority or EPA of any deficiencies in your submission, you will not 
remain eligible for the health-based compliance alternatives until the 
permitting authority or EPA verifies that the deficiencies are 
corrected.

                      12. What Records Must I Keep?

    You must keep records of the information used in developing the 
eligibility demonstration for your affected source, including all of the 
information specified in section 8 of this appendix.

                             13. Definitions

    The definitions in Sec. 63.7575 of subpart DDDDD apply to this 
appendix. Additional definitions applicable for this appendix are as 
follows:
    Hazard Index (HI) means the sum of more than one hazard quotient for 
multiple substances and/or multiple exposure pathways.
    Hazard Quotient (HQ) means the ratio of the predicted media 
concentration of a pollutant to the media concentration at which no 
adverse effects are expected. For inhalation exposures, the HQ is 
calculated as the air concentration divided by the RfC.
    Look-up table analysis means a risk screening analysis based on 
comparing the HAP or HAP-equivalent emission rate from the affected 
source to the appropriate maximum allowable HAP or HAP-equivalent 
emission rates specified in Tables 2 and 3 of this appendix.
    Reference Concentration (RfC) means an estimate (with uncertainty 
spanning perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation 
exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is 
likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a 
lifetime. It can be derived from various types of human or animal data, 
with uncertainty factors generally applied to reflect limitations of the 
data used.
    Worst-case operating conditions means operation of an affected unit 
during emissions testing under the conditions that result in the highest 
HAP emissions or that result in

[[Page 147]]

the emissions stream composition (including HAP and non-HAP) that is 
most challenging for the control device if a control device is used. For 
example, worst-case conditions could include operation of an affected 
unit firing solid fuel likely to produce the most HAP.

                         Work Practice Standards


<R05>
Sec. 63.7700  What work practice standards must I meet?

    (a) For each segregated scrap storage area, bin or pile, you must 
either comply with the certification requirements in paragraph (b) of 
this section, or prepare and implement a plan for the selection and 
inspection of scrap according to the requirements in paragraph

[[Page 152]]

(c) of this section. You may have certain scrap subject to paragraph (b) 
of this section and other scrap subject to paragraph (c) of this section 
at your facility provided the scrap remains segregated until charge 
make-up.
    (b) You must prepare and operate at all times according to a written 
certification that the foundry purchases and uses only metal ingots, pig 
iron, slitter, or other materials that do not include post-consumer 
automotive body scrap, post-consumer engine blocks, post-consumer oil 
filters, oily turnings, lead components, mercury switches, plastics, or 
free organic liquids. For the purpose of this paragraph (b), ``free 
organic liquids'' is defined as material that fails the paint filter 
test by EPA Method 9095A, ``Paint Filter Liquids Test'' (Revision 1, 
December 1996), as published in EPA Publication SW-846 ``Test Methods 
for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'' (incorporated by 
reference--see Sec. 63.14). Any post-consumer engine blocks, post-
consumer oil filters, or oily turnings that are processed and/or cleaned 
to the extent practicable such that the materials do not include lead 
components, mercury switches, plastics, or free organic liquids can be 
included in this certification.
    (c) You must prepare and operate at all times according to a written 
plan for the selection and inspection of iron and steel scrap to 
minimize, to the extent practicable, the amount of organics and HAP 
metals in the charge materials used by the iron and steel foundry. This 
scrap selection and inspection plan is subject to approval by the 
Administrator. You must keep a copy of the plan onsite and readily 
available to all plant personnel with materials acquisition or 
inspection duties. You must provide a copy of the material 
specifications to each of your scrap vendors. Each plan must include the 
information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) A materials acquisition program to limit organic contaminants 
according to the requirements in paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this 
section, as applicable.
    (i) For scrap charged to a scrap preheater, electric arc metal 
melting furnace, or electric induction metal melting furnaces, 
specifications for scrap materials to be depleted (to the extent 
practicable) of the presence of used oil filters, plastic parts, organic 
liquids, and a program to ensure the scrap materials are drained of free 
liquids; or
    (ii) For scrap charged to a cupola metal melting furnace, 
specifications for scrap materials to be depleted (to the extent 
practicable) of the presence of plastic, and a program to ensure the 
scrap materials are drained of free liquids.
    (2) A materials acquisition program specifying that the scrap 
supplier remove accessible mercury switches from the trunks and hoods of 
any automotive bodies contained in the scrap and remove accessible lead 
components such as batteries and wheel weights. You must obtain and 
maintain onsite a copy of the procedures used by the scrap supplier for 
either removing accessible mercury switches or for purchasing automobile 
bodies that have had mercury switches removed, as applicable.
    (3) Procedures for visual inspection of a representative portion, 
but not less than 10 percent, of all incoming scrap shipments to ensure 
the materials meet the specifications.
    (i) The inspection procedures must identify the location(s) where 
inspections are to be performed for each type of shipment. Inspections 
may be performed at the scrap supplier's facility. The selected 
location(s) must provide a reasonable vantage point, considering worker 
safety, for visual inspection.
    (ii) The inspection procedures must include recordkeeping 
requirements that document each visual inspection and the results.
    (iii) The inspection procedures must include provisions for 
rejecting or returning entire or partial scrap shipments that do not 
meet specifications and limiting purchases from vendors whose shipments 
fail to meet specifications for more than three inspections in one 
calender year.
    (iv) If the inspections are performed at the scrap supplier's 
facility, the inspection procedures must include an explanation of how 
the periodic inspections ensure that not less than 10 percent of scrap 
purchased from each supplier is subject to inspection.

[[Page 153]]

    (d) For each furan warm box mold or core making line in a new or 
existing iron and steel foundry, you must use a binder chemical 
formulation that does not contain methanol as a specific ingredient of 
the catalyst formulation as determined by the Material Safety Data 
Sheet. This requirement does not apply to the resin portion of the 
binder system.
    (e) For each scrap preheater at an existing iron and steel foundry, 
you must meet either the requirement in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this 
section. As an alternative to the requirement in paragraph (e)(1) or (2) 
of this section, you must meet the VOHAP emissions limit in Sec. 
63.7690(a)(9).
    (1) You must install, operate, and maintain a gas-fired preheater 
where the flame directly contacts the scrap charged; or
    (2) You must charge only material that is subject to and in 
compliance with the scrap certification requirement in paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (f) For each scrap preheater at a new iron and steel foundry, you 
must charge only material that is subject to and in compliance with the 
scrap certification requirement in paragraph (b) of this section. As an 
alternative to this requirement, you must meet the VOHAP emissions limit 
in Sec. 63.7690(a)(9).

                 Operation and Maintenance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.7710  What are my operation and maintenance requirements?

    (a) As required by Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i), you must always operate and 
maintain your iron and steel foundry, including air pollution control 
and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution 
control practices for minimizing emissions at least to the levels 
required by this subpart.
    (b) You must prepare and operate at all times according to a written 
operation and maintenance plan for each capture and collection system 
and control device for an emissions source subject to an emissions limit 
in Sec. 63.7690(a). Your operation and maintenance plan also must 
include procedures for igniting gases from mold vents in pouring areas 
and pouring stations that use a sand mold system. This operation and 
maintenance plan is subject to approval by the Administrator. Each plan 
must contain the elements described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of 
this section.
    (1) Monthly inspections of the equipment that is important to the 
performance of the total capture system (i.e., pressure sensors, 
dampers, and damper switches). This inspection must include observations 
of the physical appearance of the equipment (e.g., presence of holes in 
the ductwork or hoods, flow constrictions caused by dents or accumulated 
dust in the ductwork, and fan erosion). The operation and maintenance 
plan must also include requirements to repair the defect or deficiency 
as soon as practicable.
    (2) Operating limits for each capture system for an emissions source 
subject to an emissions limit or standard for VOHAP or TEA in Sec. 
63.7690(a)(8) through (11). You must establish the operating according 
to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this 
section.
    (i) Select operating limit parameters appropriate for the capture 
system design that are representative and reliable indicators of the 
performance of the capture system. At a minimum, you must use 
appropriate operating limit parameters that indicate the level of the 
ventilation draft and damper position settings for the capture system 
when operating to collect emissions, including revised settings for 
seasonal variations. Appropriate operating limit parameters for 
ventilation draft include, but are not limited to: volumetric flow rate 
through each separately ducted hood, total volumetric flow rate at the 
inlet to the control device to which the capture system is vented, fan 
motor amperage, or static pressure. Any parameter for damper position 
setting may be used that indicates the duct damper position related to 
the fully open setting.
    (ii) For each operating limit parameter selected in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i) of this section, designate the value or setting for the 
parameter at which the capture system operates during the

process operation. If your operation allows for more than one process to 
be operating simultaneously, designate the value or setting for the 
parameter at which the capture system operates during each possible 
configuration that you may operate (i.e., the operating limits with one 
furnace melting, two melting, as applicable to your plant).
    (iii) Include documentation in your plan to support your selection 
of the operating limits established for your capture system. This 
documentation must include a description of the capture system design, a 
description of the capture system operating during production, a 
description of each selected operating limit parameter, a rationale for 
why you chose the parameter, a description of the method used to monitor 
the parameter according to the requirements of Sec. 63.7740(a), and the 
data used to set the value or setting for the parameter for each of your 
process configurations.
    (3) Preventative maintenance plan for each control device, including 
a preventative maintenance schedule that is consistent with the 
manufacturer's instructions for routine and long-term maintenance.
    (4) A site-specific monitoring plan for each bag leak detection 
system. For each bag leak detection system that operates on the 
triboelectric effect, the monitoring plan must be consistent with the 
recommendations contained in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
guidance document ``Fabric Filter Bag Leak Detection Guidance'' (EPA-
454/R-98-015). This baghouse monitoring plan is subject to approval by 
the Administrator. The owner or operator shall operate and maintain the 
bag leak detection system according to the site-specific monitoring plan 
at all times. The plan must address all of the items identified in 
paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) Installation of the bag leak detection system.
    (ii) Initial and periodic adjustment of the bag leak detection 
system including how the alarm set-point will be established.
    (iii) Operation of the bag leak detection system including quality 
assurance procedures.
    (iv) How the bag leak detection system will be maintained including 
a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list.
    (v) How the bag leak detection system output will be recorded and 
stored.
    (5) Corrective action plan for each baghouse. The plan must include 
the requirement that, in the event a bag leak detection system alarm is 
triggered, you must initiate corrective action to determine the cause of 
the alarm within 1 hour of the alarm, initiate corrective action to 
correct the cause of the problem within 24 hours of the alarm, and 
complete the corrective action as soon as practicable. Corrective 
actions taken may include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or 
filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in 
emissions.
    (ii) Sealing off defective bags or filter media.
    (iii) Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise 
repairing the control device.
    (iv) Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment.
    (v) Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe or otherwise 
repairing the bag leak detection system.
    (vi) Making process changes.
    (vii) Shutting down the process producing the PM emissions.
    (6) Procedures for providing an ignition source to mold vents of 
sand mold systems in each pouring area and pouring station unless you 
determine the mold vent gases either are not ignitable, ignite 
automatically, or cannot be ignited due to accessibility or safety 
issues. You must document and maintain records of this determination. 
The determination of ignitability, accessibility, and safety may 
encompass multiple casting patterns provided the castings utilize 
similar sand-to-metal ratios, binder formulations, and coating 
materials. The determination of ignitability must be based on 
observations of the mold vents within 5 minutes of pouring, and the 
flame must be present for at least 15 seconds for the mold vent to be 
considered ignited. For the purpose of this determination:

[[Page 155]]

    (i) Mold vents that ignite more than 75 percent of the time without 
the presence of an auxiliary ignition source are considered to ignite 
automatically; and
    (ii) Mold vents that do not ignite automatically and cannot be 
ignited in the presence of an auxiliary ignition source more than 25 
percent of the time are considered to be not ignitable.

castings are not included in this definition.
    Metal melting furnace means a cupola, electric arc furnace, or 
electric induction furnace that converts scrap, foundry returns, and/or 
other solid forms of iron and/or steel to a liquid state. This 
definition does not include a holding furnace, an argon oxygen 
decarburization vessel, or ladle that receives molten metal from a metal 
melting furnace, to which metal ingots or other material may be added to 
adjust the metal chemistry.
    Mold or core making line means the collection of equipment that is 
used to mix an aggregate of sand and binder chemicals, form the

containing pyrolysis products of organic mold and core constituents 
produced by contact with or proximity to molten metal normally escape 
the mold during and after metal pouring.
    Pouring area means an area, generally associated with floor and pit 
molding operations, in which molten metal is brought to each individual 
mold. Pouring areas include all pouring operations that do not meet the 
definition of a pouring station.
    Pouring station means the fixed location to which molds are brought 
in a continuous or semicontinuous manner to receive molten metal, after 
which the molds are moved to a cooling area.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined in Sec. 
63.2.
    Scrap preheater means a vessel or other piece of equipment in which 
metal scrap that is to be used as melting furnace feed is heated to a 
temperature high enough to eliminate moisture and other volatile 
impurities or tramp materials by direct flame heating or similar means 
of heating.
    Scrubber blowdown means liquor or slurry discharged from a wet 
scrubber that is either removed as a waste stream or processed to remove 
impurities or adjust its composition or pH before being returned to the 
scrubber.
    Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice, 
or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated 
pursuant to section 112(h) of the CAA.

    (a) This subpart applies to each new and existing affected source at 
your integrated iron and steel manufacturing facility.
    (b) The affected sources are each new or existing sinter plant, 
blast furnace, and basic oxygen process furnace (BOPF) shop at your 
integrated iron and steel manufacturing facility.

[[Page 178]]

    (c) This subpart covers emissions from the sinter plant windbox 
exhaust, discharge end, and sinter cooler; the blast furnace casthouse; 
and the BOPF shop including each individual BOPF and shop ancillary 
operations (hot metal transfer, hot metal desulfurization, slag 
skimming, and ladle metallurgy).
    (d) A sinter plant, blast furnace, or BOPF shop at your integrated 
iron and steel manufacturing facility is existing if you commenced 
construction or reconstruction of the affected source before July 13, 
2001.
    (e) A sinter plant, blast furnace, or BOPF shop at your integrated 
iron and steel manufacturing facility is new if you commence 
construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or after July 
13, 2001. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition 
of reconstruction in Sec. 63.2.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7783  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with 
each emission limitation and operation and maintenance requirement in 
this subpart that applies to you no later than May 22, 2006.
    (b) If you have a new affected source and its initial startup date 
is on or before May 20, 2003, then you must comply with each emission 
limitation and operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart 
that applies to you by May 20, 2003.
    (c) If you have a new affected source and its initial startup date 
is after May 20, 2003, you must comply with each emission limitation and 
operation and maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to 
you upon initial startup.
    (d) If your integrated iron and steel manufacturing facility is not 
a major source and becomes a major source of HAP, the following 
compliance dates apply to you.
    (1) Any portion of the existing integrated iron and steel 
manufacturing facility that becomes a new affected source or a new 
reconstructed source must be in compliance with this subpart upon 
startup.
    (2) All other parts of the integrated iron and steel manufacturing 
facility must be in compliance with this subpart no later than 2 years 
after it becomes a major source.
    (e) You must meet the notification and schedule requirements in 
Sec. 63.7840. Several of these notifications must be submitted before 
the compliance date for your affected source.

                          Emission Limitations


<R05>
Sec. 63.7790  What emission limitations must I meet?

    (a) You must meet each emission limit and opacity limit in Table 1 
to this subpart that applies to you.
    (b) You must meet each operating limit for capture systems and 
control devices in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section that 
applies to you.
    (1) You must operate each capture system applied to emissions from a 
sinter plant discharge end or blast furnace casthouse or to secondary 
emissions from a BOPF at or above the lowest value or settings 
established for the operating limits in your operation and maintenance 
plan;
    (2) For each venturi scrubber applied to meet any particulate 
emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must maintain the hourly 
average pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate at or above the 
minimum levels established during the initial performance test.
    (3) For each electrostatic precipitator applied to emissions from a 
BOPF, you must maintain the average opacity of emissions for each 6-
minute period at or below the site-specific opacity value corresponding 
to the 99 percent upper confidence limit on the mean of a normal 
distribution of average opacity values established during the initial 
performance test.
    (c) An owner or operator who uses an air pollution control device 
other than a baghouse, venturi scrubber, or electrostatic precipitator 
must submit a description of the device; test results collected in 
accordance with Sec. 63.7822 verifying the performance of the device 
for reducing emissions of particulate matter to the atmosphere to the 
levels required by this subpart; a copy of the operation and maintenance 
plan required in Sec. 63.7800(b); and appropriate

[[Page 179]]

operating parameters that will be monitored to maintain continuous 
compliance with the applicable emission limitation(s). The monitoring 
plan identifying the operating parameters to be monitored is subject to 
approval by the Administrator.
    (d) For each sinter plant, you must either:
    (1) Maintain the 30-day rolling average oil content of the feedstock 
at or below 0.02 percent; or
    (2) Maintain the 30-day rolling average of volatile organic compound

Subpart GGGGG_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: 
                            Site Remediation

    Source: 68 FR 58190, Oct. 8, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.7880  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emissions limitations and work 
practice standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from site 
remediation activities. This subpart also establishes requirements to 
demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emissions 
limitations and work practice standards.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7881  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) This subpart applies to you if you own or operate a facility at 
which you conduct a site remediation, as defined in Sec. 63.7957; and 
this site remediation, unless exempted under paragraph (b) or (c) of 
this section, meets all three of the following conditions specified in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Your site remediation cleans up a remediation material, as 
defined in Sec. 63.7957.
    (2) Your site remediation is co-located at your facility with one or 
more other stationary sources that emit HAP and meet an affected source 
definition specified for a source category that is regulated by another 
subpart under 40 CFR part 63. This condition applies regardless whether 
or not the affected stationary source(s) at your facility is subject to 
the standards under the applicable subpart(s).
    (3) Your facility is a major source of HAP as defined in Sec. 63.2. 
A major source emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at the 
rate of 10 tons (9.07 megagrams) or more per year of any HAP or any 
combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per 
year. All emissions of HAP from every source at your facility (i.e., 
both the site remediation activity and all other facility activities) 
must be considered in making this calculation.
    (b) You are not subject to this subpart if your site remediation 
qualifies for any of one of the exemptions listed in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (6) of this section.
    (1) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site 
remediation only cleans up material that does not contain any of the HAP 
listed in Table 1 of this subpart.
    (2) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site 
remediation will be performed under the authority of the Comprehensive 
Environmental Response and Compensation Liability Act (CERCLA) as a 
remedial action or a non time-critical removal action.
    (3) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site 
remediation will be performed under a Resource Conservation and Recovery 
Act (RCRA) corrective action conducted at a treatment, storage and 
disposal facility (TSDF) that is either required by your permit issued 
by either the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a State 
program authorized by the EPA under RCRA section 3006; required by 
orders authorized under RCRA; or required by orders authorized under 
RCRA section 7003.
    (4) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site 
remediation is conducted at a gasoline service station to clean up 
remediation material from a leaking underground storage tank.
    (5) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site 
remediation is conducted at a farm or residential site.

[[Page 201]]

    (6) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart if the site 
remediation is conducted at a research and development facility that 
meets the requirements under Clean Air Act (CAA) section 112(c)(7).
    (c) Your site remediation is not subject to this subpart, except for 
the recordkeeping requirements specified in this paragraph, if the site 
remediation meets the all of the conditions in paragraphs (c)(1) through 
(3) of this section.
    (1) Before beginning the site remediation, you determine for the 
remediation material that you will excavate, extract, pump, or otherwise 
remove during your site remediation that the total quantity of the HAP 
listed in Table 1 of this subpart which is contained in the material is 
less than 1 megagram per year (Mg/yr).
    (2) You prepare and maintain at your facility written documentation 
to support your determination of the total HAP quantity used to 
demonstrate compliance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This 
documentation must include a description of your methodology and data 
you used for determining the total HAP content of the material.
    (3) This exemption may be applied to more than one site remediation 
at your facility provided that the total quantity of the HAP listed in 
Table 1 of this subpart for all of your site remediations exempted under 
this provision is less than 1 Mg/yr.
    (d) Your site remediation is not subject to the requirements of this 
subpart if all remediation activities at your facility subject to this 
subpart are completed and you have notified the Administrator in writing 
that all remediation activities subject to this subpart are completed. 
You must maintain records of compliance, in accordance with Sec. 
63.7953, for each remediation activity that was subject to this subpart. 
All future remediation activity meeting the applicability criteria in 
this section must comply with the requirements of this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7882  What site remediation sources at my facility does this
subpart affect?

    (a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing 
affected source for your site remediation as designated by paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (3) of this section.
    (1) Process vents. The affected source is the entire group of 
process vents associated with the in-situ and ex-situ remediation 
processes used at your site to remove, destroy, degrade, transform, or 
immobilize hazardous substances in the remediation material subject to 
remediation. Examples of such in-situ remediation processes include, but 
are not limited to, soil vapor extraction and bioremediation processes. 
Examples of such ex-situ remediation processes include but are not 
limited to, thermal desorption, bioremediation, and air stripping 
processes.
    (2) Remediation material management units. Remediation material 
management unit means a tank, surface impoundment, container, oil-water 
separator, organic-water separator, or transfer system, as defined in 
Sec. 63.7957, and is used at your site to manage remediation material. 
The affected source is the entire group of remediation material 
management units used for the site remediations at your site. For the 
purpose of this subpart, a tank or container that is also equipped with 
a vent that serves as a process vent, as defined in Sec. 63.7957, is 
not a remediation material management unit, but instead this unit is 
considered to be a process vent affected source under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section.
    (3) Equipment leaks. The affected source is the entire group of 
equipment components (pumps, valves, etc.) used to manage remediation 
materials and meeting both of the conditions specified in paragraphs 
(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section. If either of these conditions do not 
apply to an equipment component, then that component is not part of the 
affected source for equipment leaks.
    (i) The equipment component contains or contacts remediation 
material having a concentration of total HAP listed in Table 1 of this 
subpart equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight.
    (ii) The equipment component is intended to operate for 300 hours or 
more during a calendar year in remediation material service, as defined 
in Sec. 63.7957.

[[Page 202]]

    (b) Each affected source for your site is existing if you commenced 
construction or reconstruction of the affected source before July 30, 
2002.
    (c) Each affected source for your site is new if you commenced 
construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or after July 
30, 2002. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition 
of reconstruction in Sec. 63.2.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7883  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with 
each emission limitation, work practice standard, and operation and 
maintenance requirement in this subpart that applies to you no later 
than October 9, 2006.
    (b) If you have a new affected source that manages remediation 
material other than a radioactive mixed waste as defined in Sec. 
63.7957, then you must meet the compliance date specified in paragraph 
(b)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable to your affected source.
    (1) If the affected source's initial startup date is on or before 
October 8, 2003, you must comply with each emission limitation, work 
practice standard, and operation and maintenance requirement in this 
subpart that applies to you by October 8, 2003.

63.7885 through 63.7953, as applicable to your affected sources, unless 
your site remediation meets the requirements for an exemption under 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) A site remediation that is completed within 30 consecutive 
calendar days according to the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) 
of this section is not subject to the standards under paragraph (a) of 
this section. This exemption cannot be used for a site remediation 
involving the staged or intermittent cleanup of remediation material 
whereby the remediation activities at the site are started, stopped, and

[[Page 203]]

then re-started in a series of intervals with durations less than 30-
days per interval for which the total time of all of the intervals 
required to complete the site remediation exceeds a total of 30 days.
    (1) The 30-day period for a site remediation is determined from the 
first day that any action is initiated that removes, destroys, degrades, 
transforms, immobilizes, or otherwise manages the remediation materials. 
The end of a site remediation is determined by the last day on which 
treatment or disposal of the remediation materials from the cleanup is 
completed. The following activities, when completed before beginning 
this initial action, are not counted as part of the 30-day period: 
activities to characterize the type and extent of the contamination by 
collecting and analyzing samples, activities to obtain permits from 
Federal, State, or local authorities to conduct the site remediation, 
activities to schedule workers and necessary equipment, and activities 
to arrange for contractor or third party assistance in performing the 
site remediation.

<R05>
Sec. 63.7943  How do I determine the average VOHAP concentration of my
remediation material?

    (a) General requirements. You must determine the average total VOHAP 
concentration of a remediation material at the point-of-extraction using 
either direct measurement as specified in paragraph (b) of this section 
or by knowledge as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Direct measurement. To determine the average total VOHAP 
concentration of a remediation material at the point-of-extraction using 
direct measurement, you must use the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (3) of this section.
    (1) Sampling. Samples of each material stream must be collected at 
the point-of-extraction in a manner such that volatilization of organics 
contained in the sample is minimized and an adequately representative 
sample is collected and maintained for analysis by the selected method.
    (i) The averaging period to be used for determining the average 
total VOHAP concentration for the material stream on a mass-weighted 
average basis must be designated and recorded. The averaging period can 
represent any time interval that you determine is appropriate for the 
material stream but must not exceed 1 year. For streams that are 
combined, an averaging period representative for all streams must be 
selected.
    (ii) No less than four samples must be collected to represent the 
complete range of HAP compositions and HAP quantities that occur in each 
material stream during the entire averaging period due to normal 
variations in the material stream(s). Examples of such normal variations 
are variation of the HAP concentration within a contamination area.
    (iii) All samples must be collected and handled according to written 
procedures you prepare and document in a site sampling plan. This plan 
must describe the procedure by which representative samples of the 
material stream(s) are collected such that a minimum loss of organics 
occurs throughout the sample collection and handling process and by 
which sample integrity is maintained. A copy of the written sampling 
plan must be maintained on site in the facility operating records. An 
example of an acceptable sampling plan includes a plan incorporating 
sample collection and handling procedures according to the guidance 
found in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical 
Methods,'' EPA Publication No. SW-846 or Method 25D in 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    (2) Analysis. Each collected sample must be prepared and analyzed 
according to either one of the methods listed in Sec. 63.694(b)(2)(ii), 
or any current EPA Contracts Lab Program method (or future revisions) 
capable of identifying all the HAP in Table 1 of this subpart.
    (3) Calculations. The average total VOHAP concentration (C) on a 
mass-weighted basis must be calculated by using the results for all 
samples analyzed according to paragraph (c)(2) of this section and 
Equation 1 of this section as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08OC03.005

Where:

C = Average VOHAP concentration of the material on a mass-weighted 
basis, ppmw.
i = Individual sample ``i'' of the material.
n = Total number of samples of the material collected (at least 4 per 
stream) for the averaging period (not to exceed 1 year).
Q<INF>i</INF> = Mass quantity of material stream represented by 
C<INF>i</INF>, kilograms per hour (kg/hr).
Q<INF>T</INF> = Total mass quantity of all material during the averaging 
period, kg/hr.
C<INF>i</INF> = Measured VOHAP concentration of sample ``i'' as 
determined according to the requirements of paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this 
section, ppmw.

    (c) Knowledge of the material. To determine the average total VOHAP 
concentration of a remediation material at the point-of-extraction using 
knowledge, you must use the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) 
of this section.
    (1) Documentation must be prepared that presents the information 
used as the basis for your knowledge of the material stream's average 
VOHAP concentration. Examples of information that may be used as the 
basis for

[[Page 237]]

knowledge include: material balances for the source(s) generating each 
material stream; species-specific chemical test data for the material 
stream from previous testing that are still applicable to the current 
material stream; test data for material from the contamination area(s) 
being remediated.
    (2) If test data are used as the basis for knowledge, then you must 
document the test method, sampling protocol, and the means by which 
sampling variability and analytical variability are accounted for in the 
determination of the average VOHAP concentration. For example, you may 
use HAP concentration test data for the material stream that are 
validated according to Method 301 in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A as the 
basis for knowledge of the material. This information must be provided 
for each material stream where streams are combined.
    (3) If you use species-specific chemical concentration test data as 
the basis for knowledge of the material, you may adjust the test data to 
the corresponding average VOHAP concentration value which would be 
obtained had the material samples been analyzed using Method 305. To 
adjust these data, the measured concentration for each individual HAP 
chemical species contained in the material is multiplied by the 
appropriate species-specific adjustment factor (f<INF>m305</INF>) listed 
in Table 1 of this subpart.
    (d) In the event that you and us disagree on a determination using 
knowledge of the average total VOHAP concentration for a remediation 
material, then the results from a determination of VOHAP concentration 
using direct measurement by Method 305 in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A, as 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section, will be used to determine 
compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. We may 
perform or request that you perform this determination using direct 
measurement.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7944  How do I determine the maximum HAP vapor pressure of my
remediation material?

    (a) You must determine the maximum HAP vapor pressure of your 
remediation material using either direct measurement as specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section or by knowledge as specified in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (b) Direct measurement to determine the maximum HAP vapor pressure.
    (1) Sampling. A sufficient number of samples must be collected to be 
representative of the remediation material contained in the tank. All 
samples must be collected and handled according to written procedures 
prepared by you and documented in a site sampling plan. This plan must 
describe the procedure by which representative samples of the 
remediation material are collected such that a minimum loss of organics 
occurs throughout the sample collection and handling process and by 
which sample integrity is maintained. A copy of the written sampling 
plan must be maintained on site in the facility site operating records. 
An example of an acceptable sampling plan includes a plan incorporating 
sample collection and handling procedures according to the guidance 
found in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical 
Methods,'' EPA Publication No. SW-846 or Method 25D in 40 CFR part 60, 
appendix A.
    (2) Analysis. Any one of the following methods may be used to 
analyze the samples and compute the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the 
remediation material:
    (i) Method 25E in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A;
    (ii) Methods described in American Petroleum Institute Bulletin 
2517, ``Evaporation Loss from External Floating Roof Tanks,'';
    (iii) Methods obtained from standard reference texts;
    (iv) ASTM Method 2879-83; or
    (v) Any other method approved by the Administrator.
    (c) Use of knowledge to determine the maximum HAP vapor pressure. 
Documentation must be prepared and recorded that presents the 
information used as the basis for your knowledge that the maximum HAP 
vapor pressure of the remediation material is less than the maximum 
vapor pressure limit listed in Table 2 of this subpart for the 
applicable tank design capacity category.

[[Page 238]]

    (d) In the event that you and us disagree on a determination using 
knowledge of the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the remediation material, 
then the results from a determination of maximum HAP vapor pressure 
using direct measurement by Method 25E in 40 CFR part 60 appendix A, as 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section, will be used to determine 
compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. We may 
perform or request that you perform this determination using direct 
measurement.

a CPMS that is not out of control according to the monitoring plan 
referenced in Sec. 63.7935.
    (3) To calculate the average emissions for each averaging period, 
you must have at least 75 percent of the hourly averages for that period 
using only block hourly average values that are based on valid data 
(i.e., not from out-of-control periods).
    (4) Unless otherwise specified, each CPMS must determine the hourly 
average of all recorded readings and daily average, if required.
    (b) You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and 
validation check.

continuous compliance?

    (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section and 
your site-specific monitoring plan required in Sec. 63.7935.
    (b) Except for monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and 
required quality assurance or control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), 
you must monitor continuously (or collect data at all required 
intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating.
    (c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, out of control periods and required quality 
assurance or control activities in data averages and calculations used 
to report emissions or operating levels, nor may such data be used in 
fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement, if applicable. You 
must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing 
the operation of the control device and associated control system.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7947  What are my monitoring alternatives?

    (a) As an alternative to the parametric monitoring required in this 
subpart, you may install, calibrate, and operate a continuous emission 
monitoring system (CEMS) to measure the control device outlet total 
organic emissions or organic HAP emissions concentration.
    (1) The CEMS used on combustion control devices must include a 
diluent gas monitoring system (for O<INF>2</INF> or CO<INF>2</INF>) with 
the pollutant monitoring system in order to correct for dilution (e.g., 
to 0 percent excess air).
    (2) Each CEMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation 
(sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute 
period. Data must be reduced as specified in Sec. 63.8(g)(2).
    (3) You must conduct a performance evaluation of the CEMS according 
to the requirements in Sec. 63.8 and Performance Specification 8 (for a 
total organic emissions CEMS) or Performance Specification 9 (for a HAP 
emissions CEMS) and Performance Specification 3 (for an O<INF>2</INF> or 
CO<INF>2</INF> CEMS) of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. The relative 
accuracy provision of Performance Specification 8, sections 2.4 and 3 
need not be conducted.

[[Page 239]]

    (4) You must prepare a site-specific monitoring plan for operating, 
calibrating, and verifying the operation of your CEMS according to the 
requirements in Sec. Sec. 63.8(c), (d), and (e).

according to paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section.
    (i) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the 
total organic or HAP emissions concentration at least once every 15 
minutes during each of the three test runs.
    (ii) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate 
and record the average total organic or HAP emissions concentration 
maintained during the performance test. The average total organic or HAP 
emissions concentration, corrected for dilution as appropriate, is the 
maximum operating limit for your control device.
    (b) You must maintain the daily (24-hour) average total organic or 
HAP emissions concentration in the exhaust vent stream of the control 
device outlet less than or equal to the site-specific operating limit 
established during the performance test.

Sec. 63.7957  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in Sec. 63.2, 
and in this section. If a term is defined both in this section and in 
another subpart cross-referenced by this subpart, then the term will 
have the meaning given in this section for purposes of this subpart.
    Boiler means an enclosed combustion device that extracts useful 
energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator or a process 
heater.
    Closed vent system means a system that is not open to the atmosphere 
and is composed of hard-piping, ductwork, connections, and, if 
necessary, fans, blowers, or other flow-inducing device that conveys gas 
or vapor from an emissions point to a control device.
    Closure device means a cap, hatch, lid, plug, seal, valve, or other 
type of fitting that prevents or reduces air pollutant emissions to the 
atmosphere by blocking an opening in a cover when the device is secured 
in the closed position. Closure devices include devices that are 
detachable from the cover (e.g., a sampling port cap), manually operated 
(e.g., a hinged access lid or hatch), or automatically operated (e.g., a 
spring-loaded pressure relief valve).
    Container means a portable unit used to hold material. Examples of 
containers include, but are not limited to drums, dumpsters, roll-off 
boxes, bulk cargo containers commonly known as portable tanks or totes, 
cargo tank trucks, dump trucks, and rail cars. For the purpose of this 
subpart, a front-end loader, excavator, backhoe, or other type of self-
propelled excavation equipment is not a container.
    Continuous record means documentation of data values measured at 
least once every 15 minutes and recorded at the frequency specified in 
this subpart.

[[Page 243]]

    Continuous recorder means a data recording device that either 
records an instantaneous data value at least once every 15 minutes or 
records 15-minutes or more frequent block averages.
    Control device means equipment used recovering, removing, oxidizing, 
or destroying organic vapors. Examples of such equipment include but are 
not limited to carbon adsorbers, condensers, vapor incinerators, flares, 
boilers, and process heaters.
    Cover means a device that prevents or reduces air pollutant 
emissions to the atmosphere by forming a continuous barrier over the 
remediation material managed in a unit. A cover may have openings (such 
as access hatches, sampling ports, gauge wells) that are necessary for 
operation, inspection, maintenance, and repair of the unit on which the 
cover is used. A cover may be a separate piece of equipment which can be 
detached and removed from the unit (such as a tarp) or a cover may be 
formed by structural features permanently integrated into the design of 
the unit.
    Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to 
this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
    (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this 
subpart, including but not limited to any emissions limitation 
(including any operating limit), or work practice standard;
    (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement 
an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the 
operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a 
permit; or
    (3) Fails to meet any emissions limitation,(including any operating 
limit), or work practice standard in this subpart during startup, 
shutdown, or malfunction, regardless or whether or not such failure is 
permitted by this subpart.
    Emissions limitation means any emissions limit, opacity limit, 
operating limit, or visible emissions limit.
    Emissions point means an individual tank, surface impoundment, 
container, oil-water, organic-water separator, transfer system, vent, or 
enclosure.
    Enclosure means a structure that surrounds a tank or container, 
captures organic vapors emitted from the tank or container, and vents 
the captured vapor through a closed vent system to a control device.
    Equipment means each pump, pressure relief device, sampling 
connection system, valve, and connector used in remediation material 
service at a facility.
    External floating roof means a pontoon-type or double-deck type 
cover that rests on the liquid surface in a tank with no fixed roof.
    Facility means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under 
common control including properties that are separated only by a road or 
other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that are 
owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, 
subsidiary, or any combination thereof. A unit or group of units within 
a contiguous property that are not under common control (e.g., a 
wastewater treatment unit located at the facility but is owned by a 
different company) is a different facility.
    Fixed roof means a cover that is mounted on a unit in a stationary 
position and does not move with fluctuations in the level of the liquid 
managed in the unit.
    Flame zone means the portion of the combustion chamber in a boiler 
or process heater occupied by the flame envelope.
    Floating roof means a cover consisting of a double deck, pontoon 
single deck, or internal floating cover which rests upon and is 
supported by the liquid being contained, and is equipped with a 
continuous seal.
    Flow indicator means a device that indicates whether gas is flowing, 
or whether the valve position would allow gas to flow in a bypass line.
    Hard-piping means pipe or tubing that is manufactured and properly 
installed according to relevant standards and good engineering 
practices.
    Individual drain system means a stationary system used to convey 
wastewater streams or residuals to a remediation material management 
unit or to discharge or disposal. The term includes hard-piping, all 
drains and junction boxes, together with their associated sewer lines 
and other junction

[[Page 244]]

boxes (e.g., manholes, sumps, and lift stations) conveying wastewater 
streams or residuals. For the purpose of this subpart, an individual 
drain system is not a drain and collection system that is designed and 
operated for the sole purpose of collecting rainfall runoff (e.g., 
stormwater sewer system) and is segregated from all other individual 
drain systems.
    Internal floating roof means a cover that rests or floats on the 
liquid surface (but not necessarily in complete contact with it inside a 
tank that has a fixed roof).
    Maximum HAP vapor pressure means the sum of the individual HAP 
equilibrium partial pressure exerted by remediation material at the 
temperature equal to either: the monthly average temperature as reported 
by the National Weather Service when the remediation material is stored 
or treated at ambient temperature; or the highest calendar-month average 
temperature of the remediation material when the remediation material is 
stored at temperatures above the ambient temperature or when the 
remediation material is stored or treated at temperatures below the 
ambient temperature. For the purpose of this subpart, maximum HAP vapor 
pressure is determined using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.7944.
    No detectable organic emissions means no escape of organics to the 
atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in Sec. 
63.694(k).
    Oil-water separator means a separator as defined for this subpart 
that is used to separate oil from water.
    Operating parameter value means a minimum or maximum value 
established for a control device or treatment process parameter which, 
if achieved by itself or in combination with one or more other operating 
parameter values, determines that an owner or operator has complied with 
an applicable emissions limitation or standard.
    Organic-water separator means a separator as defined for this 
subpart that is used to separate organics from water.
    Point-of-extraction means a point above ground where you can collect 
samples of a remediation material before or at the first point where 
organic constituents in the material have the potential to volatilize 
and be released to the atmosphere and before placing the material in a 
remediation material management unit or treatment process. For the 
purpose this subpart, the first point where the organic constituents in 
the remediation material have the potential to volatilize and be 
released to the atmosphere is not a fugitive emissions point due to an 
equipment leak from any of the following equipment components: pumps, 
compressors, valves, connectors, instrumentation systems, or safety 
devices.
    Process heater means an enclosed combustion device that transfers 
heat released by burning fuel directly to process streams or to heat 
transfer liquids other than water.
    Process vent means any open-ended pipe, stack, duct, or other 
opening intended to allow the passage of gases, vapors, or fumes to the 
atmosphere and this passage is caused by mechanical means (such as 
compressors, vacuum-producing systems or fans) or by process-related 
means (such as volatilization produced by heating). For the purposes of 
this subpart, a process vent is neither a safety device (as defined in 
this section) nor a stack, duct or other opening used to exhaust 
combustion products from a boiler, furnace, heater, incinerator, or 
other combustion device.
    Radioactive mixed waste means a material that contains both 
hazardous waste subject to RCRA and source, special nuclear, or by-
product material subject to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.
    Remediation material means a material that contains one or more of 
the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart, and this material is one of 
the following:
    (1) A material found in naturally occurring media such as soil, 
groundwater, surface water, sediments, or a mixture of such materials 
with liquids, sludges, or solids which is inseparable by simple 
mechanical removal processes and is made up primarily of media. This 
material does not include debris as defined in 40 CFR 268.2.
    (2) A material found in intact or substantially intact containers, 
tanks, storage piles, or other storage units

[[Page 245]]

that requires clean up because this material poses a reasonable 
potential threat to contaminating media. Examples of these materials 
include, but are not limited to, solvents, oils, paints, and other 
volatile or semi-volatile organic liquids found in buried drums, cans, 
or other containers; gasoline, fuel oil, or other fuels in leaking 
underground storage tanks; and solid materials containing volatile or 
semi-volatile organics in unused or abandoned piles. Remediation 
material is not a waste or residue generated by routine equipment 
maintenance activities performed at a facility such as, but not limited 
to, tank bottoms and sludges removed during tank cleanouts; sludges and 
sediments removed from active wastewater treatment tanks, surface 
impoundments, or lagoons; spent catalyst removed from process equipment; 
residues removed from air pollution control equipment; and debris 
removed during heat exchanger and pipeline cleanouts.
    Remediation material management unit means a tank, container, 
surface impoundment, oil-water separator, organic-water separator, or 
transfer system used to remove, destroy, degrade, transform, immobilize, 
or otherwise manage remediation material.
    Remediation material service means any time when a pump, compressor, 
agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended 
valve or line, valve, connector, or instrumentation system contains or 
contacts remediation material.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 
70.2.
    Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief 
valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which 
functions to prevent physical damage or permanent deformation to 
equipment by venting gases or vapors during unsafe conditions resulting 
from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the purpose of 
this Subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases 
or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during 
filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in this vapor headspace in 
response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A 
safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal 
operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant 
parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the 
equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer 
recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention 
codes, standard engineering codes and practices, or other requirements 
for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or 
hazardous materials.
    Separator means a remediation material management unit, generally a 
tank, used to separate oil or organics from water. A separator consists 
of not only the separation unit but also the forebay and other separator 
basins, skimmers, weirs, grit chambers, sludge hoppers, and bar screens 
that are located directly after the individual drain system and prior to 
any additional treatment units such as an air flotation unit clarifier 
or biological treatment unit. Examples of a separator include, but are 
not limited to, an API separator, parallel-plate interceptor, and 
corrugated-plate interceptor with the associated ancillary equipment.
    Site remediation means one or more activities or processes used to 
remove, destroy, degrade, transform, immobilize, or otherwise manage 
remediation material. The monitoring or measuring of contamination 
levels in environmental media using wells or by sampling is not 
considered to be a site remediation.
    Sludge means sludge as defined in Sec. 260.10 of this chapter.
    Soil means unconsolidated earth material composing the superficial 
geologic strata (material overlying bedrock), consisting of clay, silt, 
sand, or gravel size particles (sizes as classified by the U.S. Soil 
Conservation Service), or a mixture of such materials with liquids, 
sludges, or solids which is inseparable by simple mechanical removal 
processes and is made up primarily of soil.
    Stabilization process means any physical or chemical process used to 
either reduce the mobility of contaminants in media or eliminate free 
liquids as determined by Test Method 9095--Paint

[[Page 246]]

Filter Liquids Test in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, 
Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication No. SW-846, Third Edition, 
September 1986, as amended by Update I, November 15, 1992. (As an 
alternative, you may use any more recent, updated version of Method 9095 
approved by the EPA). A stabilization process includes mixing 
remediation material with binders or other materials, and curing the 
resulting remediation material and binder mixture. Other synonymous 
terms used to refer to this process are fixation or solidification. A 
stabilization process does not include the adding of absorbent materials 
to the surface of remediation material, without mixing, agitation, or 
subsequent curing, to absorb free liquid.
    Surface impoundment means a unit that is a natural topographical 
depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of 
earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made materials), 
which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids. Examples of 
surface impoundments include holding, storage, settling, and aeration 
pits, ponds, and lagoons.
    Tank means a stationary unit that is constructed primarily of 
nonearthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or 
plastic) which provide structural support and is designed to hold an 
accumulation of liquids or other materials.
    Temperature monitoring device means a piece of equipment used to 
monitor temperature and having an accuracy of <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1 
percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius 
( [deg]C) or <plus-minus<ls-thn-eq>1.2 degrees [deg]C, whichever value 
is greater.
    Transfer system means a stationary system for which the predominant 
function is to convey liquids or solid materials from one point to 
another point within waste management operation or recovery operation. 
For the purpose of this subpart, the conveyance of material using a 
container (as defined of this subpart) or self-propelled vehicle (e.g., 
a front-end loader) is not a transfer system. Examples of a transfer 
system include but are not limited to a pipeline, an individual drain 
system, a gravity-operated conveyor (such as a chute), and a 
mechanically-powered conveyor (such as a belt or screw conveyor).
    Treatment process means a process in which remediation material is 
physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated to destroy, 
degrade, or remove hazardous air pollutants contained in the material. A 
treatment process can be composed of a single unit (e.g., a steam 
stripper) or a series of units (e.g., a wastewater treatment system). A 
treatment process can be used to treat one or more remediation material 
streams at the same time.
    Volatile organic hazardous air pollutant (VOHAP) concentration means 
the fraction by weight of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart that 
are contained in the remediation material as measured using Method 305, 
40 CFR part 63, appendix A and expressed in terms of parts per million 
(ppm). As an alternative to using Method 305, 40 CFR part 63, appendix 
A, you may determine the HAP concentration of the remediation material 
using any one of the other test methods specified in Sec. 
63.694(b)(2)(ii). When a test method specified in Sec. 63.694(b)(2)(ii) 
other than Method 305 in 40 CFR part 63, appendix A is used to determine 
the speciated HAP concentration of the contaminated material, the 
individual compound concentration may be adjusted by the corresponding 
f<INF>m305</INF> listed in Table 1 of this subpart to determine a VOHAP 
concentration.
    Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice, 
or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated 
pursuant to section 112(h) of the CAA.

viscosity adjustment, color tint or additive blending, or pH adjustment; 
cleaning of coating lines and coating line parts; handling and storage 
of coatings and solvent; and conveyance and treatment of wastewater.
    (3) Ancillary equipment such as boilers and incinerators (only those 
not used to comply with the emission limits in Tables 1 through 5 to 
this subpart), chillers and refrigeration systems, and other equipment 
that is not directly involved in the manufacturing of a coating (i.e., 
it operates as a closed system, and materials are not combined with 
materials used to manufacture the coating).
    (4) Quality assurance/quality control laboratories.


<R05>
Sec. 63.7990  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each miscellaneous coating manufacturing 
affected source as defined in Sec. 63.7985(a).
    (b) The miscellaneous coating manufacturing affected source is the 
miscellaneous coating manufacturing operations as defined in Sec. 
63.7985(b).
    (c) An affected source is a new affected source if you commenced 
construction or reconstruction after April 4, 2002, and you met the 
applicability criteria at the time you commenced construction or 
reconstruction.

                            Compliance Dates


<R05>
Sec. 63.7995  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have a new affected source, you must comply with this 
subpart according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of 
this section.
    (1) If you start up your new affected source before December 11, 
2003, then you must comply with the requirements for new sources in this 
subpart no later than December 11, 2003.
    (2) If you start up your new affected source after December 11, 
2003, then you must comply with the requirements for new sources in this 
subpart upon startup of your affected source.
    (b) If you have an existing affected source on December 11, 2003, 
then you must comply with the requirements for existing sources in this 
subpart no later than December 11, 2006.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) You must meet the notification requirements in Sec. 63.8070 
according to the schedule in Sec. 63.8070 and in 40 CFR part 63,

  Emission Limits, Work Practice Standards, and Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.8000  What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?

    (a) You must be in compliance with the emission limits and work 
practice standards in Tables 1 through 5 to this subpart at all times, 
except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction. You must 
meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this 
section. You must meet the requirements specified in Sec. Sec. 63.8005 
through 63.8025 (or the alternative means of compliance in Sec. 
63.8050), except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. You must 
meet the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements 
specified in Sec. Sec. 63.8070, 63.8075, and 63.8080.
    (b) General requirements. (1) If an emission stream contains halogen 
atoms, and you use a combustion-based control device (excluding a flare) 
to meet an organic HAP emission limit, you must determine whether the 
emission stream meets the definition of a halogenated stream by 
calculating the concentration of each organic compound that contains 
halogen atoms using the procedures specified in Sec. 63.115(d)(2)(v), 
multiplying each concentration by the number of halogen atoms in the 
organic compound, and summing the resulting halogen atom concentrations 
for all of the organic compounds in the emission stream. Alternatively, 
you may elect to designate the emission stream as halogenated.
    (2) Opening of a safety device, as defined in Sec. 63.8105, is 
allowed at any time conditions require it to avoid unsafe conditions.

[[Page 256]]

    (c) Compliance requirements for closed vent systems and control 
devices.If you use a control device to comply with an emission limit in 
Table 1, 2, or 5 to this subpart, you must comply with the requirements 
in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63 as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (3) of this section, except as specified in paragraph (d) of 
this section.
    (1) If you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through 
a closed-vent system to any combination of control devices (except a 
flare), you must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.982(c) and the 
requirements referenced therein.
    (2) If you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through 
a closed-vent system to a flare, you must meet the requirements of Sec. 
63.982(b) and the requirements referenced therein. You may not use a 
flare to control halogenated vent streams or hydrogen halide and halogen 
HAP emissions.
    (3) If you use a halogen reduction device to reduce hydrogen halide 
and halogen HAP emissions that are generated by combusting halogenated 
vent streams, you must meet the requirements of Sec. 63.994 and the 
requirements referenced therein. If you use a halogen reduction device 
before a combustion device, you must determine the halogen atom emission 
rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures in Sec. 
63.115(d)(2)(v).
    (d) Exceptions to the requirements specified in other subparts of 
this part 63--(1) Requirements for performance tests. The requirements 
specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (v) of this section apply 
instead of or in addition to the requirements for performance testing of 
control devices as specified in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63.
    (i) Conduct gas molecular weight analysis using Method 3, 3A, or 3B 
in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
    (ii) Measure moisture content of the stack gas using Method 4 in 
appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.
    (iii) As an alternative to using Method 18, Method 25/25A, or Method 
26/26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to comply with any of the emission 
limits specified in Tables 1 through 6 to this subpart, you may use 
Method 320 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. When using Method 320, you 
must follow the analyte spiking procedures of section 13 of Method 320, 
unless you demonstrate that the complete spiking procedure has been 
conducted at a similar source.
    (iv) Section 63.997(c)(1) does not apply. For the purposes of this 
subpart, results of all initial compliance demonstrations must be 
included in the notification of compliance status report, which is due 
150 days after the compliance date, as specified in Sec. 63.8075(d)(1).
    (v) If you do not have a closed-vent system as defined in Sec. 
63.981, you must determine capture efficiency using Method 204 of 
appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for all stationary process vessels subject 
to requirements of Table 1 to this subpart.
    (2) Design evaluation. To determine the percent reduction of a small 
control device, you may elect to conduct a design evaluation as 
specified in Sec. 63.1257(a)(1) instead of a performance test as 
specified in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63. You must establish the 
value(s) and basis for the operating limits as part of the design 
evaluation.
    (3) Periodic verification. For a control device with total inlet HAP 
emissions less than 1 ton per year (tpy), you must establish an 
operating limit(s) for a parameter(s) that you will measure and record 
at least once per averaging period (i.e., daily or block) to verify that 
the control device is operating properly. You may elect to measure the 
same parameter(s) that is required for control devices that control 
inlet HAP emissions equal to or greater than 1 tpy. If the parameter 
will not be measured continuously, you must request approval of your 
proposed procedure in the precompliance report. You must identify the 
operating limit(s) and the measurement frequency, and you must provide 
rationale to support how these measurements demonstrate the control 
device is operating properly.
    (4) Continuous emissions monitoring systems. Each continuous 
emissions monitoring system (CEMS) must be installed, operated, and 
maintained according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8 and paragraphs 
(d)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section.
    (i) Each CEMS must be installed, operated, and maintained according 
to

[[Page 257]]

the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, 
and according to paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, except as 
specified in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(A) of this section. For any CEMS 
meeting Performance Specification 8, you must also comply with appendix 
F, procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60.
    (A) If you wish to use a CEMS other than a Fourier Transform 
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) meeting the requirements of Performance 
Specification 15 to measure hydrogen halide and halogen HAP before we 
promulgate a Performance Specification for such CEMS, you must prepare a 
monitoring plan and submit it for approval in accordance with the 
procedures specified in Sec. 63.8.
    (B) [Reserved]
    (ii) You must determine the calibration gases and reporting units 
for TOC CEMS in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of 
this section.
    (A) For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 9 or 15 requirements, 
determine the target analyte(s) for calibration using either process 
knowledge of the control device inlet stream or the screening procedures 
of Method 18 on the control device inlet stream.
    (B) For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor 
performance of a combustion device, calibrate the instrument on the 
predominant organic HAP and report the results as carbon 
(C<INF>1</INF>), and use Method 25A or any approved alternative as the 
reference method for the relative accuracy tests.
    (C) For CEMS meeting Performance Specification 8 used to monitor 
performance of a noncombustion device, determine the predominant organic 
HAP using either process knowledge or the screening procedures of Method 
18 on the control device inlet stream, calibrate the monitor on the 
predominant organic HAP, and report the results as C<INF>1</INF>. Use 
Method 18, ASTM D6420-99, or any approved alternative as the reference 
method for the relative accuracy tests, and report the results as 
C<INF>1</INF>.
    (iii) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS 
according to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.8 and according to the 
applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, 
except that the schedule in Sec. 63.8(e)(4) does not apply, and the 
results of the performance evaluation must be included in the 
notification of compliance status report.
    (iv) The CEMS data must be reduced to operating day or operating 
block averages computed using valid data consistent with the data 
availability requirements specified in Sec. 63.999(c)(6)(i)(B) through 
(D), except monitoring data also are sufficient to constitute a valid 
hour of data if measured values are available for at least two of the 
15-minute periods during an hour when calibration, quality assurance, or 
maintenance activities are being performed. An operating block is a 
period of time from the beginning to end of batch operations in the 
manufacturing of a coating. Operating block averages may be used only 
for process vessel data.
    (5) Continuous parameter monitoring. The provisions in paragraphs 
(d)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section apply in addition to the 
requirements for continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) in 
subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63.
    (i) You must record the results of each calibration check and all 
maintenance performed on the CPMS as specified in Sec. 
63.998(c)(1)(ii)(A).
    (ii) When subpart SS of 40 CFR part 63 uses the term a range or 
operating range of a monitored parameter, it means an operating limit 
for a monitored parameter for the purposes of this subpart.
    (iii) As an alternative to measuring pH as specified in Sec. 
63.994(c)(1)(i), you may elect to continuously monitor the caustic 
strength of the scrubber effluent.
    (6) Startup, shutdown, and malfunction. Sections 63.998(b)(2)(iii) 
and (b)(6)(i)(A), which apply to the exclusion of monitoring data 
collected during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) 
from daily averages, do not apply for the purposes of this subpart.
    (7) Reporting. (i) When Sec. Sec. 63.8005 through 63.8025 reference 
other subparts in this part 63 that use the term periodic report, it 
means compliance report for the purposes of this subpart.

[[Page 258]]

    (ii) When there are conflicts between this subpart and referenced 
subparts for the due dates of reports required by this subpart, reports 
must be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.
    (iii) Excused excursions, as defined in subpart SS of 40 CFR part 
63, are not allowed.

practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart if you comply with Sec. 
63.8050 or Sec. 63.8055.
    (ii) You must meet the emission limits and work practice standards 
in Table 1 to this subpart for emissions from automatic cleaning 
operations. You are not required to meet the emission limits and work 
practice standards in Table 1 to this subpart for emissions from 
cleaning operations that are conducted manually.
    (2) For each control device used to comply with Table 1 to this 
subpart, you must comply with subpart SS of this part 63 as specified in 
Sec. 63.8000(c), except as specified in Sec. 63.8000(d) and paragraphs 
(b) through (g) of this section.
    (b) When subpart SS of this part 63 refers to process vents, it 
means process vessel vents for the purposes of this section.
    (c) Process condensers, as defined in Sec. 63.1251, are not 
considered to be control devices for process vessels.
    (d) Initial compliance. (1) To demonstrate initial compliance with a 
percent reduction emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you must 
conduct the performance test or design evaluation under conditions as 
specified in Sec. 63.7(e)(1), except that the performance test or 
design evaluation must be conducted under worst-case conditions. Also, 
the performance test for a control device used to control emissions from 
process vessels must be conducted according to Sec. 63.1257(b)(8), 
including the submittal of a site-specific test plan for approval prior 
to testing. The requirements in Sec. 63.997(e)(1)(i) and (iii) also do 
not apply for performance tests conducted to determine compliance with 
the emission limits for process vessels.
    (2) For the initial compliance demonstration for condensers, you 
must determine uncontrolled emissions using the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.1257(d)(2), and you must determine controlled emissions using 
the procedures specified in Sec. 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B) and (iii).
    (3) You must demonstrate that each process condenser is properly 
operated according to the procedures specified in Sec. 
63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(4)(ii) and (d)(3)(iii)(B). The reference in Sec. 
63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B) to the alternative standard in Sec. 63.1254(c) 
does not apply for the purposes of this subpart. As an alternative to 
measuring the exhaust gas temperature, as required by Sec. 
63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B), you may elect to measure the liquid temperature 
in the receiver.
    (4) You must conduct a performance test or compliance demonstration 
equivalent to an initial compliance demonstration within 360 hours of a 
change in operating conditions that are not considered to be within the 
previously established worst-case conditions.
    (e) Establishing operating limits. You must establish operating 
limits under the conditions required for your initial compliance 
demonstration, except you may elect to establish operating limit(s) for 
conditions other than those under which a performance test was conducted 
as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and, if applicable, 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
    (1) The operating limits may be based on the results of the 
performance test and supplementary information such as engineering 
assessments and manufacturer's recommendations. These limits may be 
established for conditions as unique as individual emission episodes. 
You must provide rationale in the precompliance report for the specific 
level for each operating limit, including any data and calculations used 
to

[[Page 259]]

develop the limit and a description of why the limit indicates proper 
operation of the control device. The procedures provided in this 
paragraph (e)(1) have not been approved by the Administrator and 
determination of the operating limit using these procedures is subject 
to review and approval by the Administrator.
    (2) If you elect to establish separate operating limits for 
different emission episodes, you must maintain records as specified in 
Sec. 63.8085(g) of each point at which you change from one operating 
limit to another, even if the duration of the monitoring for an 
operating limit is less than 15 minutes.
    (f) Averaging periods. If you elect to establish separate operating 
limits for different emission episodes, you may elect to determine 
operating block averages instead of the daily averages specified in 
Sec. 63.998(b)(3). An operating block is a period of time that is equal 
to the time from the beginning to end of an emission episode or sequence 
of emission episodes.
    (g) Flow indicators. If flow to a control device could be 
intermittent, you must install, calibrate, and operate a flow indicator 
at the inlet or outlet of the control device to identify periods of no 
flow. Periods of no flow may not be used in daily or block averages, and 
it may not be used in fulfilling a minimum data availability 
requirement.

which the control device does not meet the emission limit specified in 
Table 2 to this subpart, must not exceed 240 hours per year (hr/yr). You 
may submit an application to the Administrator requesting an extension 
of this time limit to a total of 360 hr/yr. The application must explain 
why the extension is needed, it must indicate that no material will be 
added to the storage tank between the time the 240 hr/yr limit is 
exceeded and the control device is again operational, and it must be 
submitted at least 60 days before the 240 hr/yr limit will be exceeded.

an offsite cleaning and reloading facility must comply with Sec. Sec. 
63.7995 through 63.8105 instead of complying with Sec. 
63.1253(f)(7)(ii).
    (2) You may elect to set a pressure relief device to a value less 
than the 2.5 psig required in Sec. 63.1253(f)(5) if you provide 
rationale in your notification of compliance status report explaining 
why the alternative value is sufficient to prevent breathing losses at 
all times.

<R05>
Sec. 63.8020  What requirements apply to my wastewater streams?

    (a) You must meet each requirement in Table 4 to this subpart that 
applies to your wastewater streams, and you must meet each applicable 
requirement specified in Sec. 63.8000 and paragraphs (b) through (d) of 
this section.
    (b) For each wastewater stream that you generate, you must either 
designate the wastewater stream as a Group 1 wastewater stream according

must include a description of planned reporting and recordkeeping 
procedures and the basis for the selected monitoring frequencies and the 
methods that will be used.

[[Page 261]]

    (d) If you transfer the wastewater offsite for enhanced biological 
treatment, you must obtain written certification from the offsite 
facility stating that the offsite facility will comply with the

                     Alternative Means of Compliance


<R05>
Sec. 63.8050  How do I comply with emissions averaging for stationary
process vessels at existing sources?

    (a) As an alternative to complying with the requirements in Table 1 
to this subpart for each individual stationary process vessel, you may 
elect to comply with emissions averaging for stationary process vessels 
greater than or equal to 250 gallons (gal) at your existing affected 
source as specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
    (b) General requirements. (1) A State may prohibit averaging of HAP 
emissions and require the owner or operator of an existing affected 
source to comply with the emission limits and work practice standards in 
Table 1 to this subpart.
    (2) All stationary process vessels in an emissions averaging group 
must be equipped with a tightly-fitting vented cover.
    (c) Initial compliance. To demonstrate initial compliance with the 
emissions averaging alternative, you must comply with the provisions in 
paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
    (1) Estimate uncontrolled emissions from each affected stationary 
process vessel in pounds per batch using the procedures specified in 
Sec. 63.1257(d)(2), except as specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and 
(ii) of this section. For the purposes of this section, uncontrolled 
emissions means the emissions from the vessel if it were equipped only 
with a tightly-fitting vented cover. You must identify the range of 
typical operating parameters and perform the calculation using the 
values that result in the highest emissions, and you must document the 
operating parameters and resulting emissions calculations in the 
precompliance report.
    (i) When you are required to calculate uncontrolled emissions from 
heating, you may not calculate emissions using Equation 13 of subpart 
GGG of this part 63.
    (ii) The statement in Sec. 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(B) that ``the partial 
pressure of HAP shall be assumed to be 25 percent of the saturated value 
if the

[[Page 262]]

purge flow rate is greater than 100 scfm'' does not apply. For the 
purposes of this subpart, multiply the HAP partial pressure in Equation 
12 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG by a HAP-specific saturation factor 
determined in accordance with Equations 1 through 3 of this section. 
Solve equation 1 of this section iteratively beginning with saturation 
factors (in the right-hand side of the equation) of 1.0 for each 
condensable compound. Stop iterating when the calculated saturation 
factors for all compounds are the same to two significant figures for 
subsequent iterations. Note that for multi-component emission streams, 
saturation factors must be calculated for all condensable compounds, not 
just the HAP.

where:

S<INF>1</INF>=saturation factor for individual condensable compounds in 
the emission stream
P<INF>i</INF>=partial pressure of individual condensable compounds in 
the emission stream calculated using Raoult's Law or other appropriate 
methods
P<INF>T</INF>=pressure of the vessel vapor space
A=surface area of liquid
V=purge flow rate as used in Equation 12 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG
V<INF>i</INF>\sat\=volumetric flowrate of condensable compounds in the 
emission stream
K<INF>i</INF>=mass transfer coefficient of individual condensable 
compounds in the emission stream
K<INF>o</INF>=mass transfer coefficient of a reference compound (e.g., 
0.83 cm/s for water)

water)
M<INF>i</INF>=molecular weight of individual condensable compounds in 
the emission stream
n=number of condensable compounds in the emission stream

    (2) Estimate controlled emissions in pounds per batch for each 
vessel as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this 
section.
    (i) Except as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this 
section, estimate controlled emissions as if the vessel were controlled 
in compliance with entry 2.b.i. in Table 1 to this subpart.
    (ii) Estimate the controlled emissions using the control level 
achieved on November 15, 1990 if that value is greater than the 
applicable control level required by entry 2.b.i in Table 1 to this 
subpart.
    (iii) Estimate the controlled emissions using the control level 
required to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart 
if that level is greater than the applicable control level required by 
entry 2.b.i in Table 1 to this subpart and the other rule was in effect 
before the date when you request approval to comply with emissions 
averaging.
    (3) Determine actual emissions in pounds per batch for each vessel 
in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, 
as applicable.
    (4) Provide rationale in the precompliance report for why the sum of 
the actual emissions will be less than the sum of emissions from the 
vessels if they had been controlled in accordance with Table 1 to this 
subpart. The approved actual emissions calculated according to paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section are emission limits that must be incorporated 
into your operating permit.
    (d) Continuous compliance. (1) Maintain a monthly log of the number 
of batches produced that can be correlated with the emissions estimates 
per batch developed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) Sum the actual emissions for all of the process vessels in the 
emissions averaging group every three months, with the first 3-month 
period beginning on the compliance date, and compare the resulting total

Sec. 63.8055  How do I comply with a weight percent HAP limit
in coating products?

    (a) As an alternative to complying with the requirements in Table 1 
to this subpart for each individual stationary process vessel at an 
existing source, you may elect to comply with a 5 weight percent HAP 
limit for process vessels at your affected source that are used to 
manufacture coatings with a HAP content of less than 0.05 kg per kg 
product as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) You may only comply with the alternative during the production 
of coatings that contain less than 5 weight percent HAP, as determined 
using any of the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) 
of this section.
    (1) Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).
    (2) Method 24 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). You may use Method 24 
to determine the mass fraction of volatile matter and use that value as 
a substitute for the mass fraction of HAP.
    (3) You may use an alternative test method for determining mass 
fraction of HAP if you obtain prior approval by the Administrator. You 
must follow the procedure in Sec. 63.7(f) to submit an alternative test 
method for approval.
    (4) You may rely on formulation data from raw material suppliers if 
it represents each organic HAP that is present at 0.1 percent by mass or 
more for OSHA-defined carcinogens, as specified in 29 CFR 
1910.1200(d)(4), and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. 
If the HAP weight percent estimated based on formulation data conflicts 
with the results of a test conducted according to paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (3) of this section, then there is a rebuttal presumption that 
the test results are accurate unless, after consultation, you 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the permitting authority that the 
test results are not accurate and that the formulation data are more 
appropriate.

of Sec. 63.180(d). The provisions of Sec. 63.180(d) also specify how 
to determine that a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service.
    Large control device means a control device that controls total HAP 
emissions of greater than or equal to 10 tpy, before control.
    Maximum true vapor pressure means the equilibrium partial pressure 
exerted by the total organic HAP in the stored or transferred liquid at 
the temperature equal to the highest calendar-month average of the 
liquid storage or transfer temperature for liquids stored or transferred 
above or below the ambient temperature or at the local maximum monthly 
average temperature as reported by the National Weather Service for 
liquids stored or transferred at the ambient temperature, as determined:
    (1) In accordance with methods described in American Petroleum 
Institute Publication 2517, Evaporative Loss From External Floating-Roof 
Tanks (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 63.14 of subpart 
A of this part 63); or
    (2) As obtained from standard reference texts; or
    (3) As determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials 
Method D2879-83 (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 63.14 
of subpart A of this part); or
    (4) Any other method approved by the Administrator.
    Partially soluble HAP means HAP listed in Table 7 of this subpart.
    Point of determination (POD) means each point where process 
wastewater exits the miscellaneous coating operations.

    Note to definition for point of determination: The regulation allows 
determination of the characteristics of a wastewater stream at the point 
of determination or downstream of the point of determination if 
corrections are made for changes in flow rate and annual average 
concentration of partially soluble and soluble HAP compounds as 
determined in Sec. 63.144. Such changes include losses by air 
emissions; reduction of annual average concentration or changes in flow 
rate by mixing with other water or wastewater streams; and reduction in 
flow rate or annual average concentration by treating or otherwise 
handling the wastewater stream to remove or destroy HAP.

    Process vessel means any stationary or portable tank or other vessel 
with a capacity greater than or equal to 250 gal and in which mixing, 
blending, diluting, dissolving, temporary holding, and other processing 
steps occur in the manufacturing of a coating.

[[Page 270]]

    Process vessel vent means a vent from a process vessel or vents from 
multiple process vessels that are manifolded together into a common 
header, through which a HAP-containing gas stream is, or has the 
potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Emission streams that are 
undiluted and uncontrolled containing less than 50 ppmv HAP, as 
determined through process knowledge that no HAP are present in the 
emission stream or using an engineering assessment as discussed in Sec. 
63.1257(d)(2)(ii), test data using Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix 
A, or any other test method that has been validated according to the 
procedures in Method 301 of appendix A of this part, are not considered 
process vessel vents. Flexible elephant trunk systems when used with 
closed vent systems and drawing ambient air (i.e., the system is not 
ducted, piped, or otherwise connected to the unit operations) away from 
operators when vessels are opened are not process vessel vents. Process 
vessel vents do not include vents on storage tanks, wastewater emission 
sources, or pieces of equipment subject to the requirements in Table 3 
of this subpart. A gas stream going to a fuel gas system is not a 
process vessel vent. A gas stream routed to a process for a process 
purpose is not a process vessel vent.
    Recovery device, as used in the wastewater provisions, means an 
individual unit of equipment used for the purpose of recovering 
chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse, 
or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse. Examples of equipment that 
may be recovery devices include organic removal devices such as 
decanters, strippers, or thin-film evaporation units. To be a recovery 
device, a decanter and any other equipment based on the operating 
principle of gravity separation must receive only multi-phase liquid 
streams. A recovery device is considered part of the miscellaneous 
coating manufacturing operations.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 
70.2.
    Safety device means a closure device such as a pressure relief 
valve, frangible disc, fusible plug, or any other type of device which 
functions exclusively to prevent physical damage or permanent 
deformation to a unit or its air emission control equipment by venting 
gases or vapors directly to the atmosphere during unsafe conditions 
resulting from an unplanned, accidental, or emergency event. For the 
purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine 
venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover 
such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in response 
to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety 
device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal 
operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant 
parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the air 
emission control equipment as determined by the owner or operator based 
on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection 
and prevention codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe 
handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous 
materials.
    Shutdown means the cessation of operation of an affected source, any 
process vessels within an affected source, or equipment required or used 
to comply with this subpart if steps taken to cease operation differ 
from those under routine procedures for removing the vessel or equipment 
from service. Shutdown also applies to the emptying and degassing of 
storage tanks.
    Small control device means a control device that controls total HAP 
emissions of less than 10 tpy, before control.
    Soluble HAP means the HAP listed in Table 8 of this subpart.
    Startup means the setting in operation of a new affected source. For 
new equipment added to an affected source, including equipment required 
or used to comply with this subpart, startup means the first time the 
equipment is put into operation. Startup includes the setting in 
operation of equipment any time the steps taken differ from routine 
procedures for putting the equipment into operation.
    Storage tank means a tank or other vessel that is used to store 
organic liquids that contain one or more HAP as raw material feedstocks 
or products.

[[Page 271]]

The following are not considered storage tanks for the purposes of this 
subpart:
    (1) Vessels permanently attached to motor vehicles such as trucks, 
railcars, barges, or ships;
    (2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 
kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;
    (3) Vessels storing organic liquids that contain HAP only as 
impurities;
    (4) Wastewater storage tanks; and
    (5) Process vessels.
    Total organic compounds or (TOC) means the total gaseous organic 
compounds (minus methane and ethane) in a vent stream.
    Wastewater storage tank means a stationary structure that is 
designed to contain an accumulation of wastewater and is constructed 
primarily of nonearthen materials (e.g., wood, concrete, steel, plastic) 
which provide structural support.
    Wastewater stream means water that is discarded from miscellaneous 
coating manufacturing operations through a POD, and that contains an 
annual average concentration of total partially soluble and soluble HAP 
compounds of at least 1,600 ppmw at any flow rate. For the purposes of 
this subpart, noncontact cooling water is not considered a wastewater 
stream.
    Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice, 
or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated 
pursuant to section 112(h) of the Clean Air Act.

Subpart IIIII_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: 
         Mercury Emissions From Mercury Cell Chlor-Alkali Plants

    Source: 68 FR 70928, Dec. 19, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.8180  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) for affected sources of mercury emissions at 
mercury cell chlor-alkali plants. This subpart also establishes 
requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous

[[Page 278]]

compliance with all applicable emission limitations and work practice 
standards in this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8182  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a mercury 
cell chlor-alkali plant.
    (b) You are required to obtain a title V permit, whether your 
affected source is a part of a major source of hazardous air pollutant 
(HAP) emissions or a part of an area source of HAP emissions. A major 
source of HAP is a source that emits or has the potential to emit any 
single HAP at a rate of 10 tons or more per year or any combination of 
HAP at a rate of 25 tons or more per year. An area source of HAP is a 
source that has the potential to emit HAP but is not a major source. 
Nothing in this subpart revises how affected sources are aggregated for 
purposes of determining whether an affected source is a part of an area, 
nonmajor, or major source under any provisions of the Clean Air Act 
(CAA) or EPA's regulations. For information on aggregating affected 
sources to determine what is a source under title V, see the definition 
of major source in 40 CFR 70.2, 71.2 and 63.2.
    (c) Beginning on December 19, 2006, the provisions of subpart E of 
40 CFR part 61 that apply to mercury chlor-alkali plants, which are 
listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, are no longer 
applicable.
    (1) Sec. 61.52(a);
    (2) Sec. 61.53(b) and (c); and
    (3) Sec. 61.55(b), (c) and (d).


<R05>
Sec. 63.8184  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each affected source at a plant site 
where chlorine and caustic are produced in mercury cells. This subpart 
applies to two types of affected sources: the mercury cell chlor-alkali 
production facility, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and 
the mercury recovery facility, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (1) The mercury cell chlor-alkali production facility designates an 
affected source consisting of all cell rooms and ancillary operations 
used in the manufacture of product chlorine, product caustic, and by-
product hydrogen at a plant site. This subpart covers mercury emissions 
from by-product hydrogen streams, end box ventilation system vents, and 
fugitive emission sources associated with cell rooms, hydrogen systems, 
caustic systems, and storage areas for mercury-containing wastes.
    (2) The mercury recovery facility designates an affected source 
consisting of all processes and associated operations needed for mercury 
recovery from wastes at a plant site. This subpart covers mercury 
emissions from mercury thermal recovery unit vents and fugitive emission 
sources associated with storage areas for mercury-containing wastes.
    (b) An affected source at your mercury cell chlor-alkali plant is 
existing if you commenced construction of the affected source before 
July 3, 2002.
    (c) A mercury recovery facility is a new affected source if you 
commence construction or reconstruction of the affected source after 
July 3, 2002. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the 
definition of ``reconstruction'' in Sec. 63.2.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8186  When do I have to comply with this subpart?

    (a) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with 
each emission limitation, work practice standard, and recordkeeping and 
reporting requirement in this subpart that applies to you no later than 
December 19, 2006.
    (b) If you have a new or reconstructed mercury recovery facility and 
its initial startup date is on or before December 19, 2003, you must 
comply with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and 
recordkeeping and reporting requirement in this subpart that applies to 
you by December 19, 2003.
    (c) If you have a new or reconstructed mercury recovery facility and 
its initial startup date is after December 19, 2003, you must comply 
with each emission limitation, work practice standard, and recordkeeping 
and reporting requirement in this subpart that applies to you upon 
initial startup.
    (d) You must meet the notification and schedule requirements in 
Sec. 63.8252.

[[Page 279]]

Several of these notifications must be submitted before the compliance 
date for your affected source(s).

            Emission Limitations and Work Practice Standards


<R05>
Sec. 63.8190  What emission limitations must I meet?

    (a) Emission limits. You must meet each emission limit in paragraphs 
(a)(1) through (3) of this section that applies to you.
    (1) New or reconstructed mercury cell chlor-alkali production 
facility. Emissions of mercury are prohibited from a new or 
reconstructed mercury cell chlor-alkali production facility.
    (2) Existing mercury cell chlor-alkali production facility. During 
any consecutive 52-week period, you must not discharge to the atmosphere 
total mercury emissions in excess of the applicable limit in paragraph 
(a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section calculated using the procedures in 
Sec. 63.8243(a).
    (i) 0.076 grams of mercury per megagram of chlorine produced (1.5 x 
10<SUP>-4</SUP> pounds of mercury per ton of chlorine produced) from all 
by-product hydrogen streams and all end box ventilation system vents 
when both types of emission points are present.
    (ii) 0.033 grams of mercury per megagram of chlorine produced (6.59 
x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> pounds of mercury per ton of chlorine produced) from 
all by-product hydrogen streams when end box ventilation systems are not 
present.
    (3) New, reconstructed, or existing mercury recovery facility. You 
must not discharge to the atmosphere mercury emissions in excess of the 
applicable limit in paragraph (a)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.
    (i) 23 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter from each oven type 
mercury thermal recovery unit vent.
    (ii) 4 milligrams per dry standard cubic meter from each non-oven 
type mercury thermal recovery unit vent.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 63.8192  What work practice standards must I meet?

    You must meet the work practice requirements specified in paragraphs 
(a) through (f) of this section. As an alternative to the requirements 
specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, you may choose 
to comply with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (a) You must meet the work practice standards in Tables 1 through 4 
to this subpart, except as specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (b) You must adhere to the response intervals specified in Tables 1 
through 4 to this subpart at all times. Nonadherence to the intervals in 
Tables 1 through 4 to this subpart constitutes a deviation and must be 
documented and reported in the compliance report, as required by Sec. 
63.8254(b), with the date and time of the deviation, cause of the 
deviation, a description of the conditions, and time actual compliance 
was achieved.
    (c) As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), you may request to use an 
alternative to the work practice standards in Tables 1 through 4 to this 
subpart.
    (d) You must institute a floor-level mercury vapor measurement 
program to limit the amount of mercury vapor in the cell room 
environment through periodic measurement of mercury vapor levels and 
actions to be taken when a floor-level mercury concentration action 
level is exceeded. The program must meet the requirements listed in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section. As specified in Sec. 
63.8252(e)(1)(i) to implement this program, you must prepare and submit 
to the Administrator a floor-level mercury vapor measurement plan which 
must contain the elements listed in Table 5 to this subpart.
    (1) You must utilize a mercury measurement device described in of 
Table 6 to this subpart to measure the level of mercury vapor in the 
cell room at floor-level.
    (2) You must conduct at least one floor-level mercury vapor 
measurement evaluation each half day. This evaluation must include three 
measurements of the mercury concentration at locations representative of 
the entire cell room floor area. The average of these measurements must 
be recorded as specified in Sec. 63.8156(c)(1). At a minimum, you must 
measure the level of mercury vapor above mercury-containing cell room 
equipment, as well as areas around the cells,

[[Page 280]]

decomposers, or other mercury-containing equipment.
    (3) You must establish a floor-level mercury concentration action 
level that is no higher than 0.05 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m\3\).
    (4) If a mercury concentration greater than the action level is 
measured during any floor-level mercury vapor measurement evaluation, 
you must meet the requirements in either paragraph (d)(4)(i) or (ii) of 
this section.
    (i) If you determine that the cause of the elevated mercury 
concentration is an open electrolyzer, decomposer, or other maintenance 
activity, you must record the information specified in paragraphs 
(d)(4)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.
    (A) A description of the maintenance activity resulting in elevated 
mercury concentration;
    (B) The time the maintenance activity was initiated and completed; 
and
    (C) A detailed explanation how all the applicable requirements of 
Table 1 to this subpart were met during the maintenance activity.
    (ii) If you determine that the cause of the elevated mercury 
concentration is not an open electrolyzer, decomposer, or other 
maintenance activity, you must follow the procedures specified in 
paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section until the floor-level 
mercury concentration falls below the floor-level mercury concentration 
action level. You must also keep all the associated records for these 
procedures as specified in Table 9 to this subpart.
    (A) Within 1 hour of the time the floor-level mercury concentration 
action level was exceeded, you must conduct each inspection specified in 
Table 2 to this subpart in the area where the concentration higher than 
the floor-level mercury concentration action level was measured, with 
the exception of the cell room floor and the pillars and beam 
inspections. (B) You must also inspect all decomposers, hydrogen system 
piping up to the hydrogen header, and other potential locations of 
mercury vapor leaks in the area using a technique specified in Table 6 
to this subpart. You must correct any problem identified during these 
inspections according to the requirements in Tables 2 and 3 to this 
subpart.
    (e) You must prepare, submit, and operate according to a written 
washdown plan designed to minimize fugitive mercury emissions through 
routine washing of surfaces where liquid mercury could accumulate. The 
written plan must address the elements contained in Table 7 to this 
subpart.
    (f) You must keep records of the mass of all virgin mercury added to 
cells on an annual basis.
    (g) As an alternative to the work practice standards in paragraphs 
(a) through (d) of this section, you may institute a cell room 
monitoring program to continuously monitor the mercury vapor 
concentration in the upper portion of each cell room and to take 
corrective actions as quickly as possible when elevated mercury vapor 
levels are detected. As specified in Sec. 63.8252(e)(1)(iv), if you 
choose this option, you must prepare and submit to the Administrator, a 
cell room monitoring plan containing the elements listed in Table 5 to 
this subpart and meet the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) 
of this section.
    (1) You must utilize mercury monitoring systems that meet the 
requirements of Table 8 to this subpart.
    (2) You must establish an action level according to the requirements 
in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (i) Beginning on the compliance date specified for your affected 
source in Sec. 63.8186, measure and record the mercury concentration 
for at least 30 days using a system that meets the requirements of 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

maintaining the outlet mercury hourly-average concentration no higher 
than the applicable limit. To determine the outlet mercury 
concentration, you must monitor according to paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) 
of this section.
    (i) Continuous monitoring option. You must collect mercury 
concentration data according to Sec. 63.8244(a), representing at least 
75 percent of the 15-minute periods in the operating day (with data 
recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and 
required quality assurance or control activities not counting toward the 
75 percent requirement).
    (ii) Periodic monitoring option. You must conduct at least three 
test runs per week to collect mercury emissions samples according to 
Sec. 63.8244(b)(1) and (2)(i) and, if your final control device is not

taken according to Sec. 63.8244(b)(2)(iv) did not result in average 
monitoring values being within range within 48 hours of the period that 
the monitoring value is out of range.
    (4) You must report each instance in which the corrective action 
taken according to Sec. 63.8244(b)(2)(v) did not result in the maximum 
hourly temperature being above the reference temperature during the 
first regeneration cycle following the period that the monitoring value 
was out of range.
    (b) Startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (1) Consistent with 
Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations that occur during a period 
of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not violations if you 
demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating 
in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1).
    (2) The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur 
during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations, 
according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).
    (3) By-passing the control device for maintenance activities is not 
considered a startup, shutdown, or malfunction event.

 Subpart JJJJJ_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants 
          for Brick and Structural Clay Products Manufacturing

    Source: 68 FR 26722, May 16, 2003, unless otherwise note.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.8380  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission limitations for hazardous 
air pollutants (HAP) emitted from brick and structural clay products 
(BSCP) manufacturing facilities. This subpart also establishes 
requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the 
emission limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8385  Am I subject to this subpart?

    You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a BSCP 
manufacturing facility that is, is located at, or is part of, a major 
source of HAP emissions according to the criteria in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section.
    (a) A BSCP manufacturing facility is a plant site that manufactures 
brick (including, but not limited to, face brick, structural brick, and 
brick pavers); clay pipe; roof tile; extruded floor and wall tile; and/
or other extruded, dimensional clay products. Brick and structural clay 
products manufacturing facilities typically process raw clay and shale, 
form the processed materials into bricks or shapes, and dry and fire the 
bricks or shapes.
    (b) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or 
group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common 
control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate 
of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP 
at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8390  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each existing, new, or reconstructed 
affected source at a BSCP manufacturing facility.
    (b) The existing affected source is an existing tunnel kiln with a 
design capacity equal to or greater than 9.07 megagrams per hour (Mg/hr) 
(10 tons per hour (tph)) of fired product according to paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (3) of this section. For the remainder of this subpart, a tunnel 
kiln with a design capacity equal to or greater than 9.07 Mg/hr (10 tph) 
of fired product will be called a large tunnel kiln, and a tunnel kiln 
with a design capacity less than 9.07 Mg/hr (10 tph) of fired product 
will be called a small tunnel kiln.
    (1) For existing tunnel kilns that do not have sawdust dryers, the 
kiln exhaust process stream (i.e., the only process stream) is subject 
to the requirements of this subpart.
    (2) For existing tunnel kilns that ducted exhaust to sawdust dryers 
prior to July 22, 2002, only the kiln exhaust process stream (i.e., the 
process stream that exhausts directly to the atmosphere or to an air 
pollution control device (APCD)) is subject to the requirements of this 
subpart. As such, any process stream that is ducted to a sawdust dryer 
is not subject to these requirements.

[[Page 305]]

    (3) For existing tunnel kilns that first ducted exhaust to sawdust 
dryers on or after July 22, 2002, all of the exhaust (i.e., all process 
streams) is subject to the requirements of this subpart.
    (c) An existing small tunnel kiln whose design capacity is increased 
such that it is equal to or greater than 9.07 Mg/hr (10 tph) of fired 
product is subject to the requirements of this subpart.
    (d) An existing tunnel kiln with a federally enforceable permit 
condition that restricts kiln operation to less than 9.07 Mg/hr (10 tph) 
of fired product on a 12-month rolling average basis is not subject to 
the requirements of this subpart.
    (e) Each new or reconstructed tunnel kiln is an affected source 
regardless of design capacity. All process streams from each new or 
reconstructed tunnel kiln are subject to the requirements of this 
subpart.
    (f) Kilns that are used exclusively for research and development 
(R&D) and are not used to manufacture products for commercial sale, 
except in a de minimis manner, are not subject to the requirements of 
this subpart.
    (g) Kilns that are used exclusively for setting glazes on previously 
fired products are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.
    (h) A source is a new affected source if construction of the 
affected source began after July 22, 2002, and you met the applicability 
criteria at the time you began construction.
    (i) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria as 
defined in Sec. 63.2, except as provided in paragraphs (i)(1) and 
(i)(2) of this section.
    (1) It is not technologically and economically feasible for an 
existing small tunnel kiln whose design capacity is increased such that 
it is equal to or greater than 9.07 Mg/hr (10 tph) of fired product to 
meet the relevant standards (i.e., new source maximum achievable control 
technology (MACT)) by retrofitting with a dry lime injection fabric 
filter (DIFF), dry lime scrubber/fabric filter (DLS/FF), or wet scrubber 
(WS).
    (2) It is not technologically and economically feasible for an 
existing large dry limestone adsorber (DLA)-controlled kiln to meet the 
relevant standards by retrofitting with a DIFF, DLS/FF, or WS.
    (j) An affected source is existing if it is not new or 
reconstructed.


<R05>

or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP, you 
must be in compliance with this subpart according to paragraphs (c)(1) 
and (2) of this section.
    (1) Any portion of the existing facility that is a new affected 
source or a new reconstructed source must be in compliance with this 
subpart upon startup.
    (2) All other parts of the existing facility must be in compliance

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.8465  How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate 
continuous compliance?

    (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section.
    (b) Except for periods of monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, 
and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), 
you must monitor continuously (or collect data at all required 
intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating. This 
includes periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and routine control 
device maintenance as specified in Sec. 63.8420(e) when the affected 
source is operating.
    (c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality 
assurance or control activities for purposes of calculating data 
averages. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not 
reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid 
data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or 
careless operation are not malfunctions. You must use all the valid data 
collected during all other periods in assessing compliance. Any 
averaging period for which you do not have valid monitoring data and 
such data are required constitutes a deviation from the monitoring 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8470  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the
emission limitations?

    (a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission 
limit and operating limit in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart that applies 
to you according to the methods specified in Table 5 to this subpart.
    (b) For each affected kiln that is equipped with an APCD that is not 
addressed in Table 2 to this subpart, or that is using process changes 
as a means of meeting the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, 
you must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission limit in 
Table 1 to this subpart, and each operating limit established as 
required in Sec. 63.8445(i)(2) according to the methods specified in 
your approved alternative monitoring procedures request, as described in 
Sec. Sec. 63.8445(i)(1) and 63.8(f).
    (c) You must report each instance in which you did not meet each 
emission limit and each operating limit in this subpart that applies to 
you. This includes periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and 
routine control device maintenance. These instances are deviations from 
the emission limitations in this subpart. These deviations must be 
reported according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8485.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations 
that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not 
violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that 
you were operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1) and your OM&M 
plan. The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur 
during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations, 
according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).
    (f) Deviations that occur during periods of control device 
maintenance covered by an approved routine control device maintenance 
exemption according to Sec. 63.8420(e) are not violations if you 
demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating 
in accordance with the approved routine control device maintenance 
exemption.
    (g) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the operating 
limits in Table 2 to this subpart for visible emissions (VE) from tunnel 
kilns equipped with DLA, DIFF, or DLS/FF by monitoring VE at each kiln 
stack according to the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of 
this section.
    (1) Perform daily VE observations of each kiln stack according to 
the procedures of Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. You must 
conduct the Method 22 test while the affected

[[Page 312]]

source is operating under normal conditions. The duration of each Method 
22 test must be at least 15 minutes.
    (2) If VE are observed during any daily test conducted using Method 
22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, you must promptly initiate and 
complete corrective actions according to your OM&M plan. If no VE are 
observed in 30 consecutive daily Method 22 tests for any kiln stack, you 
may decrease the frequency of Method 22 testing from daily to weekly for 
that kiln stack. If VE are observed during any weekly test, you must 
promptly initiate and complete corrective actions according to your OM&M 
plan, resume Method 22 testing of that kiln stack on a daily basis, and 
maintain that schedule until no VE are observed in 30 consecutive daily 
tests, at which time you may again decrease the frequency of Method 22 
testing to a weekly basis.
    (3) If VE are observed during any test conducted using Method 22 of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, you must report these deviations by 
following the requirements in Sec. 63.8485.

storage bin, a reaction chamber that is essentially a packed tower 
filled with limestone, and may or may not include a peeling drum that 
mechanically scrapes reacted limestone to regenerate the stone for 
reuse.
    Emission limitation means any emission limit or operating limit.
    Fabric filter means an APCD used to capture PM by filtering a gas 
stream through filter media; also known as a baghouse.
    Initial startup means:
    (1) For a new or reconstructed tunnel kiln controlled with a DLA, 
and for a tunnel kiln that would be considered reconstructed but for 
Sec. 63.8390(i)(1) or Sec. 63.8390(i)(2), the time at which the 
temperature in the kiln first reaches 260 [deg]C (500 [deg]F) and the 
kiln contains product; or
    (2) For a new or reconstructed tunnel kiln controlled with a DIFF, 
DLS/FF, or WS, the time at which the kiln first reaches a level of 
production that is equal to 75 percent of the kiln design capacity or 12 
months after the affected source begins firing BSCP, whichever is 
earlier.
    Kiln exhaust process stream means the portion of the exhaust from a 
tunnel kiln that exhausts directly to the atmosphere (or to an APCD), 
rather than to a sawdust dryer.

reconstructed) with a design capacity equal to or greater than 9.07 Mg/
hr (10 tph) of fired product.
    Particulate matter (PM) means, for purposes of this subpart, 
emissions of PM that serve as a measure of total particulate emissions, 
as measured by Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A), and as a surrogate 
for metal HAP contained in the particulates including, but not limited 
to, antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, 
manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium.
    Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under 
common control, including properties that are separated only by a road 
or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that 
are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, 
subsidiary, or any combination thereof.
    Research and development kiln means any kiln whose purpose is to 
conduct research and development for new processes and products and is 
not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale, except 
in a de minimis manner.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 
70.2.
    Small tunnel kiln means a tunnel kiln (existing, new, or 
reconstructed) with a design capacity less than 9.07 Mg/hr (10 tph) of 
fired product.
    Startup means the setting in operation of an affected source and 
starting the production process.
    Tunnel kiln means any continuous kiln that is used to fire BSCP. 
Some tunnel kilns have two process streams, including a process stream 
that exhausts directly to the atmosphere or to an APCD, and a process 
stream in which the kiln exhaust is ducted to a sawdust dryer where it 
is used to dry sawdust before being emitted to the atmosphere.
    Tunnel kiln design capacity means the maximum amount of brick, in Mg 
(tons), that a kiln is designed to produce in one year divided by the 
number of hours in a year (8,760 hours). If a kiln is modified to 
increase the capacity, the design capacity is considered to be the 
capacity following modifications.
    Wet scrubber (WS) means an APCD that uses water, which may include 
caustic additives or other chemicals, as the sorbent. Wet scrubbers may 
use any of various design mechanisms to increase the contact between 
exhaust gases and the sorbent.

    Source: 68 FR 26738, May 16, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.8530  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission limitations and work 
practice standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from clay 
ceramics manufacturing facilities. This subpart also establishes 
requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the 
emission limitations and work practice standards.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8535  Am I subject to this subpart?

    You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a clay 
ceramics manufacturing facility that is, is located at, or is part of a 
major source of HAP emissions according to the criteria in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section.
    (a) A clay ceramics manufacturing facility is a plant site that 
manufactures pressed floor tile, pressed wall tile, other pressed tile, 
or sanitaryware (e.g., sinks and toilets). Clay ceramics manufacturing 
facilities typically process clay, shale, and various additives; form 
the processed materials into tile or sanitaryware shapes; and dry and 
fire the ceramic products. Glazes are applied to many tile and 
sanitaryware products.
    (b) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or 
group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common 
control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate 
of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP 
at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8540  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each existing, new, or reconstructed 
affected source at a clay ceramics manufacturing facility and to each 
affected source described in paragraphs (f)(1) or (f)(2) of this 
section.
    (b) Each existing, new, or reconstructed periodic kiln, tunnel kiln, 
and roller kiln is an affected source regardless of design capacity. 
Each source that meets the description in paragraphs (f)(1) or (f)(2) 
also is an affected source.
    (c) Kilns that are used exclusively for research and development 
(R&D) and are not used to manufacture products for commercial sale, 
except in a de minimis manner, are not subject to the requirements of 
this subpart.
    (d) Kilns that are used exclusively for setting glazes on previously 
fired products or for refiring are not subject to the requirements of 
this subpart.
    (e) A source is a new affected source if construction of the 
affected source

[[Page 328]]

began after July 22, 2002, and you met the applicability criteria at the 
time you began construction.
    (f) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria as 
defined in Sec. 63.2, except as provided in paragraphs (f)(1) and 
(f)(2) of this section.
    (1) It is not technologically and economically feasible for an 
existing tunnel kiln whose design capacity is less than 9.07 megagrams 
per hour (Mg/hr) (10 tons per hour (tph)) of fired product but is 
increased such that it is equal to or greater than 9.07 Mg/hr (10 tph) 
of fired product to meet the relevant standards (i.e., new source 
maximum achievable control technology (MACT)) by retrofitting with a dry 
lime injection fabric filter (DIFF), dry lime scrubber/fabric filter 
(DLS/FF), or wet scrubber (WS).
    (2) It is not technologically and economically feasible for an 
existing dry limestone adsorber (DLA)-controlled kiln whose design 
capacity is equal to or greater than 9.07 Mg/hr (10 tph) of fired 
product to meet the relevant standards by retrofitting with a DIFF, DLS/
FF, or WS.
    (g) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed 
and does not meet the descriptions provided in paragraphs (f)(1) and 
(f)(2) of this section.

Sec. 63.8605  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission
limitations and work practice standards?

    (a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each emission 
limitation and work practice standard that applies to you according to 
Table 5 to this subpart.
    (b) You must establish each site-specific operating limit in Table 2 
to this subpart that applies to you according to the requirements in 
Sec. 63.8595 and Table 4 to this subpart.
    (c) You must submit the Notification of Compliance Status containing 
the results of the initial compliance demonstration according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.8630(e).

                   Continuous Compliance Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 63.8615  How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate
continuous compliance?

    (a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section.
    (b) Except for periods of monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, 
and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as 
applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), 
you must monitor continuously (or collect data at all required 
intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating. This 
includes periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and routine control 
device maintenance as specified in Sec. 63.8570(e) when the affected 
source is operating.
    (c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, 
associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality 
assurance or control activities for purposes of calculating data 
averages. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not 
reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid 
data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or 
careless operation are not malfunctions. You must use all the valid data 
collected during all other periods in assessing compliance. Any 
averaging period for which you do not have valid monitoring data and 
such data are required constitutes a deviation from the monitoring 
requirements.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8620  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission
limitations and work practice standards?

    (a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission 
limit, operating limit, and work practice standard in Tables 1, 2, and 3 
to this subpart that applies to you according to the methods specified 
in Table 6 to this subpart.
    (b) For each kiln that is subject to the emission limits specified 
in Table 1 to this subpart and is equipped with an APCD that is not 
addressed in Table 2 to this subpart, or that is using process changes 
as a means of meeting the emission limits in Table 1 to this subpart, 
you must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission limit in 
Table 1 to this subpart, and each operating limit established as 
required in Sec. 63.8595(i)(2) according to the methods specified in 
your approved alternative monitoring procedures request, as described in 
Sec. Sec. 63.8595(i)(1) and 63.8(f).
    (c) You must report each instance in which you did not meet each 
emission limit and operating limit in this subpart that applies to you. 
This includes periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, and routine 
control device maintenance. These instances are deviations from the 
emission limitations in this subpart. These deviations must be reported 
according to the requirements in Sec. 63.8635.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations 
that occur during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not 
violations if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that 
you were operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1) and your OM&M 
plan. The Administrator will determine whether deviations that occur 
during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are violations, 
according to the provisions in Sec. 63.6(e).
    (f) Deviations that occur during periods of control device 
maintenance covered by an approved routine control device maintenance 
exemption according to Sec. 63.8570(e) are not violations if you

[[Page 335]]

demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating 
in accordance with the approved routine control device maintenance 
exemption.
    (g) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the operating 
limits in Table 2 to this subpart for visible emissions (VE) from tunnel 
kilns equipped with DLA, DIFF, or DLS/FF by monitoring VE at each kiln 
stack according to the requirements in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of 
this section.
    (1) Perform daily VE observations of each kiln stack according to 
the procedures of Method 22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. You must 
conduct the Method 22 test while the affected source is operating under 
normal conditions. The duration of each Method 22 test must be at least 
15 minutes.
    (2) If VE are observed during any daily test conducted using Method 
22 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, you must promptly initiate and 
complete corrective actions according to your OM&M plan. If no VE are 
observed in 30 consecutive daily Method 22 tests for any kiln stack, you 
may decrease the frequency of Method 22 testing from daily to weekly for 
that kiln stack. If VE are observed during any weekly test, you must 
promptly initiate and complete corrective actions according to your OM&M 
plan, resume Method 22 testing of that kiln stack on a daily basis, and 
maintain that schedule until no VE are observed in 30 consecutive daily 
tests, at which time you may again decrease the frequency of Method 22 
testing to a weekly basis.
    (3) If VE are observed during any test conducted using Method 22 of 
40 CFR part 60, appendix A, you must report these deviations by 
following the requirements in Sec. 63.8635.

production that is equal to 75 percent of the kiln design capacity or 12 
months after the affected source begins firing clay ceramics, whichever 
is earlier.
    Particulate matter (PM) means, for purposes of this subpart, 
emissions of PM that serve as a measure of total particulate emissions, 
as measured by Method 5 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A), and as a surrogate 
for metal HAP contained in the particulates including, but not limited 
to, antimony, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, 
manganese, mercury, nickel, and selenium.
    Period of natural gas curtailment or supply interruption means a 
period of time during which the supply of natural gas to an affected 
facility is halted for reasons beyond the control of the facility. An 
increase in the cost or unit price of natural gas does not constitute a 
period of natural gas curtailment or supply interruption.
    Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under 
common control, including properties that are separated only by a road 
or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that 
are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, 
subsidiary, or any combination thereof.
    Research and development kiln means any kiln whose purpose is to 
conduct research and development for new processes and products and is 
not engaged in the manufacture of products for commercial sale, except 
in a de minimis manner.

70.2.
    Startup means the setting in operation of an affected source and 
starting the production process.
    Tunnel kiln means any continuous kiln that is not a roller kiln that 
is used to fire clay ceramics.
    Tunnel kiln design capacity means the maximum amount of clay 
ceramics, in Mg (tons), that a kiln is designed to produce in one year 
divided by the number of hours in a year (8,760 hours). If a kiln is 
modified to increase the capacity, the design capacity is considered to 
be the capacity following modifications.
    Wet scrubber (WS) means an APCD that uses water, which may include 
caustic additives or other chemicals, as the sorbent. Wet scrubbers may 
use any of various design mechanisms to increase the contact between 
exhaust gases and the sorbent.
    Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice, 
operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated 
pursuant to section 112(h) of the Clean Air Act.

Subpart LLLLL_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: 
          Asphalt Processing and Asphalt Roofing Manufacturing

    Source: 68 FR 24577, May 7, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                        What This Subpart Covers


<R05>
Sec. 63.8680  What is the purpose of this subpart?

    This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous 
air pollutants (NESHAP) for existing and new asphalt processing and 
asphalt roofing manufacturing facilities. This subpart also establishes 
requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the 
emission limitations.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8681  Am I subject to this subpart?

    (a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an asphalt 
processing facility or an asphalt roofing manufacturing facility, as 
defined in Sec. 63.8698, that is a major source of hazardous air 
pollutants (HAP) emissions, or is located at, or is part of a major 
source of HAP emissions.
    (b) After the applicable compliance date specified in Sec. 63.8683, 
blowing stills, asphalt storage tanks, saturators, wet loopers, and 
coaters subject to the provisions of this subpart that are also subject 
to 40 CFR part 60, subpart UU, are required to comply only with 
provisions of this subpart.
    (c) This subpart does not apply to any equipment that is subject to 
subpart CC of this part or to subpart K, Ka, or Kb of 40 CFR part 60.
    (d) This subpart does not apply to asphalt processing and asphalt 
roofing manufacturing equipment used for research and development, as 
defined in Sec. 63.8698.

[[Page 352]]

    (e) The provisions of subpart J of 40 CFR part 60 do not apply to 
emissions from asphalt processing facilities subject to this subpart.
    (f) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or 
group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common 
control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate 
of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP 
at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.

[68 FR 24577, May 7, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 28364, May 17, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 63.8682  What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

    (a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing 
affected source at asphalt processing and asphalt roofing manufacturing 
facilities.
    (b) The affected source is:
    (1) Each asphalt processing facility as defined in Sec. 63.8698; or
    (2) Each asphalt roofing manufacturing line as defined in Sec. 
63.8698.
    (i) If the asphalt roofing manufacturing line is collocated with an 
asphalt processing facility, the storage tanks that store asphalt flux 
intended for oxidation in the blowing stills and those tanks that 
receive asphalt directly from the on-site blowing stills are part of the 
asphalt processing facility. The remaining asphalt storage tanks are 
considered to be part of the asphalt roofing facility.
    (ii) If an asphalt storage tank is shared by two or more lines at an 
asphalt roofing manufacturing facility, the shared storage tank is 
considered part of the line to which the tank supplies the greatest 
amount of asphalt, on an annual basis.
    (iii) If a sealant or adhesive applicator is shared by two or more 
asphalt roofing manufacturing lines, the shared applicator is considered 
part of the line that provides the greatest throughput to the 
applicator, on an annual basis.
    (c) An affected source is a new affected source if you commenced 
construction of the affected source after November 21, 2001, and you met 
the applicability criteria at the time you commenced construction.
    (d) An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the criteria in 
the reconstruction definition in Sec. 63.2.
    (e) An affected source is existing if it is not new or 
reconstructed.

Sec. 63.8698  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 40 
CFR 63.2, the General Provisions of this part, and in this section as 
follows:
    Adhesive applicator means the equipment used to apply adhesive to 
roofing shingles for producing laminated or dimensional roofing 
shingles.
    Asphalt flux means the organic residual material from distillation 
of crude oil that is generally used in asphalt roofing manufacturing and 
paving and non-paving asphalt products.

[[Page 360]]

    Asphalt loading rack means the equipment at an asphalt processing 
facility used to transfer oxidized asphalt from a storage tank into a 
tank truck, rail car, or barge.
    Asphalt processing facility means any facility engaged in the 
preparation of asphalt flux at stand-alone asphalt processing 
facilities, petroleum refineries, and asphalt roofing facilities. 
Asphalt preparation, called ``blowing,'' is the oxidation of asphalt 
flux, achieved by bubbling air through the heated asphalt, to raise the 
softening point and to reduce penetration of the oxidized asphalt. An 
asphalt processing facility includes one or more asphalt flux blowing 
stills, asphalt flux storage tanks storing asphalt flux intended for 
processing in the blowing stills, oxidized asphalt storage tanks, and 
oxidized asphalt loading racks.
    Asphalt roofing manufacturing facility means a facility consisting 
of one or more asphalt roofing manufacturing lines.
    Asphalt roofing manufacturing line means the collection of equipment 
used to manufacture asphalt roofing products through a series of 
sequential process steps. The equipment that comprises an asphalt 
roofing manufacturing line varies depending on the type of substrate 
used (i.e., organic or inorganic) and the final product manufactured 
(e.g., roll roofing, laminated shingles). For example, an asphalt 
roofing manufacturing line that uses fiberglass mat as a substrate 
typically would not include a saturator/wet looper (or the saturator/wet 
looper could be bypassed if the line manufacturers multiple types of 
products). An asphalt roofing manufacturing line can include a saturator 
(including wet looper), coater, coating mixers, sealant applicators, 
adhesive applicators, and asphalt storage and process tanks. The number 
of asphalt roofing manufacturing lines at a particular facility is 
determined by the number of saturators (or coaters) operated in 
parallel. For example, an asphalt roofing manufacturing facility with 
two saturators (or coaters) operating in parallel would be considered to 
have two separate roofing manufacturing lines.
    Asphalt storage tank means any tank used to store asphalt flux, 
oxidized asphalt, and modified asphalt, at asphalt roofing manufacturing 
facilities, petroleum refineries, and asphalt processing facilities. 
Storage tanks containing cutback asphalts (asphalts diluted with 
solvents to reduce viscosity for low temperature applications) and 
emulsified asphalts (asphalts dispersed in water with an emulsifying 
agent) are not subject to this subpart.
    Blowing still means the equipment in which air is blown through 
asphalt flux to change the softening point and penetration rate of the 
asphalt flux, creating oxidized asphalt.
    Boiler means any enclosed combustion device that extracts useful 
energy in the form of steam and is not an incinerator.
    Coater means the equipment used to apply amended (filled or 
modified) asphalt to the top and bottom of the substrate (typically 
fiberglass mat) used to manufacture shingles and rolled roofing 
products.
    Coating mixer means the equipment used to mix coating asphalt and a 
mineral stabilizer, prior to applying the stabilized coating asphalt to 
the substrate.
    Combustion device means an individual unit of equipment such as a 
flare, incinerator, process heater, or boiler used for the combustion of 
organic hazardous air pollutant vapors.
    Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to 
this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
    (1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this 
subpart including, but not limited to, any emission limitation 
(including any operating limit), or work practice standard;
    (2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement 
an applicable requirement in this subpart, and that is included in the 
operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a 
permit; or
    (3) Fails to meet any emission limitation (including any operating 
limit) or work practice standard in this subpart during startup, 
shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is 
permitted by this subpart.

[[Page 361]]

    Emission limitation means any emission limit, opacity limit, 
operating limit, or visible emission limit.
    Group 1 asphalt loading rack means an asphalt loading rack that 
loads asphalt with a maximum temperature of 260 [deg]C (500 [deg]F) or 
greater and has a maximum true vapor pressure of 10.4 kiloPascals (kPa) 
(1.5 pounds per square inch absolute (psia)) or greater.
    Group 2 asphalt loading rack means an asphalt loading rack that is 
not a Group 1 asphalt loading rack.
    Group 1 asphalt storage tank means an asphalt storage tank that 
meets both of the following criteria:
    (1) Has a capacity of 177 cubic meters (47,000 gallons) of asphalt 
or greater; and
    (2) Stores asphalt at a maximum temperature of 260 [deg]C (500 
[deg]F) or greater and has a maximum true vapor pressure of 10.4 kPa 
(1.5 psia) or greater.
    Group 2 asphalt storage tank means any asphalt storage tank with a 
capacity of 1.93 megagrams (Mg) of asphalt or greater that is not a 
Group 1 asphalt storage tank.
    Incinerator means an enclosed combustion device that is used for 
destroying organic compounds. Auxiliary fuel may be used to heat waste 
gas to combustion temperatures. Any energy recovery section present is 
not physically formed into one manufactured or assembled unit with the 
combustion section; rather, the energy recovery section is a separate 
section following the combustion section and the two are joined by ducts 
or connections carrying flue gas.
    Maximum true vapor pressure means the equilibrium partial pressure 
exerted by the stored asphalt at its maximum storage temperature.
    Modified asphalt means asphalt that has been mixed with polymer 
modifiers.
    Oxidized asphalt means asphalt that has been prepared by passing air 
through liquid asphalt flux in a blowing still.
    Process heater means an enclosed combustion device that primarily 
transfers heat liberated by burning fuel directly to process streams or 
to heat transfer liquids other than water.
    Research and development equipment means any equipment whose primary 
purpose is to conduct research and development to develop new processes 
and products, where such equipment is operated under the close 
supervision of technically trained personnel and is not engaged in the 
manufacture of products for commercial sale in commerce, except in a de 
minimis manner.
    Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 
70.2.
    Saturator means the equipment in which substrate (predominantly 
organic felt) is filled with asphalt. Saturators are predominantly used 
for the manufacture of saturated felt products. The term saturator 
includes the saturator and wet looper.
    Sealant applicator means the equipment used to apply a sealant strip 
to a roofing product. The sealant strip is used to seal overlapping 
pieces of roofing product after they have been applied.
    Work practice standard means any design, equipment, work practice, 
or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated 
pursuant to section 112(h) of the Clean Air Act.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\a\ The operating limits specified in Table 2 and the requirements
  specified in Table 5 are applicable if you are monitoring control
  device operating parameters to demonstrate continuous compliance. If
  you use a CEMS or COMS to demonstrate compliance with the emission
  limits, you are not required to record control device operating
  parameters. However, you must maintain emissions below the value
  established during the initial performance test. Data from the CEMS
  and COMS must be reduced as specified in Sec. 63.8(g).
\b\ Continuous parameter monitoring is not required if (1) the emissions
  are routed to a boiler or process heater with a with a design heat
  input capacity of 44 MW or greater; or (2) the emissions are
  introduced into the flame zone of a boiler or process heater.
\c\ A 15-minute averaging period can be used as an alternative to the 3-
  hour averaging period for this parameter.
\d\ As an alternative to monitoring the pressure drop across the control
  device, owners or operators using an ESP to achieve compliance with
  the emission limits specified in Table 1 of this subpart can monitor
  the voltage to the ESP. If this option is selected, the ESP voltage
  must be maintained at or above the operating limit established during
  the performance test.

[[Page 376]]

system efficiency as described in Table 3 to this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8802  What methods must I use to demonstrate compliance with 
the emission limitation for loop slitter adhesive use?

    (a) Determine the HAP content for each material used. To determine 
the HAP content for each material used in your foam fabrication 
operations, you must use one of the options in paragraphs (a)(1) through 
(3) of this section. If you use the option in paragraph (a)(3) of this 
section, you are subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section.
    (1) Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63). You may use Method 
311 for determining the mass fraction of HAP. Use the procedures 
specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section when 
determining HAP content by Method 311.
    (i) Include in the HAP total each HAP that is measured to be present 
at 0.1 percent by mass or more for Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA)-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 
1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. 
For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is measured to be 0.5 
percent of the material by mass, you do not need to include it in the 
HAP total. Express the mass fraction of each HAP you measure as a value 
truncated to four places after the decimal point (for example, 0.1234).
    (ii) Calculate the total HAP content in the test material by adding 
up the individual HAP contents and truncating the result to three places 
after the decimal point (for example, 0.123).
    (2) Alternative method. You may use an alternative test method for 
determining mass fraction of HAP if you obtain prior approval by the 
Administrator. You must follow the procedure in Sec. 63.7(f) to submit 
an alternative test method for approval.
    (3) Information from the supplier or manufacturer of the material. 
You may rely on information other than that generated by the test 
methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section to 
determine the mass fraction of HAP according to paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and 
(ii) of this section. This information may include, but is not limited 
to, a material safety data sheet (MSDS), a certified product data sheet 
(CPDS), or a manufacturer's hazardous air pollutant data sheet.
    (i) Include in the HAP total each HAP that is present at 0.1 percent 
by mass or more for OSHA-defined carcinogens as specified in 29 CFR 
1910.1200(d)(4) and at 1.0 percent by mass or more for other compounds. 
For example, if toluene (not an OSHA carcinogen) is 0.5 percent of the 
material by mass, you do not have to include it in the HAP total.
    (ii) If the HAP content is provided by the material supplier or 
manufacturer as a range, then you must use the upper limit of the range 
for determining compliance.
    (4) Verification of supplier or manufacturer information. Although 
you are not required to perform testing to verify the information 
obtained according to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the 
Administrator may require a separate measurement of the total HAP 
content using the methods specified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this 
section. If this measurement exceeds the total HAP content provided by 
the material supplier or manufacturer, then you must use the measured 
HAP content to determine compliance.
    (b) [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 63.8806  How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the
emission limitations?

    (a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each emission limit 
that applies to you according to Table 4 to this subpart.
    (b) You must establish each site-specific operating limit in Table 2 
to this subpart that applies to you according to the requirements in 
Sec. 63.8800 and Table 3 to this subpart.
    (c) You must submit the Notification of Compliance Status containing 
the results of the initial compliance demonstration according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.8816(e) through (h).

this section.
    (1) Maintain a list of each adhesive and the manufacturer or 
supplier of each.
    (2) Maintain a record of EPA Method 311 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 
63), approved alternative method, or other reasonable means of HAP 
content determinations indicating the mass percent of each HAP for each 
adhesive.
    (b) If you own or operate a new or reconstructed flame lamination 
affected source, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) 
through (3) of this section if you use a scrubber, or paragraph (b)(4) 
of this section if you use any other control device.
    (1) Keep records of the daily average scrubber inlet liquid flow 
rate.
    (2) Keep records of the daily average scrubber effluent pH.
    (3) If you use a venturi scrubber, keep records of daily average 
pressure drop across the venturi.
    (4) Keep records of operating parameter values for each operating 
parameter that applies to you.
    (c) If you own or operate a new or reconstructed flame lamination 
affected source, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) 
through (4) of this section.
    (1) Except for periods of monitoring malfunctions, associated 
repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities 
(including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span 
adjustments), you must monitor continuously (or collect data at all 
required intervals) at all times that the affected source is operating. 
This includes periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction when the 
affected source is operating. A monitoring malfunction includes, but is 
not limited to, any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable 
failure of the monitoring device to provide valid data. Monitoring 
failures that are caused by poor maintenance or careless operation are 
not malfunctions.
    (2) In data average calculations and calculations used to report 
emission or operating levels, you may not use data recorded during 
monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, or recorded during required 
quality assurance or control activities. Nor may such data be used in 
fulfilling any applicable minimum data availability requirement. You 
must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing 
the operation of the control device and associated control system.
    (3) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CMS in 
accordance with your site-specific monitoring plan.
    (4) You must operate and maintain the CMS in continuous operation 
according to the site-specific monitoring plan.


<R05>
Sec. 63.8812  How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with 
the emission limitations?

    (a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission 
limit and operating limit in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart that applies 
to you according to the methods specified in Table 5 to this subpart.
    (b) You must report each instance in which you did not meet each 
emission limit and each operating limit in Tables 1 and 2 to this 
subpart that apply to you. For new or reconstructed flame lamination 
affected sources, this includes periods of startup, shutdown, and 
malfunction. These instances are deviations from the operating limits in 
this subpart. These deviations must be reported according to the 
requirements in Sec. 63.8818.
    (c) [Reserved]
    (d) Consistent with Sec. Sec. 63.6(e) and 63.7(e)(1), deviations 
that occur at a new or reconstructed flame lamination affected source 
during a period of startup, shutdown, or malfunction are not violations 
if you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that you were 
operating in accordance with Sec. 63.6(e)(1). The Administrator will 
determine whether deviations that occur at a new or reconstructed flame 
lamination affected source during a period of startup, shutdown, or 
malfunction are violations, according to the provisions in Sec. 
63.6(e).

[[Page 378]]

    (e) You also must meet the following requirements if you are 
complying with the adhesive use ban for loop slitter adhesive use 
described in Sec. 63.8790(a).
    (1) If, after you submit the Notification of Compliance Status, you 
use an adhesive for which you have not previously verified percent HAP 
mass using the methods in Sec. 63.8802, you must verify that each 
adhesive used in the affected source meets the emission limit, using any 
of the methods in Sec. 63.8802.
