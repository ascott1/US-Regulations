                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2001, consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

    (b) The information requested by the AIDAR sections listed in 
paragraph (a) is necessary to allow USAID to prudently administer pubic 
funds. It lets USAID make reasonable assessments of contractor 
capabilities and responsibility of costs. Information is required in 
order for a contractor and/or its employee to obtain a benefit-usually 
taking the form of payment under a government contract.
    (c) Public reporting burden for these collections of information is 
estimated as shown in paragraph (a) of this section. The estimated 
burden includes the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing 
data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing 
and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the 
burden estimates or any other aspects of these collections of 
information, including suggestions for

responsibilities include but are not limited to developing, issuing, and 
maintaining the USAID Acquisition Regulation (``AIDAR'', 48 CFR chapter 
7), USAID's supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR 
Chapter 1), in coordination with the General counsel and such other 
offices as may be appropriate.
    (b) Applicability. (1) Unless a deviation is specifically authorized 
in accordance with subpart 701.4, or unless otherwise provided, the FAR 
and AIDAR apply to all contracts (regardless of currency of payment, or 
whether funds are appropriated or non-appropriated) to which USAID is a 
direct party.
    (2) At Missions where joint administrative services are arranged, 
procuring offices may apply the Department of State Acquisition 
Regulation (48 CFR chapter 6) for all administrative and technical 
support contracts except in defined areas. The Office of Administrative 
Services will furnish the defined areas and administrative guidelines 
for procurement to the overseas Missions. Administrative and local 
support services include the procurement accountability, maintenance and 
disposal of all office and residential equipment and furnishings, 
vehicles and expendable supplies purchased with administrative and/or 
technical support funds, either dollars or local currency.


<R05>
Sec. 701.303  Publication and codification.

    (a) The AIDAR is USAID's Acquisition Regulation supplementing the 
FAR (48 CFR chapter 1) and is published as chapter 7 of Title 48, Code 
of Federal Regulations. AIDAR Circulars shall be used to promulgate 
changes to the AIDAR and shall be published in compliance with (48 CFR) 
FAR part 1.
    (b) Appendices. Significant procurement policies and procedures that 
do not correspond to or conveniently fit into the FAR system described 
in FAR 1.1 and 1.303 may be published as Appendices to the AIDAR. 
Appendices follow the main text of the AIDAR in a section entitled 
``Appendices to Chapter 7'' and contain a table of contents and the 
individual appendices identified by letter and subject title (e.g., 
``Appendix D--Direct USAID Contracts with a U.S. Citizen or a U.S. 
Resident Alien for Personal Services Abroad'').
    (c) Only the M/OP Director has the authority to issue internal 
agency guidance applicable to all agency contracts. The heads of the 
various USAID contracting activities (see subparts 701.6 and 702.10) may 
issue operating instructions and procedures consistent with the FAR, 
AIDAR, and other Agency regulations, policies, and procedures for 
application within their organizations. One copy of each such issuance 
shall be forwarded to the Office of Procurement, Policy Division (M/OP/
POL). Insofar as possible, such material will be numerically keyed to 
the AIDAR.

             Subpart 701.4_Deviations from the FAR or AIDAR


<R05>
Sec. 701.402  Policy.

    It is the policy of USAID that deviation from the mandatory 
requirements of the FAR and AIDAR shall be kept at a minimum and be 
granted only if it is essential to effect necessary procurement and when 
special and exceptional circumstances make such deviation clearly in the 
best interest of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 701.470  Procedure.

    (a) Deviation from the FAR or AIDAR affecting one contract or 
transaction.
    (1) Deviations which affect only one contract or procurement will be 
made only after prior approval by the head of the contracting activity. 
Deviation requests containing the information listed in paragraph (c) of 
this section shall be submitted sufficiently in advance of the effective 
date of such deviation to allow adequate time for consideration and 
evaluation by the head of the contracting activity.
    (2) Requests for such deviations may be initiated by the responsible 
USAID contracting officer who shall obtain clearance and approvals as 
may be required by the head of the contracting activity. Prior to 
submission of the deviation request to the head of the contracting 
activity for approval, the contracting officer shall obtain written 
comments from the Office of Procurement, Policy Division (M/OP/P), 
hereinafter referred to as ``M/OP/P''. The M/OP/P shall normally be 
allowed 10 working days prior to the submission of the deviation request 
to the head of the contracting activity to review the request and to 
submit comments. If the exigency of the situation requires more 
immediate action, the requesting office may arrange with the M/OP/P for 
a shorter review period. In addition to a copy of the deviation request, 
the M/OP/P shall be furnished any background or historical data which 
will contribute to a more complete understanding of the deviation. The 
comments of the M/OP/P shall be made a part of the deviation request 
file which is forwarded to the head of the contracting activity.
    (3) Coordination with the Office of General Counsel, as appropriate, 
should also be effected prior to approval of a deviation by the head of 
the contracting activity.
    (b) Class deviations from the FAR or AIDAR: Class deviations are 
those which affect more than one contract or contractor.
    (1) Class deviations from the AIDAR will be processed in the same 
manner as prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. Individual heads 
of contracting activities have authority to approve class deviations 
affecting only contracts within their own contracting activities, except 
that the Director, M/OP, has authority to approve class deviations that 
affect more than one contracting activity.
    (2) Class deviations from the FAR shall be considered jointly by 
USAID and the Chairperson of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (C/
CAAC) (FAR 1.404) unless, in the judgement of the head of the 
contracting activity, after due consideration of the objective of 
uniformity, circumstances preclude such consultation. The head of the 
contracting activity shall certify on the face of the deviation the 
reason for not coordinating with the C/CAAC. In such cases, the M/OP/P, 
shall be responsible for notifying the C/CAAC of the class deviation.
    (3) Class deviations from the FAR shall be processed as follows:
    (i) The request shall be processed in the same manner as paragraph 
(a) of this section, except that the M/OP/P, shall be allowed 15 working 
days prior to the submission of the deviation request to the head of the 
contracting activity to effect the necessary coordination with the C/
CAAC and to submit comments. If the exigency of the situation requires 
more immediate action, the requesting office may arrange with the M/OP/P 
for a shorter review and coordination period. The comments of the C/CAAC 
and the M/OP/P shall be made a part of the deviation request file which 
is forwarded to the head of the contracting activity.
    (ii) The request shall be processed in the same manner as paragraph 
(a) of this section if the request is not being jointly considered by 
USAID and the C/CAAC.

[[Page 8]]

    (4) Deviations involving basic agreements or other master type 
contracts are considered to involve more than one contract.
    (5) Unless the approval is sooner rescinded, class deviations shall 
expire 2 years from the date of approval provided that deviation 
authority shall continue to apply to contracts or task orders which are 
active at the time the class deviation expires. Authority to continue 
the use of such deviation beyond 2 years may be requested in accordance 
with the procedures prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.
    (6) Expiration dates shall be shown on all class deviations.
    (c) Requests for deviation shall contain a complete description of 
the deviation, the effective date of the deviation, the circumstances in 
which the deviation will be used, a specific reference to the regulation 
being deviated from, an indication as to whether any identical or 
similar deviations have been approved in the past, a complete 
justification of the deviation including any added or decreased cost to 
the Government, the name of the contractor, and the contract or task 
order number.
    (d) Register of deviations: Separate registers shall be maintained 
by the procuring activities of the deviations granted from the FAR and 
AIDAR. Each deviation shall be recorded in its appropriate register and 
shall be assigned a control number as follows: the symbol of the 
procuring activity, the abbreviation ``DEV'', the fiscal year, the 
serial number [issued in consecutive order during each fiscal year] 
assigned to the particular deviation and the suffix ``c'' if it is a 
class deviation, e.g. CM-DEV-85-1, CM-DEV-85-2c. The control number 
shall be embodied in the document authorizing the deviation and shall be 
cited in all references to the deviation.
    (e) Central record of deviations: Copies of approved deviations 
shall be furnished promptly to the M/OP/P, who shall be responsible for 
maintaining a central record of all deviations that are granted.
    (f) Semiannual report of class deviations:
    (1) USAID contracting officers shall submit a semiannual report to 
the M/OP/P of all contract actions effected under class deviations to 
the FAR and AIDAR which have been approved pursuant to paragraph (b) of 
this section.
    (2) The report shall contain the applicable deviation control 
number, the contractor's name, contract number and task order number (if 
appropriate).
    (3) The report shall cover the 6-month periods ending June 30 and 
December 31, respectively, and shall be submitted within 20 working days 
after the end of the reporting period.

Form 1420-50, USAID Consultant Registry Information System (ACRIS) 
Organization and Individual Profile) with USAID's Office of Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization (Department of State, U.S. Agency for 
International Development, Washington, DC 20523-1414--Attention: Office 
of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization). These forms should be 
updated annually.

<R05>
Sec. 706.302-5  Authorized or required by statute.

certain disadvantaged enterprises using other than full and open 
competition. The provisions implementing this authority are set forth in 
706.302-71 and part 726.

Sec. 706.302-70  Impairment of foreign aid programs.

    (a) Authority. (1) Citation: 40 U.S.C. 474.
    (2) Full and open competition need not be obtained when it would 
impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the 
purposes of foreign aid, relief, and rehabilitation.
    (b) Application. This authority may be used for:
    (1) An award under section 636(a)(3) of the Foreign Assistance Act 
of 1961, as amended, involving a personal services contractor serving 
abroad;
    (2) An award of $250,000 or less by an overseas contracting 
activity;
    (3)(i) An award for which the Assistant Administrator responsible 
for the project or program makes a formal written determination, with 
supporting findings, that compliance with full and open competition 
procedures would impair foreign assistance objectives, and would be 
inconsistent with the fulfillment of the foreign assistance program; or
    (ii) Awards for countries, regions, projects, or programs for which 
the Administrator of USAID makes a formal written determination, with 
supporting findings, that compliance with full and open competition 
procedures would impair foreign assistance objectives, and would be 
inconsistent with the fulfillment of the foreign assistance program.
    (4) Awards under AIDAR 715.370-1 (Title XII selection procedure--
general) or 715.370-2 (Title XII selection procedure--collaborative 
assistance).
    (5) An award for the continued provision of highly specialized 
services when award to another resource would result in substantial 
additional costs to the government or would result in unacceptable 
delays.
    (c) Limitations. (1) Offers shall be requested from as many 
potential offerors as is practicable under the circumstances. While the 
authority at 706.302-70(b)(5) is for use when the contracting officer 
determines that the incumbent contractor is the only practicable, 
potential offeror, the requirement to publicize the intended award, as 
required in FAR 5.201, still applies.
    (2) The contract file must include appropriate explanation and 
support justifying the award without full and open competition, as 
provided in FAR 6.303, except that determinations made under 706.302-
70(b)(3) will not be subject to the requirement for contracting officer 
certification or to approvals in accord with FAR 6.304.
    (3) The authority in 706.302-70(b)(3)(i) shall be used only when no 
other authority provided in FAR 6.302 or AIDAR 706.302 is suitable. The 
specific foreign assistance objective which would be impaired must be 
identified and explained in the written determination and finding. Prior 
consultation with the Agency Competition Advocate (see 706.501) is 
required before executing the written determination and finding, and 
this consultation must

[[Page 15]]

be reflected in the determination and finding.
    (4) Use of the authority in 706.302-70(b)(5) for proposed follow-on 
amendments in excess of one year or over $250,000 is subject to the 
approval of the Agency Competition Advocate. For all other follow-on 
amendments using this authority, the contracting officer's certification 
required in FAR 6.303-2(a)(12) will serve as approval.

not less than ten percent of the amounts made available through the 
appropriations cited in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for development 
assistance and for assistance for famine recovery and development in 
Africa shall be used only for activities of disadvantaged enterprises 
(as defined in 726.7002). In order to achieve its goal, USAID is 
authorized in the cited statutes to use other than full and open 
competition to award contracts to small business concerns owned and 
controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (small 
disadvantaged businesses as defined in 726.7002), historically black 
colleges and universities, colleges and universities having a student 
body of which more than 40 percent of the students are Hispanic 
Americans, and private voluntary organizations which are controlled by 
individuals who are socially and economically disadvantaged, as the 
terms are defined in 726.7002.
    (b) Application. This authority may be used only if the Agency 
determines in accordance with 726.7004 that:
    (1) The acquisition is to be funded from amounts referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section;
    (2) Award of the acquisition to an eligible organization is 
appropriate to meet the requirement in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; 
and
    (3) After considering whether the acquisition can be made under the 
authority of section 8(a), award under section 8(a) is not practicable.
    (c) Limitations. (1) Offers shall be requested from as many 
potential offerors as is practicable under the circumstances.
    (2) Use of this authority is not subject to the requirements in FAR 
6.303 and FAR 6.304, provided that the contract file includes a 
certification by the contracting officer stating that the procurement is 
being awarded pursuant to 706.302-71 and that the application 
requirements and limitations of 706.302-71 (b) and (c) have been 
complied with.

Sec. 711.002-70  Metric system waivers.

    (a) Criteria. The FAR 11.002(b) requirement to use the metric system 
of measurement for specifications and quantitative data that are 
incorporated in or required by USAID contracts may be waived when USAID 
determines in writing that such usage is impractical or is likely to 
cause U.S. firms to experience significant inefficiencies or the loss of 
markets.
    (b) Authorization. (1) The USAID Metric Executive (as designated in 
ADS

[[Page 17]]

chapter 323), the contracting officer, and the USAID official who 
approves the procurement requirement are authorized to waive the metric 
requirement for one of the above reasons. The USAID Metric Executive is 
authorized to overrule a decision to grant a waiver, or to nullify a 
blanket waiver made by another approving official so long as a 
contractor's rights under an executed contract are not infringed upon.
    (2) A blanket waiver for a class of multiple transactions may be 
issued for a term not to exceed three years.
    (3) When a waiver will be based upon the adverse impact on U.S. 
firms, clearance from the USAID Metric Executive and the Office of Small 
and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (SDB) will be obtained prior to 
authorization.
    (c) Records and reporting. (1) The basis for each waiver and any 
plans to adapt similar requirements to metric specifications in future 
procurements should be documented in the contract file.
    (2) Each procurement activity will maintain a log of the waivers 
from the metric requirements which are authorized for its procurements. 
The logs shall list the commodity/service being procured, total dollar 
value of the procured item(s), waiver date, authorizing official, basis 
for waiver, and USAID actions that can promote metrication and lessen 
the need for future waivers.
    (3) Within 30 days of the closing of each fiscal year, each USAID/W 
procurement activity and each Mission will submit a copy of the metric 
waiver log for the year to the USAID Metric Executive. (Mission logs are 
to be consolidated in a Mission report for the procurement activity and 
for the nonprocurement activities maintaining such logs under the USAID 
Metric Transition Plan.) Repetitive purchases of commercially produced 
and marketed items and classes of items may be consolidated in reporting 
procurements that do not exceed $10,000 cumulatively during the 
reporting period.

narrative justification of the evaluation results.
    (4) The contracting officer is responsible for reviewing the 
documentation justifying the evaluation results to determine that it is 
adequate and complete. The contracting officer shall return a 
justification determined to be inadequate to the chair for revision.
    (5) No member of the USAID evaluation committee shall hold 
discussions with any offeror before or during the USAID evaluation 
committee's proceedings, nor shall any information about the proposals 
be provided to anyone not on the committee without first obtaining the 
contracting officer's consent.

Sec. 715.370  Alternative source selection procedures.

    The following selection procedures may be used, when appropriate, 
for activities covered under Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended.

[64 FR 16649, Apr. 6, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 715.370-1  Title XII selection procedure--general.

    (a) General. The Deputy Administrator has determined, as provided in 
AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(3)(ii) that use of this Title XII source selection 
procedure is necessary so as not to impair or affect USAID's ability to 
administer Title XII of the Foreign Assistance

[[Page 20]]

Act. This determination is reflected in AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(4). This 
constitutes authority for other than full and open competition when 
selecting Title XII institutions to perform Title XII projects.
    (b) Scope of subsection. This subsection prescribes policies and 
procedures for the selection of institutions eligible under Title XII of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to perform activities 
authorized under Title XII.
    (c) Applicability. The provisions of this subsection are applicable 
when the project office certifies that the activity is authorized under 
Title XII, and determines that use of the Title XII selection procedure 
is appropriate.
    (d) Solicitation, evaluation, and selection procedures. (1) 
Competition shall be sought among eligible Title XII institutions to the 
maximum practicable extent; this requirement shall be deemed satisfied 
when a contractor is selected under the procedures of this subsection.
    (2) The project office shall--
    (i) Prepare selection criteria for evaluation of eligible 
institutions for use in preparing the source list, determining 
predominantly qualified sources, and selecting the contractor;
    (ii) Prepare an initial list of eligible institutions considered 
qualified to perform the proposed activity;
    (iii) Provide a statement describing qualifications and areas of 
expertise considered essential, a statement of work, estimate of 
personnel requirements, special requirements (logistic support, 
government furnished property, and so forth) for the contracting 
officer's use in preparing the request for technical proposal (RFTP).
    (iv) Send a memorandum incorporating the certification and 
determination required by paragraph (c) of this section, together with 
the information required by paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (iii) of this 
section, with the ``Action'' copy of the PIO/T to the contracting 
officer, requesting him/her to prepare and distribute the RFTP.
    (3) Upon receipt and acceptance of the project officer's request, 
the contracting officer shall prepare the RFTP. The RFTP shall contain 
sufficient information to enable an offeror to submit a responsive and 
complete technical proposal. This includes a definitive statement of 
work, an estimate of the personnel required, and special provisions 
(such as logistic support, government furnished equipment, and so 
forth), a proposed contract format, and evaluation criteria. No cost or 
pricing data will be requested or required by the RFTP. The RFTP will be 
distributed to the eligible institutions recommended by the project 
office. The RFTP will be synopsized, as required by FAR 5.201, and will 
normally allow a minimum of 60 days for preparation and submission of a 
proposal.
    (4) Upon receipt of responses to the RFTP by the contracting 
officer, an evaluation committee will be established as provided for in 
715.608 of this subpart.
    (5) The evaluation committee will evaluate all proposals in 
accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFTP, and will prepare a 
selection memorandum which shall:
    (i) State the evaluation criteria;
    (ii) List all of the eligible institutions whose proposals were 
reviewed;
    (iii) Report on the ranking and rationale therefor for all 
proposals;
    (iv) Indicate the eligible institution or institutions considered 
best qualified.
    (6) The evaluation committee will submit the selection memorandum to 
the contracting officer for review and approval.
    (7) The contracting officer will either approve the selection 
memorandum, or return it to the evaluation committee for reconsideration 
for specified reasons.
    (8) If the selection memorandum is approved, the contracting officer 
shall obtain cost, pricing, and other necessary data from the 
recommended institution or institutions and shall conduct negotiations. 
If a satisfactory contract cannot be obtained, the contracting officer 
will so advise the evaluation committee. The evaluation committee may 
then recommend an alternate institution or institutions.

<R05>
Sec. 715.370-2  Title XII selection procedure--collaborative assistance.

    (a) General. (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(4) provides authority for 
other than full and open competition when selecting Title XII 
institutions to perform Title XII activities.
    (b) Scope of subsection. This subsection prescribes policies and 
procedures for the selection of institutions eligible under Title XII of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to perform activities 
authorized under Title XII, where USAID has determined, in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this subsection, that use of the collaborative 
assistance contracting system is appropriate. See AIDR Appendix F (of 
this chapter)--Use of Collaborative Assistance Method for Title XII 
Activities for a more complete definition and discussion of the 
collaborative assistance method.
    (c) Determinations. The following findings and determinations must 
be made prior to initiating any contract actions under the collaborative 
assistance method:
    (1) The cognizant technical office makes a preliminary finding that 
an activity:
    (i) Is authorized by Title XII; and
    (ii) Should be classed as collaborative assistance because a 
continuing collaborative relationship between USAID, the host country, 
and the contractor is required from design through completion of the 
activity, and USAID, host country, and contractor participation in a 
continuing review and evaluation of the activity is essential for its 
proper execution.
    (2) Based upon this preliminary finding, the cognizant technical 
office shall establish an evaluation panel consisting of a 
representative of the cognizant technical office as chairman, a 
representative of the contracting officer, and any other representatives 
considered appropriate by the chairman to review the proposed activity 
for its appropriateness under the collaborative assistance method.
    (3) If supported by the panel's findings, the chairman will make a 
formal written determination that the collaborative assistance method is 
the appropriate contracting method for the Title XII activity in 
question.
    (d) Evaluation and selection. (1) Competition shall be sought among 
eligible Title XII institutions to the maximum practicable extent; this 
requirement shall be deemed satisfied when a contractor is selected 
under the procedures of this section.
    (2) The evaluation panel shall:
    (i) Prepare evaluation and selection criteria;
    (ii) Prepare an initial source list of eligible institutions 
considered qualified to perform the proposed project; and
    (iii) Evaluate the list, using the evaluation criteria previously 
determined, for the purpose of making a written determination of the 
sources considered most capable of performing the project.
    (3) The chairman of the evaluation panel will prepare a memorandum 
requesting the contracting officer to prepare a request for expressions 
of interest from qualified sources and setting forth:
    (i) The formal determinations required by paragraph (c) of this 
section;
    (ii) The evaluation criteria which have been determined; and
    (iii) The recommended source list and the rationale therefor.
    (4) The contracting officer will prepare a request for an expression 
of interest (REI), containing sufficient information to permit an 
offeror to determine its interest in the project, and to discuss the 
project with USAID representatives, if appropriate. The REI should 
include a concise statement of the purpose of the activity, any special 
conditions or qualifications considered important, a brief description 
of the selection procedure and evaluation criteria which will be used, 
the proposed contract format, and any other information considered 
appropriate. The REI will be issued to the sources recommended by the 
panel, and to others, as appropriate; it will be synopsized, as required 
by FAR 5.201, and it will normally allow a minimum of 60 days for 
preparation of an expression of interest. Guidelines for preparation of 
expressions of interest are contained in attachment 1 to AIDAR appendix 
F.
    (5) The contracting officer will transmit all expressions of 
interest to the evaluation panel for evaluation and selection 
recommendation. The panel

[[Page 22]]

may conduct on site evaluations at its discretion, as part of the 
evaluation process.
    (6) The chairman of the evaluation panel will prepare a written 
selection recommendation with supporting justification, recommending 
that negotiations be conducted with the prospective contractor(s) 
selected by the evaluation panel. The selection recommendation shall be 
transmitted to the contracting officer together with the complete 
official file on the project which was being maintained by the 
evaluation panel.
    (7) The contracting officer will review the selection 
recommendation, obtain necessary cost and other data, and proceed to 
negotiate with the recommended sources.

<R05>
Sec. 715.602  Policy.

    (a) USAID encourages the submission of unsolicited proposals which 
contribute new ideas consistent with and contributing to the 
accomplishment of the Agency's objectives. However, the requirements for 
contractor resources are normally quite program specific, and thus 
widely varied, and must be responsive to host country needs. Futher, 
USAID's projects are usually designed in collaboration with the 
cooperating country. These factors can limit both the need for, and 
USAID's ability to use unsolicited proposals. Therefore, prospective 
offerors are encouraged to contact USAID to determine the Agency's 
technical and geographical requirements as related to the offeror's 
interests before preparing and submitting a formal unsolicited proposal.
    (b) USAID's basic policies and procedures regarding unsolicited 
proposals are those established in FAR subpart 15.6 and this subpart.
    (c) For detailed information on unsolicited proposals, see 715.604; 
for initial contact point within USAID, see 715.604(c).

<R05>
Sec. 719.270  Small business policies.

    (a) In keeping with section 602 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961 (22 U.S.C. 2352), as amended, USAID shall, insofar as practicable 
and to the maximum extent consistent with the accomplishment of the 
purposes of said Act, assist United States small business to participate 
equitably in the furnishing of supplies and services for Foreign 
Assistance activities.
    (b) It is the policy of USAID to:
    (1) Fully endorse and carry out the Government's small business 
program for placing a fair proportion of its purchases and contracts for 
supplies, construction (including maintenance and repair), research and 
development, and services (including personal, professional, and 
technical services) with small business, including minority small 
business concerns; and
    (2) Increase their participation in USAID procurement.
    (c) In furtherance of this policy:
    (1) Cognizant technical officers shall make positive efforts (see 
719.271-5) to identify potentially qualified small and minority business 
firms during precontract development of activities and shall, with the 
responsible contracting officers, assure that such firms are given full 
opportunity to participate equitably;
    (2) Small business set-asides shall be made for all contracts to be 
executed in USAID/Washington which qualify for small business set-aside 
action under Part 19 of the FAR; and
    (3) Consideration shall be given in appropriate cases to the award 
of the contract to the Small Business Administration for subcontracting 
to small business firms pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business 
Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).
    (d) This program shall be implemented by all USAID/Washington 
contracting activities in order to attain these policy objectives. In 
accordance with 719.271, all USAID/Washington direct-procurement 
requirements which exceed the simplified acquisition threshold shall be 
screened for small business opportunities by the Office of Small and 
Disadvantaged Business Utilization (SDB) except those exempted by 
719.271-6(a).
    (e) Where practicable and desirable, small business and minority 
business enterprise award goals will be established for the respective 
USAID/Washington procuring activities to provide incentive for 
contracting personnel to increase awards to small firms. The goals will 
be set by SDB after consultation with the respective head of the 
contracting activity (see subsection 702.170-10).
    (f) In the event of a disagreement between SDB and the contracting 
officer concerning: (1) A recommended set-aside, or (2) a request for 
modification or withdrawal of a class or individual set-aside, complete 
documentation of the case including the reasons for disagreement shall 
be transmitted within five working days to the head of the contracting 
activity (see 719.271-6(e)) for a decision. Procurement action shall be 
suspended pending a decision.

[[Page 25]]

    (g) The above suspension shall not apply where the contracting 
officer:
    (1) Certifies in writing, with supporting information, that in order 
to protect the public interest award must be made without delay;
    (2) Promptly provides a copy of said certification to SDB; and
    (3) Includes a copy of the certification in the contract file.
    (h) SDB shall be the Small Business Advisor and Minority Business 
Procurement Policy Manager for all USAID/Washington procuring 
activities.
    (i) The details on the Agency's direction and operation of the small 
business program are set forth in 719.271.
    (j) No decision rendered, or action taken, under the coverage set 
forth in 719.271 shall preclude the Small Business Administration from 
appealing directly to the USAID Administrator as provided for in part 19 
of the FAR.

    The purpose of this section is to prescribe responsibilities and 
procedures for carrying out the small business program policy set forth 
in 219.270, and in part 19 of the FAR. Small Business concerns are 
defined in FAR subpart 19.1; in addition, small business concerns are 
concerns organized for profit. Nonprofit organizations are not 
considered small business concerns. Small disadvantaged business 
enterprises are defined in FAR subpart 19.1. Small disadvantaged 
business enterprises are included in the term ``small business'' when 
used in this subpart; specific reference to disadvantaged business 
enterprises is for added emphasis.


<R05>
Sec. 719.271-2  The USAID Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business 
          Utilization (SDB).

    (a) SDB is responsible for administering, implementing, and 
coordinating the Agency's small business (including minority business 
enterprises) program.
    (b) SDB, headed by the Director SDB, who also serves as the Minority 
Business Procurement Manager, shall be specifically responsible for:
    (1) Developing policies, plans, and procedures for a coordinated 
Agency-wide small business and minority business enterprise procurement 
program;
    (2) Advising and consulting regularly with USAID/Washington 
procuring activities on all phases of their small business program, 
including, where practicable and desirable, the establishment of small 
business and minority business enterprise award goals;
    (3) Collaborating with officials of the Small Business 
Administration (SBA), other Government Agencies, and private 
organizations on matters affecting the Agency's small business program;
    (4) Developing and maintaining an USAID Consultant Registry 
Information System (ACRIS) of bidders/offerors (annotated to identify 
small business and minority business enterprise firms) capable of 
furnishing services for use by the USAID contracting activities;
    (5) Cooperating with contracting officers in administering the 
performance of contractors subject to the Small Business and Minority 
Business Enterprises Subcontracting Program clauses;
    (6) Developing a plan of operation designed to increase the share of 
contracts awarded to small business concerns, including small minority 
business enterprises;
    (7) Establishing small business class set-aside for types and 
classes of items of services where appropriate;
    (8) Reviewing each procurement requisition to make certain 
individual or class set-asides are initiated on all suitable USAID/
Washington proposed contract actions in excess of the simplified 
acquisition threshold which are subject to screening (see 719.271-6);
    (9) Maintaining a program designed to:
    (i) Locate capable small business sources for current and future 
procurements through GSA and other methods;
    (ii) Utilize every source available to determine if an item is 
obtainable from small business; and

[[Page 26]]

    (iii) Develop adequate small business competition on all appropriate 
procurements;
    (10) Taking action to assure that unnecessary qualifications, 
restrictive specifications, or other features (such as inadequate 
procurement lead time) of the programming or procurement process, which 
may prevent small business participation in the competitive process, are 
modified to permit such participation where an adequate product or 
service can be obtained;
    (11) Recommending that portions of large planned procurements or 
suitable components of end items or services be purchased separately so 
small firms may compete;
    (12) On proposed non-competitive procurements, recommending to the 
contracting officer that the procurement be made competitive when, in 
the opinion of SDB, there are small business or minority business 
enterprises believed competent to furnish the required goods or 
services, and supplying the contracting officer a list of such firms;
    (13) Assisting small business concerns with individual problems;
    (14) Promoting increased awareness by the technical staff of the 
availability of small business firms;
    (15) Making available to GSA copies of solicitations when so 
requested;

Sec. 719.271-3  USAID contracting officers.

    With respect to procurement activities within their jurisidiction, 
contracting officers are responsible for:
    (a) Being thoroughly familiar with part 19 of the FAR and this 
section dealing with the small business program;
    (b) Screening abstracts of bids and other award data to determine 
set-aside potential for future procurements;
    (c) Assuring that small business concerns and minority business 
enterprises are appropriately identified on source lists and abstracts 
of bids or proposals by an ``S'' and ``M'', respectively, or other 
appropriate symbol;
    (d) Reviewing types and classes of items and services to determine 
where small business set-asides can be applied;
    (e) Recommending that portions of large planned procurements of 
suitable components of end items or services be purchased separately so 
small firms may compete;
    (f) Making a unilateral determination for total or partial small 
business set-asides in accordance with Subpart 19.5 of the Federal 
Acquisition Regulations;
    (g) Submitting proposed procurement actions for USAID/Washington 
contracts to SDB for screening (see 719.271-6);
    (h) Taking action to assure that unnecessary qualifications, 
restrictive specifications or other features (such as inadequate 
procurement lead time) of the programming or procurement process which 
may prevent small business participation in the competitive process are 
modified to permit such participation where an adequate product or 
service can be obtained;
    (i) Prior to rendering a final decision on a proposed non-
competitive procurement action, and as part of his/her findings and 
determinations, the contracting officer shall consider the 
recommendations, if any, of SDB together with the latter's list of 
additional sources;
    (j) As appropriate, referring small business concerns, including 
small minority business enterprises, to SDB for information and advice;
    (k) Promoting increased awareness by the technical staff of the 
availability of small business concerns;
    (l) Making available to SDB copies of solicitations when requested;
    (m) Assisting SDB in counseling non-responsive or non-responsible 
small business bidders/offerors to help them to participate more 
effectively in future solicitations; and

<R05>
Sec. 719.271-4  Heads of contracting activities.

    In order for the agency small business program to be effective, the 
active support of top management is required. The heads of the 
contracting activities shall be responsible for:
    (a) Rendering decisions in cases resulting from non-acceptances by 
their contracting officers of set-aside recommendations made by SDB;
    (b) Consulting with SDB in establishing small business and minority 
business enterprise award goals, where practicable and desirable; and

<R05>
Sec. 719.271-5  Cognizant technical officers.

    Since the procurement process starts with the establishment of a 
requirement, the actions of the cognizant technical officers can affect 
the opportunity of small business to participate equitably; therefore, 
each cognizant technical officer shall, during the formulation of 
activities which will require contractual implementation:
    (a) Consult with SDB on the availability and capabilities of small 
business firms to permit making a tentative set-aside determination 
where appropriate; and
    (b) Provide sufficient procurement lead time in the activity 
implementation schedule to allow potential small business participation.

<R05>
Sec. 719.271-6  Small business screening procedure.

    (a) General. All USAID/Washington proposed contract actions in

forward the original and 2 copies to SDB within one working day of 
receipt by the contracting activity of a procurement requisition.
    (2) The contracting officer will attach to his/her transmittal a 
complete copy of the procurement request and a copy of the recommended

with his/her written reasons for rejection to SDB within two working 
days.
    (3) Upon receipt of the contracting officer's rejection, SDB may: 
(i) accept, or (ii) appeal, the rejection. In the case of acceptance of 
the contracting officer's rejection, SDB shall annotate Block 14 when it

Sec. 719.271-7  Reports on procurement actions that are exempted from 
          screening.

    (a) Unilateral and class set-asides. The contracting officer shall 
prepare Form USAID 1410-14 as stated in 719.271-6, but forward only the 
duplicate copy with the documentation required by Block 5 of the form to 
SDB. The original will be filed in the contract file.
    (1) If, upon review of the material submitted under 719.271-7(a) 
above, SDB concludes that it would be practicable to accomplish all or a 
portion of the procurement involved under section 8(a) subcontracting, 
it shall so advise the contracting officer in writing within five days 
after receipt of such material.
    (2) Such advice shall be considered a counter-recommendation and 
shall be processed in accordance with 719.271-6 (d) and (e).
    (b) Public exigency exemption. The contracting officer shall prepare 
Form USAID 1410-14 as stated in 719.271-6, but forward only the

SDB. In addition to the documentation called for in 719.271-6, the 
contracting officer shall furnish a copy of his/her written 
determination exempting the procurement from screening. The 
determination shall cite the pertinent facts which led to his/her 
decision. This exemption is not intended to be used as substitute for 
good procurement planning and lead-time; SDB will report abuses of this 
exemption to the head of the contracting activity for appropriate action 
in accordance with 719.271-4(c).
    (c) Institution building contract (IBC) exemption. The contracting

Sec. 722.103  Overtime.


<R05>
Sec. 722.103-1  Definitions.

    Compensatory time off means leave equal to overtime worked, which, 
unless otherwise authorized in a contract or approved by a contracting 
officer, must be taken not later than the end of the calendar month 
following that in which the overtime is worked.


<R05>
Sec. 722.103-2  Policy.

    (a) Most contracts covered by this regulation call for the 
performance of professional or technical services overseas on a cost-
reimbursement basis. The compensation for employees performing such 
services is normally fixed on a monthly or annual basis, and the 
contracts usually state minimum work week hours. It is not expected that 
these employees will receive additional pay, overtime or shift premiums, 
or compensatory time off.
    (b) When the contracting officer determines it is in the best 
interests of the Government, specific provision may be made in contracts 
to permit such benefits for non-technical and non-professional employees 
serving overseas, subject to approvals to be required in the contract.

<R05>
Sec. 722.170  Employment of third country nationals (TCN's) and 
          cooperating country nationals (CCN's).

    (a) General. It is USAID policy that cooperating country nationals 
(CCN's) and third country nationals (TCN's), who are hired abroad for 
work in a cooperating country under USAID-direct contracts, generally be 
extended the same benefits, and be subject to the same restrictions as 
TCN's and CCN's employed as direct hires by the USAID Mission. 
Exceptions to this policy may be granted either by the Mission Director 
or the Assistant Administrator having program responsibility for the 
project. (TCN's and CCN's who are hired to work in the United States 
shall be extended benefits and subject to restrictions on the same basis 
as U.S. citizens who work in the United States.)
    (b) Compensation. Compensation, including merit or promotion 
increases paid to TCN's and CCN's may not, without the approval of the 
Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program 
responsibility for the project, exceed the prevailing compensation paid 
to personnel performing comparable work in the cooperating country as 
determined by the USAID Mission. Unless otherwise authorized by the 
Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program 
responsibility for the project, the compensation of such TCN and CCN 
employees shall be paid in the currency of the cooperating country.
    (c) Allowances and differentials. TCN's and CCN's, hired abroad for 
work in a cooperating country, are not eligible for allowances or 
differentials under USAID-direct contracts, unless authorized by the 
Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having program 
responsibility for the project.

[[Page 30]]

    (d) Country and security clearances. The contractor shall insure 
that the necessary clearances, including security clearances, if 
required, have been obtained for TCN and CCN employees in accordance 
with any such requirements set forth in the contract or required by the 
USAID Mission, prior to the TCN or CCN starting work under the contract.
    (e) Physical fitness. Contractors are required to insure that 
prospective TCN and CCN employees are examined prior to employment to 
determine whether the prospective employee meets the minimum physical 
requirements of the position and is free from any contagious disease.
    (f) Workweek, holidays, and leave. The workweek, holidays, and leave 
for TCN and CCN employees shall be the same as for all other employees 
of the contractor, under the terms of the contract; however, TCN and CCN 
employees are not eligible for home leave or military leave unless 
authorized by the Mission Director or the Assistant Administrator having 
program responsibility for the project.
    (g) Travel and transportation for TCN's and CCN's. Travel and 
transportation shall be provided TCN and CCN employees on the same basis 
as for all other employees of the contractor, under the terms of the 
contract.
    (h) Household effects and motor vehicles. USAID will not provide 
household effects to TCN and CCN employees; such employees may ship 
their household effects and motor vehicles to their place of employment 
on the same basis as for all other employees of the contractor, under 
the terms of the contract unless they are residents of the cooperating 
country.

               Subpart 722.8_Equal Employment Opportunity


<R05>
Sec. 722.805-70  Procedures.

    (a) The procedures in this section apply, as appropriate, for all 
contracts excluding construction, which shall be handled in accordance 
with (48 CFR) FAR 22.804-2. Contracting officers are responsible for 
ensuring that the requirements of (48 CFR) FAR 22.8 and related clauses 
are met before awarding any contracts or consenting to subcontracts 
subject to these requirements.
    (b) Representations and Certifications. The first step in ensuring 
compliance with these requirements is to obtain all necessary 
representations and certifications (Reps and Certs) required by FAR 
22.810. The contracting officer must review the Reps and Certs to 
determine whether they have been completed and signed as required, and 
are acceptable.
    (1) If any of these Reps and Certs are incomplete or unsigned, the 
contracting officer must request that the offeror(s) complete and sign 
them, as necessary, unless the initial evaluation of the offeror's 
proposal results in the contracting officer's concluding that the 
offeror would not, in any event, be within a competitive range 
determined in accordance with (48 CFR) FAR 15.306(c), or would not be 
selected if award is to be made without discussions. A request as 
described in this paragraph (b)(1) constitutes either a clarification 
per (48 CFR) FAR 15.306(a) (``resolving minor or clerical errors'', 
paragraph (a)(2)), or a communication before establishment of 
competitive range per (48 CFR) FAR 15.306(b), not a discussion per (48 
CFR) FAR 15.306(d).
    (2) If completed and signed Reps and Certs raise questions 
concerning the offeror's compliance with EEO requirements, or if the 
contracting officer has information from any other source which calls 
into question the offeror's eligibility for award based on this section 
and (48 CFR) FAR 22.8, the contracting officer must refer the matter to 
the cognizant regional Department of Labor Office of Federal Contract 
Compliance Programs (OFCCP) regardless of the estimated value of the 
contract; only OFCCP may make a determination of non-compliance with EEO 
requirements.
    (c) OFCCP's National Preaward Registry. If the Reps and Certs are 
complete, signed, and deemed acceptable, and the contracting officer has 
no reason to doubt their accuracy, the contracting officer must then 
consult the OFCCP's National Preaward Registry at the internet website 
in 48 CFR 22.805(a)(4) (i) to see if the offeror is listed.

[[Page 31]]

    (1) If the conditions stated in FAR 22.805(a) (4) are met (including 
the contract file documentation requirement in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)), 
then the Contracting Officer does not need to take any further action in 
verifying the offeror's compliance with the requirements of this subpart 
and (48 CFR) FAR 22.8.
    (2) If the offeror does not appear in the National Preaward 
Registry, and the estimated amount of the contract or subcontract is 
expected to be under $10 million then the contracting officer may rely 
on the Reps and Certs as sufficient verification of the offeror's 
compliance.
    (3) If the offeror does not appear in the National Preaward Registry 
and the estimated amount of the contract or subcontract is $10 million 
or more, then the contracting officer must request a preaward clearance 
from the appropriate OFCCP regional office, in accordance with 48 CFR 
22.805(a). If the initial contact with OFCCP is by telephone, the 
contracting officer and OFCCP are to mutually determine what information 
is to be included in the written verification request. The contracting 
officer may need to provide the following information in addition to the 
items listed in FAR 22.805(a)(5), if so requested by the OFCCP regional 
office:
    (i) Name, title, address, and telephone number of a contract person 
for the prospective contractor;
    (ii) A description of the type of organization (university, 
nonprofit, etc.) and its ownership (private, foreign, state, etc.).
    (iii) Names and addresses of the organizations in a joint venture 
(if any).
    (iv) Type of procurement (new contract--RFP or IFB, amendment, etc.) 
and the period of the contract.
    (v) Copy of approved Reps and Certs.
    (d) In the event that OFCCP reports that the offeror is not in 
compliance, negotiations with the offeror shall be terminated.
    (e) Documentation for the contract file. Every contract file must 
contain completed and signed Reps and Certs. The file must clearly show 
that these documents have been reviewed and accepted by the contracting 
officer. If the Reps and Certs were revised to make them acceptable (see 
paragraph (b) of this section), the file must also document what changes 
were required and why, and verify that the changes were made. The 
contracting officer shall also document the OFCCP National Preaward 
Registry review (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section), and, if the 
Registry does not include the offeror:
    (1) For contracts or modifications over $10,000 but less than $10 
million, the file must contain a statement from the contracting officer 
that the contractor is considered in compliance with EEO requirements, 
and giving the basis for this statement (see paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section). This statement may be in a separate memorandum to the file or 
in the memorandum of negotiation.
    (2) For contracts or modifications of $10 million or more, the file 
must document all communications with OFCCP regarding the offeror's 
compliance. Such documentation includes copies of any written 
correspondence and a record of telephone conversations, specifying the 
name, address, and telephone number of the person contacted, a summary 
of the information presented, and any advice given by OFCCP.
    (f) Documentation in the event of non-compliance. In the event OFCCP 
determines that a prospective contractor is not in compliance, a copy of 
OFCCP's written determination, and a summary of resultant action taken 
(termination of negotiations, notification of offeror and cognizant 
technical officer, negotiation with next offeror in competitive range, 
resolicitation, etc.) will be placed in the contract file for any 
contract which may result, together with other records related to 
unsuccessful offers, and retained for at least six months following 
award.

<R05>
Sec. 725.170  Exceptions for Foreign Assistance Act functions.

    In addition to the exception stated in FAR 25.102 for purchases for 
use outside the United States, there is an exception for economic 
assistance functions performed under authority of the Foreign Assistance 
Act. This exception is stated in Executive Order 11223, dated May 12, 
1965 (30 FR 6635). U.S. procurement restrictions are applied by USAID, 
however, as shown elsewhere in this part. These restrictions are 
generally tighter than the Buy American Act. As a general rule, the 
tighter USAID restrictions will be used. In the case of certain 
procurements for use within the United States, the Buy American 
provision may be used instead in the interest of uniformity among 
Federal Agencies procuring for domestic use.

                     Subpart 725.4_Trade Agreements


<R05>
Sec. 725.403  Exceptions.

    FAR 25.4 establishes procedures for purchases under the Trade 
Agreements Act of 1979 (including GATT's Agreement on Government 
Procurement) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Under 
both such agreements, USAID's contracts for the purpose of providing 
foreign assistance are not subject to the procedures set forth in FAR 
25.4. In contrast, USAID's operating expense-type administrative 
purchases (i.e., purchases for the direct benefit and use of USAID) are 
subject to the procedures in FAR 25.4, unless otherwise exempted by one 
of the exemptions specified in FAR 25.4.

             Subpart 725.70_Source, Origin, and Nationality


<R05>
Sec. 725.701  General.

    USAID's source, origin and nationality requirements for program-
funded contracts and subcontracts are established in 22 CFR part 228, 
Rules on Source, Origin and nationality for Commodities and Services 
Financed by USAID. These policies as they apply to subcontracts and 
purchases under USAID program-funded contracts have been incorporated 
into the contract clauses referenced in 725.704 and 725.705 of this 
subpart.

Sec. 725.702  Designation of authorized geographic code.

Sec. 726.7005  Exceptions.

    The notification requirement in 705.207 and the subcontracting 
requirement in 726.7007 are based on statutory requirement and may not 
be deviated from under the provisions of subpart 701.4. By statute, the

awarded under the provisions of 706.302-71.
    (b) The contracting officer shall accept an offeror's 
representations and certifications under the provisions referenced above

Sec. 726.7007  Requirement for subcontracting with disadvantaged 
          enterprises.

    (a) In addition to the requirements in FAR subpart 19.7, any new 
contract or modification which constitutes new procurement (except for a 
contract or modification with a disadvantaged enterprise as defined in 
726.7002) with respect to which more than $500,000 is to be funded with 
amounts made available for development assistance or from the 
appropriations cited in section 706.302-71(a)(1) shall contain a 
provision requiring that not less than ten percent of the dollar value 
of the contract must be subcontracted to disadvantaged enterprises, 
including disadvantaged enterprises which are not small.
    (b) This requirement does not apply when the contracting officer, 
with the concurrence of the Director of OSDBU, certifies there is no 
realistic expectation of U.S. subcontracting opportunities and so 
documents the file. If the contracting officer and the Director of OSDBU 
do not agree, the determination will be made by the head of the 
contracting activity. See 726.7005 for guidance on other potential 
exceptions.
    (c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause in 752.226-2 in 
any solicitation or contract as provided in paragraph (a) of this

<R05>
Sec. 728.105-1  Advance payment bonds.

    (a) Generally, advance payment bonds will not be required in 
connection with USAID contracts containing an advance payment provision. 
In lieu thereof, contracting officers will follow procedures set forth 
in FAR 32.409-3.
    (b) Whenever a contracting officer considers that an advance payment 
bond is necessary, the contracting officer will: (1) Establish a bond 
penalty that will adequately protect interests of the Government, (2) 
use the USAID Advance Payment Bond format, (3) place bond with a surety 
currently approved by the U.S. Treasury Department according to the 
latest Treasury Department Circular 570, (4) stipulate that the cost of 
the bond shall not exceed a rate of $7.50 per $1,000 per annum based on 
the penalty of the bond, without the prior written approval of the 
Office of Procurement, Policy Division (M/OP/P).
    (c) Where the surety's obligation under an advance payment bond 
covers all advances made to the contractor during the term of the 
contract, no release should be issued to the surety until all advances 
made and to be made under the contract have been fully liquidated in 
accordance with the provisions of the contract, such as no-pay vouchers, 
reports of expenditures, or by refund. Where the surety's obligation 
under the bond is limited to advances made during a specified period of 
time, no release should be issued to the surety until all advances made 
and to be made during the specified period have been liquidated as 
aforesaid.

                         Subpart 728.3_Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 728.305-70  Overseas worker's compensation and war-hazard 
          insurance--waivers and USAID insurance coverage.

    (a) Upon the recommendation of the USAID Administrator, the 
Secretary of Labor may waive the applicability of the Defense Base Act 
(DBA) with respect to any contract, subcontract, or subordinate 
contract, work location, or classification of employees. Either the 
contractor or USAID can request a waiver from coverage. Such a waiver 
can apply to any employees who are not U.S. citizens, not residents of, 
or not hired in the United States. Waivers requested by the contractor 
are submitted to the contracting officer for approval and further 
submission to the Department of Labor, which grants the waiver. 
Application for a waiver is submitted on Labor Department Form BEC 565. 
USAID has a number of blanket waivers already in effect for certain 
countries that are applicable to its direct contracts with contractors 
performing in such countries. Where such waivers are granted from 
coverage under the DBA, the waiver is conditioned on providing other 
worker's compensation coverage to employees to which the waiver applies. 
Usually this takes the form of securing worker's compensation coverage 
of the country where work will be performed

[[Page 38]]

or of the country of the employee's nationality, whichever offers 
greater benefits. The Department of Labor has granted partial blanket 
waivers of DBA coverage applicable to USAID-financed contracts performed 
in certain countries, subject to two conditions:
    (1) Employees hired in the United States by the contractor, and 
citizens or residents of the United States are to be provided DBA 
insurance coverage;
    (2) Waived employees (i.e., employees who are neither U.S. citizens 
nor U.S. resident aliens, and who were hired outside the United States) 
will be provided worker's compensation benefits as required by the laws 
of the country in which they are working or the laws of their native 
country, whichever offers greater benefits. Information as to whether a 
DBA Waiver has been obtained by USAID for a particular country may be 
obtained from the cognizant USAID contracting officer.
    (b) To assist contractors in securing insurance at minimal rates for 
the workmen's compensation insurance required under the DBA, and to 
facilitate meeting insurance requirements for such coverage, USAID, 
after open and competitive negotiation, has entered into a contract with 
an insurance carrier to provide such coverage at a specified rate. The 
terms of this contract require the insurance carrier to provide 
coverage, and the contractor to make payments to and handle its claims 
with that insurance carrier. Contracting officers are responsible for 
explaining and advising contractors of the details of securing such 
insurance.

    (c) Automobile liability. In order to ensure that private

USAID contract are properly insured, USAID has established minimum 
required coverages as a supplement to the FAR clause at 52.228-7. This 
supplemental coverage is specified in AIDAR 752.228-7, and is to be used 
in all USAID-direct contracts involving performance overseas.

contracted with an insurance carrier to provide the required insurance 
for all USAID contractors. It is therefore necessary to supplement the 
FAR clause at 52.228-3 with the additional coverage specified in AIDAR 
752.228-3. The coverage specified in AIDAR 752.228-3 shall be used in 
addition to the coverage specified in FAR 52.228-3 in all USAID-direct 
contracts involving performance overseas.

    (a) USAID is required by law to include language in all its direct 
contracts and subcontracts ensuring that all U.S. marine insurance 
companies have a fair opportunity to bid for marine insurance when such 
insurance is necessary or appropriate under the contract. USAID has 
therefore established a supplementary preface to the clause at FAR 
52.228-9. This supplementary preface is set forth in AIDAR 752.228-9, 
and is required for use in any USAID-direct contract where marine 
insurance is necessary or appropriate.

the contractor will take local and USAID Mission practice into account 
and will insure that the workweek is compatible with that of those USAID 
Mission and Cooperating Country employees with whom the contractor will 
be working.
    (b) Reasonableness. ADS Chapter 302.5.3 states USAID policy

Sec. 731.205-70  Overseas recruitment incentive.

    (Note: the term employee as used in this section means an employee 
who is a U.S. citizen or a U.S. resident alien.)

    (a) If a contractor employee serving overseas under a contract does 
not qualify for the exemption for overseas income provided under section 
911 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 911), such employee is 
eligible to receive an overseas recruitment incentive (ORI), to the 
extent the ORI: Is authorized by the contractor's normal policy and 
practice; is deemed necessary by the contractor to recruit and retain 
qualified employees for overseas services; and does not exceed 10% of

[[Page 40]]

the base salary of the employee from date of arrival at overseas post to 
begin assignment to date of departure from post at the end of 
assignment. ORI is to be paid as a single payment at the end of the 
employee tour of duty overseas. The contractor shall take all reasonable 
and prudent steps to ensure that ORI is not paid to any employee who has 
received the IRS section 911 exemption.
    (b) In the event that an employee subsequently receives a section 
911 exclusion for any part of the base salary upon which this supplement 
has been paid, such supplement or appropriate portion thereof shall be 
reimbursed by the contractor to USAID with interest. The interest shall 
be calculated at the average U.S. Treasury rate in effect for the period 
that the contractor or his employee had the funds. Neither the 
contractor's nor the subcontractor's inability to collect refunds from 
eligible employees shall be used as a basis to excuse subsequent refunds 
by the contractor to USAID.

Sec. 731.205-71  Salary supplements for Host Government employees.

    (a) Definitions. (1) A Host Government (HG) employee is a person 
paid by the HG, occupying an established position, either temporary or 
permanent, part-time or full-time, within a HG institution.
    (2) An HG institution is an organization in which the government 
owns at least a fifty percent share or receives at least fifty percent 
of its financial support from the government.
    (b) General. Salary supplement occurs when payments are made that 
augment an HG employee's base salary or premiums, overtime, extra 
payments, incentive payment and allowances for which the HG employee 
would qualify under HG rules or practices for the performance of his/
hers regular duties or work performed during his/hers regular office 
hours. Per diem, invitational travel, honoraria and payment for work 
carried out outside of normal working hours are not considered to be 
salary supplements subject to the provisions in USAID policy referenced 
in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Salary supplements are eligible for USAID financing only when 
authorized in accordance with USAID policy established in the cable 
State 119780 dated April 15, 1988 (on ADS-CD under USAID Handbooks, 
Handbook 1). If salary supplements have been authorized in a particular 
case, the Contracting Officer shall provide written approval to the 
contractor in order for such costs to be eligible. Any specific 
requirements or limitations shall be specified in the approval.
    (d) Contracting Officers shall insert the Clause at 752.231-71 in 
all contracts in which there is a possibility of the need of HG 
employees. It should also be inserted in all subsequent subcontracts.

the contractor will take local and USAID Mission practice into account 
and will ensure that the workweek is compatible with that of those USAID 
Mission and Cooperating Country employees with whom the contractor will 
be working.
    (b) Salaries and wages. (1) ADS Chapter 302.5.3 states USAID policy 
regarding personnel compensation exceeding the maximum annual rate for 
an Executive Service level ES-6. Consistent with this policy, any 
employee's or consultant's base salary plus overseas recruitment 
incentive, if any (see 731.205-70), subject to this policy will be 
allowable under USAID-direct contracts only if approved in accordance 
with the essential procedures in ADS chapter E302.5.3.

[[Page 41]]

    (2) In considering consulting income as a factor when determining 
allowable salary for service under a contract:
    (i) For faculty members working under annual appointments, salary 
for service under the contract may include the employee's on-campus 
salary plus ``consulting income'' (that is, income from employment other 
than the employee's regular on-campus appointment, excluding business or 
other activities not connected with the employee's profession) earned 
during the year preceding employment under the contract.
    (ii) For faculty members working under academic year appointments, 
salary for service under the contract may include the employee's on-
campus academic year salary plus ``consulting income'' as defined above 
earned during the year proceeding employment under the contract, or 
salary for service under the contract may be derived by annualizing the 
academic year salary (in which case ``consulting income'' may not be 
included).
    (3) USAID policies and compensation of third country national or 
cooperating country national employees are set forth in AIDAR 722.170.

<R05>
Sec. 731.770  OMB Circular A-122, cost principles for nonprofit 
          organizations; USAID implementation.

    (a) Paragraph 6 of the transmittal letter for OMB Circular A-122 
specifies that ``Agencies shall designate a liaison official to serve as 
the agency representative on matters relating to the implementation of 
this Circular.'' The Director, Office of Procurement, has been so 
designated. The Overhead and Special Cost and Contract Close-Out Branch, 
Office of Procurement (OCC) provides staff assistance to the Director 
concerning OMB Circular A-122. OCC is also responsible for obtaining 
cognizance under the criteria in the transmittal letter for OMB Circular 
A-122; for liaison with other cognizant agencies; for authorizing 
exclusion of OMB Circular A-122 coverage for a particular nonprofit 
organization pursuant to paragraph 5 of the OMB Circular A-122 
transmittal letter; and for advice and assistance in applying OMB 
Circular A-122 cost principles.
    (b) Paragraph 4b of the OMB Circular A-122 transmittal letter 
contains a definition of prior approval as follows:

    Prior approval means securing the awarding agency's permission in 
advance to incur costs for those items that are designated as requiring 
prior approval by OMB Circular A-122. Generally, this permission will be 
in writing. Where an item of cost requiring prior approval is specified 
in the budget of an award, approval of the budget constitute approval of 
that cost.


Consequently, an award containing a budget constitutes prior approval of 
the direct cost item in the budget, unless otherwise annotated. 
Accordingly, award budgets should be appropriately annotated 
substantially as follows:

    Inclusion of any cost in the line item budget of this award does not 
obviate the requirement for prior approval of cost items designated as 
requiring prior approval by OMB Circular A-122 ; or
    In accordance with the requirements to OMB Circular No. A-122, 
approval is granted to incur costs for (name specific item or

[[Page 42]]

items) which are included in the budget of this award.

<R05>
Sec. 731.771  Bid and proposal costs.

    Pending the establishment of Government-wide principles in 
Attachment B of OMB Circular A-122, USAID will treat bid and proposal 
costs as follows:
    (a) Bid and proposal costs are the costs of preparing bids, 
proposals, and applications for potential activities such as Government 
and non-Government grants, contracts and other agreements, including the 
development of scientific, cost, and other data needed to support such 
bids, proposals, and applications. Except as provided in (b) below, bid 
and proposal costs of the current accounting period of both successful 
and unsuccessful bids and proposals normally should be treated as 
indirect costs for allocation to all current activities, and no bid and 
proposal costs of past accounting periods will be allocable to the 
current period. However, if the organization's established practice is 
to treat bid and proposal costs by some other method, the results 
obtained may be accepted only if found to be reasonable and equitable.
    (b) Bid and proposal costs incurred by the organization to obtain 
unrestricted funds are to be treated as fund raising and allocated an 
appropriate share of indirect costs under the conditions described in 
paragraph B.3 of Attachment A to OMB Circular A-122.


<R05>
Sec. 731.772  Compensation for personal services.

Sec. 732.406-72  Establishing an LOC.

    (a) While the contract will provide for the use of an LOC when it is

[54 FR 46391, Nov. 3, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 736.602-3  Evaluation board functions.

    Agency architect-engineer evaluation boards shall perform the 
following functions:
    (a) Prepare a selection memorandum recommending no less than three 
firms which are considered most highly qualified to perform the required 
services for submission to the head of the contracting activity for his/
her approval. This selection memorandum shall include the information 
specified in 736.602-3(c).
    (b) In evaluating architect-engineer firms, the architect-engineer 
evaluation board shall apply the following criteria, other criteria 
established by Agency regulations, and any criteria set forth in the 
public notice on a particular contract:
    (1) Specialized experience of the firm (including each member of 
joint venture or association) with the type of service required;
    (2) Capacity of the firm to perform the work (including any 
specialized services) within the time limitations;
    (3) Past record of performance on contracts with USAID or other 
Government agencies and private industry with respect to such factors as 
control of costs, quality of work, and ability to meet schedules, to the 
extent such information is available;
    (4) Ability to assign an adequate number of qualified key personnel 
from the organization, including a competent supervising representative 
having considerable experience in responsible positions on work of a 
similar nature;
    (5) The portions of the work the architect-engineer is able to 
perform with its own forces when required;
    (6) Ability of the architect-engineer to furnish or to obtain 
required materials and equipment;
    (7) If the geographical or topographical aspects of the project are 
deemed vital, familiarity with the locality where the project is 
situated;
    (8) Financial capacity;
    (9) Responsibility of the architect-engineer under standards 
provided in FAR subpart 9.1. No contract may be

[[Page 48]]

awarded to a contractor that does not meet these standards;
    (10) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Agency, 
with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of architect-
engineer contracts among qualified firms. Each architect-engineer 
evaluation board shall give favorable consideration, to the fullest 
extent practicable to the most highly qualified firms that have not had 
prior experience on Government projects (including small business firms 
and firms owned by the socially and/or economically deprived).
    (c) The evaluation board shall prepare a selection memorandum for 
the approval of the head of the contracting activity. The selection 
memorandum will be signed by the board chairman and cleared by each 
board member. The selection memorandum shall include the following 
information:
    (1) A listing by name of all firms reviewed by the board;
    (2) A listing of the evaluation criteria applied;
    (3) An analysis of the selection showing the rationale for the 
board's recommendation;
    (4) The board's recommendation of the three most highly qualified 
firms, in order of preference;
    (5) An independent Government cost estimate. The evaluation board 
shall require the project engineer to develop an independent Government 
estimate of the cost of the required architect-engineer services. 
Consideration shall be given to the estimated value of the services to 
be rendered, the scope, complexity, and the nature of the project and 
the estimated costs expected to be generated by the work. The 
independent Government estimate shall be revised as required during 
negotiations to correct noted deficiencies and reflect changes in or 
clarification of, the scope of the work to be performed by the 
architect-engineer. A cost estimate based on the application of 
percentage factors to cost estimates of the various segments of the work 
involved, e.g., construction project, may be developed for comparison 
purposes, but such a cost estimate shall not be used as a substitute for 
the independent Government estimate.


<R05>
Sec. 736.602-4  Selection authority.

    (a) The head of the contracting activity or his/her authorized 
designee shall review the selection memorandum and shall either approve 
it or return it to the board for reconsideration for specified reasons.
    (b) Approval of the selection memorandum by the head of the 
contracting activity or his/her authorized designee shall serve as 
authorization for the contracting office to commence negotiation.

sections 3 and 4 of Executive Order 11223, as follows:

    Section 3. With respect to cost-type contracts heretofore or 
hereafter made with non-profit institutions under which no fee is 
charged or paid, amendments or modifications of such contracts may be 
made with or without consideration and may be utilized to accomplish the 
same things as any original contract could have accomplished, 
irrespective of the time or circumstances of the making, or of the form 
of the contract amended or modified, or of the amending or modifying 
contract and irrespective of rights which may have accrued under the 
contract or the amendments or modifications thereof.
    Section 4. With respect to contracts heretofore or hereafter made, 
other than those described in section 3 of this order, amendments and 
modifications of such contracts may be made with or without 
consideration and may be utilized to accomplish the same things as any 
original contract could have accomplished, irrespective of the time or 
circumstances of the making, or the form of the contract amended or 
modified, or of the amending or modifying contract, and irrespective of 
rights which may have accrued under the contract or the amendments or 
modifications thereof, if the Secretary of State or the Director of the 
United States International Development Cooperation Agency (with respect 
to functions vested in or delegated to Director) determines in each case 
that such action is necessary to protect the foreign policy interests of 
the United States.

<R05>
Sec. 750.7104  Types of actions.

    Three types of actions may be taken by or pursuant to the direction 
of an approving authority under the Executive Order. These are 
contractual adjustments such as amendments without consideration, 
correction of mistakes, and formalization of informal commitments.


<R05>
Sec. 750.7105  Approving authorities.

    All authority to approve actions under this subpart has been 
delegated to the M/OP Director.

[50 FR 16086, Apr. 24, 1985, as amended at 64 FR 42040, Aug. 3, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 750.7106  Standards for deciding cases.


<R05>
Sec. 750.7106-1  General.

    The mere fact that losses occur under a Government contract is not, 
by itself, a sufficient basis for the exercise of the authority 
conferred by the Executive Order. Whether, in a particular case, 
appropriate action such as amendment without consideration, correction 
of a mistake or ambiguity in a contract, or formalization of an informal 
commitment, will protect the foreign policy interests of the United 
States is a matter of sound judgment to be made on the basis of all of 
the

[[Page 53]]

facts of such case. Although it is obviously impossible to predict or 
enumerate all the types of cases with respect to which action may be 
appropriate, examples of certain cases or types of cases where action 
may be proper are set forth in sections 750.7106-2 through 750.7106-4. 
Even if all of the factors contained in any of the examples are present, 
other factors or considerations in a particular case may warrant denial 
of the request. These examples are not intended to exclude other cases 
where the approving authority determines that the circumstances warrant 
action.


<R05>
Sec. 750.7106-2  Amendments without consideration.

    (a) Where an actual or threatened loss under a foreign assistance 
contract, however caused, will impair the productive ability of a 
contractor whose continued performance of any foreign assistance 
contract or whose continued operation as a source of supply is found to 
be essential to protect the foreign policy interests of the United 
States, the contract may be adjusted but only to the extent necessary to 
avoid such impairment to the contractor's productive ability.
    (b) Where a contractor suffers a loss (not merely a diminution of 
anticipated profits) on a foreign assistance contract as a result of 
Government action, the character of the Government action will generally 
determine whether any adjustment in the contract will be made and its 
extent. Where the Government action is directed primarily at the 
contractor and is taken by the Government in its capacity as the other 
contracting party, the contract may be adjusted if fairness so requires; 
thus where such Government action, although not creating any liability 
on its part, increases the cost of performance, considerations of 
fairness may make appropriate some adjustment in the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 750.7106-3  Mistakes.

    A contract may be amended or modified to corrrect or mitigate the 
effect of a mistake, including the following examples:
    (a) A mistake or ambiguity which consists of the failure to express 
or to express clearly in the written contract the agreements as both 
parties understood them;
    (b) A mistake on the part of the contractor which is so obvious that 
it was or should have been apparent to the contracting officer; and
    (c) A mutual mistake as to a material fact.

Amending contracts to correct mistakes with the least possible delay 
normally will protect the foreign policy interests of the United States 
by expediting the procurement program and by giving contractors proper 
assurance that such mistakes will be corrected expeditiously and fairly.


<R05>
Sec. 750.7106-4  Informal commitments.

    Informal commitments may be formalized under certain circumstances 
to permit payment to persons who have taken action without a formal 
contract; for example, where any person, pursuant to written or oral 
instructions from an officer or official of the Agency and relying in 
good faith upon the apparent authority of the officer or official to 
issue such instructions, has arranged to furnish or has furnished 
property or services to the agency and/or to a foreign assistance 
contractor or subcontractor without formal contractual coverage for such 
property or services. Formalization of commitments under such 
circumstances normally will protect the foreign policy interests of the 
United States by assuring persons that they will be treated fairly and 
paid expeditiously.


<R05>
Sec. 750.7107  Limitations upon exercise of authority.

    (a) The Executive Order is not authority for:
    (1) The use of the cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of 
contracting;
    (2) The making of any contract in violation of existing law relating 
to limitation on profit or fees;
    (3) The waiver of any bid, payment performance or other bond 
required by law.
    (b) No amendments, or modifications shall be entered into under the 
authority of the Executive Order:
    (1) Unless, with respect to cases falling within Section 4 of the 
Executive

[[Page 54]]

Order, a finding is made that the action is necessary to protect the 
foreign policy interests of the United States;
    (2) Unless other legal authority in the Agency is deemed to be 
lacking or inadequate;
    (3) Except within the limits of the amounts appropriated and the 
statutory contract authorization.
    (c) No contract shall be amended or modified unless the request 
therefor has been filed before all obligations (including final payment) 
under the contract have been discharged.
    (d) No informal commitment shall be formalized unless:
    (1) A request for payment has been filed within six months after 
arranging to furnish or furnishing property or services in reliance upon 
the commitment;
    (2) USAID has received the services satisfactorily performed, or has 
accepted property furnished in reliance on the commitment;
    (3) The USAID employees alleged to have made the informal commitment 
have accepted responsibility for making the informal commitment in 
question; and
    (4) USAID has taken appropriate action to prevent recurrence.

    (c) A recital of the finding, with respect to cases falling within 
Section 4 of the Executive Order, that the action is necessary to 
protect the foreign policy interests of the United States.


<R05>
Sec. 750.7109  Submission of requests by contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 750.7109-1  Filing requests.

    Any person (hereinafter called the ``contractor'') seeking an 
adjustment under standards set forth in 750.7106 may file a request in 
duplicate with the cognizant contracting officer or his/her duly 
authorized representative. If such filing is impracticable, requests 
will be deemed to be properly filed if filed with the Chief of the

Sec. 750.7109-2  Form of requests by contractors.

contracting officer providing the information specified in FAR 50.303.


<R05>

considered appropriate, request the contractor to furnish the facts and 
evidence as described in FAR 50.304.

<R05>
Sec. 750.7110-1  Investigation.

    The Evaluation Division of the Office of Procurement (M/OP/E) shall 
be responsible for assuring that the case prepared by the cognizant 
contracting officer makes a thorough investigation of all facts and 
issues relevant to each situation. Facts and evidence shall be obtained 
from contractor and Government personnel and shall include signed 
statements of material facts within the knowledge of the individuals 
where documentary evidence is lacking and audits where considered 
necessary to establish financial or cost related facts. The 
investigation shall establish the facts essential to meet the standards 
for deciding the particular case and shall address the limitations upon 
exercise of the authority of the M/OP Director to approve the request.

pursuant to 704.404, paragraph (a) of the clause is revised as follows:

    (a) This clause applies to the extent that this contract involves 
access to classified (`Confidential', `Secret', or `Top Secret'), or 
administratively controlled (`Sensitive But Unclassified') information.

the action(s) which the Contractor has taken or proposes to take to 
avoid, eliminate or neutralize the conflict.
    (b) The Contracting Officer shall provide the contractor with

Sec. 752.245-71  Title to and care of property.

    As prescribed in 745.106(a), the following clause shall be included 
in all contracts when the contractor will acquire property under the 
contract for use overseas and the contract funds were obligated under a 
Strategic Objective agreement (or similar agreement) with the 
cooperating country.

                Title to and Care of Property (APR 1984)

    (a) Title to all non-expendable property purchased with contract 
funds under this contract and used in the Cooperating Country, shall at 
all times be in the name of the Cooperating Government, or such public 
or private agency as the Cooperating Government may designate, unless 
title to specified types or classes of non-expendable property is 
reserved to USAID under provisions set forth in the schedule of this 
contract; but all such property shall be under the custody and control 
of Contractor until the owner of title directs otherwise, or completion 
of work under this contract or its termination, at which time custody 
and control shall be turned over to the owner of title or disposed of in 
accordance with its instructions. All performance guaranties and 
warranties obtained from suppliers shall be taken in the name of the 
title owner. (Non-expendable property is property which is complete in 
itself, does not lose its identity or become a component part of another 
article when put into use; is durable, with an expected service life of 
two years or more; and which has a unit cost of $500 of more.)
    (b) Contractor shall prepare and establish a program, to be approved 
by the Mission, for the receipt, use, maintenance, protection, custody, 
and care of non-expendable property for which it has custodial 
responsibility, including the establishment of reasonable controls to 
enforce such program.
    (c)(1) For non-expendable property to which title is reserved to the 
U.S. Government under provisions set forth in the schedule of this 
contract, Contractor shall submit an annual report on all non-expendable 
property under its custody as required in the clause of this contract 
entitled ``Government Property''.
    (2) For non-expendable property titled to the Cooperating 
Government, the Contractor shall, within 90 days after completion of 
this contract, or at such other date as may be fixed by the Contracting 
Officer, submit an inventory schedule covering all items of non-
expendable property under its custody, which have not been consumed in 
the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall also indicate 
what disposition has been made of such property.I56Subpart 752.70--Texts

Sec. 752.247-70  Preference for privately owned U.S.-flag commercial 
          vessels.

    As prescribed in 747.507, insert the following clause:

 Preference for Privately Owned U.S.-Flag Commercial Vessels (OCT 1996)

    (a) Under the provisions of the Cargo Preference Act of 1954 (46 
U.S.C. 1241(b)) at least 50 percent of the gross tonnage of equipment, 
materials, or commodities financed by USAID, or furnished without 
provision for reimbursement, or at least 75 percent of the gross tonnage 
of cargo moving under P.L. 480 financed by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, that may be transported in ocean vessels (computed 
separately for dry bulk carriers, dry cargo liners, and tankers) shall 
be transported in privately owned U.S.-flag commercial vessels.
    (b) In accordance with USAID regulations and consistent with the 
regulations of the Maritime Administration, USAID applies Cargo 
Preference requirements on the basis of programs or activities that 
generally include more than one contract. Thus, the amount of cargo 
fixed on privately owned U.S.-flag vessels under this contract may be 
more or less than the required 50 or 75 percent, depending on current 
compliance with Cargo Preference requirements. If freight under the 
contract is fixed on a U.S. flag vessel, Alternate I of this clause 
shall apply.
    (c)(1) The contractor shall submit one legible copy of a rated on-
board ocean bill of

[[Page 66]]

lading for each shipment to both the Division of National Cargo, Office 
of Cargo Preference, Maritime Administration, U.S. Department of 
Transportation, Washington, DC 20590, and the Transportation Division, 
Office of Procurement, USAID, Washington, DC 20523-7900.
    (2) The contractor shall furnish these bill of lading copies within 
20 working days of the date of loading for shipments originating in the 
United States, or within 30 working days for shipments originating 
outside the United States. Each bill of lading copy shall contain the 
following information:
    (i) Sponsoring U.S. Government agency.
    (ii) Name of vessel.
    (iii) Vessel flag registry.
    (iv) Date of loading.
    (v) Port of loading.
    (vi) Port of final discharge.
    (vii) Description of commodity.
    (viii) Gross weight in pounds and cubic feet if available.
    (ix) Total ocean freight revenue in U.S. dollars.

                               Alternate I

    (d) If freight is fixed on a U.S. flag vessel, except as provided in 
paragraph (e) of this clause, the contractor shall use privately owned 
U.S. flag commercial vessels, and no others, in the ocean transportation 
of any supplies to be furnished under this contract.
    (e) If such vessels are not available, or not available at rates 
that are fair and reasonable for privately owned U.S. flag commercial 
vessels, the Contractor shall notify the contracting officer and request 
either authorization to ship in foreign-flag vessels or designation of 
available U.S.-flag vessels. If the Contractor is authorized in writing 
by the Contracting Officer to ship the supplies in foreign-flag vessels, 
the contract price shall be equitably adjusted to reflect the difference 
in costs of shipping the suppliers in privately owned U.S.-flag 
commercial vessels and foreign-flag vessels.

Sec. 752.7002  Travel and transportation.

    For use in cost reimbursement contracts performed in whole or in 
part overseas.

                  Travel and Transportation (JAN 1990)

    (a) General. The Contractor will be reimbursed for reasonable, 
allocable and allowable travel and transportation expenses incurred 
under and for the performance of this contract. Determination of 
reasonableness, allocability and allowability will be made by the 
Contracting Officer based on the applicable cost principles, the 
Contractor's established policies and procedures, USAID's established 
policies and procedures for USAID direct-hire employees, and the 
particular needs of the project being implemented by this contract. The 
following paragraphs provide specific guidance and limitations on 
particular items of cost.
    (b) International travel. For travel to and from post of assignment 
the Contractor shall be reimbursed for travel costs and travel 
allowances of travelers from place of residence in the United States (or 
other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the 
cost of the travel from the employee's residence in the United States) 
to the post of duty in the Cooperating Country and return to place of 
residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost 
of such travel does not exceed

[[Page 67]]

the cost of travel from the post of duty in the Cooperating Country to 
the employee's residence) upon completion of services by the individual. 
Reimbursement for travel will be in accordance with the applicable cost 
principles and the provisions of this contract, and will be limited to 
the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. If a 
regular employee does not complete one full year at post of duty (except 
for reasons beyond his/her control), the costs of going to and from the 
post of duty for that employee and his/her dependents are not 
reimbursable hereunder. If the employee serves more than one year but 
less than the required service in the Cooperating Country (except for 
reasons beyond his/her control) the costs of going to the post of duty 
are reimbursable hereunder but the costs of going from post of duty to 
the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she 
was employed for work under this contract or other location as approved 
by the Contracting Officer are not reimbursable under this contract for 
the employee and his/her dependents. When travel is by economy class 
accommodations, the Contractor will be reimbursed for the cost of 
transporting up to 22 pounds of accompanied personal baggage per 
traveler in addition to that regularly allowed with the economy ticket 
provided that the total number of pounds of baggage does not exceed that 
regularly allowed for first class travelers. Travel allowances for 
travelers shall not be in excess of the rates authorized in the 
Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas)--
hereinafter referred to as the Standardized Regulations--as from time to 
time amended, for not more than the travel time required by scheduled 
commercial air carrier using the most expeditious route. One stopover en 
route for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the 
traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or 
more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when 
travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the 
traveler. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with 
the established practice of the Contractor but not to exceed the amounts 
stated in the Standardized Regulations.
    (c) Local travel. Reimbursement for local travel in connection with 
duties directly referable to the contract shall not be in excess of the 
rates established by the Mission Director for the travel costs of 
travelers in the Cooperating Country. In the absence of such established 
rates the Contractor shall be reimbursed for actual travel costs of 
travelers in the Cooperating Country, if not provided by the Cooperating 
Government or the Mission, including travel allowances at rates not in 
excess of those prescribed by the Standardized Regulations.
    (d) Travel for consultation. The Contractor shall be reimbursed for 
the round trip of the Contractor's Chief of Party in the Cooperating 
Country or other designated Contractor employee or consultant in the 
Cooperating Country performing services required under this Contract, 
for travel from the Cooperating Country to the Contractor's office in 
the United States or to USAID/Washington for consultation and return on 
occasions deemed necessary by the Contractor and approved in advance, in 
writing, by the Contracting Officer or the Mission Director.
    (e) Special international travel and third country travel. For 
special travel which advances the purpose of the contract, which is not 
otherwise provided by the Cooperating Government, and with the prior 
written approval of the Contracting Officer or the Mission Director, the 
Contractor shall be reimbursed for (i) the travel cost of travelers 
other than between the United States and the Cooperating Country and for 
local travel within other countries and (ii) travel allowance for 
travelers while in travel status and while performing services hereunder 
in such other countries at rates not in excess of those prescribed by 
the Standardized Regulations.
    (f) Indirect travel for personal convenience. When travel is 
performed by an indirect route for the personal convenience of the 
traveler, the allowable costs of such travel will be computed on the 
basis of the cost of allowable air fare via the direct usually traveled 
route. If such costs include fares for air or ocean travel by foreign 
flag carriers, approval for indirect travel by such foreign flag 
carriers must be obtained from the Contracting Officer or the Mission 
Director before such travel is undertaken, otherwise only that portion 
of travel accomplished by United States-flag carriers will be 
reimbursable within the above limitation of allowable costs.
    (g) Limitation on travel by dependents. Travel costs and allowances 
will be allowed only for dependents of regular employees and such costs 
shall be reimbursed for travel from place of abode to assigned station 
in the Cooperating Country and return, only if dependent remains in the 
country for at least 9 months or one-half of the required tour of duty 
of the regular employee responsible for such dependent, whichever is 
greater. If the dependent is eligible for educational travel pursuant to 
the ``Differential and Allowances'' clause of this contract, time spent 
away from post resulting from educational travel will be counted as time 
at post.
    (h) Delays en route. The Contractor may grant to travelers under 
this contract reasonable delays en route while in travel status when 
such delays are caused by events beyond the control of such traveler or 
Contractor. It is understood that if delay is

[[Page 68]]

caused by physical incapacitation, personnel shall be eligible for such 
sick leave as provided under the ``Leave and Holidays'' clause of this 
contract.
    (i) Travel by privately owned automobile. The Contractor shall be 
reimbursed for the cost of travel performed by a regular employee in 
his/her privately owned automobile at a rate not to exceed that 
authorized in the Federal Travel Regulations plus authorized per diem 
for the employee and for each of the authorized dependents traveling in 
the automobile, if the automobile is being driven to or from the 
Cooperating Country as authorized under the contract, provided that the 
total cost of the mileage and the per diem paid to all authorized 
travelers shall not exceed the total constructive cost of fare and 
normal per diem by all authorized travelers by surface common carrier or 
authorized air fare, whichever is less.
    (j) Emergency and irregular travel and transportation. Emergency 
transportation costs and travel allowances while en route, as provided 
in this section will also be reimbursed not to exceed amounts authorized 
by the Foreign Service Travel Regulations for USAID-direct hire 
employees in like circumstances under the following conditions:
    (1) The costs of going from post of duty in the Cooperating Country 
to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or 
she was employed for work under this contract or other location for 
Contractor employees and dependents and returning to the post of duty, 
when the Contractor's Chief of Party, with the concurrence of the 
Contracting Officer or Mission Director makes a written determination 
that such travel is necessary for one of the reasons specified in 
subparagraphs (j)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section. A copy of the written 
determination shall be furnished to the Contracting Officer.
    (i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to 
which the employee is assigned, or serious effect on physical or mental 
health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty, subject in 
either case, to the limitations stated in the clause of this contract 
entitled ``Personnel--Physical Fitness of Employee and Dependents.'' The 
Mission Director may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the 
employee at contract expense if, based on medical opinion, such an 
attendant is necessary.
    (ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the 
immediate family of the employee or the immediate family of the 
employee's spouse.
    (2) When, for any reason, the Mission Director determines it is 
necessary to evacuate the Contractor's entire team (employees and 
dependents) or Contractor dependents only, the Contractor will be 
reimbursed for travel and transportation expenses and travel allowance 
while en route, for the cost of the individuals going from post of duty 
in the Cooperating Country to the employee's permanent, legal place of 
residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this 
contract or other approved location. The return of such employees and 
dependents may also be authorized by the Mission Director when, in his/
her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to do so.
    (3) The Mission Director may also authorize emergency or irregular 
travel and transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, 
the circumstances warrant such action. The authorization shall include 
the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time 
away from post, transportation of personal and/or household effects, 
etc. Requests for such emergency travel shall be submitted through the 
Contractor's Chief of Party.
    (k) Home leave travel. To the extent that home leave has been 
authorized as provided in the ``Leave and Holidays'' clause of this 
contract, the cost of travel for home leave is reimbursable for travel 
costs and travel allowances of travelers from the post of duty in the 
Cooperating Country to place of residence in the United States (or other 
location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost 
of travel to the employee's residence in the United States) and return 
to the post of duty in the Cooperating Country. Reimbursement for travel 
will be in accordance with the applicable cost principles and the 
provisions of this contract, and will be limited to the cost of travel 
by the most direct and expeditious route. When travel is by economy 
class accommodations, the Contractor will be reimbursed for the cost of 
transporting up to 22 pounds of accompanied personal baggage per 
traveler in addition to that regularly allowed with the economy ticket 
provided that the total number of pounds of baggage does not exceed that 
regularly allowed for first class travelers. Travel allowances for 
travelers shall not be in excess of the rates authorized in the 
Standardized Regulations as from time to time amended, for not more than 
the travel time required by scheduled commercial air carrier using the 
most expeditious route. One stopover en route for a period of not to 
exceed 24 hours is allowable when the traveler uses economy class 
accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or more of scheduled duration. 
Such stopover shall not be authorized when travel is by indirect route 
or is delayed for the convenience of the traveler. Per diem during such 
stopover shall be paid in accordance with the established practice of 
the Contractor but not to exceed the amounts stated in the Standardized 
Regulations.
    (l) Rest and recuperation travel. The Contractor shall be reimbursed 
for the cost of travel performed by regular employees and dependents for 
purposes of rest and recuperation provided that such reimbursement does

[[Page 69]]

not exceed that authorized for USAID direct hire employees, and provided 
further that no reimbursement will be made unless approval is given by 
the Contractor's Chief of party.
    (m) Transportation of motor vehicles, personal effects and household 
goods. (1) Transportation, including packing and crating costs, will be 
paid for shipping from the point of origin in the United States (or 
other location as approved by the Contracting Officer) to post of duty 
in the Cooperating Country and return to point of origin in the United 
States (or other location as approved by the Contracting Officer) of one 
privately-owned vehicle for each regular employee, personal effects of 
travelers and household goods of each regular employee not to exceed the 
limitations in effect for such shipments for USAID direct hire employees 
in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations as in effect 
when shipment is made.
    (2) If a regular employee does not complete one full year at post of 
duty (except for reasons beyond his/her control), the costs for 
transportation of vehicles, effects and goods to and from the post of 
duty are not reimbursable hereunder. If the employee serves more than 
one year but less than the required service in the Cooperating Country 
(except for reasons beyond his/her control) the costs for transportation 
of vehicles, effects and goods to the post of duty are reimbursable 
hereunder but the costs for transportation of vehicles, effects and 
goods from post of duty to the employee's permanent, legal place of 
residence at the time he or she was employed for work under this 
contract or other location as approved by the Contracting Officer are 
not reimbursable under this contract.
    (3) The cost of transporting motor vehicles and household goods 
shall not exceed the cost of packing, crating and transportation by 
surface. In the event that the carrier does not require boxing or 
crating of motor vehicles for shipment to the Cooperating Country, the 
cost of boxing or crating is not reimbursable. The transportation of a 
privately-owned motor vehicle for a regular employee may be authorized 
by the Contractor as replacement of the last such motor vehicle shipped 
under this contract for the employee when the Mission Director or his/
her designee determines in advance and so notifies the Contractor in 
writing that the replacement is necessary for reasons not due to the 
negligence or malfeasance of the regular employee. The determination 
shall be made under the same rules and regulations that apply to Mission 
employees.
    (n) Unaccompanied baggage. Unaccompanied baggage is considered to be 
those personal belongings needed by the traveler immediately upon 
arrival at destination. To permit the arrival of effects to coincide 
with the arrival of regular employees and dependents, consideration 
should be given to advance shipments of unaccompanied baggage. The 
Contractor will be reimbursed for costs of shipment of unaccompanied 
baggage (in addition to the weight allowance for household effects) not 
to exceed the limitations in effect for USAID direct hire employees in 
accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations as in effect when 
shipment is made.
    This unaccompanied baggage may be shipped as air freight by the most 
direct route between authorized points of origin and destination 
regardless of the modes of travel used. This provision is applicable to 
home leave travel and to short-term employees when these are authorized 
by the terms of this contract.
    (o) Storage of household effects. The cost of storage charges 
(including packing, crating, and drayage costs) in the U.S. of household 
goods of regular employees will be permitted in lieu of transportation 
of all or any part of such goods to the Cooperating Country under 
paragraph (m) above provided that the total amount of effects shipped to 
the Cooperating Country or stored in the U.S. shall not exceed the 
amount authorized for USAID direct hire employees under the Uniform 
Foreign Service Travel Regulations.
    (p) International ocean transportation. (1) Flag eligibility 
requirements for ocean carriage are covered by the ``Source and 
Nationality Requirements'' clause of this contract.
    (i) Transportation of things. Where U.S. flag vessels are not 
available, or their use would result in a significant delay, the 
Contractor may obtain a release from this requirement from the 
Transportation Division, Office of Procurement, U.S. Agency for 
International Development, Washington, DC. 20523-1419, or the Mission 
Director, as appropriate, giving the basis for the request.
    (ii) Transportation of persons. Where U.S. flag vessels are not 
available, or their use would result in a significant delay, the 
Contractor may obtain a release from this requirement from the 
Contracting Officer or the Mission Director, as appropriate.
    (2) Transportation of foreign-made vehicles. Reimbursement of the 
costs of transporting a foreign-made motor vehicle will be made in 
accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Service Travel 
Regulations.
    (3) Reduced rates on U.S. flag carriers. Reduced rates on United 
States flag carriers are in effect for shipments of household goods and 
personal effects of USAID contract personnel. These reduced rates are 
available provided the shipper states on the bill of lading that the 
cargo is ``Personal property-not for resale-payment of freight charges 
is at U.S. Government (USAID) expense and any special or diplomatic 
discounts accorded this type cargo are applicable.'' The Contractor will 
not be reimbursed for shipments of household goods or personal effects 
in an

[[Page 70]]

amount in excess of the reduced rates available in accordance with the 
foregoing.

Sec. 752.7012  Protection of the individual as a research subject.

    This clause is for use in any USAID contract which involves research 
using human subjects.

      Protection of the Individual as a Research Subject (AUG 1995)

    (a) Safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects in 
research conducted under a USAID contract is the responsibility of the 
contractor. USAID has adopted the Common Federal Policy for the 
Protection of Human Subjects. USAID's Policy is found in Part 225 of 
Title 22 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the ``Policy''). Additional 
interpretation, procedures, and implementation guidance of the Policy 
are found in USAID General Notice entitled ``Procedures for the 
Protection of Human Subjects in Research Supported by USAID'', issued 
April 19, 1995, as from time to time amended (a copy of which is 
attached to this contract). USAID's Cognizant Human Subjects Officer 
(CHSO) and USAID/W has oversight, guidance, and interpretation 
responsibility for the Policy.
    (b) Contractors must comply with the Policy when humans are the 
subject of research, as defined in 22 CFR 225.102(d), performed as part 
of the contract, and contractors must provide ``assurance'', as required 
by 22 CFR 225.103, that they follow and abide by the procedures in the 
Policy. See also Section 5 of the April 19, 1995, USAID General Notice 
which sets forth activities to which the Policy is applicable. The 
existence of a bona fide, applicable assurance approved by the 
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) such as the ``multiple 
project assurance'' (MPA) will satisfy this requirement. Alternatively, 
contractors can provide an acceptable written assurance to USAID as 
described in 22 CFR 225.103. Such assurances must be determined by the 
CHSO to be acceptable prior to any applicable research being initiated 
or conducted under the contract. In some limited instances outside the 
U.S., alternative systems for the protection of human subjects may be 
used provided they are deemed ``at least equivalent'' to those outlined 
in Part 225 (see 22 CFR 225.101(h)). Criteria and procedures for making 
this determination are described in the General Notice cited in the 
preceding paragraph.
    (c) Since the welfare of the research subject is a matter of concern 
to USAID as well

[[Page 74]]

as to the contractor, USAID staff, consultants and advisory groups may 
independently review and inspect research, and research processes and 
procedures involving human subjects, and based on such findings, the 
CHSO may prohibit research which presents unacceptable hazards or 
otherwise fails to comply with USAID procedures. Informed consent 
documents must include the stipulation that the subject's records may be 
subject to such review.

    (a) The Contractor acknowledges that this contract is an important 
part of the United States Foreign Assistance Program and agrees that its 
operations and those of its employees in the Cooperating Country will be 
carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the 
responsibility which this entails.
    (b) The Mission Director is the chief representative of USAID in the 
Cooperating Country. In this capacity, he/she is responsible for both 
the total USAID program in the cooperating country including certain 
administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract, and for 
advising USAID regarding the performance of the work under the contract 
and its effect on the United States Foreign Assistance Program. Although 
the Contractor will be responsible for all professional, technical, and 
administrative details of the work called for by the contract, it shall 
be under the guidance of the Mission Director in matters relating to 
foreign policy. The Chief of Party shall keep the Mission Director 
currently informed of the progress of the work under the contract.
    (c) In the event the conduct of any Contractor employee is not in 
accordance with the preceding paragraphs, the Contractor's Chief of 
Party shall consult with the Mission Director and the employee involved 
and shall recommend to the Contractor a course of action with regard to 
such employee.
    (d) The parties recognize the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct 
the removal from a country of any U.S. citizen or the discharge from 
this contract of any third-country national or cooperating-country 
national when, at the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the 
United States so require. Under these circumstances termination of an 
employee and replacement by an acceptable substitute shall be at no cost 
to USAID.
    (e) If it is determined that the services of such employee shall be 
terminated, the Contractor shall use its best efforts to cause the 
return of such employee to the United States or point of origin as 
appropriate.

[The following paragraph (f) is applicable if the contract is with an 
educational institution:]

    (f) It is understood by the parties that the Contractor's 
responsibilities shall not be restrictive of academic freedom. 
Notwithstanding these academic freedoms, the Contractor's employees, 
while in the Cooperating Country, are expected to show respect for its 
conventions, customs, and institutions, to abide by applicable laws and 
regulations, and not to interfere in its internal political affairs.

[[Page 75]]

                   Use of Pouch Facilities (JUL 1997)

    (a) Use of diplomatic pouch is controlled by the Department of 
State. The Department of State has authorized the use of pouch 
facilities for USAID contractors and their employees as a general 
policy, as detailed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this clause; 
however, the final decision regarding use of pouch facilities rests with 
the Embassy or USAID Mission. In consideration of the use of pouch 
facilities as hereinafter stated, the Contractor and its employees agree 
to indemnify and hold harmless the Department of State and USAID against 
loss or damage occurring in pouch transmission.
    (1) Contractors and their employees are authorized use of the pouch 
for transmission and receipt of up to a maximum of 2 pounds per shipment 
of correspondence and documents needed in the administration of foreign 
assistance programs.
    (2) U.S. citizen employeed of U.S. contractors are authorized use of 
the pouch for personal mail up to a maximum of one pound per shipment 
(but see paragraph (a)(3) of this clause).
    (3) Merchandise, parcels, magazines, or newspapers are not 
considered to be personal mail for purposes of this clause, and are not 
authorized to be sent or received by pouch.
    (4) Official mail as authorized by paragraph (a)(1) of this clause 
should be addressed as follows: Individual or Organization name, 
followed by the symbol ``C'', city Name of Post, U.S. Agency for 
International Development, Washington, DC 20523-0001.
    (5) Personal mail pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this clause should 
be sent to the address specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this clause, but 
without the name of the organization.
    (6) Mail sent via the diplomatic pouch may not be in violation of 
U.S. Postal laws and may not contain material ineligible for pouch 
transmission.
    (7) USAID contractor personnel are not authorized use of military 
postal facilities (APO/FPO). This is an Adjutant General's decision 
based on existing laws and regulations governing military postal 
facilities and is being enforced worldwide. Posts having access to APO/
FPO facilities and using such for diplomatic pouch dispatch, may, 
however, accept official mail from Contractors and letter mail from 
their employees for the pouch, provided of course, adequate postage is 
affixed.
    (b) The Contractor shall be responsible for advising its employees 
of this authorization and these guidelines and limitations on use of 
pouch facilities.
    (c) Specific additional guidance on use of pouch facilities in 
accordance with this clause is available from the Post Communication 
Center at the Embassy or USAID Mission.

    The following clause is applicable to all contracts involving any 
aspect of family planning or population activities.

     Family Planning and Population Assistance Activities (AUG 1986)

    (a) Voluntary Participation. (1) The Contractor agrees to take any 
steps necessary to ensure that funds made available under this contract 
will not be used to coerce any individual to practice methods of family 
planning inconsistent with such individual's moral, philosophical, or 
religious beliefs. Further, the Contractor agrees to conduct its 
activities in a manner which safeguards the rights, health and welfare 
of all individuals who take part in the program.
    (2) Activities which provide family planning services or information 
to individuals, financed in whole or in part under this contract, shall 
provide a broad range of family planning methods and services available 
in the country which the activity is conducted or shall provide 
information to such individuals regarding where such methods and 
services may be obtained.
    (b) Prohibition on Abortion-related Activities. No funds made

lobbying for abortion.
    (c) Voluntary Participation Requirements for Sterilization Programs. 
(1) None of the funds made available under this contract shall be used

assent from the individual given after being advised of the surgical 
procedures to be followed, the attendant discomforts and risks, the 
benefits to be expected, the availability of alternative methods of 
family planning, the purpose of the operation and its irreversibility, 
and the fact that the consent can be withdrawn at any time prior to the 
operation. An individual's consent is considered voluntary if it is 
based upon the exercise of free choice and is not obtained by any 
special inducement or any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress or 
other forms of coercion or misrepresentation.
    (3) Further, the Contractor shall document the patient's informed 
consent by: (i) A written consent document in a language the patient 
understands and speaks, which explains the basic elements of informed 
consent, as set out above, and which is signed by the individual and by 
the attending physician or by the authorized assistant of the attending 
physician; or (ii) when a patient is unable to read adequately a written 
certification signed by the attending physician or by the authorized 
assistant of the attending physician that the basic elements of informed 
consent above were orally presented to the patient, and that the patient 
thereafter consented to the performance of the operation. The receipt of 
the oral explanation shall be acknowledged by the patient's mark on the 
certification and by the signature or mark of the witness who shall be 
of the same sex and speak the same language as the patient.
    (4) Copies of the informed consent forms and certification documents 
for each voluntary sterilization (VS) procedure must be retained by the 
performing Contractor or subcontractor for a period of three years after 
the performance of the sterilization procedure.
    (d) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in any 
subgrants, subcontracts, purchase orders, and other subordinate 
agreements hereunder whenever appropriate to the goods and services to 
be provided under such agreements.

wide database training management system, the Training Results and 
Information Network (``TraiNet''), which is the preferred system for 
managing USAID's participant training program, including enrollment in 
the HAC program. However, until such time as the USAID sponsoring unit 
(as defined in ADS 253) has given the Contractor access to USAID's 
``TraiNet'' software for trainee tracking and HAC enrollment, the 
Contractor must fill out and mail the Participant Data Form (PDF) (Form 
USAID 1381-4) to USAID. The Contractor can obtain information regarding 
each HAC program contractor, including contact information, and a supply 
of the PDF forms and instructions for completing and submitting them, by 
contacting the data base contractor serving the Global Center for Human 
Capacity Development (G/HCD).
    (c) The Contractor must ensure that HAC enrollment begins 
immediately upon the participant's departure for the United States for 
the purpose of participating in a training program financed by USAID, 
and that enrollment continues in full force and effect until the 
participant returns to his/her country of origin, or is released from 
USAID's responsibility, whichever is the sooner.
    (1) The HAC insurance provider, not the Contractor, shall be 
responsible for paying all reasonable and necessary medical 
reimbursement charges not otherwise covered by student health service or 
other insurance programs, subject to the availability of funds for such 
purposes, in accordance with the standards of coverage established by 
USAID under its HAC program and by the HAC providers' contracts.
    (2) After HAC enrollment, upon receipt of HAC services invoice from 
the selected HAC provider, the Contractor shall submit payment directly 
to the HAC provider.

[[Page 77]]

    (3) The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that participants and 
any stakeholders (as defined in ADS 253) are advised that USAID is not 
responsible for any medical claims in excess of the coverages provided 
by the HAC program, or for medical claims not eligible for coverage 
under the HAC program, or not otherwise covered in this section.
    (d) The Contractor, to the extent that it is an educational 
institution with a mandatory student health service program, shall also 
enroll participants in that institution's student health service 
program. Medical costs which are covered under the institution's student 
health service shall not be eligible for payment under USAID's HAC 
program.
    (e) If the Contractor has a mandatory, non-waivable health and 
accident insurance program for students, the costs of such insurance 
will be allowable under this contract. Any claims eligible under such 
insurance will not be payable under USAID's HAC plan or under this 
contract. Even though the participant is covered by the Contractor's 
mandatory, non-waivable health and accident insurance program, the 
participant MUST be enrolled in USAID's more comprehensive HAC program.
    (f) Medical conditions pre-existing to the participant's sponsorship 
for training by USAID, discovered during the required pre-departure 
medical examination, are grounds for ineligibility for sponsorship 
unless specifically waived by the sponsoring unit, and covered through a 
separate insurance policy maintained by the participant or his employer, 
or a letter of guarantee from the participant or the employer (which 
thereby assumes liability for any related charges that might 
materialize. See ADS 253).

                 Changes in Tuition and Fees (APR 1984)

    While educational programs for participants will be established 
utilizing the Contractor's currently applicable tuition and fee 
schedule, the parties understand that such standard tuition and fees may 
be subject to change during the course of the program. If such event 
results in an increase in the cost of the program, USAID agrees to pay 
such increased standard tuition and fees in the next applicable academic 
term as a condition for the continuation of the program. If such change 
results in a decrease in the cost of the program, the Contractor agrees 
to charge to USAID only the amount of such revised standard tuition and 
fees in the next applicable academic term. The Contractor shall 
undertake to keep USAID currently advised as to changes in its standard 
tuition and fees. At such time as increases in the amounts of tuition 
and fees results in there being inadequate funds remaining in this 
contract to meet the costs of the next academic term, the Contractor 
will so advise USAID. USAID may then provide such additional funds as 
required to complete the program.

student for academic or disciplinary reasons.
    (c) If such withdrawal occurs prior to the end of a term, the 
Government shall pay any tuition and fees due for the current term in 
which the student may be enrolled, and the Contractor shall credit the 
Government with any charges eligible for refund under the Contractor's 
standard procedures for civilian students in effect on the effective 
date of such withdrawal.
    (d) Withdrawal of students by the Government shall not be the basis 
for any special charge or claim by the Contractor other than as provided

    (iv) When the contractor is unable to make appointments of regular 
employees for a full 2 years, the contractor may make appointments of

                             (End of clause)

[56 FR 7587, Feb. 25, 1991, as amended at 62 FR 40471, July 29, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 752.7028  Differential and allowances.

    The following clause is for use in all USAID cost reimbursement 
contracts performed in whole or in part overseas.

                 Differentials and Allowances (JUL 1996)

    (This clause does not apply to TCN or CCN employees. TCN and CCN 
employees are not eligible for differentials and allowances, unless 
specifically authorized by the cognizant Assistant Administrator or 
Mission Director. A copy of such authorization shall be retained and 
made available as part of the contractor's records which are required to 
be preserved and made available by the ``Examination of Records by the 
Comptroller General'' and ``Audit'' clauses of this contract).

    (a) Post differential. Post differential is an additional 
compensation for service at places in foreign areas where conditions of 
environment differ substantially from conditions of environment in the 
continental United States and warrant additional compensation as a 
recruitment and retention incentive. In areas where post differential is 
paid to USAID direct-hire employees, post differential not to exceed the 
percentage of salary as is provided such USAID employees in accordance 
with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), 
Chapter 500 (except the limitation contained in Section 552, ``Ceiling 
on Payment'') Tables-Chapter 900, as from time to time amended, will be 
reimbursable hereunder for employees in respect to amounts earned during 
the time such employees actually spend overseas on work under this 
contract. When such post differential is provided to regular employees 
of the Contractor, it shall be payable beginning on the date of arrival 
at the post of assignment and continue, including periods away from post 
on official business, until the close of business on the day of 
departure from post of assignment en route to the United States. Sick or 
vacation leave taken at or away from the post of assignment will not 
interrupt the continuity of the assignment or require a discontinuance 
of such post differential payments, provided such leave is not taken 
within the United States or the territories of the United States. Post 
differential will not be payable while the employee is away from his/her 
post of assignment for purposes of home leave. Short-term employees 
shall be entitled to post differential beginning with the forty-third 
(43rd) day at post.
    (b) Living quarters allowance. Living quarters allowance is an 
allowance granted to reimburse an employee for substantially all of his/
her cost for either temporary or residence quarters whenever Government-
owned or Government-rented quarters are not provided to him/her at his/
her post without charge. Such costs are those incurred for temporary 
lodging (temporary lodging allowance) or one unit of residence quarters 
(living quarters allowance) and include rent, plus any costs not 
included therein for heat, light, fuel, gas, electricity and water. The 
temporary lodging allowance and the living

[[Page 80]]

quarters allowance are never both payable to an employee for the same 
period of time. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to 
employees for a living quarters allowance for rent and utilities if such 
facilities are not supplied. Such allowance shall not exceed the amount 
paid USAID employees of equivalent rank in the Cooperating Country, in 
accordance with either the Standardized Regulations (Government 
Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 130, as from time to time amended, or 
other rates approved by the Mission Director. Subject to the written 
approval of the Mission Director, short-term employees may be paid per 
diem (in lieu of living quarters allowance) at rates prescribed by the 
Federal Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended, during the 
time such short-term employees spend at posts of duty in the Cooperating 
Country under this contract. In authorizing such per diem rates, the 
Mission Director shall consider the particular circumstances involved 
with respect to each such short-term employee including the extent to 
which meals and/or lodging may be made available without charge or at 
nominal cost by an agency of the United States Government or of the 
Cooperating Government, and similar factors.
    (c) Temporary quarters subsistence allowance. Temporary quarters 
subsistence allowance is a quarters allowance granted to an employee for 
the reasonable cost of temporary quarters incurred by the employee and 
his family for a period not in excess of (i) 90 days after first arrival 
at a new post in a foreign area or a period ending with the occupation 
of residence (permanent) quarters, if earlier, and (ii) 30 days 
immediately preceding final departure from the post subsequent to the 
necessary vacating of residence quarters, unless an extension is 
authorized in writing by the Mission Director. The Contractor will be 
reimbursed for payments made to employees and authorized dependents for 
temporary quarters subsistence allowance, in lieu of living quarters 
allowance, not to exceed the amount set forth in the Standardized 
Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 120, as from 
time to time amended.
    (d) Post allowance. Post allowance is a cost-of-living allowance 
granted to an employee officially stationed at a post where the cost of 
living, exclusive of quarters cost, is substantially higher than in 
Washington, DC. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to 
employees for post allowance not to exceed those paid USAID employees in 
the Cooperating Country, in accordance with the Standardized Regulations 
(Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 220, as from time to time 
amended.
    (e) Supplemental post allowance. Supplemental post allownce is a 
form of post allowance granted to an employee at his/her post when it is 
determined that assistance is necessary to defray extraordinary 
subsistence costs. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made 
to employees for supplemental post allowance not to exceed the amount 
set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign 
Areas), Chapter 230, as from time to time amended.
    (f) Educational allowance. Educational allowance is an allowance to 
assist an employee in meeting the extraordinary and necessary expenses, 
not otherwise compensated for, incurred by reason of his/her service in 
a foreign area in providing adequate elementary and secondary education 
for his/her children. The Contractor will be reimbursed for payments 
made to regular employees for educational allowances for their dependent 
children in amounts not to exceed those set forth in the Standardized 
(Regulations Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 270, as from 
time to time amended.
    (g) Educational travel. Educational travel is travel to and from a 
school in the United States for secondary education (in lieu of an 
educational allowance) and for college education. The Contractor will be 
reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for educational travel 
for their dependent children provided such payment does not exceed that 
which would be payable in accordance with the Standardized Regulations 
(Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 280, as from time to time 
amended. Educational travel shall not be authorized for regular 
employees whose assignment is less than two years.
    (h) Separate maintenance allowance. Separate maintenance allowance 
is an allowance to assist an employee who is compelled, by reason of 
dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions 
at his/her post of assignment in a foreign area, or for the convenience 
of the Government, to meet the additional expense of maintaining his/her 
dependents elsewhere than at such post. The Contractor will be 
reimbursed for payments made to regular employees for a separate 
maintenance allowance not to exceed that made to Aid employees in 
accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, 
Foreign Areas), Chapter 260, as from time to time amended.
    (i) Payments during evacuation. The Standardized Regulations 
(Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) provide the authority for 
efficient, orderly, and equitable procedure for the payment of 
compensation, post differential and allowances in the event of an 
emergency evacuation of employees or their dependents, or both, from 
duty stations for military or other reasons or because of imminent 
danger to their lives. If evacuation has been authorized by the Mission 
Director

[[Page 81]]

the Contractor will be reimbursed for payments made to employees and 
authorized dependents evacuated from their post of assignment in 
accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, 
Foreign Areas), Chapter 600, and the Federal Travel Regulations, as from 
time to time amended.
    (j) Danger pay allowance. (1) The contractor will be reimbursed for 
payments made to its employees for danger pay not to exceed that paid 
USAID employees in the cooperating country, in accordance with the 
Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 
650, as from time to time amended.
    (2) Danger pay is an allowance that provides additional compensation 
above basic compensation to an employee in a foreign area where civil 
insurrection, civil war, terrorism or wartime conditions threaten 
physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the 
employee. The danger pay allowance is in lieu of that part of the post 
differential which is attributable to political violence. Consequently, 
the post differential may be reduced while danger pay is in effect to 
avoid dual crediting for political violence.

                       Post Privileges (JUL 1993)

    (a) Routine health room services may be available, subject to post 
policy, to U.S. citizen contractors and their authorized dependents 
(regardless of citizenship) at the post of duty. These services do not 
include hospitalization, or predeparture or end of tour medical 
examinations. The services normally include such medications as may be 
available, immunizations and preventive health measures, diagnostic 
examinations and advice, and home visits as medically indicated. 
Emergency medical treatment is provided to U.S. citizen employees and 
dependents, whether or not they may have been granted access to routine 
health room services, on the same basis as it would be to any U.S. 
citizen in an emergency medical situation in the country.
    (b) Privileges such as the use of APO, PX's, commissaries, and 
officer's clubs are established at posts abroad pursuant to agreements 
between the U.S. and Cooperating Governments. These facilities are 
intended for and usually limited to members of the official U.S. 
establishment including the Embassy, USAID Mission, U.S. Information 
Service, and the Military. Normally, the agreements do not permit these 
facilities to be made available to nonofficial Americans.

   Inspection Trips by Contractor's Officers and Executives (APR 1984)

    Provided it is approved by the Mission Director, the Contractor may 
send the Campus Coordinator, a professional member of its staff as an 
alternate to the Campus Coordinator, or such of its senior officials 
(e.g., president, vice presidents, deans, or department heads) to the 
Cooperating Country as may be required to review the progress of the

alternate, no direct salary charges will be paid hereunder with respect 
to any such officials.

Sec. 752.7031  Leave and holidays.

    For use in all USAID cost-reimbursement contracts for technical or 
professional services.

                      Leave and Holidays (OCT 1989)

    (a) Vacation leave. (1) The Contractor may grant to its employees 
working under this contract vacations of reasonable duration in 
accordance with the Contractor's practice for its employees, but in no 
event shall such vacation leave be earned at a rate exceeding 26 work 
days per annum. Reimbursement for vacation leave is limited to the 
amount earned by employees while serving under this contract.
    For regular employees during their tour of duty in the Cooperating 
Country, vacation leave is provided under this contract primarily for 
purposes of affording necessary rest and recreation. The Contractor's 
Chief of Party, the employee and the Cooperating Country institution 
associated with this project shall develop vacation leave schedules 
early in the employee's tour of duty taking into consideration project 
requirements, employee preference and other factors.
    (2) Leave taken during the concluding weeks of an employee's tour 
shall be included in the established leave schedule and be limited to 
that amount of leave which can be earned during a twelve-month period 
unless approved in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this clause.

[[Page 82]]

    (3) Vacation leave earned but not taken by the end of the employee's 
tour pursuant to paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this clause will be 
forfeited unless the requirements of the project precluded the employee 
from taking such leave, and the Contracting Officer (with the 
endorsement of the Mission) approves one of the following as an 
alternative:
    (i) Taking, during the concluding weeks of the employee's tour, 
leave not permitted under (a)(2) of this section, or
    (ii) Lump-sum payment for leave not taken provided such leave does 
not exceed the number of days which can be earned by the employee during 
a twelve-month period.
    (b) Sick Leave. Sick leave is earned by employees in accordance with 
the Contractor's usual practice but not to exceed 13 work days per annum 
or 4 hours every 2 weeks. Additional sick leave after use of accrued 
vacation leave may be advanced in accordance with Contractor's usual 
practice, if in the judgment of the Contractor's Chief of Party it is 
determined that such additional leave is in the best interest of the 
project. In no event shall such additional leave exceed 30 days. The 
Contractor agrees to reimburse USAID for leave used in excess of the 
amount earned during the employee's assignment under this contract. Sick 
leave earned and unused at the end of a regular tour of duty may be 
carried over to an immediately-succeeding tour of duty under this 
contract. The use of home leave authorized under this clause shall not 
constitute a break in service for the purpose of sick leave carry-over. 
Contractor employees will not be compensated for unused sick leave at 
the completion of their duties under this contract.
    (c) Home leave. (1) Home leave is leave earned for service abroad 
for use only in the United States, in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 
or in the possessions of the United States.
    (2) A regular employee who is a U.S. citizen or resident and has 
served at least 2 years overseas, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
clause, under this contract and has not taken more than 30 workdays 
leave (vacation, sick, or leave without pay) in the United States, may 
be granted home leave of not more than 15 workdays for each such year of 
service overseas, provided that such regular employee agrees to return 
overseas upon completion of home leave under an additional 2 year 
appointment, or for a shorter period of not less than 1 year of overseas 
service under the contract if the Mission Director has approved in 
advance. Home leave must be taken in the United States, the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, or the possessions of the United States; any days spent 
elsewhere will be charged to vacation leave or leave without pay.
    (3) Notwithstanding the requirement in paragraph (c)(2), of this 
clause, that the Contractor's regular employee must have served 2 years 
overseas under this contract to be eligible for home leave, Contractor 
may grant advance home leave to such regular employee subject to all of 
the following conditions:
    (i) Granting of advance home leave would in each case serve to 
advance the attainment of the objectives of this contract;
    (ii) The regular employee shall have served a minimum of 18 months 
in the Cooperating Country on his/her current tour of duty under this 
contract; and
    (iii) The regular employee shall have agreed to return to the 
Cooperating Country to serve out the remainder of his/her current tour 
of duty and an additional 2 year appointment under this contract, or 
such other additional appointment of not less than 1 year of overseas 
service as the Mission Director may approve.
    (4) The period of service overseas required under paragraph (c)(2) 
or paragraph (c)(3) of this clause shall include the actual days spent 
in orientation in the United States (less language training) and the 
actual days overseas beginning on the date of departure from the United 
States port of embarkation on international travel and continuing, 
inclusive of authorized delays en route, to the date of arrival at the 
United States port of debarkation from international travel. Allowable 
vacation and sick leave taken while overseas, but not leave without pay, 
shall be included in the required period of service overseas. An amount 
equal to the number of days vacation and sick leave taken in the United 
States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the possessions of the 
United States will be added to the required period of service overseas.
    (5) Salary during travel to and from the United States for home 
leave will be limited to the time required for travel by the most 
expeditious air route. The Contractor will be responsible for 
reimbursing USAID for salary payments made during home leave if in spite 
of the undertaking of the new appointment the regular employee, except 
for reasons beyond his/her control as determined by the Contracting 
Officer, does not return overseas and complete the additional required 
service. Unused home leave is not reimbursable under this contract.
    (6) To the extent deemed necessary by the Contractor, regular 
employees in the United States on home leave may be authorized to spend 
not more than 5 days in work status for consultation at home office/
campus or at USAID/Washington before returning to their post of duty. 
Consultation at locations other than USAID/Washington or home office/
campus, as well as any time in excess of 5 days spent for consultation, 
must be approved by the Mission Director or the Contracting Officer.

[[Page 83]]

    (7) Except as provided in the schedule or approved by the Mission 
Director or the Contracting Officer, home leave is not authorized for 
TCN or CCN employees.
    (d) Holidays. Holidays for Contractor employees serving in the 
United States shall be in accordance with the Contractor's established 
policy and practice. Holidays for Contractor employees serving overseas 
should take into consideration local practices and shall be established 
in collaboration with the Mission Director.
    (e) Military leave. Military leave of not more than 15 calendar days 
in any calendar year may be granted in accordance with the Contractor's 
usual practice to each regular employee whose appointment is not limited 
to 1 year or less and who is a reservist of the United States Armed 
Forces, provided that such military leave has been approved in advance 
by the cognizant Mission Director or Assistant Administrator. A copy of 
any such approval shall be provided to the Contracting Officer.
    (f) Leave Records. The Contractor's leave records shall be preserved 
and made available as part of the contractor's records which are 
required to be preserved and made available by the Examination of 
Records by the Comptroller General and Audit clauses of this contract.

Sec. 752.7033  Physical fitness.

    For use in all USAID contracts involving performance overseas.

                       Physical Fitness (JUL 1997)

    (The requirements of this provision do not apply to employees hired 
in the Cooperating Country or to authorized dependents who were already 
in the Cooperating Country when their sponsoring employee was hired.)
    (a) Assignments of less than 60 days in the Cooperating Country. The 
contractor shall require employees being assigned to the Cooperating 
Country for less than 60 days to be examined by a licensed doctor of 
medicine. The contractor shall require the doctor to provide to the 
contractor a written statement that in his/her medical opinion the 
employee is physically qualified to engage in the type of activity for 
which he/she is employed and the employee is physically able to reside 
in the country to which he/she is assigned. Under a cost reimbursement 
contract, if the contractor has no written statement of medical opinion 
on file prior to the departure for the Cooperating Country of any 
employee and such employee is unable to perform the type of activity for 
which he/she is employed or cannot complete his/her tour of duty because 
of any physical disability (other than physical disability arising from 
an accident while employed under this contract), the contractor shall be 
responsible for returning the disabled employee to his/her point of hire 
and providing a replacement at no additional cost to the Government. In 
addition, in the case of a cost reimbursement contract, the contractor 
shall not be entitled to reimbursement for any additional costs 
attributable to delays or other circumstances caused by the employee's 
inability to complete his/her tour of duty.
    (b) Assignments of 60 days or more in the Cooperating Country. (1) 
The Contracting Officer shall provide the contractor with a reproducible 
copy of the ``USAID Contractor Employee Physical Examination Form''. 
This form is for collection of information; it has been reviewed and 
approved by OMB (see 701.105(a)). Information required by the Paperwork 
Reduction Act for reporting the burden estimate, the points of contact 
regarding burden estimate, and the OMB approval expiration date, are 
printed on the form. The contractor shall reproduce the form as 
required, and provide a copy to each employee and authorized dependent 
proposed for assignments of 60 days or more in the Cooperating Country. 
The contractor shall

[[Page 84]]

have the employee and all authorized dependents obtain a physical 
examination from a licensed physician, who will complete the form for 
each individual. The employee will deliver the physical examination 
form(s) to the embassy health unit in the Cooperating Country.
    (2) (The following information is provided for two purposes: To 
assist fixed price offerors to develop their price proposal, and to 
provide cost reimbursement contractors with guidance in determining 
reasonable and allowable costs.) As a contribution to the cost of 
medical examinations, USAID shall reimburse the contractor for the 
physical examination authorized in paragraph (a) of this section in an 
amount not to exceed $100 for the physical examination, plus 
reimbursement of charges for immunizations to the extent not covered by 
the contractor's health insurance policy. For physical examinations 
authorized in paragraph (b)(1) above, the USAID contribution to the cost 
of the examination shall be as follows:
    (i) For the employee and authorized dependents 12 years of age and 
over, one half of the cost of each examination up to a maximum USAID 
share of $300 per individual, plus reimbursement of charges for 
immunizations to the extent not covered by the contractor's health 
insurance policy.
    (ii) For authorized dependents under 12 years of age, one half of 
the cost of each examination up to a maximum USAID share of $120 per 
individual, plus reimbursement of charges for immunizations to the 
extent not covered by the contractor's health insurance policy.
    (iii) The contractor must obtain the prior written approval of the 
Contracting Officer to receive any USAID contributions higher than these 
limits.

<R05>
Sec. Appendix D to Chapter 7--Direct USAID Contracts With a U.S. Citizen 
          or a U.S. Resident Alien for Personal Services Abroad

    1. General. (a) Purpose. This appendix sets forth the authority, 
policy, and procedures under which USAID contracts with a U.S. citizen 
or U.S. resident alien for personal services abroad.
    (b) Definitions. (1) Personal services contract (PSC) means a 
contract that, by its express terms or as administered, make the 
contractor personnel appear, in effect, Government employees (see FAR 
37.104).
    (2) Employer-employee relationship means an employment relationship 
under a service contract with an individual which occurs when, as a 
result of the contract's terms or the manner of its administration 
during performance, the contractor is subject to the relatively 
continuous supervision and control of a Government officer or employee.
    (3) Non-person services contract means a contract under which the 
personnel rendering the services are not subject either by the 
contract's terms or by the manner of its administration, to the 
supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the 
Government and its employees.
    (4) Independent contractor relationship means a contract 
relationship in which the contractor is not subject to the supervision 
and control prevailing in relationships between the Government and its 
employees. Under this relationship, the Government does not normally 
supervise the performance of the work, control the days of the week or 
hours of the day in which it is to be performed, or the location of 
performance.
    (5) Resident hire means a U.S. citizen who, at the time of hire as a 
PSC, resides in the cooperating country as a spouse or dependent of a 
U.S. citizen employed by a U.S. government agency or under any U.S. 
government-financed contract or agreement, or for reasons other than for 
employment with a U.S. government agency or under any U.S. government-
financed contract or agreement. A U.S. citizen for purposes of this 
definition also includes persons who at the time of contracting are 
lawfully admitted permanent residents of the United States.

[[Page 86]]

    (6) U.S. resident alien means a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted 
for permanent residence in the United States.
    (7) Abroad means outside the United States and its territories and 
possessions.
    (8) USAID direct-hire employees means civilian employees appointed 
under USAID Handbook 25 procedures or superseding Automated Directive 
System (ADS) Chapters.

    2. Legal Basis. (a) Section 635(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the ``FAA'') provides the 
Agency's contracting authority.
    (b) Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2396(a)(3)) authorizes 
the Agency to enter into personal services contracts with individuals 
for personal services abroad and provides further that such individuals 
``* * * shall not be regarded as employees of the U.S. Government for 
the purpose of any law administered by the Civil Service Commission.'' 
\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Civil Service Commission is now the Federal Office of 
Personnel Management.

    3. Applicability. (a) This appendix applies to all personal services 
contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens to provide 
assistance abroad under Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA.
    (b) This appendix does not apply to:
    (1) Nonpersonal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. 
resident aliens; such contracts are covered by the basic text of the FAR 
(48 CFR Chapter 1) and the AIDAR (48 CFR Chapter 7).
    (2) Personal services contracts with individual Cooperating Country 
Nationals (CCNs) or Third Country Nationals (TCNs). Such contracts are 
covered by Appendix J of this chapter.
    (3) Other personal services arrangements covered by USAID Handbook 
25--Employment and Promotion or superseding ADS Chapters.
    (4) Interagency agreements (e.g., PASAs and RSSAs covered by ADS 
306--Interagency Agreements.

    4. Policy. (a) General. USAID may finance, with either program or 
operating expense (OE) funds, the cost of personal services contracts as 
part of the Agency's program of foreign assistance by entering into a 
direct contract with an individual U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien 
for personal services abroad.
    (1) Program funds. Under the authority of Section 635(h) of the FAA, 
program funds may be obligated for periods up to five years where 
necessary and appropriate to the accomplishment of the tasks involved.
    (2) Operating Expense Funds. Pursuant to USAID budget policy, OE 
funded salaries and other recurrent cost items may be forward funded for 
a period of up to three (3) months beyond the fiscal year in which these 
funds were obligated. Non-recurring cost items may be forward funded for 
periods not to exceed twenty-four (24) months where necessary and 
appropriate to accomplishment of the work.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ If there is a need, these contracts may be written for 5 years 
also but funded only as outlined in paragraph 4(a) of this Appendix.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Limitations on Personal Services Contracts. (1) Personal 
services contracts may only be used when adequate supervision is 
available.
    (2) Personal services contracts may be used for commercial 
activities. Commercial activities provide a product or service which 
could be obtained from a commercial source. See Attachment A of OMB 
Circular A-76 for a representative list of such activities.
    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of USAID directives, 
regulations or delegations, U.S. citizen personal services contractors 
(USPSCs) may be delegated or assigned any authority, duty or 
responsibility delegable to U.S. citizen direct-hire employees (USDH 
employees) except that:
    a. They may not supervise U.S. direct-hire employees of USAID or 
other U.S. Government agencies. They may supervise USPSCs and non-U.S. 
citizen employees.
    b. They may not be designated as Contracting Officers or delegated 
authority to sign obligating or subobligating documents.
    c. They may represent the agency, except that communications that 
reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must 
be cleared by a USDH employee.
    d. They may participate in personnel selection matters, but may not 
be delegated authority to make a final decision on personnel selection.
    e. Exceptions to the limitations in this paragraph (b)(3) must be 
approved by the Assistant Administrator for Management (AA/M).
    (c) Withholdings and Fringe Benefits. (1) Personal services 
contractors (PSCs) are Government employees for purposes of the Internal 
Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code) and are, therefore, 
subject to social security (FICA) and Federal income tax (FIT) 
withholdings. As employees, they are ineligible for the ``foreign earned 
income'' exclusion under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations 
(see 26 CFR 1.911-3(c)(3)).
    (2) Personal services contractors are treated on par with other 
Government employees, except for programs based on any law administered 
by the Federal Office of Personnel Management (e.g., incentive awards, 
life insurance, health insurance, and retirement programs covered by 5 
CFR Parts 530, 531, 831, 870, 871, and 890). While PSCs are ineligible 
to participate in any of these programs,

[[Page 87]]

the following fringe benefits are provided as a matter of policy:
    (i) The employer's FICA contribution for retirement purposes.
    (ii) A contribution against the actual cost of the PSC's annual 
health and life insurance costs. Proof of health and life insurance 
coverage and its actual cost to the PSC shall be submitted to the 
Contracting Officer before any contribution is made. (See also paragraph 
4(c)(3) of this Appendix.)
    (A) The contribution for health insurance shall not exceed 50% of 
the actual cost to the PSC for his/her annual health insurance, or the 
maximum U.S. Government contribution for a direct-hire employee, as 
announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management, whichever is 
less. If the PSC is covered under a spouse's health insurance plan, 
where the spouse's employer pays some or all of the health insurance 
costs, the cost to the PSC for annual health insurance shall be 
considered to be zero.
    (B) The contribution for life insurance shall be up to 50% of the 
actual annual costs to the PSC for life insurance, not to exceed $500.00 
per year.
    (iii) PSCs shall receive the same percentage pay comparability 
adjustment as U.S. Government employees subject to the availability of 
funds.
    (iv) PSCs shall receive a 3% annual salary increase subject to 
satisfactory performance documented in their annual written evaluation. 
Such increase may not exceed 3% without a deviation. This 3% limitation 
also applies to extensions of the same service or negotiations for a new 
contract for the same or similar services unless a deviation has been 
approved.
    (v) PSCs shall receive the following allowances and differentials 
provided in the State Department's Standardized Regulations (Government 
Civilians Foreign Areas) on the same basis as U.S. Government employees 
(except for U.S. resident hires, see paragraph 4(d) and Section 12, 
General Provisions, Clause 22, ``U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services 
Contractors''):
    (A) Temporary lodging allowance (Section 120),\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Mission Directors may authorize per diem in lieu of these 
allowances.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (B) Living quarters allowance (Section 130),\3\
    (C) Post allowance (Section 220),\3\
    (D) Supplemental post allowance (Section 230),\3\
    (E) Separate maintenance allowance (Section 260),\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ These allowances are not authorized for short tours (i.e., less 
than a year).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (F) Education allowance (Section 270),\4\
    (G) Educational travel (Section 280),\4\
    (H) Post differential (Section 500),
    (I) Payments during evacuation/authorized departure (Section 600), 
and
    (J) Danger pay (Section 650).
    (vi) Any allowance or differential that is not expressly stated in 
paragraph 4(c)(2)(v) is not authorized for any PSC unless a deviation is 
approved. The only exception is a consumables allowance if authorized 
for the post under Handbook 22 or superseding ADS Chapter.
    (vii) Health room services may be provided in accordance with the 
clause of this contract entitled ``Physical Fitness and Health Room 
Privileges.''
    (viii) PSCs are eligible to receive benefits for injury, disability, 
or death under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act since the law is 
administered by the Department of Labor not the Office of Personnel 
Management.
    (ix) PSCs are eligible to earn four hours of annual leave and four 
hours of sick leave for each two week period. However, PSCs with 
previous PSC service (not previous U.S. Government civilian or military 
service) earn either six hours of annual leave for each two week period 
if their previous PSC service exceeds 3 years (including 10 hours annual 
leave for the final pay period of a calendar year), or eight hours of 
annual leave for each two week period if their previous PSC service 
exceeds 15 years.
    (3) A PSC who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil Service, 
Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered by their 
spouse's Government health or life insurance policy is ineligible for 
the contribution under paragraph 4(c)(2)(ii) of this appendix.
    (4) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional 
contributions for health or life insurance under their contract (since 
the Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the 
retiree) unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the 
Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not 
provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas. If coverage overseas 
is excluded, then eligibility as cited in paragraph 4(c)(3) applies.
    (5) Retired U.S. Government employees may be awarded Personal 
Services Contracts without any reduction in or offset against their 
Government annuity.
    (d) U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractors. U.S. resident-
hire PSCs are not eligible for any fringe benefits (except contributions 
for FICA, health insurance, and life insurance), including differentials 
and allowances unless such individuals can demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that they have received similar 
benefits and allowances from their immediately previous employer in the 
cooperating country, or the Mission Director

[[Page 88]]

may determine that payment of such benefits would be consistent with the 
Mission's policy and practice and would be in the best interests of the 
U.S. Government.
    (e) Determining Salary for Personal Services Contractors. (1) There 
are two separate and distinct methods of establishing a salary for 
personal services contractors. Use of method number 1 is required unless 
justified and approved as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii).
    (i) Method 1: Salaries for Personal Services Contractors shall be 
established based on the market value in the United States of the 
position being recruited for. This requires the Contracting Officer in 
coordination with the Technical Officer to determine the correct market 
value (a salary range) of the position to be filled. This method is 
required in establishing salary for all PSCs unless method 2 is 
authorized as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(ii). Contract Information 
Bulletin (CIB) 96-8 dated February 23, 1996 provides a guide which 
contains information concerning Preparation of Scopes of Work, 
Determination of Salary Class Grade, Salary Class Bench Marks and Salary 
Class Review. The market value of the position then becomes the basis 
along with the applicants' certified salary history on the SF 171, 
``Personal Qualifications Statement'' for salary negotiations by the 
Contracting Officer. The SF 171 must be retained in the permanent 
contract file. Any position which is determined to be above the GS-13 
equivalent and exceeds six months in duration must be classified by M/
HR/POD. The crucial point is the establishment of a realistic and 
reasonable market value for a job. The final determination regarding the 
reasonableness of a salary level rests with the Contracting Officer. 
Paying salaries using this method avoids ``rank in person'' salaries 
which are in excess of the value of the job being contracted for.
    (ii) Method 2: If approved in writing by the Mission Director or the 
cognizant Assistant Administrator, based on written justification, 
salary may be negotiated based on the applicant's current earnings 
adjusted in accordance with the factors set out in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) 
(A) through (C). This approval requirement cannot be redelegated. 
Current earnings must be certified by the contractor on the SF 171, (see 
paragraph 6(b)(3) of this appendix). This is guidance for establishing 
initial salaries, not subsequent increases, for the same contractor 
performing the same function.
    (A) As a rule, up to a 3 percent increase above current earnings may 
be given. However, a 3 percent increase is awarded only to a PSC whose 
earnings are based on a period of twelve months or more; 2 percent for 
established earnings of less than twelve months but not less than four 
months; or 1 percent for established earnings during the past four 
months.
    (B) Additional percentages may be given for the following factors. 
If a PSC has worked in a developing country for more than two years, an 
additional 1 percent may be awarded. Education related to the area of 
specialization and above the minimum qualification required may warrant 
an additional 1 percent, and those specialties for which there is keen 
competition in the employment market or a serious shortage category 
nationwide may be awarded an additional 2 percent. In addition, related 
technical experience over 5 years may increase the percentage by 1 and 
over ten years by 3.
    (C) All requests for an initial rate of pay above 10 percent over 
current earnings must be approved in writing by the appropriate 
Assistant Administrator or Mission Director. Current earnings are actual 
earnings for work reasonably related to the position for which the 
applicant is being considered. Paragraphs 4(e)(1)(ii) (A) through (C) 
apply only to salary setting method number 2 in paragraph 4 (e)(1)(ii).
    (2) When an applicant has no current earnings history (e.g., a 
person returning to the workforce after an absence of a number of years) 
or when an applicant's current earnings history doesn't accurately 
reflect the applicant's job market worth (e.g., a Peace Corps 
volunteer), every effort should be made to establish a market value for 
the position as a basis for negotiation, notwithstanding the lack of a 
current earnings history, provided that the applicant has the full 
qualifications for the job and could command a similar salary in the 
open job market.
    (3) Salaries in excess of the ES-6 level must also be approved by 
the M/OP Director based upon a memorandum through the appropriate 
Assistant Administrator or Mission Director and Contracting Officer, as 
provided for in internal guidelines on ``Approval Procedures for 
Contractor Salaries''. This approval level cannot be redelegated.
    (f) Incentive Awards. U.S. PSCs are not eligible to receive monetary 
awards. They are eligible for non-monetary awards such as certificates.
    (g) Annual Salary Increase. PSC contracts written for more than one 
year should provide for a 3% annual increase based on satisfactory 
performance documented in their annual written evaluations.
    (h) Pay Comparability Adjustment. PSCs shall receive the same 
percentage pay comparability adjustment as that received by U.S. 
Government employees subject to the availability of funds.
    (i) Subcontracting. PSCs are U.S. Government employees and may not 
be called upon (or permitted) to subcontract out any part of their work. 
Funds for subcontracting have no place in the budget of a personal 
services contract. Support services, equipment, and supplies (e.g., 
typing and report preparation,

[[Page 89]]

paper, pens, computers, and furniture) should be furnished to PSCs just 
as they would be to direct-hire employees. To the extent that direct-
hire personnel may be authorized to purchase supporting services or 
supplies under a travel authorization, so may PSCs; otherwise, contracts 
for personal services should not contain any funds for procurement.

    5. Soliciting for Personal Services Contracts. (a) Technical 
Officer's Responsibilities. The Technical Officer will prepare a written 
detailed statement of duties and a statement of minimum qualifications 
to cover the position being recruited for. The statement shall be 
included in the procurement request (the Acquisition & Assistance 
Request Document) e.g., the request shall also include the following 
additional information as a minimum:
    (1) The specific foreign location(s) where the work is to be 
performed, including any travel requirements (with an estimate of 
frequency);
    (2) The length of the contract, with beginning and ending dates, 
plus any options for renewal or extension;
    (3) The basic education, training, experience, and skills required 
for the position;
    (4) An estimate of what a comparable GS/FS equivalent position 
should cost, including basic salary, allowances, and differentials, if 
appropriate; and
    (5) A list of Government or host country furnished items (e.g., 
housing).
    (b) Contracting Officer's Responsibilities. (1) The Contracting 
Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services which shall 
contain:
    (i) Three sets of SF 171s and SF 171As. (Upon receipt, one copy of 
each SF 171 and SF 171A shall be forwarded to the Project Officer.)
    (ii) A detailed statement of duties or a completed position 
description for the position being recruited for.
    (iii) A copy of the prescribed contract Cover Page, Contract 
Schedule, General Provisions as appropriate, as well as the FAR Clauses 
to be incorporated in full text and by reference.
    (iv) A copy of the USAID General Notice entitled ``Employee Review 
of the New Standards of Conduct''.
    (2) The Contracting Officer shall comply with the requirements of 
(48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c) as detailed in paragraph 5(c) except those 
recruited from the U.S.
    (c) Competition. (1) Under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal 
Services Contracts (except those recruited from the U.S.) are exempt 
from the requirements for full and open competition with two limitations 
that must be observed by Contracting Officers:
    (i) Offers are to be requested from as many potential offerors as is 
practicable under the circumstances, and
    (ii) A justification supporting less than full and open competition 
must be prepared in accordance with FAR 6.303.
    (2) PSCs With Untied States Citizens or Resident Aliens Recruited 
from Outside the Cooperating Country. Solicitations for PSCs recruited 
outside the cooperating country must be publicized via the Agency's 
External Home Page on the Internet under the caption ``Business & 
Procurement, USAID Procurements.'' Instructions regarding how to access 
the External Internet and the information to be provided have been 
approved and included in a CIB. A justification under FAR 6.303 is not 
required when this procedure is followed.
    (3) A class justification was approved by the USAID Procurement 
Executive to satisfy the requirements of (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2) 
for a justification in accordance with FAR 6.303. This class 
justification for Personal Services Contracts with U.S. Citizens may 
only be used for those who are recruited locally subject to the 
following conditions:
    (i) The position was publicized locally in accordance with 
established Mission policy or procedure, or the procedures in paragraph 
5(c)(ii) was followed;
    (ii) As an alternative to the procedures in paragraphs 5(c) (i) and 
(ii), at least 3 individuals were considered by consulting source lists 
(e.g., applications or resumes on hand) or conducting other informal 
solicitation.
    (iii) Extensions or renewals with the same individual for continuing 
services do not need to be publicized.
    (iv) A copy of the class justification (which was distributed to all 
USAID Contracting Officers via Contract Information Bulletin) must be 
included in the contract file, together with a written statement, signed 
by the Contracting Officer, that the contract is being awarded pursuant 
to (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1); that the conditions for use of this 
class justification have been met; and that the cost of the contract is 
fair and reasonable.
    (4) If the appropriate competitive procedure in paragraph 5(3) is 
not followed, the Contracting Officer must prepare a separate 
justification as required under (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2).
    (5) Since the award of a Personal Services Contract is based on 
technical qualifications, not price, and since the SF 171, ``Personal 
Qualifications Statement'', and SF 171A, ``Continuation Sheet for 
Standard Form 171'', are used to solicit for such contracts, FAR 
subparts 15.4 and 15.5 and FAR parts 52 and 53 are inappropriate and 
shall not be used. Instead, the solicitation and selection procedures 
outlined in this Appendix shall govern.

    6. Negotiating a Personal Services Contract. Negotiating a Personal 
Services Contract is significantly different from negotiating a

[[Page 90]]

nonpersonal services contract because it establishes an employer-
employee relationship; therefore, the selection procedures are more akin 
to the personnel selection procedures.
    (a) Technical Officer's Responsibilities. The Technical Officer 
shall be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the applications 
(i.e., SF 171s) received in response to the solicitation issued by the 
Contracting Officer. If deemed appropriate, interviews may be conducted 
with the applicants before the final selection is submitted to the 
Contracting Officer.
    (b) Contracting Officer's Responsibilities. (1) The Contracting 
Officer shall forward a copy of each SF 171 received under the 
solicitation to the Project Officer for evaluation.
    (2) On receipt of the Technical Officer's recommendation, the 
Contracting Officer shall conduct negotiations with the recommended 
applicant. Normally, the Contracting Officer shall negotiate only the 
salary (see the salary setting coverage in paragraph 4(e) of this 
Appendix). The terms and conditions of the contract, including 
differentials and allowances, are not negotiable or waivable without a 
properly approved deviation (see (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470). If the 
Contracting Officer can negotiate a salary that is fair and reasonable, 
then the award shall be made.
    (3) The Contracting Officer shall use the certified salary history 
on the SF 171 as the basis for salary negotiations, along with the 
market value of the position being recruited for (unless approval not to 
use market value has been granted under paragraph 4(e)(1)(ii)), and the 
Technical Officer's cost estimate.
    (4) The Contracting Officer will obtain two copies of IRS Form W-4, 
``Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate'', from the successful 
applicant. (Upon receipt, the Contracting Officer will forward one copy 
of the W-4 to the Office of the Controller.)
    (5) Security clearance is required for all U.S. citizens entering 
into USAID PSCs. The Contracting Officer will obtain four sets of SF 86, 
``Security Investigation Data for Sensitive Position'', from the 
successful applicant and forward them to the Office of Security. PSCs 
may receive a preliminary clearance and be placed under contract prior 
to receipt of clearance provided the appropriate paper work has been 
completed, reviewed by IG/SEC/PSI and acknowledged as a ``no objection'' 
to the appropriate Mission. See General Provision 24 in section 12 of 
this Appendix.

    7. Executing a Personal Services Contract. Contracting Officers or 
Heads of Contracting Activities, whether USAID/W or Mission, may execute 
Personal Services Contracts, provided that the amount of the contract 
does not exceed the contracting authority that has been redelegated to 
them. In executing a Personal Services Contract, the Contracting Officer 
is responsible for insuring that:
    (a) The proposed contract is within his/her delegated authority;
    (b) A Request Number covering the proposed contract has been 
received;
    (c) The position has been classified by either the Mission or M/HR/
POD (see CIB 96-8) and the classification is in the contract file;
    (d) The proposed Statement of Duties is contractible, contains a 
statement of minimum qualifications from the technical office requesting 
the services, and is suitable to the use of a Personal Services Contract 
in that:
    (1) Performance of the proposed work requires or is best suited for 
an employer-employee relationship, and is thus not suited to the use of 
a non-personal services contract;
    (2) The Statement of Duties does not require performance of any 
function normally reserved for Federal employees (see paragraph 4(b) of 
this Appendix); and
    (3) There is no apparent conflict of interest involved (if the 
Contracting Officer believes that a conflict of interest may exist, the 
question should be referred to the cognizant legal counsel);
    (e) Selection of the contractor is documented and justified. (48 
CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1) provides an exception to the requirement for 
full and open competition for Personal Services Contracts abroad (see 
paragraph 5(c) of this Appendix);
    (f) The standard contract format prescribed for Personal Services 
Contracts (Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 to this Appendix) is used; or that 
any necessary deviations are processed as required by (48 CFR) AIDAR 
701.470.

    (Note: The prescribed contract format is designed for use with 
contractors who are residing in the U.S. when hired. If the contract is 
with a U.S. citizen residing in the cooperating country when hired, 
contract provisions governing physical fitness and travel/transportation 
expenses, and home leave, allowances, and orientation should be suitably 
modified (see paragraph 4(d) of this Appendix)).

These modifications are not considered deviations subject to (48 CFR) 
AIDAR 701.470. (Justification and explanation of these modifications is 
to be included in the contract file);
    (g) Orientation is arranged in accordance with General Provision 23 
in section 12 of this Appendix;
    (h) The contractor has submitted the names, addresses, and telephone 
numbers of at least two persons who may be notified in the event of an 
emergency (this information is to be retained in the contract file);
    (i) The contract is complete and correct and all information 
required on the contract

[[Page 91]]

Cover Page (USAID Form 1420-36A) has been entered;
    (j) The contract has been signed by the Contracting Office and the 
contractor, and fully executed copies are properly distributed;
    (k) The following clearances, approvals and forms have been 
obtained, properly completed, and placed in the contract file before the 
contract is signed by both parties;
    (1) Evidence of job classification in the file by the Mission except 
for grade equivalents above GS-13. For those positions with grade 
equivalent above GS-13, evidence of job classification done by M/HR/POD;
    (2) Security clearance, including the completed SF 86, to the extent 
required by USAID Handbook 6, Security or superseding ADS Chapter, (see 
General Provisions 14 and 24 in section 12 of this Appendix);
    (3) Mission, host country, Human Resources Office, and technical 
office clearance, as appropriate;
    (4) Medical examinations and certifications as required by the 
contract general provision entitled ``Physical Fitness and Health Room 
Privileges'';
    (5) One original executed IRS Form W-4 entitled ``Employee's 
Withholding Allowance Certificate'', and one copy, shall be obtained. 
The original shall be sent to the Controller of the paying office and 
one shall be placed in the contract file;
    (6) Evidence of DAA/HR clearance that the position may be filled by 
PSC.
    (7) The approval for any salary in excess of ES-6, in accordance 
with Appendix G of this chapter;
    (8) A copy of the class justification or other appropriate 
explanation and support required by (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70, if 
applicable;
    (9) Any deviation to the policy or procedures of this appendix, 
processed and approved under (48 CFR) AIDAR 701.470;
    (10) A fully executed SF 171, and a copy of the position 
classification, and approved deviation, if appropriate;
    (11) The Memorandum of Negotiation; and
    (12) The Contracting Officer's signed certification that competition 
requirements have been satisfied as described in paragraph 5(c) of the 
policy text of this Appendix. The certification shall be a part of the 
Memorandum of Negotiations.
    (l) Funds for the contract are properly obligated to preclude 
violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 1341 (the Contracting 
Officer ensures that the contract has been properly recorded by the 
appropriate accounting office prior to its release for the signature of 
the selected contractor);
    (m) The contractor receives and understands the USAID General Notice 
entitled ``Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct'' and a copy 
is attached to each contract as provided for in paragraph (c) of General 
Provision 1, section 12;
    (n) Agency conflict of interest requirements as set out in the 
General Notice ``Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct'' are 
met by the contractor prior to his/her reporting for duty;
    (o) A copy of a Checklist for Personal Services contractors which 
may be in the format set out in this section or another format 
convenient for the Contracting Officer, provided that a memorandum 
containing all of the information described in this section 7 shall be 
prepared for each PSC and placed in the contract file;
    (p) The contractor understands that he/she is an employee of the 
United States for purposes of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended, and the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States 
Code). This subjects the employee to withholding for both FICA and 
Federal Income Tax and precludes the employee from receiving the Federal 
Earned Income Tax exclusion of 26 U.S.C. Section 911. See Special Note 
on the Cover Page of USAID Form 1420-36.
    (q) The contractor also understands that he/she may commence work 
prior to the completion of the security clearance. However, until such 
time as clearance is received, the contractor may not have access to 
classified or administratively controlled materials. Failure to obtain 
clearances will constitute cause for termination.

    8. Post Audit. The Inspector General, or his/her designee, audits 
the Personal Services Contracts of all contracting activities for the 
purpose of ensuring conformance to applicable policy and regulations.

    9. Contracting Format. The prescribed Contract Cover Page, Contract 
Schedule, General Provisions, and appropriate Federal Acquisition 
Regulations (FAR) clauses for Personal Services Contracts covered by 
this appendix are included as follows:
    10. Form USAID 1420-36, ``Cover Page'' and ``Schedule''.

serve as an alternate procedure for OE funded U.S. PSCs or U.S. Resident 
Alien PSCs. The Schedule is for use when the Contracting Officer 
anticipates incremental recurring cost funded contracts.
    Use of the Optional Schedule eliminates the need to amend the 
contract each time funds are obligated. However, the Contracting Officer 
is required to amend each contract not less than twice during a 12 month 
period to ensure that the contract record of obligations is up to date 
and agrees with the figures in the master funding document.)

leave in excess in that earned, but in no case shall a contractor be 
granted advance vacation leave in excess of that which he/she will earn

days for each such year of service overseas; provided, that the 
contractor agrees to return overseas upon completion of home leave under 
an additional 2 year appointment, or for such shorter period of not less 
than 1 year of overseas service under the contract as the Mission

States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the possessions of the 
United States, and any days spent elsewhere will be charged to vacation 
leave or leave without pay.

the contractor must have served 2 years overseas under personal services 
contract with this Mission to be eligible for home leave, the contractor

conditions:
    (i) Granting of leave home leave would in each case serve to advance 
the attainment of the objectives of this contract;
    (ii) The contractor has served a minimum of 18 months in the

and
    (iii) The contractor agrees to return to the Cooperating Country to

additional 2 year appointment under this or subsequent contract, or such 
other additional appointment of not less than 1 year of overseas service 
as the Mission Director may approve.
    (4) The period of service overseas required under paragraph (c)(2), 
or paragraph (c)(3) above, shall include the actual days in orientation 
in the United States (less language training) and the actual days

Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the possessions of the United States 
will be added to the required period of service overseas.
    (5) Salary during the travel to and from the United States for home 
leave will be limited to the time required for travel by the most

contractor and his/her authorized dependents to the same extent and on 
the same basis as they are granted to U.S. citizen direct-hire employees 
at the Mission by the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, 
Foreign Areas), as from time to time amended, except as noted to the 
contrary below:

            Applicable Reference to Standardized Regulations
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Post Differential........................  Chapter 500 and Tables in
                                                Chapter 900.
(2) Living Quarters Allowance................  Section 130.
(3) Temporary Lodging Allowance..............  Section 120.
(4) Post Allowance...........................  Section 220.
(5) Supplemental Post Allowance..............  Section 230.
(6) Payments During Evacuation...............  Section 600.
(7) Education Allowance......................  Section 270.
(8) Separate Maintenance Allowance...........  Section 260.
(9) Danger Pay Allowance.....................  Section 650.
(10) Education Travel........................  Section 280.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (1) Post Differential. Post differential is an additional 
compensation for service at places in foreign areas where conditions of 
environment differ substantially from conditions of environment in the 
continental United States and warrant additional compensation as a 
recruitment and retention incentive. In areas where post differential is 
paid to USAID direct-hire employees, post differential not to exceed the 
percentage of salary as is provided such USAID employees in accordance 
with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) 
Chapter 500 (except the limitation contained in Section 552, ``Ceiling 
on Payment'') Tables--Chapter 900, as from time to time amended, will be 
reimbursable hereunder for employees in respect to amounts earned during 
the time such employees actually spend overseas on work under this 
contract. When such post differential is provided to the contractor, it 
shall be payable beginning on the date of arrival at the post of 
assignment and continue, including periods away from post on official 
business, until the close of business on the day of departure from post 
of assignment enroute to the United States. Sick or vacation leave taken 
at or away from the post of assignment will not interrupt the continuity 
of the assignment or require a discontinuance of such post differential 
payments, provided such leave is not taken within the United States or 
the territories of the United States. Post differential will not be 
payable while the employee is away from his/her post of assignment for 
purposes of home leave. Short-term employees shall be entitled to pose 
differential beginning with the forty-third (43rd) day at post.
    (2) Living Quarters Allowance. Living quarters allowance is an 
allowance granted to reimburse an employee for substantially all of his/
her cost for either temporary or residence quarters whenever Government-
owned or Government-rented quarters are not provided to him/her at his/
her post without charge. Such costs are those incurred for temporary 
lodging (temporary lodging allowance) or one unit of residence quarters 
(living quarters allowance) and include rent,

[[Page 101]]

plus any costs not included therein for heat, light, fuel, gas, 
electricity and water. The temporary lodging allowance and the living 
quarters allowance are never both payable to an employee for the same 
period of time. The contractor will receive living quarters allowance 
for payment of rent and utilities if such facilities are not supplied. 
Such allowance shall not exceed the amount paid USAID employees of 
equivalent rank in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with either 
the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), 
Chapter 130, as from time to time amended, or other rates approved by 
the Mission Director. Subject to the written approval of the Mission 
Director, short-term employees may be paid per diem (in lieu of living 
quarters allowance) at rates prescribed by the Federal Travel 
Regulations, as from time to time amended, during the time such short-
term employees spend at posts of duty in the Cooperating Country under 
this contract. In authorizing such per diem rates, the Mission Director 
shall consider the particular circumstances involved with respect to 
each such short-term employee including the extent to which meals and/or 
lodging may be made available without charge or at nominal cost by an 
agency of the United States Government or of the Cooperating Government, 
and similar factors.
    (3) Temporary Lodging Allowance. Temporary lodging allowance is a 
quarters allowance granted to an employee for the reasonable cost of 
temporary quarters incurred by the employee and his/her family for a 
period not in excess of (i) three months after first arrival at a new 
post in a foreign area or a period ending with the occupation of 
residence (permanent) quarters, if earlier, and (ii) one month 
immediately preceding final departure from the post subsequent to the 
necessary vacating of residence quarters. The contractor will receive 
temporary lodging allowance for himself/herself and authorized 
dependents, in lieu of living quarters allowance, not to exceed the 
amount set forth in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, 
Foreign Areas), Chapter 120, as from time to time amended.
    (4) Post Allowance. Post allowance is a cost-of-living allowance 
granted to an employee officially stationed at a post where the cost of 
living, exclusive of quarters cost, is substantially higher than in 
Washington, D.C. The contractor will receive post allowance payments not 
to exceed those paid USAID employees in the Cooperating Country, in 
accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, 
Foreign Areas), Chapter 220, as from time to time amended.
    (5) Supplemental Post Allowance. Supplemental post allowance is a 
form of post allowance granted to an employee at his/her post when it is 
determined that assistance is necessary to defray extraordinary 
subsistence costs. The contractor will receive supplemental post 
allowance payments not to exceed the amount set forth in the 
Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 
230, as from time to time amended.
    (6)  Payments During Evacuation. The Standardized Regulations 
(Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) provide the authority for 
efficient, orderly, and equitable procedure for the payment of 
compensation, post differential and allowances in the event of an 
emergency evacuation of employees or their dependents, or both, from 
duty stations for military or other reasons or because of imminent 
danger to their lives. If evacuation has been authorized by the Mission 
Director, the contractor will receive payments during evacuation for 
himself/herself and authorized dependents evacuated from their post of 
assignment in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government 
Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 600, and the Federal Travel 
Regulations, as from time to time amended.
    (7) Educational Allowance. Educational allowance is an allowance to 
assist the contractor in meeting the extraordinary and necessary 
expenses, not otherwise compensated for, incurred by reason of his/her 
service in a foreign area in providing adequate elementary and secondary 
education for his/her children. The contractor will receive educational 
allowance payments for his/her dependent children in amounts not to 
exceed those set forth in Standardized Regulations (Government

dangerous, notably unhealthful, or excessively adverse living conditions 
at his/her post of assignment in a foreign area, or for the convenience 
of the Government, to meet the additional expense of maintaining his/her 
dependents elsewhere than at such post. The contractor will receive 
separate maintenance allowance payments not to exceed that made to USAID 
employees in accordance with the Standardized Regulations (Government 
Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 260, as from time to time amended.
    (9) Danger Pay Allowance. Danger pay allowance is an allowance to 
provide additional compensation above basic compensation to employees in 
foreign areas where civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism or wartime 
conditions threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or 
well-being of the employee. The danger pay allowance is in lieu of that 
part of the post differential which is attributable to political 
violence. Consequently, the post differential may be reduced while 
danger pay is in effect to avoid dual crediting for political violence.

[[Page 102]]

The contractor shall be allowed danger pay allowance not to exceed that 
paid USAID employees in the Cooperating Country, in accordance with the 
Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas), Chapter 
650, as from time to time amended.
    (10) Educational Travel. Educational travel is travel to and from a 
school in the United States for secondary education (in lieu of an 
educational allowance) and for college education. The contractor will

time to time amended.

7. Social Security, Federal Income Tax, and Foreign Earned Income (June 
                                  1990)

    (a) Since the contractor is an employee, F.I.C.A. contributions and 
U.S. Federal Income Tax withholding shall be deducted in accordance with 
regulations and rulings of the Social Security Administration and the 
U.S. Internal Revenue Service, respectively.
    (b) As an employee, the contractor is not eligible for the ``foreign 
earned income'' exclusion under the IRS Regulations (see 26 CFR 1.911-
3(c)(3)).

                  8. Advance of Dollar Funds (APR 1997)

    If requested by the contractor and authorized in writing by the 
Contracting Officer, USAID will arrange for an advance of funds to 
defray the initial cost of travel, travel allowances, authorized 
precontract expenses, and shipment of personal property. The advance 
shall be granted on the same basis as to a USAID U.S.-citizen direct-
hire employee in accordance with USAID Handbook 22, Chapter 4 or 
superseding ADS Chapter.

                         9. Insurance (APR 1997)

    (a) Worker's Compensation Benefits. The contractor shall be provided 
worker's compensation benefits in accordance with the Federal Employees' 
Compensation Act.
    (b) Health and Life Insurance. (1) The contractor shall be provided 
a maximum contribution of up to 50% against the actual costs of the 
contractor's annual health insurance costs, provided that such costs may 
not exceed the maximum U.S. Government contribution for direct-hire 
personnel as announced annually by the Office of Personnel Management.
    (2) The contractor shall be provided a contribution of up to 50% 
against the actual costs of annual life insurance not to exceed $500.00 
per year.
    (3) Retired U.S. Government employees shall not be paid additional 
contributions for health or life insurance under their contracts. The 
Government will normally have already paid its contribution for the 
retiree unless the employee can prove to the satisfaction of the 
Contracting Officer that his/her health and life insurance does not 
provide or specifically excludes coverage overseas. In such case, the 
contractor would be eligible for contributions under paragraphs (b) (1) 
or (2) as appropriate.
    (4) Proof of health and life insurance coverage shall be submitted 
to the Contracting Officer before any contribution is paid. On 
assignments of less than one year, costs for health and life insurance 
shall be prorated and paid accordingly.
    (5) A contractor who is a spouse of a current or retired Civil 
Service, Foreign Service, or Military Service member and who is covered 
by their spouse's Government health or life insurance policy is 
ineligible for the contribution under paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of 
this provision.
    (c) Insurance on Private Automobiles. If the contractor or his/her 
dependents transport, or cause to be transported, privately owned 
automobile(s) to the Cooperating Country, or any of them purchase an 
automobile within the Cooperating Country, the contractor agrees to 
ensure that all such automobile(s) during such ownership within the 
Cooperating Country will be covered by a current, i.e., not in arrears, 
insurance policy issued by a reliable company providing the following 
minimum coverage, or such other minimum coverage as may be set by the 
Mission Director, payable in U.S. dollars or its equivalent in the 
currency of the Cooperating Country: injury to persons, $10,000/$20,000; 
property damage, $5,000. The contractor further agrees to deliver, or 
cause to be delivered to the Mission Director, the insurance policies 
required by this clause or satisfactory proof of the existence thereof, 
before such automobile(s) operated within the Cooperating Country. The 
premium costs for such insurance shall not be a reimbursable cost under 
this contract.

           10. Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993)

    (a) General. (1) USAID/Washington Office of Administrative Services, 
or such other office as may be designated by that office, may furnish 
Transportation Requests (TR's) to the contractor for transportation 
authorized by this contract originating in the United

[[Page 103]]

States, and the executive or administrative officer at the Mission may 
furnish TR's for such authorized transportation which is payable in 
local currency or is to originate overseas. When transportation is not 
provided by the Government-issued TR, the contractor shall procure his/
her own transportation, the costs of which will be reimbursed in 
accordance with the terms of this contract.
    (2) The contractor will be reimbursed for reasonable, allocable and 
allowable travel and transportation expenses incurred under and for the 
performance of this contract. Determination of reasonableness, 
allocability and allowability will be made by the Contracting Officer in 
accordance with USAID's established policies and procedures for USAID 
direct-hire employees, and the particular needs of the activity being 
implemented by this contract. The following paragraphs provide specific 
guidance and limitations on particular items of cost.
    (b) U.S. Travel and Transportation. The contractor shall be 
reimbursed for actual transportation costs and travel allowances in the 
United States as authorized in the Contract Schedule or approved in 
advance by the Contracting Officer or the Mission Director. 
Transportation costs and travel allowances shall not be reimbursed in 
any amount greater than the cost of, and time required for, economy-
class commercially scheduled air travel by the most expeditious route 
except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g) of this provision unless 
economy air travel is not available and the contractor certifies to this 
in his/her voucher or other documents submitted for reimbursement.
    (c) International Travel. For travel to and from post of assignment, 
the contractor shall be reimbursed for travel costs and travel 
allowances from place of residence in the United States (or other 
location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost 
of the travel from the contractor's residence in the United States) to 
the post of duty in the Cooperating Country and return to place of 
residence in the United States (or other location provided that the cost 
of such travel does not exceed the cost of travel from the post of duty 
in the Cooperating Country to the contractor's residence) upon 
completion of services by the individual. Reimbursement for travel will 
be in accordance with USAID's established policies and procedures for 
its direct-hire employees and the provisions of this contract, and will 
be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious 
route. If the contract is for longer than one year and the contractor 
does not complete one full year at post of duty (except for reasons 
beyond his/her control), the costs of going to and from the post of duty 
for the contractor and his/her dependents are not reimbursable 
hereunder. If the contractor serves more than one year but less than the 
required service in the Cooperating Country (except for reasons beyond 
his/her control) the costs of going to the post of duty are reimbursable 
hereunder but the costs of going from post of duty to the contractor's 
permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed 
for work under this contract, or other location as approved by the 
Contracting Officer, are not reimbursable under this contract for the 
contractor and his/her dependents. When travel is by economy class 
accommodations, the contractor will be reimbursed for the cost of 
transporting up to 10 kilograms/22 pounds of accompanied personal 
baggage per traveler in addition to that regularly allowed with the 
economy ticket provided that the total number of pounds of baggage does 
not exceed that regularly allowed for first class travelers. Travel 
allowances for travelers shall not be in excess of the rates authorized 
in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas)-
hereinafter referred to as the Standardized Regulations--as from time to 
time amended, for not more than the travel time required by scheduled 
commercial air carrier using the most expeditious route. One stopover 
enroute for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the 
traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or 
more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when 
travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the 
traveler. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with 
the Federal Travel Regulations as from time to time amended.
    (d) Local Travel. Reimbursement for local travel in connection with 
duties directly referable to the contract shall not be in excess of the 
rates established by the Mission Director for the travel costs of 
travelers in the Cooperating Country. In the absence of such established 
rates the contractor shall be reimbursed for actual travel costs in the 
Cooperating Country or the Mission, including travel allowances at rates 
not in excess of those prescribed by the Standardized Regulations.
    (e) Indirect Travel for Personal Convenience. When travel is 
performed by an indirect route for the personal convenience of the 
traveler, the allowable costs of such travel will be computed on the 
basis of the cost of allowable air fare via the direct usually traveled 
route. If such costs include fares for air or ocean travel by foreign 
flag carriers, approval for indirect travel by such foreign flag 
carriers must be obtained from the Contracting Officer or the Mission 
Director before such travel is undertaken, otherwise only that portion 
of travel accomplished by the United States-flag carriers will be 
reimbursable within the above limitation of allowable costs.
    (f) Limitation on Travel by Dependents. Travel costs and allowances 
will be allowed for authorized dependents of the contractor and

[[Page 104]]

such costs shall be reimbursed for travel from place of abode to 
assigned station in the Cooperating Country and returned, only if the 
dependent remains in the Cooperating Country for at least 9 months or 
one-half of the required tour of duty of the contractor, whichever is 
greater, except as otherwise authorized hereunder for education, medical 
or emergency visitation travel. If the dependent is eligible for 
educational travel pursuant to the ``Differential and Allowances'' 
clause of this contract, time spent away from post resulting from 
educational travel will be counted as time at post.
    (g) Delays Enroute. The contractor may be granted reasonable delays 
enroute while in travel status when such delays are caused by events 
beyond the control of the contractor and are not due to circuitous 
routine. It is understood that if delay is caused by physical 
incapacitation, he/she shall be eligible for such sick leave as provided 
under the ``Leave and Holidays'' clause of this contract.
    (h) Travel by Privately Owned Automobile (POV). If travel by POV is 
authorized in the contract schedule or approved by the Contracting 
Officer, the contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of travel 
performed in his/her POV at a rate not to exceed that authorized in the 
Federal Travel Regulations plus authorized per diem for the employee and 
for each of the authorized dependents traveling in the POV, if the POV 
is being driven to or from the Cooperating Country as authorized under 
the contract, provided that the total cost of the mileage and the per 
diem paid to all authorized travelers shall not exceed the total 
constructive cost of fare and normal per diem by all authorized 
travelers by surface common carrier or authorized air fare, whichever is 
less.
    (i) Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation. Emergency 
transportation costs and travel allowances while enroute, as provided in 
this section, will be reimbursed not to exceed amounts authorized by the 
Foreign Service Travel Regulations for USAID-direct hire employees in 
like circumstances under the following conditions:
    (1) The costs of going from post of duty in the Cooperating Country 
to the employee's permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or 
she was employed for work under this contract or other location for 
contractor employees and dependents and returning to the post of duty, 
subject to the prior written approval of the Mission Director that such 
travel is necessary for one of the following reasons.
    (i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to 
which the employee is assigned, or serious effect on physical or mental 
health if residence is continued at assigned post of duty. The Mission 
Director may authorize a medical attendant to accompany the employee at 
contract expense if, based on medical opinion, such an attendant is 
necessary.
    (ii) Death, or serious illness or injury of a member of the 
immediate family of the employee or the immediate family of the 
employee's spouse.
    (2) When, for any reason, the Mission Director determines it is 
necessary to evacuate the contractor or contractor's dependents, the 
contractor will be reimbursed for travel and transportation expenses and 
travel allowance while enroute, for the cost of the individuals going 
from post of duty in the Cooperating Country to the employee's 
permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed 
for work under this contract or other approved location. The return of 
such employees and dependents may also be authorized by the Mission 
Director when, in his/her discretion, he/she determines it is prudent to 
do so.
    (3) The Mission Director may also authorize emergency or irregular 
travel and transportation in other situations, when in his/her opinion, 
the circumstances warrant such action. The authorization shall include 
the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time 
away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.
    (j) Home Leave Travel. To the extend that home leave has been 
authorized as provided in the ``Leave and Holidays'' clause of this 
contract, the cost of travel for home leave is reimbursable for travel 
costs and travel allowances of travelers from the post of duty in the 
Cooperating Country to place of residence in the United States (or other 
location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the cost 
of travel to the contractor's residence in the United States) and return 
to the post of duty in the Cooperating Country. Reimbursement for travel 
will be in accordance with the Uniform State/USAID/USIA Foreign Service 
Travel Regulations, as from time to time amended, and will be limited to 
the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious route. Travel 
allowances for travelers shall be in accordance with the rates 
authorized in the Standardized Regulations as from time to time amended, 
for not more than the travel time required by scheduled commercial air 
carrier using the most expeditious route using economy class. One 
stopover enroute for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable 
when the traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 
hours or more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be 
authorized when travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the 
convenience of the traveler or the traveler uses other than economy 
class. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with 
the Standardized Regulations.
    (k) Rest and Recuperations Travel. If approved in writing by the 
Mission Director,

[[Page 105]]

the contractor and his/her dependents shall be allowed rest and 
recuperation travel on the same basis as authorized USAID direct-hire 
Mission employees and their dependents.
    (l) Transportation of Motor Vehicles, Personal Effects and Household 
Goods.
    (1) Transportation costs will be paid on the same basis as for USAID 
direct-hire employees serving the same length tour of duty, as 
authorized in the schedule. Transportation, including packing and 
crating costs, will be paid for shipping from the point of origin in the 
United States (or other location as approved by the Contracting Officer) 
to post of duty in the Cooperating Country and return to point of origin 
in the United States (or other location as approved by the Contracting 
Officer) of one privately-owned vehicle for the contractor, personal 
effects of the contractor and authorized dependents, and household goods 
of the contractor not to exceed the limitations in effect for such 
shipments for USAID direct-hire employees in accordance with the Foreign 
Service Travel Regulations in effect at the time shipment is made. These 
limitations may be obtained from the Contracting Officer.
    (2) The cost of transporting motor vehicles and household goods 
shall not exceed the cost of packing, crating, and transportation by 
surface common carrier. In the event that the carrier does not require 
boxing or crating of motor vehicles for shipment to the Cooperating 
Country, the cost of boxing or crating is not reimbursable. The 
transportation of a privately owned motor vehicle for a contractor may 
be authorized as a replacement of the last such motor vehicle shipped 
under this contract for such contractor when the Mission Director 
determines, in advance, and so notifies the contractor in writing, that 
the replacement is necessary for reasons not due to the negligence or 
malfeasance of the contractor. The determination shall be made under the 
same rules and regulations that apply to authorized Mission U.S. citizen 
direct-hire employees.
    (m) Unaccompanied Baggage. Unaccompanied baggage is considered to be 
those personal belongings needed by the traveler immediately upon 
arrival of the contractor and dependents, and consideration should be 
given to advance shipments of unaccompanied baggage. The contractor will 
be reimbursed for costs of shipment of unaccompanied baggage (in 
addition to the weight allowance for household effects) not to exceed 
the limitations in effect for USAID direct-hire employees in accordance 
with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations as in effect when shipment 
is made. These limitations are available from the Contracting Officer. 
This unaccompanied baggage may be shipped as air freight by the most 
direct route between authorized points of origin and destination 
regardless of the modes of travel used. This provision is applicable to 
home leave travel when authorized by the terms of this contract.
    (n) International Ocean Transportation. (1)(i) Transportaiton of 
things. Where U.S. flag vessels are not available, or their use would 
result in a significant delay, the contractor may obtain a release from 
the requirement to use U.S. flag vessels from the Transportation 
Division, Office of Procurement, U.S. Agency for International 
Development, Washington, D.C. 20523-1419, or the Mission Director, as 
appropriate, giving the basis for the request.
    (ii) Transportation of persons. Where U.S. flag vessels are not 
available, or their use would result in a significant delay, the 
contractor may obtain a release from the requirement to use U.S. flag 
vessels from the Contracting Officer or the Mission Director, as 
appropriate.
    (2) Transportation of foreign-made vehicles. Reimbursement of the 
costs of transporting a foreign-made motor vehicle will be made in 
accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Service Travel 
Regulations.
    (3) Reduced rates on U.S.-flag carriers are in effect for shipments 
of household goods and personal effects of USAID contractors between 
certain locations. These reduced rates are available provided the 
shipper furnishes to the carrier at the time of the issuance of the Bill 
of Lading documentary evidence that the shipment is for the account of 
USAID. The Contracting Officer will, on request, furnish to the 
contractor current information concerning the availability of a reduced 
rate with respect to any proposed shipment. The contractor will not be 
reimbursed for shipments of household goods or personal effects in 
amounts in excess of the reduced rates which are available in accordance 
with the foregoing.
    (o) Storage of household effects. The cost of storage charges 
(including packing, crating, and drayage costs) in the U.S. of household 
goods of the contractor will be permitted in lieu of transportation of 
all or any part of such goods to the Cooperating Country under paragraph 
(l) above provided that the total amount of effects shipped to the 
Cooperating Country or stored in the U.S. shall not exceed the amount 
authorized for USAID direct-hire employees under the Uniform Foreign 
Service Travel Regulations. These amounts are available from the 
Contracting Officer.

                         11. Payment (Aug 1996)

    (a) Once each month, or at more frequent intervals, if approved by 
the paying office indicated on the Cover Page, the contractor may submit

completion. The contractor's claim, which includes his/her final 
settlement of compensation, shall not be paid until after the 
performance of the duties required under the terms of this contract has 
been approved by USAID. On receipt and approval of the voucher 
designated by the contractor as the ``final voucher'' submitted on Form 
SF 1034 (original) and SF 1034-A (three copies), together with a refund 
check for the balance remaining on hand of any funds which may have been

    Upon arrival in the Cooperating Country, and from time to time as 
appropriate, the contractor shall consult with the Mission Director or 
his/her authorized representative who shall provide, in writing, the 
policy the contractor shall follow in the conversion of U.S. dollars to 
local currency. This may include, but not be limited to the conversion 
of said currency through the cognizant U.S. Disbursing Officer, or

              13. Post of Assignment Privileges (July 1993)

    Privileges such as the use of APO, PX's, commissaries and officers 
clubs are established at posts abroad under agreements between the U.S. 
and host governments. These facilities are intended for and usually 
limited to members of the official U.S. establishment including the 
Embassy, USAID Mission, U.S. Information Service and the Military. 
Normally, the agreements do not permit these facilities to be made 
available to non-official Americans. However, in those cases where 
facilities are open to non-official Americans, they may be used.

                  14. Security Requirements (June 1990)

    (a) This entire provision shall apply to the extent that this 
contract involves access to classified information (``Confidential'', 
``Secret'', or ``Top Secret'') or access to administratively controlled 
information (``Limited Official Use''). Contractors that are not U.S. 
citizens shall not have access to classified or administratively 
controlled information.
    (b) The contractor (1) shall be responsible for safeguarding all 
classified or administratively controlled information in accordance with

show respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the 
Cooperating Country and not interfere in its political affairs.
    (c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this provision, the contract may be terminated under General 
Provision 16 of this contract. The Contractor recognizes the right of 
the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her immediate removal from any country 
when, in the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United 
States so require.
    (d) The Mission Director is the chief representative of USAID in the 
Cooperating Country. In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the 
total USAID Program in the Cooperating Country including certain 
administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for 
advising USAID regarding the performance of the work under the contract 
and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program. The contractor 
will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the 
statement of duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be 
under the general policy guidance of the Mission Director, and shall 
keep the Mission Director or his/her designated representative currently 
informed of the progress of the work under this contract.

                       16. Termination (Nov 1989)

    (This is an approved deviation to be used in place of the clause 
specified in FAR 52.249-12.)
    (a) The Government may terminate performance of work under this 
contract in whole or, from time to time, in part:
    (1) For cause, which may be effected immediately after establishing 
the facts warranting the termination, by giving written notice and a 
statement of reasons to the contractor in the event (i) the Contractor 
commits a breach or violation of any obligations herein contained, (ii) 
a fraud was committed in obtaining this contract, or (iii) the 
contractor is guilty (as determined by USAID) of misconduct in the 
Cooperating Country. Upon such a termination, the contractor's right to 
compensation shall cease when the period specified in such notice 
expires or the last day on which the contractor performs services 
hereunder, whichever is earlier. No costs of any kind incurred by the 
contractor after the date such notice is delivered shall be reimbursed 
hereunder except the cost of return transportation (not including travel 
allowances), if approved by the Contracting Officer. If any costs 
relating to the period subsequent to such date have been paid by USAID, 
the contractor shall promptly refund to USAID any such prepayment as 
directed by the Contracting Officer.
    (2) For the convenience of USAID, by giving not less than 15 
calendar days advance written notice to the contractor. Upon such a 
termination, contractor's right to compensation shall cease when the 
period specified in such notice expires except that the contractor shall 
be entitled to any unused vacation leave, return transportation costs 
and travel allowances and transportation of unaccompanied baggage costs 
at the rate specified in the contract and subject to the limitations 
which apply to authorized travel status.
    (3) For the convenience of USAID, when the contractor is unable to 
complete performance of his/her services under the contract by reason of 
sickness or physical or emotional incapacity based upon a certification 
of such circumstances by a duly qualified doctor of medicine approved by 
the Mission. The contract shall be deemed terminated upon delivery to 
the Contractor of a termination notice. Upon such a termination, the 
contractor shall not be entitled to compensation except to the extent of 
any unused vacation or sick leave but shall be entitled to return 
transportation, travel allowances, and unaccompanied baggage costs at 
rates specified in the contract and subject to the limitations which 
apply to authorized travel status.

                 20. Use of Pouch Facilities (July 1993)

    (a) Use of diplomatic pouch is controlled by the Department of 
State. The Department of State has authorized the use of pouch 
facilities for USAID contractors and their employees as a general 
policy, as detailed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this 
provision. However, the final decision regarding use of pouch facilities 
rests with the Embassy or USAID Mission. In consideration of the use of 
pouch facilities as hereinafter stated, the Contractor agrees to 
indemnify and hold harmless the Department of State and USAID for loss 
or damage occurring in pouch transmission.
    (1) Contractors are authorized use of the pouch for transmission and 
receipt of up to a maximum of 0.90 kilogram/2 pounds per shipment of 
correspondence and documents needed in the administration of foreign 
assistance programs.
    (2) U.S. citizen contractors are authorized use of the pouch for 
personal mail up to a maximum of 0.45 kilogram/one pound per shipment 
(but see (a)(3) below). Non-U.S. citizen Contractors are not permitted 
use of the pouch for personal mail except to the extent that such use 
may be authorized by the Chief of Mission.
    (3) Merchandise, parcels, magazines, or newspapers are not 
considered to be personal mail for purpose of this clause, and are not 
authorized to be sent or received by pouch.
    (4) Official and personal mail under paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of 
this provision, sent by pouch, should be addressed as follows:
    Individual's Name (C), U.S. Agency for International Development, 
Washington, D.C. 20523-0001.
    (5) Mail sent via the diplomatic pouch may not be in violation of 
U.S. Postal laws and may not contain material ineligible for pouch 
transmission.
    (6) Use of military postal facilities (APO/FPO) is authorized to 
U.S. contractors on the same basis as approved for direct-hire employees 
at the USAID Mission. Posts having access to APO/FPO facilities and 
using such for diplomatic pouch dispatch, may, however, accept official 
and personal mail for the pouch provided, of course, adequate postage is 
affixed when onward transmission (mail to other than USAID/W) through 
U.S. postal channels is required.
    (b) The contractor shall be responsible for compliance with these 
guidelines and limitations on use of pouch facilities.
    (c) Specific additional guidance on use of pouch facilities in 
accordance with this clause is available from the Post Communication 
Center at the Embassy or USAID Mission.

as power of attorney designees or alternate contact persons.

     22. U.S. Resident Hire Personal Services Contractor (June 1990)

    A contractor meeting the definition of a U.S. Resident Hire PSC 
contained in Section 12, General Provisions, Clause 1, Definitions, 
shall be subject to U.S. Federal Income Tax, but shall not be eligible 
for any fringe benefits (except contributions for FICA, health insurance 
and life insurance), allowances, or differentials, including but not 
limited to travel and transportation, medical, orientation, home leave, 
etc., unless such individual can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Contracting Officer that he/she has received similar benefits/allowances 
from their immediately previous employer in the Cooperating Country, or 
the Mission Director determines that payment of such benefits would be 
consistent with the Mission's policy and practice and would be in the 
best interest of the U.S. Government.

            23. Orientation and Language Training (July 1993)

    (a) Except as set forth in paragraph (b)(4) below, the Contractor 
shall receive a maximum of 2 weeks USAID orientation before travel 
overseas. The dates of orientation shall be selected by the Contractor 
and approved by the Contracting Officer from the orientation schedule 
provided by USAID.
    (b) As either set forth in the Contract Schedule, or provided in 
writing by the Contracting Officer, the following may be authorized 
taking into consideration specific job requirements, contractor's prior 
overseas experience, or unusual circumstances, in connection with

    (2) Language training,
    (3) Orientation for Contractor's dependents at contract expense.
    (4) Waiver of orientation for individual contractor.
    (c) Transportation costs and travel allowances not to exceed one 
round trip from the Contractor's residence to place of orientation and 
return will be reimbursed, pursuant to Clause 10 of the General 
Provisions, entitled ``Travel and Transportation Expenses,'' if the 
orientation is more than 80 kilometers/50 miles from the contractor's 
residence.
    Allowable salary costs during the period of orientation are also 
reimbursable.

 24. Conditions for Contracting Prior to Receipt of Security Clearance 
                               (July 1993)

    (a) U.S. Resident Hire PSC. The contractor may commence work prior 
to the completion of the security clearance. However, until such time as 
clearance is received, the contractor shall have no access to classified 
or administratively controlled materials. Further, failure to obtain 
clearance will constitute cause for contract termination in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(2) of General Provision 16 of this contract.
    (b) U.S. PSC--Non-Resident Hire. The contractor may elect to 
commence travel to post immediately to begin work prior to completion of 
the security clearance. However, until such time as security clearance 
is received, the contractor shall:
    (1) Have no access to classified or administratively controlled 
materials;
    (2) Be authorized to travel to post himself/herself only; and
    (3) Be authorized no entitlements other than those normally 
authorized for short term (less than a year) employees at post. Even if 
the contract is for one year or more, dependents may not accompany 
contractor unless at his/her expense, and transportation/storage of 
household/personal effects and motor vehicle will not be financed by 
USAID prior to the receipt of the security clearance. Upon receipt of 
clearance, the Contracting Officer will authorize reimbursement of any 
such costs borne at contractor's expense prior to clearance provided 
they are reasonable, allocable and allowable. If appropriate given the 
length of time remaining, the Contracting Officer will authorize 
dependent travel and shipment/storage of motor vehicle and effects. 
Allowances which would not be provided to short term employees will be 
authorized after clearance is received provided that the contractor is 
otherwise entitled to such benefits. Failure to obtain the security 
clearance will constitute cause for contract termination in accordance 
with paragraph (a)(2) of General Provision 16 of this contract.

          25. Medical Evacuation (MEDEVAC) Services (July 1993)

    (a) The contractor agrees to obtain medevac service coverage for 
himself/herself

[[Page 110]]

and his/her authorized dependents while performing personal services 
abroad. Coverage shall be obtained pursuant to the terms of the contract 
between USAID and USAID's medevac service provider unless exempted in 
accordance with paragraph (b).
    (b) The following are exempted from the requirements in paragraph 
(a):
    (1) Contractors and their dependents with a health insurance program 
that includes sufficient medevac coverage as approved by the Contracting 
Officer.
    (2) Contractors and their dependents located at Missions where the 
Mission Director makes a written determination to waive the requirement 
for such coverage based on findings that the quality of local medical 
services or other circumstances obviate the need for such coverage.
    (c) Information on the current medevac service provider, including 
application procedures, is available from the Contracting Officer.

                      26. Governing Law (Nov 1996)

    This contract is established under the procurement authorities of 
the United States Government and shall be interpreted in accordance with 
the body of Federal Procurement Law in the United States. This contract 
is a complete statement of the duties, compensation, benefits, leave, 
notice, termination, and the like; therefore, the laws of the country of 
performance with respect to labor and contract matters shall not apply

                 Sec. Appendix E to Chapter 7 [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. Appendix F to Chapter 7--Use of Collaborative Assistance Method for 
                          Title XII Activities

                             1. Introduction

    This appendix provides a detailed description of the collaborative 
assistance method of contracting. This is a specialized contracting 
system which may be used for contracting with educational institutions 
eligible under, and for activities authorized under, Title XII of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, under the circumstances 
described in AIDAR 715.613-71.

                               2. Purpose

    The collaborative assistance system is designed to:
    (a) Increase the joint implementation authority and responsibility 
of the contractor and the LDC;
    (b) Encourage more effective collaboration between all participating 
parties (USAID, host country, and contractor) at important stages, 
including the design stage of a technical assistance project.

                                3. Policy

    The collaborative assistance approach represents an alternative 
method for long-term technical assistance which involves professional 
collaboration with eligible Title XII institutions and LDC counterparts 
for a problem-solving type activity to develop new institutional forms 
and capabilities, to devise operating systems and policies, and to 
conduct joint research and development--including training. In such an 
activity, the difficulty in defining, in advance, precise and 
objectively verifiable contractor inputs and long-term project content 
as a basis for payment usually requires a flexible approach to project 
design, contracting, and project implementation. Such flexibility is 
also essential to the collaborative style which is responsive to LDC 
desires in problem areas of great complexity and varying uncertainty. 
Other types of technical assistance, which are usually shorter in term 
are amenable to

[[Page 111]]

more precise definition in advance, or involve closely defined and 
relatively standardized services, or are otherwise more analogous to 
commodity resource transfers, may be suitable for other contracting 
methods, e.g., certain forms of institution building, on-the-job 
training, resource surveys, etc. The collaborative assistance method is 
an approved method for providing technical assistance when used in 
accordance with the circumstances outlined above, and with the 
guidelines set forth in paragraph 4, below.

                      4. Implementation Procedures

    (a) Introduction. This paragraph 4, provides background information, 
guidelines and procedures to effect the implementation of the policy set 
forth in paragraph 3 of this appendix.
    (b) Conditions and practices. In order for this policy to work 
effectively even when the proposed activity fits the criteria described 
under Policy, there must also be:
    (1) Acceptance of the notion that the host country, in consultation 
with the contractor, is in the best position to make tactical, day-to-
day decisions on project inputs within agreed-upon limitations and 
output expectations;
    (2) Sufficient trust and respect between the Agency and the 
contractor to allow this flexible implementation authority;
    (3) A direct-hire project monitor with appropriate background to be 
knowledgeable of progress and to assist in an advisory and facilitative 
capacity, both during and between periodic reviews. In addition, the 
following important conditions must be met:
    (i) Adequate preproject communication between, and identification of 
assistance required by, the host government and USAID;
    (ii) Full joint planning and improved project design (``Joint'' as 
used herein refers to the primary parties, i.e., the collaborating 
institutions, as well as the host government and USAID. In some 
instances, it can also include other donors.);
    (iii) Careful contractor selection, i.e., matching of the 
contractor's technical and managerial capabilities to the anticipated 
requirements of the overseas activity;
    (iv) Establishment of relationships between host country, USAID and 
contractor staff to include host country leadership, flexible 
implementation authority, and effective management by the contractor;
    (v) Improved joint project evaluation, feedback, and replanning; and
    (vi) Simplified administrative procedures and greater reliance on 
in-country logistical support.
    (c) Project Stages and Contractor Involvement. In the long-term 
technical assistance projects as described above, there are four 
discrete but sometimes overlapping decision stages which take place--
with the principal contractor usually involved in the last three.
    (1) Problem analysis and project identification. After the host 
government has indicated a desire for U.S. collaboration on a particular 
problem and the USAID field mission has determined that the proposed 
activity is consistent with its program goals and priorities, 
considerable effort is usually necessary to refine further the project 
purpose and type of assistance required and provide a basis for 
contractor selection. This is a crucial step and is focused on results 
sought--on what the prospective contractor is expected to produce in 
relation to resources to be used and to project purpose. It should 
result in a clear understanding of what the LDC wants, and an overall 
plan which includes agreement on specific objectives or outputs, 
acceptable types of activities and inputs and an initial budget--
resulting in project documentation. At this step, USAID makes decisions 
it cannot delegate on what it will support and at what cost. If needed 
to supplement its direct-hire expertise, USAID can use outside 
consultants for analysis and advice but retains the ultimate decision 
for itself in collaboration with, but independent of, the requesting 
host government. (Normally, the proposed contractor for project 
definition and subsequent implementation should not have been involved 
in the problem analysis and project identification stage as a consultant 
to either the host country government, host institution, or USAID. If a 
potential contractor has been so involved, particular care must be taken 
to prevent actual or apparent organizational conflicts of interest in 
the procurement that follows. This could require at a minimum, a careful 
assessment and complete documentation of reasons for selection.)
    Normally, there will need to be some mutual interaction between the 
overall planning stage outlined here and the detailed planning and 
design work which follows in the next phase. There will usually be some 
overlap, with preliminary decisions in this stage providing a basis for 
selection of implementing agents for stage (2) which in turn proceeds 
through some preliminary planning to guide completion of stage (1) as a 
basis for long-term contracting.
    (2) Project definition. At this stage, having selected the 
implementing agent, the U.S. and LDC organizations which will be 
collaborating in carrying out the project are encouraged to work out, to 
their mutual \3/8\satisfaction, the particulars of what to do and how to 
do it (i.e., detailed project design) within the context of LDC 
leadership and responsibility and the general agreements and budget 
reached in stage (1). The emphasis here is on the technical approach to 
be utilized and the scheduling and management of project inputs. This 
may involve a short-term reconnaissance and/or an extensive period of 
detailed joint planning and feeling out of what is feasible during a 
preliminary

[[Page 112]]

operating phase of the project, possibly lasting as much as a year or 
more. This stage recognizes the importance, for the problem-solving or 
ground breaking types of technical assistance, of involving the U.S. and 
LDC implementing organizations together as soon as the detailed design 
work begins. USAID's role here is to facilitate, not direct, the joint 
planning, assure consistency with prior agreements or concur in changes, 
affirm that the implementing parties have agreed on a reasonable project 
design, and prepare or cause to be prepared the documentation required 
for stage (3), including any amendments that might be required to the 
project documentation. If and when a decision is made by the host 
government and USAID to proceed into the operating phase with the same 
contractor, the U.S. intermediary should be treated as a cooperating 
partner in the negotiation of the subsequent long-term operating 
agreement(s) with the host government, host institution and USAID.
    (3) Implementation. The results of the approach outlined in the 
stage above should include, in addition to a better understanding and 
more meaningful commitment by all parties, the following specific 
products:
    (i) A jointly developed life-of-project design which reflects the 
commitment of all parties and includes clear statements of purpose, 
principal outputs, eligible types of activity and expenditure limits, 
critical assumptions, and major progress indicators;
    (ii) A workplan and input schedule for the first two years or at 
least as long as the expenditure period for the next obligation of 
project funds;
    (iii) Provisions for any administrative support, special services or 
other inputs by the host country, contractor, and/or USAID; and
    (iv) A plan for periodic joint evaluation and review or progress and 
subsequent workplans, normally annually, with the participation of all 
parties.
    Appropriate elements of these agreements and understandings are now 
embodied in a contract for project implementation, as described in 
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of the section on Contracting Implications. This 
contract allows the U.S. intermediary to apply its judgment, reflecting 
close collaboration with its LDC colleagues, in adjusting the flow of 
USAID-financed inputs and in making other operational decisions with a 
minimum of requirements for prior USAID approvals or contract amendments 
as long as the contractor stays within the bounds of the approved 
overall plan and budget. In this phase, USAID will give technical 
assistance contractors the authority and responsibility for using their 
specialized expertise to the fullest extent in the scheduling and 
managing of project inputs.
    (4) Monitoring, joint evaluation and replanning. With increased 
flexibility and responsibility for implementation placed with the 
technical assistance contractor, the host government, and/or 
institutional collaborator, improved and timely progress reporting and 
periodic, joint, and structured reviews of results and evolving plans 
are imperative as a basis for monitoring and evaluating contractor 
performance, revalidating or adjusting project design, and for 
determining future funding levels and commitments.
    Both the contractor's annual report and the joint review should be 
structured within the framework of purpose, outputs, performance 
indicators, etc., originally established in the project indentification 
phase--as modified by detailed project design--and reflected in the 
Project Agreement and other pertinent documentation. The field review 
will normally serve as the occasion for discussing changes in or 
additions to previously agreed-to workplans as well as proposing changes 
in purpose, types of activities authorized and budgets which require 
contract amendment. Obviously, the appropriate host government, host 
institution, and senior contractor officials should be thoroughly 
involved in the process, which will have to be adapted to the conditions 
within specific projects and countries. An important USAID 
responsibility is to assure that there is appropriate host country 
participation in developing and improving project plans prior to new 
obligations of funds. The special requirements and responsibilities of 
the various parties shall also be reflected in the project agreement and 
contract terms and in guidelines on the content of annual reports, 
evaluation procedures, etc.
    Standard checking on services actually delivered as a basis for 
reimbursement will be continued including appropriate audit of 
expenditures.
    (d) Contracting implications. The principal elements of change in 
present contracting practices, as detailed below, are earlier selection 
and involvement of the prime contractor, contracting by major stages of 
project design and operations, minimizing the need for precontract 
negotiations and contract amendments and USAID approvals, and providing 
technical assistance contractors with the authority and responsibility 
needed to manage implementation within the approved program bounds.
    (1) Selection. The early involvement of the contractor in the 
definition stage of a long-term technical assistance project, after 
USAID decides what it wants to undertake in stage (1), does not alter 
the Agency's responsibility to select its contractors carefully and in 
full compliance with appropriate contracting regulations and selection 
procedures. What is required here is that contractor selection be 
carried out at an earlier stage than has sometimes been the Agency 
practice in the past or with other types of

[[Page 113]]

contracts and in anticipation that the contractor, assuming adequate 
performance, will participate in all subsequent phases until final 
completion.
    (2) Contracting stages. In contracting, the initial design stage 
should be separated from the longer term implementation stage without 
any USAID commitment to undertake the second until it has exercised its 
independent judgment based on the product of the first plus any outside 
expert appraisal it and the host country want to use.
    The long-term implementation stage itself may be further subdivided 
into contract periods which permit time between predetermined events for 
analysis, determination of new project requirements, and evaluation of 
performance prior to initiating the next phase by contract amendment/
extension. If, for any reason, such an examination does not appear to 
warrant project continuation, then termination of the project and/or 
contract would be the next step.
    (3) Flexible implementation authority. While good project design 
will eliminate or diminish many operational problems, the very nature of 
long-term technical assistance requires flexible implementation within 
agreed purposes, ultimate outputs, types of activity and available 
financing. With these key variables for USAID management control 
established, contracts should be written so as to minimize the need for 
amendments and USAID approval of changes in input particulars. This can 
be facilitated, both for the USAID, host country, institution, and the 
contractor by:
    (i) Retention of operational plan in contract and removal of 
workplan. The contract narrative will contain the life-of-the-project 
Operational Plan, consistent with the project design as developed in 
stage (2) and reflected in the project documentation (and subsequent 
amendments thereto). The Operational Plan includes a statement of the 
purpose to be achieved, the outputs to be produced by the contractor and 
the types of activities to be undertaken, the more significant 
indicators of progress, a general description of the type of inputs that 
are authorized and intended to be provided during the life of the 
project, and the overall budget.
    In order to allow adjustments at the implementation level without 
going through the contract amendment process, the detailed but short-
term workplan containing specific descriptions and scheduling of all 
inputs such as numbers and types of staff, participants, commodities, 
etc., and specific activities, will not be a part of the contract. It is 
a working document to be modified in the field when the situation 
demands. The latest version will be available as a supporting document 
to justify proposed new obligation levels. Normally, the workplan and 
derived budget will cover a rolling two year period, i.e., each year 
another yearly increment is added after review and approval.
    (ii) Budget flexibility. To support this implementation flexibility, 
contract budget or fiscal controls will be shifted from fixed line items 
for each input category to program categories, permitting the technical 
assistance contractor to adjust amounts and timing to achieve previously 
approved types of activity. This same type of flexibility should apply 
to any local currency supplied for project operations and/or contractor 
staff support. While an essential corollary to eliminating the workplan 
from the contract, this is not a unique procedure under cost 
reimbursement type contracts when the contractor has demonstrated 
adequate management capability.
    (iii) Negotiation of advance understandings. To permit university 
and international research center contractors to manage their activities 
in accordance with their own policies and procedures and thereby sharpen 
their management responsibility while achieving substantial savings in 
time and reduced documentation, USAID may negotiate advance 
understandings with its technical assistance contractors on dollar costs 
and administrative procedures that would be included by reference in its 
subsequent contracts. Upon receipt of a request from the contractor that 
their policies be reviewed and approved for usage in their contract in 
lieu of the standard terms and conditions, OP/PS/OCC, USAID/W will 
initiate negotiations of such policies in an expeditious manner. The 
approved policies will be used in all relevant relations involving the 
Agency and respective contractors in lieu of traditional contract 
standard provisions, whenever this may be appropriate. This does not 
apply to local currency costs and host government procedures which must 
be negotiated in each case.
    The purpose of the practices listed above is not only to give a 
qualified contractor the authority to adjust the composition and timing 
of inputs but to assign to it clear responsibility for managing such 
resources, as the evolving circumstances require, to achieve the agreed-
upon outputs on a cost efficient basis. It should also reduce the delay 
and paperwork involved in frequent but minor contract amendments, and 
approvals. For the agency as a whole, both in the Mission and in USAID/
W, these have involved a large workload and cost.
    (e) Role of USAID. Nothing in this appendix is intended to delegate, 
diminish or otherwise modify USAID's final responsibility for the 
prudent management of public funds and its own programs. Rather in 
withdrawing from the day-to-day involvement in and responsibility for 
the management of adjustment of the flow of inputs during the 
implementation, the best use of limited agency staff and time can be 
devoted to protecting

[[Page 114]]

the public interest in gaining maximum results from the funds 
appropriated for technical assistance by:
    (1) Seeking optimum identification in terms of LDC priorities and 
U.S. capabilities;
    (2) Mobilizing and selecting the best U.S. professional talent to 
design and carry out the project;
    (3) Monitoring what is happening to assure adequacy of processes, 
get a feel of results, assure actual delivery of inputs being financed;
    (4) Assuring that the attention of USAID's implementation agents and 
LDC colleagues stay well focused on project purpose and results to be 
achieved (outputs) and the relation to these of what is being done and 
actual results;
    (5) Providing intermediaries adequate authority and responsibility 
to adjust inputs promptly and sensitively to the evolving project 
situations.
    Attention to these considerations, and to achievements of the 
preimplementation conditions prescribed above, should greatly increase 
the chances for successful project completion and impact on a cost 
effective basis, which is the final measurement of prudent management.

  Attachment to Appendix F--Guidelines for Requests for Expressions of 
                                Interest

                      A. Length and Level of Detail

    A Request for Expression of Interest (REI) should include more than 
just a short letter expressing interest, but should not be in the detail 
of a technical proposal (RFTP). The REI is not the only source of 
information that can or should be used for selection, but at least a 
minimum level of information should be contained in each document. A ten 
page paper that responds to the selection criteria included in every REI 
should be sufficient for evaluation purposes. The selection criteria 
should specify the technical inputs required for successful execution of 
the project and normally require a response in three general areas:
    1. A description of the institution's capability to address the 
problem described in the REI.
    2. Any related experience, whether in the country or region or in 
the problem area.
    3. A demonstrable commitment of the institution to support the 
project.
    The responses should address the capability, experience, and 
commitment to the particular project.

                    B. Specific Personnel Information

    The response should specify within the areas set out in the 
selection criteria the following planning and personnel factors.
    1. The design team plan and the scope of work for each member.
    2. A list of candidates for the design team and their credentials.
    3. A list of possible candidates for long-term assignment to the 
project. (Since there has been no project design, the specific technical 
assistance slots and technical responsibilities are vague. But it is 
expected that at least half of the personnel needs can be estimated 
early in the project. The institution should make its best guess for the 
team and present to the Agency the persons or types of persons with whom 
they are likely to contract.)

                   C. Multiple Institution Submissions

    Joint effort on the part of several institutions is encouraged when 
appropriate. A single institution may submit an expression of interest 
for part of the project without knowledge of other collaborators or it 
may submit information in response to A and B of this attachment as part 
of a suggested collection of institutions. In either case, a proposed 
plan for cooperation is necessary.
    However, such joint efforts must specify the division of 
responsibilities for the planning and personnel factors indicated in B 
of this attachment. Often USAID will identify the need for cooperation 
and suggest such an effort in the REI. Even if USAID does not suggest 
collaboration, joint efforts with a description of the cooperation would 
be an appropriate way to respond to an REI.

              Sec. Appendices G-H to Chapter 7  [Reserved]


<R05>
    Sec. Appendix I to Chapter 7--USAID's Academic Publication Policy

                         1. Statement of Policy

    This is a statement of USAID policy on publication, or release to 
parties other than those specifically authorized, of unclassified 
materials gathered or developed under contracts with academic 
institutions.

                        2. Underlying Principles

    USAID favors and encourages the publication of scholarly research as 
well as the maximum availability, distribution, and use of knowledge 
developed in its program.
    This policy statement does not deal with material that is classified 
for security reasons. It does deal with considerations of national 
interest, not of sufficient gravity to warrant security classification, 
but serious enough to affect adversely the conduct of

[[Page 115]]

U.S. assistance programs. Consequently, in addition to the requirements 
of courtesy, propriety, and confidence which normally guide scholars in 
their work, there should also be consideration of the potential 
repercussions of publication on the successful execution of development 
and other cooperative programs in which the United States and foreign 
countries are involved.

                       3. Operational Definitions

    The Agency draws a distinction between two kinds of manuscripts 
which a scholar may wish to publish:
    (a) A report which is prepared and delivered to the Agency under the 
terms of the contract (a ``contract manuscript''); and
    (b) An article or book based upon experience and information gained 
under an USAID contract but not prepared or delivered under the contract 
(a ``non-contract manuscript'').
    There are two kinds of actions, to be specified in the contract, 
which the Agency can take upon notification of a contractor's desire to 
publish:
    (a) Comment only, under which USAID and the foreign government 
involved may review the manuscript, and have their comments considered 
seriously by the contractor prior to publication; and
    (b) Authorization for release, which USAID may withhold if 
reconciliation between the national interest and the author's interest 
is impossible.

                          4. Policy Statements

    (a) USAID, as a general rule, will not require an academic 
institution to obtain permission to publish the written work produced 
under a contract. It will ask for the opportunity to review the 
manuscript for comment only, prior to publication.
    In the case of a contract manuscript, USAID reserves the right to 
disclaim endorsement of the opinions expressed; if it is a noncontract 
manuscript, USAID reserves the right to disassociate itself from 
sponsorship or publication.
    (b) On the other hand, USAID may reserve the right of authorization 
for release in those exceptional cases where conditions exist making it 
reasonably foreseeable, in light of the contract's scope of work and the 
manner and place of performance, that the written work to be prepared 
and delivered under the contract may have adverse repercussions on the 
relations and programs of the United States. Where this right is 
reserved, it must be so specified in the contract. In determining where 
to reserve such right, USAID will consider all relevant factors, 
including:
    (1) The extent to which prompt and full performance of the contract 
will require access, facilitated by reason of the contract, to 
information not generally available to scholars;
    (2) The extent to which the work involves matters of political 
concern to foreign countries, particularly where any substantial part of 
the work is to be performed therein;
    (3) The extent to which, by reason of USAID's close involvement and 
cooperation in the performance of the contract, the work product may be 
so identified with USAID itself as to prevent effective disclaimer of 
USAID endorsement thereof;
    (4) The extent to which the objective of the contract is to provide 
advice to USAID or to a foreign government of immediate operational 
significance in the conduct of the USAID program or the implementation 
of governmental programs in the host country;
    (5) The desires of the host country.

                            5. Implementation

    The successful implementation of this policy on publication rests on 
a thorough understanding and acceptance of these principles by USAID and 
the prospective contractor. The actual publications provision for a 
particular contract, then, would be so worded as to reflect the 
agreement reached in the contract negotations.
    USAID's concern with noncontract manuscripts is related to the 
identification of a manuscript with the U.S. Government. This concern 
will be modified by the passage of time following termination of the 
contract.
    In the normal case of prepublication review for USAID comment, the 
institution will submit a copy of the manuscript not later than the date 
of submission to the publisher. This gives the Agency time to comment if 
it is deemed appropriate. However, in the case of review for 
authorization, timely notification of USAID's response will be given, 
consistent with the size of the manuscript and the number and location 
of the parties involved.
    The Agency will make every effort to expedite this review procedure 
in accordance with the underlying principle described at the beginning 
of this policy statement.

Sec. Appendix J to Chapter 7--Direct USAID Contracts With a Cooperating 
Country National and With a Third Country National for Personal Services 
                                 Abroad

                               1. General

    (a) Purpose. This appendix sets forth the authority, policy, and 
procedures under which USAID contracts with cooperating

[[Page 116]]

country nationals or third country nationals for personal services 
abroad.
    (b) Definitions. For the purpose of this appendix:
    (1) Personal services contract (PSC) means a contract that, by its 
express terms or as administered, make the contractor personnel appear, 
in effect, Government employees (see FAR 37.104).
    (2) Employer-employee relationship means an employment relationship 
under a service contract with an individual which occurs when, as a 
result of (i) the contract's terms or (ii) the manner of its 
administration during performance, the contractor is subject to the 
relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government officer or 
employee.
    (3) Non-personal services contract means a contract under which the 
personnel rendering the services are not subject either by the 
contract's terms or by the manner of its administration, to the 
supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the 
Government and its employees.
    (4) Independent contractor relationship means a contract 
relationship in which the contractor is not subject to the supervision 
and control prevailing in relationships between the Government and its 
employees. Under these relationships, the Government does not normally 
supervise the performance of the work, or the manner in which it is to 
be performed, control the days of the week or hours of the day in which 
it is to be performed, or the location of performance.
    (5) Contractor means a cooperating country national or a third 
country national who has entered into a contract pursuant to this 
appendix.
    (6) Cooperating country means the country in which the employing 
USAID Mission is located.
    (7) Cooperating country national (CCN) means an individual who is a 
cooperating country citizen or a non-cooperating country citizen 
lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the cooperating country.
    (8) Third Country National (TCN) means an individual
    (i) Who is neither a citizen nor a permanent legal resident alien of 
the United States nor of the country to which assigned for duty, and
    (ii) Who is eligible for return to his/her home country or country 
of recruitment at U.S. Government expense [see Section 12, General 
Provision 9 paragraph (n)].

                             2. Legal Basis

    (a) Section 635(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as 
amended, hereinafter referred to as the ``FAA'', provides the Agency's 
contracting authority.
    (b) Section 636(a)(3) of the FAA authorizes the Agency to enter into 
personal services contracts with individuals for personal services 
abroad and provides further that such individuals ``* * * shall not be 
regarded as employees of the U.S. Government for the purpose of any law 
administered by the Civil Service Commission.''\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\The Civil Service Commission is now the Federal Office of 
Personnel Management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            3. Applicability

    (a) This appendix applies to all personal services contracts with 
CCNs or TCNs to provide assistance abroad under Section 636(a)(3) of the 
FAA.
    (b) This appendix does not apply to:
    (1) Contracts for non-personal services with TCNs or CCNs; such 
contracts are covered by the basic text of the FAR and AIDAR.
    (2) Personal services contracts with U.S. citizens or U.S. resident 
aliens for personal services abroad; such contracts are covered by 
Appendix D of this chapter.
    (3) Appointments of experts and consultants as USAID direct-hire 
employees; such appointments are covered by USAID Handbook 25, 
Employment and Promotion or superseding Chapters of the Automated 
Directive System (ADS).

                                4. Policy

    (a) General. USAID may finance, with either program or operating 
expense (OE) funds, the cost of personal services as part of the 
Agency's program of foreign assistance by entering into a direct 
contract with a CCN or a TCN for personal services abroad.
    (1) Program funds. Under the authority of Section 636(h) of the FAA, 
program funds may be obligated for periods up to five years where 
necessary and appropriate to the accomplishment of the tasks involved.
    (2) Operating expense funds. Pursuant to USAID budget policy, OE 
funded salaries and other recurrent cost items may be forward funded for 
a period of up to three (3) months beyond the fiscal year in which these 
funds were obligated. Non-recurring cost items may be forward funded for 
periods not to exceed twenty-four (24) months where necessary and 
appropriate to accomplishment of the work.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\If there is a need, these contracts may be written for 5 years 
but only funded as outlined above.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) Limitations on Personal Services Contracts.
    (1) Personal services contracts may only be used when adequate 
supervision is available.
    (2) Personal services contracts may be used for commercial 
activities. Commercial activities provide a product or service which 
could be obtained from a commercial source. See Attachment A of OMB 
Circular A-76 for a representative list of such activities.

[[Page 117]]

    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of USAID directives, 
regulations or delegations, Cooperating Country or Third Country 
Nationals may be delegated or assigned any authority, duty or 
responsibility, delegated or assigned U.S. citizen direct-hire employees 
(USDH employees) except that:
    a. They may not supervise USDH employees of USAID or other U.S. 
Government agencies. They may supervise USPSCs and non-U.S. citizen 
employees.
    b. They may not be designated a Contracting Officer or delegated 
authority to sign obligating or subobligating documents.
    c. They may represent the agency, except that communications that 
reflect a final policy, planning or budget decision of the agency must 
be cleared by a USDH employee.
    d. They may participate in personnel selection matters but may not 
be delegated authority to make a final decision on personnel selection.
    e. Services which involve security classified material.
    (4) Exceptions. Exceptions to the limitations in (b)(3) must be 
approved by the Assistant Administrator for Management (AA/M).
    (c) Conditions of Employment.
    (1) General. For the purpose of any law administered by the U.S. 
Office of Personnel Management, USAID PSC contractors are not to be 
regarded as employees of the U.S. Government, are not included under any 
retirement or pension program of the U.S. Government, and are not 
eligible for the Incentive Awards Program covered by Uniform State/
USAID/USIA regulations. Each USAID Mission is expected to participate in 
the Joint Special Embassy Incentive Awards Program. The program is 
administered by a joint committee which establishes procedures for 
submission, review and approval of proposed awards. Other than these 
exceptions, CCNs and TCNs who are hired for work in a cooperating 
country under PSCs generally will be extended the same benefits and be 
subject to the same restrictions as Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) 
employed as direct-hires by the USAID Mission.
    (2) Compensation. (i) It is USAID's general policy (see AIDAR 
722.170) that PSC compensation may not, without the approval of the 
Mission Director or Assistant Administrator, exceed the prevailing 
compensation paid to personnel performing comparable work in the 
cooperating country. Compensation for TCN or CCN personal services 
contractors set in accordance with the provisions of 4c(2)(ii) below 
satisfies this requirement.
    (ii) In accordance with Section 408(a)(1) of the Foreign Service Act 
of 1980, a local compensation plan forms the basis for all compensation 
payments to FSNs which includes CCNs and TCNs. The plan is each post's 
official system of position classification and pay, consisting of the 
local salary schedule which includes salary rates, statements 
authorizing fringe benefit payments, and other pertinent facets of 
compensation for TCNs and CCNs, and the local position classification 
system as reflected in the Local Employee Position Classification 
Handbook (LEPCH) or equivalent in effect at the Mission. Compensation 
for PSCs will be in accordance with the local compensation plan, to the 
extent that it covers employees of the type or category being employed, 
unless the Mission Director determines otherwise. If the Mission 
Director determines that compensation in accordance with the local plan 
would be inappropriate in a particular instance, then compensation will 
be set in accordance with (in order of preference):
    (A) Any other Mission policies on foreign national employee 
compensation; or
    (B) Paragraphs 4(c) (d), (e), (g), (h), and (i) of Appendix D. When 
compensation is set in accordance with this exception, the record shall 
be documented in writing with a justification prepared by the requesting 
office and approved by the Mission Director.
    (iii) The earning of leave (annual and sick), allowances and 
differential (if applicable), salaries and all other related benefits 
cannot be enumerated in this Appendix as they vary from Mission to 
Mission and are based upon the compensation plan for each.
    (iv) Unless otherwise authorized, the currency in which compensation 
is paid to contractors shall be in accordance with the prevailing local 
compensation practice of the post.
    (v) CCN and TCN contractors are eligible for allowances and 
differential on the same basis as direct-hire FSN employees under the 
post compensation plan.
    (vi) A USAID PSC who is a spouse of a current or retired U.S. Civil 
Service, U.S. Foreign Service, or U.S. military service member, and who 
is covered by their spouse's government health or life insurance policy, 
is ineligible for a contribution towards the costs of annual health and 
life insurance.
    (vii) Retired CCNs and TCNs may be awarded personal services 
contracts without any reduction in or offset against their Government 
annuity.
    (3) Incentives Awards. (i) All Cooperating Country Nationals direct-
hire and Personal Services Contractors (PSCs) and Third Country 
Nationals (PSCs) of the Foreign Affairs Community are eligible for the 
Joint Special Embassy Incentive Awards Program.
    (ii) Meritorious Step Increases for USAID FSN PSCs may be authorized 
provided the granting of such increases is the general practice locally.
    (iii) The Joint Country Awards Committee administers each post's 
(Embassy) award program, including establishment of procedures for 
submission, review and approval of proposed awards.

[[Page 118]]

    (4) Training. CCN and TCN PSCs are eligible for most of the training 
courses offered in the Training Course Schedule. However, applications 
will be processed on a case-by-case basis and are required to be 
approved by the Contracting Officer.

              5. Soliciting for Personal Services Contracts

    (a) Technical Officer's Responsibilities. The Technical Officer will 
prepare a written detailed statement of duties and a statement of 
minimum qualifications to cover the position being recruited for; the 
statement shall be included in the procurement request. The procurement 
request shall also include the following additional information as a 
minimum:
    (1) The specific foreign location(s) where the work is to be 
performed, including any travel requirements (with an estimate of 
frequency);
    (2) The length of the contract, with beginning and ending dates, 
plus any options for renewal or extension;
    (3) The basic education, training, experience, and skills required 
for the position;
    (4) A certification from the officer in the Mission responsible for 
the LEPCH or equivalent that the position has been reviewed and is 
properly classified as to a title, series and grade in accordance with 
the LEPCH. If the position does not fall within the LEPCH or equivalent 
system, and estimate of compensation based on subparagraphs 4(c)(2)(ii) 
(A) or (B) of this Appendix after consultations or in coordination with 
the contract officer or executive officer;
    (5) A list of Government or host country furnished items (e.g., 
housing).
    (b) Contracting Officer's Responsibilities. (1) The Contracting 
Officer will prepare the solicitation for personal services which shall 
contain:
    (i) Three sets of certified biographical data and salary history. 
(Upon receipt, one copy of the above information shall be forwarded to 
the Project Officer);
    (ii) A detailed statement of duties or a completed position 
description for the position being recruited for;
    (iii) A copy of the prescribed contract Cover Page, Contract 
Schedule, and General Provisions as well as the FAR Clause to be 
included in full text and a list of those to be incorporated by 
reference; and
    (iv) A copy of General Notice entitled ``Employee Review of the New 
Standards of Conduct'' dated October 30, 1992.
    (2) The Contracting Officer shall comply with the limitations of 
AIDAR 706.302-70(c) as detailed in paragraph 5(c) below.
    (c) Competition. (1) Under AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1), Personal Services 
Contracts are exempt from the requirements for full and open competition 
with two limitations that must be observed by Contracting Officers:
    (i) Offers are to be requested from as many potential offerors as is 
practicable under the circumstances, and
    (ii) a justification supporting less than full and open competition 
must be prepared in accordance with FAR 6.303.
    (2) A class justification was approved by the USAID Procurement 
Executive to satisfy the requirements of AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2) for a 
justification in accordance with FAR 6.303. Use of this class 
justification for Personal Services Contracts with Cooperating Country 
Nationals and Third Country Nationals is subject to the following 
conditions:
    (i) New contracts are publicized consistent with Mission/Embassy 
practice on announcement of direct hire FSN positions. Renewals or 
extensions with the same individual for continuing service do not need 
to be publicized.
    (ii) A copy of the class justification (which was distributed to all 
USAID Contracting Officers via Contract Information Bulletin) must be 
included in the contract file, together with a written statement, signed 
by the Contracting Officer, that the contract is being awarded pursuant 
to AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(1); that the conditions for use of this class 
justification have been met; and that the cost of the contract is fair 
and reasonable. If the conditions in paragraphs (2)(i) and (ii) are not 
followed, the Contracting Officer must prepare a separate justification 
as required under AIDAR 706.302-70(c)(2).
    (3) Since the award of a personal services contract is based on 
technical qualifications, not price, and since the biographical data and 
salary history are used to solicit for such contracts, FAR Subparts 15.4 
and 15.5 are inappropriate and shall not be used. Instead, the 
solicitation and selection procedures outlined in this Appendix shall 
govern.

               6. Negotiating a Personal Services Contract

    Negotiating a Personal Services Contract is significantly different 
from negotiating a nonpersonal services contract because it establishes 
an employer-employee relationship; therefore, the selection and 
negotiations procedures are more akin to the personal selection 
procedures.
    (a) Technical Officer's Responsibilities. The Technical Officer 
shall be responsible for reviewing and evaluating the applications 
received in response to the solicitation issued by the Contracting 
Officer. If deemed appropriate, interviews may be conducted with the 
applicants before the final selection is submitted to the Contracting 
Officer.
    (b) Contracting Officer's Responsibilities.
    (1) The Contracting Officer shall forward a copy of biographical 
data and salary history received under the solicitation to the Technical 
Officer for evaluation.
    (2) On receipt of the Technical Officer's recommendation, the 
Contracting Officer

[[Page 119]]

shall conduct negotiations with the recommended applicant. The terms and 
conditions of the contract will normally be in accordance with the local 
compensation plan which forms the basis for all compensation on payments 
paid to FSNs which includes CCNs and TCNs.
    (3) The Contracting Officer shall use the certified salary history 
on the certified statement of biographical data and salary history as

Personal Services Contracts, provided that the amount of the contract 
does not exceed the contracting authority that has been redelegated to 
them. See AIDAR 701.601. In executing a personal service contract, the

of minimum qualifications from the technical office requesting the 
services, and is suitable for a personal services contract in that:
    (1) Performance of the proposed work requires or is best suited for 
an employer-employee relationship, and is thus not suited to the use of 
a non-personal services contract;
    (2) The scope of work does not require performance of any function 
normally reserved for direct-hire Federal employees (under paragraph 
4(b) of this Appendix); and
    (3) There is no apparent conflict of interest involved (if the 
Contracting Officer believes that a conflict of interest may exist, the 
question should be referred to the cognizant legal counsel);

open competition for Personal Services Contracts abroad; see paragraph 
5(c) of this Appendix);
    (e) The standard contract format prescribed for a Cooperating 
Country National and a Third Country National personal services contract 
(Sections 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 of this Appendix as appropriate) is 
used, or that any necessary deviations are processed as required by

    (h) The contract has been signed by the Contracting Officer and the 
contractor, and fully executed copies are properly distributed;
    (i) The following clearances, approvals and forms have been 
obtained, properly completed, and placed in the contract file before the 
contract is signed by both parties:
    (1) Security clearance to the extent required by USAID Handbook 6, 
Security or other superseding Chapters of the Automated Directives 
System;
    (2) Mission, host country, and technical office clearance, as 
appropriate;
    (3) Medical clearance(s) based on a full medical examination(s) and 
statement of medical opinion by a licensed physician. The physician's 
medical opinion must be in the possession of the Contracting Officer 
prior to signature of contract. If a TCN is recruited, medical clearance 
requirements apply to the contractor and each dependent who is 
authorized to accompany the contractor;
    (4) The approval for any salary in excess of ES-6, in accordance 
with Appendix G of this chapter;
    (5) A copy of the class justification or other appropriate

    (j) The position description is classified in accordance with the 
LEPCH, and the proposed salary is consistent with the local compensation 
plan or the alternate procedures established in 4(c)(2)(ii) above;
    (k) Funds for the contract are properly obligated to preclude 
violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. 134 (the Contracting

appropriate accounting office prior to its release for the signature of 
the selected contractor);
    (l) The contractor receives and understands USAID General Notice 
entitled ``Employee Review of the New Standards of Conduct'' dated 
October 30, 1992 and a copy is attached to each contract, as provided

for duty;
    (n) A copy of a Checklist for Personal Services Contractors which 
may be in the form set out above or another form convenient for the 
contracting officer, provided that a form containing all of the 
information described

[[Page 120]]

in this paragraph 7 shall be prepared for each PSC and placed in the 
contract file;
    (o) In consultation with the regional legal advisor and/or the 
regional contracting officer, the contract is modified by deleting from 
the General Provisions (Sections 12 and 13 of this Appendix) the 
inapplicable clause(s) by a listing in the Schedule; and
    (p) The block entitled, ``Acquisition and Assistance Request 
Document'' on the Cover Page of the contract format is completed by

                          8. Contracting Format

Provisions and FAR Clauses for personal service contracts for TCNs and 
CCNs covered by this Appendix are included as follows:

    11. ``Optional Schedule'' for a Contract with a Cooperating Country

recurring cost funded contracts. It should be noted that the Optional 
Schedule eliminates the need to amend the contract each time funds are 
obligated. However, the Contracting Officer is required to amend each 
contract not less than twice during a 12 month period to ensure that the 
contract record of obligations is up to date and agrees with the figures 
in the master funding document.]

    [For use in both CCN and TCN Contracts as appropriate].
    (a) General. The contractor will be reimbursed in currency 
consistent with the prevailing practice at post and at the rates 
established by the Mission Director for authorized travel in the 
cooperating country in connection with duties directly referable to work 
under this contract. In the absence of such established rates, the 
contractor shall be reimbursed for actual costs of authorized travel in 
the cooperating country if not provided by the cooperating government or 
the Mission in connection with duties directly referable to work 
hereunder, including travel allowances at rates prescribed by USAID 
Handbook 22, ``Foreign Service Travel Regulations'' or superseding ADS 
Chapters as from time to time amended. The Executive or Administrative 
Officer at the Mission may furnish Transportation Requests (TR's) for 
transportation authorized by this contract which is payable in local 
currency or is to originate outside the United States. When 
transportation is not provided by Government issued TR, the contractor 
shall procure the transportation, and the costs will be reimbursed. The 
following paragraphs provide specific guidance and limitations on 
particular items of cost.
    (b) International Travel. For travel to and from post of assignment 
the TCN contractor shall be reimbursed for travel costs and travel 
allowances from place of residence in the country of recruitment (or 
other location provided that the cost of such travel does not exceed the 
cost of the travel from the place of residence) to the post of duty in 
the cooperating country and return to place of residence in the country 
of recruitment (or other location provided that the cost of such travel 
does not exceed the cost of travel from the post of duty in the 
cooperating country to the contractor's residence) upon completion of 
services by the individual. Reimbursement for travel will be in 
accordance with USAID's established policies and procedures for its CCN 
and TCN direct-hire employees and the provisions of this contract, and 
will be limited to the cost of travel by the most direct and expeditious 
route. If the contract is for longer than one year and the contractor 
does not complete one full year at post of duty (except for reasons 
beyond his/her control), the cost of going to and from the post of duty 
for the contractor and his/her dependents are not reimbursable 
hereunder. If the contractor serves more than one year but less than the 
required service in the cooperating country (except for reasons beyond 
his/her control) costs of going to the post of duty are reimbursable 
hereunder but the cost of going from post of duty to the contractor's 
permanent, legal place of residence at the time he or she was employed 
for work under this contract are not reimbursable under this contract 
for the contractor and his/her dependents. When travel is by economy 
class accommodations, the contractor will be reimbursed for the cost of 
transporting up to 10 kilograms/22 pounds of accompanied personal 
baggage per traveler in addition to that regularly allowed with the 
economy ticket provided that the total number of pounds of baggage does 
not exceed that regularly allowed for first class travelers. Travel 
allowances for travelers shall not be in excess of the rates authorized 
in the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) 
hereinafter referred to as the Standardized Regulations--as from time to 
time amended, for not more than the travel time required by scheduled 
commercial air carrier using the most expeditious route. One stopover 
enroute for a period of not to exceed 24 hours is allowable when the 
traveler uses economy class accommodations for a trip of 14 hours or 
more of scheduled duration. Such stopover shall not be authorized when 
travel is by indirect route or is delayed for the convenience of the 
traveler. Per diem during such stopover shall be paid in accordance with 
the Federal Travel Regulations as from time to time amended.
    (c) Local Travel.--Reimbursement for local travel in connection with 
duties directly referable to the contract shall not be in excess of the 
rates established by the Mission Director for the travel costs of 
travelers in the Cooperating Country. In the absence of such established 
rates the contractor shall be reimbursed for actual travel costs in the 
Cooperating Country by the Mission, including travel allowances at rates 
not in excess of those prescribed by the Standardized Regulations.
    (d) Indirect Travel for Personal Convenience of a TCN. When travel 
is performed by an indirect route for the personal convenience of the 
traveler, the allowable costs of such travel will be computed on the 
basis of the cost of allowable air fare via the direct usually traveled 
route. If such costs include fares for air or ocean travel by foreign 
flag carriers, approval for indirect travel by such foreign flag 
carriers must be obtained from the Contracting Officer or the Mission 
Director before such travel is undertaken, otherwise only that portion 
of travel accomplished by the United States-flag carriers will be 
reimbursable within the above limitation of allowable costs.
    (e) Limitation on Travel by TCN Dependents. Travel costs and 
allowances will be allowed

[[Page 129]]

for authorized dependents of the contractor and such costs shall be 
reimbursed for travel from place of abode in the country of recruitment 
to the assigned station in the Cooperating Country and return, only if 
the dependent remains in the Cooperating Country for at least 9 months 
or one-half of the required tour of duty of the contract, whichever is 
greater, except as otherwise authorized hereunder for education, 
medical, or emergency visitation travel. Dependents of the TCN 
contractor must return to the country of recruitment or home country 
within thirty days of the termination or completion of the contractor's 
employment, otherwise such travel will not be reimbursed under this 
contract.
    (f) Delays Enroute. The contractor may be granted reasonable delays 
enroute while in travel status when such delays are caused by events 
beyond the control of the contractor and are not due to circuitous 
routing. It is understood that if delay is caused by physical 
incapacitation, he/she shall be eligible for such sick leave as provided 
under the ``Leave and Holidays'' clause of this contract.
    (g) Travel by Privately Owned Automobile (POV). If travel by POV is 
authorized in the contract schedule or approved by the Contracting 
Officer, the contractor shall be reimbursed for the cost of travel 
performed in his/her POV at a rate not to exceed that authorized in the 
Federal Travel Regulations plus authorized per diem for the employee 
and, if the POV is being driven to or from the cooperating country as 
authorized under the contract, for each of the authorized dependents 
traveling in the POV, provided that the total cost of the mileage and 
per diem paid to all authorized travelers shall not exceed the total 
constructive cost of fare and normal per diem by all authorized 
travelers by surface common carrier or authorized air fare, whichever is 
less.
    (h) Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation. [For TCNs 
only]. Emergency transportation costs and travel allowances while 
enroute, as provided in this section, will be reimbursed not to exceed 
amounts authorized by the Foreign Service Travel Regulations for FSN 
direct-hire employees in like circumstances under the following 
conditions:
    (1) The costs of going from post of duty in the cooperating country 
to another approved location for the contractor and authorized 
dependents and returning to post of duty, subject to the prior written 
approval of the Mission Director, when such travel is necessary for one 
of the following reasons:
    (i) Need for medical care beyond that available within the area to 
which contractor is assigned.
    (ii) Serious effect on physical or mental health if residence is 
continued at assigned post of duty.
    (iii) Serious illness, injury, or death of a member of the 
contractor's immediate family or a dependent, including preparation and 
return of the remains of a deceased contractor or his/her dependents.
    (2) Emergency evacuation when ordered by the principal U.S. 
Diplomatic Officer in the cooperating country. Transportation and travel 
allowances at safe haven and the transportation of household effects and 
automobile or storage thereof when authorized by the Mission Director, 
shall be payable in accordance with established Government regulations.
    (3) The Mission Director may also authorize emergency or irregular 
travel and transportation in other situations when in his/her opinion 
the circumstances warrant such action. The authorization shall include 
the kind of leave to be used and appropriate restrictions as to time 
away from post, transportation of personal and household effects, etc.
    (i) Country of Recruitment Travel and Transportation. [For TCNs 
only]. The contractor shall be reimbursed for actual transportation 
costs and travel allowances in the country of recruitment as authorized 
in the Schedule or approved in advance by the Contracting Officer or the 
Mission Director. Transportation costs and travel allowances shall not 
be reimbursed in any amount greater than the cost of, and time required 
for, economy-class commercial-scheduled air travel by the most 
expeditious route except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h) above, 
unless economy air travel is not available and the contractor adequately 
documents this to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer in 
documents submitted with the voucher.
    (j) Rest and Recuperation Travel. [For TCNs only].
    If approved in writing by the Mission Director, the contractor and 
his/her dependents shall be allowed rest and recuperation travel on the 
same basis as direct-hire TCN employees and their dependents at the post 
under the local compensation plan.
    (k) Transportation of Personal Effects (Excluding Automobiles and 
Household Goods). [For TCNs only].
    (1) General. Transportation costs will be paid on the same basis as 
for direct-hire employees at post serving the same length tour of duty, 
as authorized in the schedule. Transportation, including packing and 
crating costs, will be paid for shipping from contractor's residence in 
the country of recruitment or other location, as approved by the 
Contracting Officer (provided that the cost of transportation does not 
exceed the cost from the contractor's residence) to post of duty in the 
cooperating country and return to the country of recruitment or other 
location provided the cost of transportation of the

[[Page 130]]

personal effects of the contractor not to exceed the limitations in 
effect for such shipments for USAID direct-hire employees in accordance 
with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations in effect at the time 
shipment is made. These limitations may be obtained from the Contracting 
Officer. The cost of transporting household goods shall not exceed the 
cost of packing, crating, and transportation by surface common carrier.
    (2) Unaccompanied Baggage. Unaccompanied baggage is considered to be 
those personal belongings needed by the traveler immediately upon 
arrival of the contractor and dependents. To permit the arrival of 
effects to coincide with the arrival of the contractor and dependents, 
consideration should be given to advance shipments of unaccompanied 
baggage. The contractor will be reimbursed for costs of shipment of 
unaccompanied baggage (in addition to the weight allowance for household 
effects) not to exceed the limitations in effect for USAID direct-hire 
employees in accordance with the Foreign Service Travel Regulations in 
effect when shipment is made. These limitations are available from the 
Contracting Officer. This unaccompanied baggage may be shipped as air 
freight by the most direct route between authorized points of origin and 
destination regardless of the modes of travel used.
    (l) Reduced Rates on U.S.-Flag Carriers. Reduced rates on U.S.-flag 
carriers are in effect for shipments of household goods and personal 
effects of USAID contractors between certain locations. These reduced 
rates are available provided the shipper furnishes to the carrier at the 
time of the issuance of the Bill of Lading documentary evidence that the 
shipment is for the account of USAID. The Contracting Officer will, on 
request, furnish to the contractor current information concerning the 
availability of a reduced rate with respect to any proposed shipment. 
The contractor will not be reimbursed for shipments of household goods 
or personal effects in amounts in excess of the reduced rates which are 
available in accordance with the foregoing.
    (m) Transportation of things. [For TCNs Only]. Where U.S. flag 
vessels are not available, or their use would result in a significant 
delay, the contractor may obtain a release from the requirement to use 
U.S. flag vessels from the Transportation Division, Office of 
Procurement, U.S. Agency for International Development, Washington, DC 
20523-1419, or the Mission Director, as appropriate, giving the basis 
for the request.
    (n) Repatriation Travel. [For TCNs Only]. Notwithstanding other 
provisions of this Clause 9, a TCN must return to the country of 
recruitment or to the TCN's home country within 30 days after 
termination or completion of employment or forfeit all right to 
reimbursement for repatriation travel. The return travel obligation 
[repatriation travel] assumed by the U.S. Government may have been the 
obligation of another employer in the area of assignment if the employee 
has been in substantially continuous employment which provided for the 
TCN's return to home country or country from which recruited.
    (o) Storage of household effects. [For TCNs Only]. The cost of 
storage charges (including packing, crating, and drayage costs) in the 
country of recruitment of household goods of regular employees will be 
permitted in lieu of transportation of all or any part of such goods to 
the Cooperating Country under paragraph (k) above provided that the 
total amount of effects shipped to the Cooperating Country or stored in 
the country of recruitment shall not exceed the amount authorized for 
USAID direct-hire employees under the Foreign Service Travel 
Regulations. These amounts are available from the Contracting Officer.

contractor may submit such written documentation in a form acceptable to 
Mission policy and practice as required for other personal services 
contractors and as directed by the Mission Controller or paying office. 
The documentation will also provide information required to be filed 
under cooperating country laws to permit withholding by USAID of funds, 
if required, as described in the clause of these General Provisions 
entitled Social Security and Cooperating Country Taxes.
    (b) Any other payments due under this contract shall be as 
prescribed by Mission policy for the type of payment being made.

part of the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program and agrees that his/her 
duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate 
with the responsibilities which this entails. Favorable relations 
between the Mission and the Cooperating Government as well as with the 
people of the cooperating country require that the contractor shall show 
respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the 
cooperating country and not become involved in any illegal political 
activities.
    (b) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph 
(a), the contract may be terminated pursuant to the General Provision of

under the general policy guidance of the Mission Director and shall keep 
the Mission Director or his/her designated representative currently 
informed of the progress of the work under this contract.

the contractor of a termination notice. Upon such a termination, the 
contractor shall not be entitled to compensation except to the extent of

rates specified in the contract and subject to the limitations which 
apply to authorized travel status.

    [For TCNs only].

[[Page 132]]

    Privileges such as the use of APO, PX's, commissaries and officer's

U.S. and host governments. These facilities are intended for and usually 
limited to U.S. citizen members of the official U.S. Mission including 
the Embassy, USAID, Peace Corps, U.S. Information Services and the 
Military. Normally, the agreements do not permit these facilities to be

[49 FR 12583, Mar. 29, 1984, as amended at 63 FR 69217, Dec. 16, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 801.103  Authority.

    The VAAR and any amendments thereto are issued by the Secretary of

<R05>
Sec. 801.103-70  Exclusions.

Sec. 801.104  Applicability.

    (a) The FAR and the VAAR apply to all acquisitions of the Department

contracting activities. Such issuances may include delegations of 
authority, review and approval for acquisition action up to the dollar 
level delegated to that contracting activity by this regulation as well 
as providing procedural guidance for users. Such issuances will be the 
minimum necessary to provide a logical implementation of FAR and VAAR 
requirements and will be internal to the facility, i.e., it will not 
specify reporting/recordkeeping requirements for the public (see 
801.301-70(b)).

[49 FR 12583, Mar. 29, 1984, as amended at 52 FR 28559, July 31, 1987;

objective applies to the Department of Veterans Affairs acquisition 
system.
    (b)(1) Contractors will not be requested to maintain systems of 
records unless prescribed in FAR or this VAAR. A deviation to this 
prohibition may be processed in accordance with 801.403 in order to 
allow the contracting officer to require contractor reporting or 
recordkeeping beyond that prescribed in FAR and VAAR. The request for 
deviation will clearly specify what information or recordkeeping will be 
required and why it is required. The request will be signed by the head 
of the contracting activity.
    (2) The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel 
Management (95) will review the request and upon concurrence will 
likewise submit the request to Office of Management

circumstances warranting the deviation and nature of the deviation.

[49 FR 12583, Mar. 29, 1984, as amended at 52 FR 49016, Dec. 29, 1987; 
54 FR 31962, Aug. 3, 1989]

      Subpart 801.6_Career Development, Contracting Activity, and 
                            Responsibilities


<R05>
Sec. 801.601  General.

    (a) This subpart establishes general contracting officer authority 
and responsibility. However, other provisions in both the FAR and the 
VAAR contain some contracting officer limitations and it is incumbent 
upon each contracting officer to be aware of those limitations.

[[Page 140]]

    (b) Personnel, other than those designated in 801.602, may determine 
quality, quantity and delivery requirements for items or services to be 
purchased. However, under no circumstances will individuals who have not 
been delegated contracting authority commit the Government for purchases 
of supplies, equipment or services. Individuals making such commitments 
may be held financially liable for the amount of the obligation.


<R05>
Sec. 801.602  Contracting officers.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, VA regulations, VAAR and 
FAR, the authority vested in the Secretary to do the following is 
delegated to the Senior Procurement Executive and is further delegated 
to the Procurement Executive:
    (1) Execute, award, and administer contracts, purchase orders, and 
other agreements (including interagency agreements) for the expenditure 
of funds involved in the acquisition of personal property, service 
(including architect-engineer services), construction, issuing 
Government bills of lading, and for the sale of personal property, 
leases, sales agreements and other transactions;
    (2) Prescribe and publish acquisition policies and procedures;
    (3) Establish clear lines of contracting authority;
    (4) Manage and enhance career development of the procurement work 
force;
    (5) Examine, in coordination with the Office of Federal Procurement 
Policy, the procurement system to determine specific areas where 
Governmentwide performance standards should be established and applied, 
and to participate in the development of Governmentwide procurement 
policies, regulations and standards; and,
    (6) Oversee the competition advocate program.
    (b) Further delegation to execute, award, and administer contracts, 
purchase orders and other agreements will be made in accordance with the 
Contracting Officer Certification Program as prescribed in (VAAR) 48 CFR 
801.670 and 801.690.

[61 FR 1526, Jan. 22, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 801.602-2  Responsibilities.

    (a) In the administration of a contract, many problems can and do 
arise that make the advice and assistance of the General Counsel either 
desirable or necessary. The final decision as to the action to be taken, 
however, must be made by the contracting officer in each instance. To 
reduce to the absolute minimum the possibility of litigation resulting 
from his/her decision, the contracting officer shall, except as provided 
in paragraph (c) of this section, submit the problem through channels in 
sufficient detail to the General Counsel for advice or assistance.
    (b) While legal review and concurrence of the General Counsel is 
required prior to a default termination, in some cases where a quick 
response is necessary, this review can be expedited by express mailing 
or telefaxing the default letter and related documents which are 
required to make an evaluation directly to the General Counsel (025). 
The default termination letter should contain, at a minimum, the 
following:
    (1) The proposed termination (FAR 49.102);
    (2) An explanation of what necessitated the default, including the 
reasons why the contracting officer considers the contractor to be in 
default;
    (3) A statement that the factors set forth in FAR 49.402-3(f) have 
been fully considered; and
    (4) Final decision language and appeal rights.
    (c) Contracts containing a mutual termination clause may be 
terminated without reference to the General Counsel.

[49 FR 12583, Mar. 29, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 31962, Aug. 3, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 801.602-3  Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

    (a) Contracting officers shall not ratify contractual commitments 
made by other VA personnel without prior approval as prescribed below. 
Such unauthorized commitments include commitments made by other 
contracting officers which exceed their respective contracting authority 
as well as unauthorized commitments made by individuals lacking 
contracting authority.

[[Page 141]]

    (1) At field stations, for supplies, services and construction, the 
approving authority is the director of the field facility concerned.
    (2) For central office contracting officers, for supplies, services, 
and construction, the approving authorities are the heads of the 
administrations and directors of the staff offices concerned, and the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management.
    (3) For acquisitions of leasehold interest in real property the 
approving authority is:
    (i) The Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office of Facilities 
Management, for 1-5,000 square feet, and for 1-100 parking spaces 
costing less than $50,000 per annum.
    (ii) The Assistant Secretary for Management for 5,001-20,000 square 
feet, and for parking spaces exceeding 100 which cost less than $100,000 
per annum.
    (iii) The Deputy Secretary for 20,001 square feet and above, and for 
parking spaces exceeding 100 which cost more than $100,000 per annum.
    (4) This approval authority shall not be redelegated.
    (b) Requests received by contracting officers for ratification of 
commitments made by personnel lacking contracting authority shall be 
processed as follows:
    (1) The individual who made the unauthorized contractual commitment 
shall furnish the contracting officer all records and documents 
concerning the commitment and a complete written statement of facts, 
including, but not limited to, a statement as to why the procurement 
office was not utilized, why the proposed contractor was selected and a 
list of other sources considered, description of work to be performed or 
products to be furnished, estimated or agreed contract price, citation 
of appropriation available, and a statement of whether the contractor 
has commenced performance.
    (2) The contracting officer will review the file and forward it to 
the approving authority specified in paragraph (a) of this section with 
any comments or information which should be considered in evaluation of 
the request for ratification. If legal review is desirable, the 
approving authority will coordinate the request for ratification with 
the Office of the General Counsel or the District Counsel, as 
appropriate.
    (3) If ratification is authorized, the file will be returned to the 
contracting officer for issuance of a purchase order or contract, as 
appropriate.
    (c) In the case of otherwise proper contract awards made by 
contracting officers in excess of the limits of their delegated 
authority, the need for ratification will be brought to the attention of

<R05>
Sec. 801.690-4  Selection.

    (a) Contracting officers (CO) shall be appointed only in those 
instances where a valid organizational need for certified personnel can 
be demonstrated. Such factors to be considered in making these 
assessments include complexity of work, volume of actions and 
organizational structure.
    (b) Requests for appointment of contracting officers will be made in 
writing. Request for appointments at the Senior and Intermediate Level 
will be signed by the HCA and forwarded to the Acquisition Training 
Officer (90) for processing. The request for appointment will include at 
a minimum a justification of need, and a qualification statement for the 
candidate. Requests for appointment of HCAs as contracting officers will 
be made at one level above the head of the contracting activity.
    (c) The COCB and HCAs (limited to Basic Level) will evaluate 
candidates for CO certifications based on training, experience, and 
performance, and consideration of academic education, in addition to 
meeting standards of ethical conduct and avoiding conflicts of interest. 
Minimum qualifications of contracting officers are based on a 
combination of training, experience, and performance with consideration 
of relevant academic credit or degrees earned. The following minimum 
requirements are established for designation of contracting officers:
    (1) Basic level. (i) Training--Forty hours of basic acquisition or 
small purchase training that can be accomplished on the job or in 
formalized courses of instruction. If on-the-job training is conducted, 
it must be documented for the record and include a brief description of

Acquisition.
    (B) ATP Level II--Advanced Contract Administration.
    (C) ATP Level III-- Cost and Price Analysis.

ATP courses may include tests or other assessments to indicate what 
information has been learned by the student. An assessment will then be 
made to determine if additional formal or on-the-job training is needed.
    (ii) Experience. Two years of progressive work assignments in an 
acquisition related field leading to broader technical ability within 
the last five years.
    (iii) Performance. Satisfactory rating.
    (iv) Education (desired). Associate degree.
    (3) Senior level--(i) Training--(A) ATP Level I-- Fundamentals of 
Acquisition.
    (B) ATP Level II-- Advanced Contract Administration.
    (C) ATP Level III-- Cost and Price Analysis.
    (D) ATP Level IV-- Contract Negotiation.

ATP courses may include tests or other assessments to indicate what 
information has been learned by the student. An assessment will then be 
made to determine if additional formal or on-the-job training is needed.

    (ii) Experience. Three years of progressive assignments in an 
acquisition related field within the last five years and demonstrated 
broad technical ability related to acquisition.
    (iii) Performance. Satisfactory rating.
    (iv) Education (desired). Bachelor degree.
    (d) Other training courses may be substituted for the prescribed 
core curriculum provided that the training meets equivalent content and 
difficulty per course. Recommending officials must fully document and 
justify equivalent courses when recommending candidates for appointment 
as contracting officers. The COCB will review and determine if 
equivalent

[[Page 152]]

courses may be appropriately substituted. HCAs are responsible for 
providing their subordinates with advice and assistance necessary to 
complete required training.
    (e) Candidates who achieve additional academic credit beyond the 
desired education level may be eligible to receive credit toward 
experience for this additional academic credit. Substitutions of this 
nature must be fully justified and documented by the recommending 
official and forwarded to the COCB for evaluation and appropriate 
action. Candidates will receive a maximum credit of 1 year of experience 
when substitutions are approved for the Intermediate and Senior Level. A 
maximum credit of 6 months may be approved by the HCA for the Basic 
Level.
    (f) Candidates who do not meet the minimum qualifications 
established in this section, may be granted interim appointments in 
accordance with 801.690-7.
    (g) The Privacy Act of 1974 applies to the information collected

appointment.
    (b) If training requirements are met during the interim appointment 
period through the ATP, a permanent warrant may be issued by the 
designating official upon satisfactory completion of all the required 
courses. Where equivalent courses have been completed, appropriate 
documentation (copies of course certificates) must be submitted before a

<R05>
Sec. 803.7000  Policy.

    It is Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) policy to contract with 
companies that conduct business with the highest degree of integrity and 
honesty. To demonstrate this commitment to integrity and honesty, 
contractors should have standards of conduct and internal control 
systems that are designed to promote such standards, to facilitate the 
timely discovery and disclosure of improper conduct in connection with 
Government contracts, and to assure that corrective measures are 
promptly instituted and carried out. For example, a contractor's system 
of management controls should provide for--
    (a) A written code of business ethics and standards of conduct and 
an ethics training program for all employees;
    (b) A mechanism, such as a hotline, by which employees may report 
suspected instances of improper conduct, and instructions that encourage 
employees to make such reports;
    (c) Disciplinary action for improper conduct;
    (d) Periodic reviews of company business practices, procedures, 
policies, and internal controls for compliance with standards of conduct 
and the special requirements of Government contracting;
    (e) Internal and/or external audits as appropriate;

[[Page 155]]

    (f) Timely reporting to appropriate Government officials of any 
suspected or possible violations of law in connection with Government 
contracts or any other irregularities in connection with such contracts; 
and
    (g) Full cooperation with any Government agencies responsible for 
either investigation or corrective actions.

advertise for architect-engineer services, it must establish the 
geographic area within which architect-engineer firms (including joint 
ventures) will be considered. The area determined must be large enough 
to assure selection of three to five firms highly qualified for the 
particular project involved, but not so large as to make the evaluation 
process unduly burdensome.

<R05>
Sec. 807.300  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes basic procedures and principles to be 
followed in performing the contracting aspect of the OMB Circular A-76 
cost comparison process.


<R05>
Sec. 807.304  Procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 807.304-73  Bid opening/receipt of proposals.

    The date established for bid opening or receipt of proposals will 
normally be 90 days after sending the request for publication to the 
Commerce Business Daily (CBD) (65 days after issuing the solicitation).


<R05>
Sec. 807.304-75  Bid acceptance.

    Bid acceptance shall be 90 days from bid opening/receipt of 
proposals in order to accommodate the time necessary to evaluate bids/
offers, finalize the cost comparison and process any appeals. 
Contracting officers will insert ``90 days'' in FAR clause 52.214-15.


<R05>
Sec. 807.304-76  Contract effective date.

    (a) A transition from in-house performance to contract requires a 
period of time from contract award to beginning of contract performance 
(contract effective date). This time is necessary to allow for personnel 
adjustments, e.g., right of first refusal process, and to allow a 
reasonable period for the contractor to make necessary resource 
reallocations. The contract effective date should be carefully 
considered in conjunction with the A-76 Task Group and must be specified 
in the solicitation.
    (b) Although outplacement planning to minimize the effect of any 
necessary reduction in force should be initiated in advace of bid 
opening/receipt of proposals as prescribed by Office of Personnel and 
Labor Relations, there are also employee and labor organization 
reduction-in-force notice requirements which must be satisfied.
    (c) When bargaining unit employees will be affected, facility 
officials also should review and comply with any employee or labor 
organization notice requirements in applicable negotiated agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 807.304-77  Right of first refusal.

    (a) In addition to the Right of First Refusal clause specified in 
FAR 52.207-3, the contracting officer will include the clause ``Report 
of Employment Under Commercial Activities'' in 852.207-70. This clause 
is primarily intended to verify that the contractor is meeting its 
obligation to provide adversely affected Federal workers the first 
opportunity for employment openings, for which they qualify, created by 
the contract.
    (b) The Report of Employment Under Commercial Activities clause is 
also prescribed to avoid inappropriate severance payment. In order to 
implement the clause, the contracting officer (or Contracting Officer's 
Technical Representative (COTR)) must first obtain a list from the 
servicing personnel office of Federal employees, including their Social 
Security numbers, who will be adversely affected as a result of the 
anticipated contract. The list should be requested as soon as a 
preliminary determination is made to contract out a function subject to 
A-76. (Contracting officers may designate a COTR to coordinate the 
information and reporting requirements.)

Management Regulation 41 CFR 101-25.101-5. Justification for each 
deviation must be included in the procurement file.
    (c) Eligible Beneficiaries. When it is determined that a therapeutic 
benefit to eligible beneficiaries will result from personal selection of 
shoes, clothing and incidentals, acquisition from the Veterans Canteen 
Service or commercial sources is authorized. When dress shoes similar to

<R05>
Sec. 809.106-1  Conditions for preaward surveys.

    (a) Preaward on-site evaluation will be made for contracts covering 
the products and services of bakeries, dairies, ice cream plants and 
laundry and dry cleaning activities. A committee under the direction of 
the contracting officer and composed of representatives of the medical 
service and/or using service chiefs or designees appointed by the 
facility director will inspect and evaluate the plant, personnel, 
equipment and processes of the prospective contractor. Prior to any 
inspection, the contracting officer will inquire whether the plant has 
been recently inspected and approved by another Department of Veterans 
Affairs facility or Federal agency. Approved inspection reports of 
another Department of Veterans Affairs facility will be accepted by 
Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and approved inspection 
reports of other Federal agencies may be accepted as satisfactory 
evidence that the facilities of the bidder meet the requirements of the 
Invitation for Bid, provided inspection was made not more than 6 months 
prior to the proposed contract period.
    (b) Preaward on-site evaluation of dairy plants will not be made by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs when acceptable bids are received 
from suppliers of those dairy products designated as No. 1 in the 
Federal Specifications. Suppliers must have received, prior to opening 
of bids, a pasteurized milk rating of 90 percent or more for the type of 
product being supplied, on the basis of the U.S. Public Health Service 
milk ordinance and code. Such rating must be current (not over 2 years 
old), and will have been determined by certified State milk sanitation 
rating officer in the State of origin or by the Public Health Service 
and will continue at 90 percent or more during the period of the 
contract. Firms not so rated may only offer dairy products designated as 
No. 2 in the Federal Specifications. Award to such firms may be made 
only after completion of a preaward on-site evaluation conducted in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) Prior to any open market purchase of fresh bakery products (such 
as pies, cakes, cookies), the plant where these products are produced or 
prepared will be inspected and evaluated as provided in paragraph (a) of 
this section. On-site evaluation will be made at least annually and 
recorded on VA Form 10-2079, Inspection Report of Bakery.

                    Subpart 809.2_Qualified Products


<R05>
Sec. 809.206  Acquiring qualified products.

    (a) Federal Qualified Products Lists are lists of products qualified 
under the applicable Federal or interim Federal specification. Such 
lists may be used as authorized by the appropriate administration or 
staff office. Requests to receive copies of existing Federal Qualified 
Products Lists will be submitted to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Acquisition and Materiel Management (91) for transmittal to General 
Services Administration. Requests to establish a Federal Qualified 
Products List for a commodity will be submitted to the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management (91), supported by one 
or more of the following justifications:
    (1) The time required for testing after award would unduly delay 
delivery of the supplies being purchased.
    (2) The cost of repetitive testing would be excessive.
    (3) The tests would require expensive or complicated testing 
apparatus not commonly available.
    (4) The interest of the Government requires assurance, prior to 
award, that the product is satisfactory for its intended use.

[[Page 162]]

    (5) The determination of acceptability would require performance 
data to supplement technical requirements in the specification.
    (b) VA Qualified Products Lists are lists of products qualified by 
VA under VA specifications or purchase descriptions. Such lists may be 
established as authorized by the appropriate administration or staff 
office.
    (1) VA Qualified Products Lists will be supported by one or more of 
the justifications in 809.206(a) or the following:
    (i) Where tests result in substantial or repetitive rejections, or
    (ii) Where professional requirements of performance, balance, 
design, or construction cannot economically be developed into clear 
specifications, and professional judgment is required in determining the 
acceptability of items meeting VA requirements.
    (2) In the event that the requirement for VA Qualified Products List 
is established for any given product, known suppliers of the type of 
item required will be notified and given an opportunity to submit 
samples for inspection, and test based upon guarantee that they will 
deliver the item to be inspected, provided the item is acceptable. A 
qualified products list shall not be used as a means of restricting 
competition to favored suppliers. All suppliers so desiring shall be 
given an opportunity to have their products tested for acceptability.
    (3) Costs involved in the inspection and test will be borne by VA. 
The supplier will be required to bear the cost of the sample and its 
transportation to the inspecting point. After inspection, the sample 
shall be returned to the supplier ``as is'' unless it is destroyed by 
inspection or disposed of or retained by VA as authorized by the 
supplier.
    (4) Items which have been accepted for the qualified products list 
will be subject to constant review for compliance with the applicable 
specification. Where there is a variance between the specification and 
item, the supplier shall be requested to furnish an item that conforms 
to the specification. Failure or inability on the part of the supplier 
to provide an item that conforms to the specification will be sufficient 
cause to consider the item unacceptable in response to subsequent 
invitations.
    (5) The acceptance of an item for the qualified products list does 
not guarantee acceptance in any future purchase, nor does it constitute 
a waiver of the requirements of the specifications as to acceptance, 
inspection, testing or other provisions of any future contract involving 
such item.
    (6) Bid invitations covering products which have been included in a 
qualified products list will include the clause set forth in FAR 52.209-
1 or 52.209-2 as applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 809.270  Qualified products for convenience/labor saving foods.

    (a) Each VA medical district's Dietetic Service representative is 
delegated authority to establish a common Qualified Products List for 
convenience/labor-saving foods for the use of medical centers within 
his/her respective district. The medical district Dietetic Service 
representative will notify the Director, Dietetic Service, VA Central 
Office, of the establishment of each Qualified Products List and 
amendments to each established list.
    (b) Each medical center is authorized to use its district Qualified 
Products List. Each medical center may test food of its own choice, but 
will submit test results to the district Dietetic Service 
representative. The Dietetic Service representative will coordinate and 
consolidate the test results and recommendations of individual medical 
centers with other medical centers within the district in order to avoid 
unnecessary duplication.
    (c) The approved medical district Qualified Products List will be 
furnished each Supply office within the district. The Supply Services 
will have access to complete and accurate records of established 
Qualified Products Lists and all test results. These records will be 
made available to the Office of Acquisition and Materiel Management, VA 
Central Office, upon request.

           Subpart 809.5_Organizational Conflicts of Interest


<R05>
Sec. 809.504  Contracting officer's responsibilities.

    (a) Contracting officers will be responsible for determining the 
existence of actual and/or potential organizational conflicts of 
interest which would result from the award of the contract. The 
contracting officer will be guided by information submitted by offerors 
and by his/her own judgment. The contracting officer may obtain the 
advice of legal counsel and the assistance of technical specialists in 
evaluating potential organizational conflicts.
    (b) If it is determined that organizational conflicts of interest 
will be created by the award of the contract, the contracting officer 
may find an offeror nonresponsible.
    (c) Notwithstanding the existence of organizational conflicts of 
interest, it may be determined that the award of the contract would be 
in the best interest of the Government. In that case, the contracting 
officer may set terms and conditions which will reduce the 
organizational conflicts of interest to the greatest extent possible, 
with the approval of the head of the contracting activity.
    (d) The contracting officer will, in addition to any certifications 
required by this subpart, require in all solicitations for consulting 
services that the offeror submit as part of an offer a statement which 
discloses all relevant facts relating to existing or potential 
organizational conflicts of interest surrounding the contract and/or the 
proposed use of subcontractors during the contract.

[[Page 165]]


<R05>
Sec. 809.505  General rules.

    The determination that organizational conflicts of interest exist 
can only be made when facts surrounding individual contracting 
situations are known. Therefore, it is up to the contracting officer to 
exercise common sense, good judgment and sound discretion in making such 
a determination and to take steps to mitigate to the greatest extent 
possible organizational conflicts of interest. The contracting officer 
will be guided by at least two underlying principles. These are that 
organizational conflicts of interest may result from (a) conflicting 
roles and interests of the contractor, in which case he/she would be 
unable to give unbiased and objective advice or may otherwise produce a 
biased work product; or (b) unfair competitive advantage which exceeds a 
normal flow of benefits from the award of the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 809.508-2  Contract clause.

    The representation in 852.209-70, Organizational Conflicts of 
Interest, will be made a part of all solicitations for consulting 
services.

    (a) Brand name product means a commercial product described by brand 
name and make or model number or other appropriate nomenclature by which 
such product is offered for sale to the public by the particular 
manufacturer, producer or distributor.
    (b) Salient characteristics are those particular characteristics 
that specifically describe the essential physical and functional 
features of the material or service required. They are those essential 
physical or functional features which are identified in the 
specifications as a mandatory requirement which a proposed ``equal'' 
product or material must possess in order for the bid to be considered 
responsive. Bidders must furnish all descriptive literature and bid 
samples required by the solicitation to establish such ``equality''.

[[Page 166]]

      Subpart 811.1_Selecting and Developing Requirements Documents


<R05>
Sec. 811.104  Items particular to one manufacturer.

    (a) Specifications shall be written in accordance with FAR 11.002 
unless otherwise justified by the specification writer and approved by 
the contracting officer as described in paragraph (b) of this section. 
The contract file shall be documented accordingly.
    (b) When it is determined that a particular physical or functional 
characteristic of only one product will meet the minimum requirements of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs (see FAR 11.104) or that a ``brand 
name or equal'' purchase description will be used, the specification 
writer, whether agency personnel, architect-engineer, or consultant with 
which the Department of Veterans Affairs has contracted, shall 
separately identify the item(s) to the contracting officer and provide a 
full written justification of the reason the particular characteristic 
is essential to the Government's requirements or why the ``brand name or 
equal'' purchase description is necessary. The contracting officer shall 
make the final determination whether restrictive specifications or 
``brand name or equal'' purchase descriptions will be included in the 
solicitation.
    (c) Purchase descriptions that contain references to one or more 
brand name products may be used only in accordance with 811.104-70, 
811.104-71, and 811.104-72. In addition, purchase descriptions that 
contain references to one or more brand name products shall be followed 
by the words ``or equal,'' except when the acquisition is fully 
justified under FAR 6.3 and VAAR 806.3. Acceptable brand name products 
should be listed in the solicitation. Where a ``brand name or equal'' 
purchase description is used, prospective contractors must be given the 
opportunity to offer products other than those specifically referenced 
by brand name if such other products are determined by the Government to 
fully meet the salient characteristics listed in the invitation. The 
contract file will be documented in accordance with paragraph (b) of 
this section, justifying the need for use of a brand name or equal 
description.
    (d) ``Brand name or equal'' purchase descriptions shall set forth 
those salient physical, functional, or other characteristics of the 
referenced products which are essential to the minimum needs of the 
Government. For example, when interchangeability of parts is required, 
such requirement should be specified. Purchase descriptions shall 
contain the following information to the extent available and include 
such other information as is necessary to describe the item required:
    (1) Complete common generic identification of the item required;
    (2) Applicable model, make or catalog number for each brand name 
product referenced, and identity of the commercial catalog in which it 
appears; and
    (3) Name of manufacturer, producer or distributor of each brand name 
product referenced (and address if not well known).
    (e) When necessary to describe adequately the item required, an 
applicable commercial catalog description or pertinent extract may be 
used if such description is identified in the solicitation as being that 
of the particular named manufacturer, producer or distributor. The 
contracting officer will insure that a copy of any catalogs referenced 
(except parts catalogs) is available on request for review by bidders at 
the purchasing office.
    (f) Except as noted in paragraph (d) of this section, purchase 
descriptions shall not include either minimum or maximum restrictive 
dimensions, weights, materials or other salient characteristics which 
are unique to a brand name product or which would tend to eliminate 
competition or other products which are only marginally outside the 
restrictions. However, purchase description may include restrictive 
dimensions, weights, materials or other salient characteristics if such 
restrictions are determined in writing by the user to be essential to 
the Government's requirements, the brand name of the product is included 
in the purchase description, and all other determinations required by 
811.104 are made.

[[Page 167]]


<R05>
Sec. 811.104-70  Purchase descriptions.

    (a) When any purchase description, including a ``brand name or 
equal'' purchase description, is used in a solicitation for a supply 
contract to describe required items of mechanical equipment, the 
solicitation will include the clauses in 852.211-70 (Service Data 
Manual) and in 852.211-71 (Guarantee).
    (b) Solicitations using ``brand name or equal'' purchase 
descriptions will contain the ``brand name or equal'' clause in 852.211-
77, and the provision set forth at FAR 52.214-21, Descriptive 
Literature. Contracting officers are cautioned to review the 
requirements at FAR 14.202-5(d) when utilizing the descriptive 
literature provision.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph 811.104-70(d), when a ``brand 
name or equal'' purchase description is included in an invitation for 
bids, the following shall be inserted after each item so described in 
the solicitation, for completion by the bidder:

                               Bidding on:

Manufacturer name_______________________________________________________

Brand___________________________________________________________________

No._____________________________________________________________________

    (d)(1) When component parts of an end item are described in the 
solicitation by a ``brand name or equal'' purchase description and the 
contracting officer determines that the clause in 811.104-70(b) is 
inapplicable to such component parts, the requirements of 811.104-70(c) 
shall not apply with respect to such component parts. In such cases, if 
the clause is included in the solicitation for other reasons, a 
statement substantially as follows also shall be included:

    The clause entitled ``Brand Name or Equal'' does not apply to the 
following component parts (list the component parts to which the clause 
does not apply): and

    (2) In the alternative, if the contracting officer determines that 
the clause in 811.104-70(b) shall apply to only certain such component 
parts, the requirements of 811.104-70(c) shall apply to such component 
parts and a statement substantially as follows also shall be included:

    The clause entitled ``Brand Name or Equal'' applies to the following 
component parts (list the component parts to which the clause applies):

    (e) When a solicitation contains ``brand name or equal'' purchase 
descriptions, bidders who offer brand name products, including component 
parts, referenced in such descriptions shall not be required to furnish 
bid samples of the referenced brand name products. However, 
solicitations may require the submission of bid samples in the case of 
bidders offering ``or equal'' products. If bid samples are required, the 
solicitation shall include the provision set forth at FAR 52.214-20, Bid 
Samples. The bidder must still furnish all descriptive literature in 
accordance with and for the purpose set forth in the ``Brand Name or 
Equal'' clause, 852.211-77(c)(1) and (2), even though bid samples may 
not be required.


<R05>
Sec. 811.104-71  Bid evaluation and award.

    (a) Bids offering products that differ from brand name products 
referenced in a ``brand name or equal'' purchase description shall be 
considered for award when the contracting officer determines in 
accordance with the terms of the clause at 852.211-77 that the offered 
products are clearly identified in the bids and are equal in all 
material respects to the products specified.
    (b) Award documents shall identify, or incorporate by reference, an 
identification of the specific products which the contractor is to 
furnish. Such identification shall include any brand name and make or 
model number, descriptive material, and any modifications of brand name 
products specified in the bid. Included in this requirement are those 
instances when the descriptions of the end items contain ``brand name or 
equal'' purchase descriptions of component parts or of accessories 
related to the end item, and the clause at 852.211-77 was applicable to 
such component parts or accessories (see 811.104-70(d)(2)).


<R05>
Sec. 811.104-72  Procedure for negotiated procurements.

    (a) The policies and procedures prescribed in 811.104-70 and 
811.104-71 should be used as a guide in developing

[[Page 168]]

adequate purchase descriptions for negotiated procurements.
    (b) The clause at 852.211-77 may be adapted for use in negotiated 
procurements. If use of the clause is not practicable (as may be the 
case in unusual and compelling urgency purchases), suppliers shall be 
suitably informed that proposals offering products different from the 
products referenced by brand name will be considered if the contracting 
officer determines that such offered products are equal in all material 
respects to the products referenced.

       Subpart 811.2_Using and Maintaining Requirements Documents


<R05>
Sec. 811.202  Maintenance of standardization documents.

    (a) Military and departmental specifications. Contracting officers 
may, when they deem it to be advantageous to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, utilize these specifications when procuring supplies and 
equipment costing less than the simplified acquisition threshold. 
However, when purchasing items of perishable subsistence, contracting 
officers shall observe only those exemptions set forth in paragraphs 
(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section.
    (b) Nutrition and Food Service specifications. (1) The Department of 
Veterans Affairs has adopted for use in the procurement of packinghouse 
products, the purchase descriptions and specifications set forth in the 
Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS), and the IMPS General 
Requirements, which have been developed by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. Purchase descriptions and specifications for dairy 
products, poultry, eggs, fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables, as well 
as certain packinghouse products selected from the IMPS especially for 
Department of Veterans Affairs use, are contained in Part IV of the 
Federal Supply Catalog, Stock List, FSC Group 89, Subsistence, 
Publication No. C8900-SL. A copy of Part IV of this catalog and the IMPS 
may be obtained from any Department of Veterans Affairs contracting 
officer.
    (2) The military specifications for meat and meat products contained 
in Part IV of the Federal Supply Catalog, Stock List, FSC Group 89, 
Subsistence, shall be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs only 
when purchasing such items of subsistence from the Defense Logistics 
Agency (DLA). Military specifications for poultry, eggs, and egg 
products contained in Part IV of the Federal Supply Catalog, Stock List, 
FSC Group 89, Subsistence, may be used when purchasing either from DLA 
or from local dealers.
    (3) Except as authorized in part 846 of this chapter, contracting 
officers shall not deviate from the specifications contained in Part IV 
of the Federal Supply Catalog, Stock List, FSC Group 89, Subsistence, 
and the IMPS without prior approval of the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Acquisition and Materiel Management.
    (4) Items of meat, cured pork and poultry not listed in either Part 
IV of the Federal Supply Catalog, Stock List, FSC Group 89, Subsistence, 
or the IMPS, will not be purchased without prior approval of the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management.
    (c) Department of Veterans Affairs specifications. (1) The Director, 
Publications Service, is responsible for developing, publishing, and 
distributing Department of Veterans Affairs specifications covering 
printing and binding.
    (2) Department of Veterans Affairs specifications, as they are 
revised, are placed in stock in the VA Forms and Publications Depot. 
Facility requirements for these specifications will be requisitioned 
from that source.
    (d) Government paper specification standards. (1) Invitations for 
bids, requests for proposals, purchase orders, or other procurement 
instruments covering the purchase of paper stocks to be used in 
duplicating or printing, or which specify the paper stocks to be used in 
buying printing, binding, or duplicating, will require that such paper 
stocks be in accordance with the Government Paper Specification 
Standards issued by the Joint Committee on Printing of Congress.
    (2) All binding or rebinding of books, magazines, pamphlets, 
newspapers, slip cases and boxes will be procured in accordance with 
Government Printing Office (GPO) specifications and will be

             Subpart 811.4_Delivery or Performance Schedules


<R05>
Sec. 811.404  Contract clauses.

    When delivery is required by or on a particular date, the time of 
delivery clause set forth in FAR 52.211-8 as it relates to f.o.b. 
destination contracts will state that the delivery date specified is the 
date by which the shipment is to be delivered, not the shipping date. In 
f.o.b. origin contracts, the clause will state that the date specified 
is the date shipment is to be accepted by the carrier.

                    Subpart 811.5_Liquidated Damages


<R05>
Sec. 811.502  Policy.

    Liquidated damages provisions will not be routinely included in 
supply or construction contracts, regardless of dollar amount. The 
decision to include liquidated damages provisions will conform to the 
criteria in FAR 11.502. In making this decision, consideration will be 
given to whether the necessity for timely delivery or performance as 
required in the contract schedule is so critical that a probable 
increase in contract price is justified. Liquidated damages provisions 
will not be included as insurance against selection of a non-responsible 
bidder, as a substitute for efficient contract administration, or as a 
penalty for failure to perform on time.


<R05>
Sec. 811.504  Contract clauses.

    When the liquidated damages clause prescribed in FAR 52.211-11 or 
52.211-12 is to be used and where partial performance may be utilized to 
the advantage of the Government, the clause in 852.211-78 will be 
included in the contract.

                Subpart 811.6_Priorities and Allocations


<R05>
Sec. 811.602  General.

    (a) Priorities and allocations of critical materials are controlled 
by the Department of Commerce. Essentially, such priorities and 
allocations are restricted to projects having a direct connection with 
supporting current defense needs. The Department of Veterans Affairs is 
not authorized to assign a priority rating to its purchase orders or 
contracts involving the acquisition or use of critical materials.
    (b) In those instances where it has been technically established 
that it is not feasible to use a substitute material, the Department of 
Commerce has agreed to assist us in obtaining critical materials for 
maintenance and repair projects. They will also, where possible, render 
assistance in connection with the purchase of new items, which may be in 
short supply because of their use in connection with the defense effort.
    (c) Contracting officers having problems in acquiring critical 
materials will ascertain all the facts necessary to enable the 
Department of Commerce to render assistance to the Department of 
Veterans Affairs in acquiring these materials. The contracting officer 
will submit a request for assistance containing the following 
information to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and 
Materiel Management (90):
    (1) A description of the maintenance and repair project or the new 
item, whichever is applicable;

[[Page 170]]

    (2) The critical material and the amount required;
    (3) The contractor's sources of supply, including any addresses. If 
the source is other than the manufacturer or producer, also list the 
name and address of the manufacturer or producer;
    (4) The Department of Veterans Affairs contract or purchase order 
number;
    (5) The contractor's purchase order number, if known, and the 
delivery time requirement as stated in the solicitation or offer;
    (6) The additional time the contractor claims will be necessary to 
effect delivery if priority assistance is not provided;
    (7) The nature and extent of the emergency that will be generated at 
the station, e.g.,
    (i) damage to the physical plant,
    (ii) impairment of the patient care program,
    (iii) creation of safety hazards, and
    (iv) any other pertinent condition that will result because of 
failure to secure assistance in obtaining the critical materials; and
    (8) If applicable, a statement that the item required is for use in 
a construction contract which was authorized by the Chief Facilities 
Management Officer, Office of Facilities Management, to be awarded and 
administered by the facility contracting officer.

                   Subpart 814.2_Solicitation of Bids


<R05>
Sec. 814.201  Preparation of invitations for bids.

    (a) Invitations for bids for supplies, equipment and services will 
be serially numbered at the time of issue. The number will consist of 
the station or National Acquisition Center division number, the serial 
number of the invitation, and the fiscal year in which issued, e.g., 
101-24-84. A series beginning with the number 1 will be started each 
fiscal year. Invitations for bids for supplies, equipment and services 
which are issued, accepted and become contracts in the same fiscal year 
but, because of procurement leadtime, will not be performed until the 
ensuing fiscal year will be numbered in the series of the year in which 
they are issued. However, invitations issued in one fiscal year that 
will result in a contract that will become effective and performed only 
in the ensuing fiscal year will be numbered in the ensuing fiscal year 
series.
    (b) Invitations for construction contracts will bear the applicable 
IFB number and project number, if assigned.

[[Page 174]]

    (c) In order to preclude adverse criticism of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs by prospective bidders relative to the disclosure of 
bid prices prior to bid opening, the provision entitled ``Caution to 
Bidders Bid-Envelopes,'' as set forth in 852.214-70, will be prominently 
placed in all invitations for bids.
    (d) To realize the greatest possible price advantage for the 
Government, items that may be processed by a contractor to effect a 
reduction in cost factors such as production, inspection and delivery, 
may be listed for award on both individual item and summary item bases. 
Items will be listed individually and, in addition, a summary price will 
be solicited for those items the contracting officer determines to be of 
a related character and normally handled by a majority of prospective 
bidders.
    (1) When different products are to be combined for a summary price, 
the quantity, unit and unit price columns opposite the summary item will 
be crossed out, e.g.:

(Item No.) Summary bid for furnishing items ___ to ___ inclusive on an 
all or none basis:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Quantity                          Unit                  Unit Price                Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XX...................................  XX.....................  XX.....................  $ XX
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Bidder will enter summary amount.)

    (2) When a single unit price is solicited for a single product for 
delivery to various destinations, or for multiple deliveries, the total 
quantity required will be listed opposite the summary item, e.g.:

(Item No.) Summary bid for furnishing items ___ to ___ inclusive on all 
or none basis:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Quantity                          Unit                  Unit Price                Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
XX...................................  XX.....................  XX.....................  $ XX
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Bidder will enter unit price and summary amount.)

    (3) Invitations containing a summary bid request will contain the 
following statement:

    The award will be made on either an individual item basis or summary 
bid basis, whichever results in the lowest cost to the Government. 
Therefore, to assure proper evaluation of all bids, a bidder quoting a 
summary bid price must also quote a price on each individual item 
included in the summary bid price.

    (e) Bid invitations for supplies, equipment, or services (other than 
construction) must define the extent to which alternate bids will be 
authorized and considered. Alternates specified on construction projects 
will be considered for acceptance only as a part of the basic item.
    (1) When an alternate item will be considered only if no bids or 
insufficient bids are received on the item desired, the clause set forth 
in 852.214-71(a) will be included in the invitation.
    (2) When an alternate item will be considered on an equal basis with 
the item specified, the clause set forth in 852.214-71(b) will be 
included in the invitation.
    (3) In addition to the clauses referenced in paragraph (e) (1) or 
(2) of this section, the clause set forth in 852.214-71(c) will be 
included in the invitation when bids will be allowed on different 
packaging, unit designation, etc.
    (f) When a contracting officer determines that it will be 
advantageous to the Government to make the award by group or groups of 
items, a provision for such award will be included in the invitation for 
bids.
    (1) This may apply when:
    (i) The items in the group or groups are readily available from the 
sources to be solicited; and
    (ii) It is desirable to make a minimum number of contracts; or
    (iii) Furniture or fixtures are required for a single project and 
uniformity of design is desirable; or
    (iv) The articles required will be assembled and used as a unit.
    (2) Solicitations for supplies and services, other than 
construction, will contain the provision set forth in FAR 52.214-22.
    (3) Solicitations for construction contracts which solicit prices on 
an item and alternate item basis (when it is intended that a single 
aggregate award will be made for all items in the solicitation within 
certain fiscal limitations) will contain a statement as to the order of 
priority in which the alternate items will be awarded. This priority 
will be based on the relative importance of an item, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs' estimate, and the

[[Page 175]]

amount of funds available. Such schedules will be substantially as 
follows:

    Item No. 1--Furnish all labor, material, equipment, etc., to paint 
buildings No. 1, 2, and 3, $___.
    Alternate items in order of priority. Furnish all labor, material, 
equipment, etc., to paint:
    Item No. 2--Building No. 1 only $___.
    Item No. 3--Building No. 2 only $___.


A single award will be made on Item No. 1, but in the event the offer 
exceeds the funds available, a single award will be made on Item No. 2, 
or a combination of Item Nos. 2 and 3. Offerors should quote a price on 
each item listed.

Sec. 814.301  Responsiveness of bids.

    Where the timeliness of the submission of a bid, modification or 
withdrawal cannot be administratively determined in accordance with FAR 
14.301, the matter will be submitted by the contracting officer directly 
to the Comptroller General for decision. The submission will include 
copies of all pertinent papers. A copy of each submission will be 
forwarded to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel 
Management.

when bids are received in the office of the addressee subsequent to the 
time of opening, and it will establish whether or not the delay was due 
to mishandling on the part of VA.

[[Page 177]]

will be retained for the current and two succeeding fiscal years.
    (b) The authority to approve cancellation of invitations for bid 
after opening and the authority to approve the acquisition after

<R05>
Sec. 814.404-2  Rejection of individual bids.

    (a) When a bid that is being considered for an award is found to be 
incomplete, e.g., all pages of the invitation have not been returned by 
the bidder, the contracting officer will take whichever of the following 
actions that is appropriate:
    (1) Make a determination that the bid as submitted is in such a form 
that acceptance would create a valid and binding contract, requiring the 
contractor to perform in accordance with all of the material terms and 
conditions of the invitation. Such a determination may be based on the 
fact that the bid as submitted includes evidence that the offeror 
intends to be bound by all the material terms and conditions of the 
invitation.
    (2) Make a determination that the bid as submitted is in such form 
that acceptance would not create a valid and binding contract.
    (b) When a single bid is received in response to a solicitation, the 
offer shall not be rejected simply because it specifies a bid acceptance 
time which is shorter than that contained in the solicitation, unless a 
compelling reason exists for rejecting such a bid. Insufficient time to 
properly evaluate an offer shall be considered a compelling reason for 
rejection; however, the contracting officer will first request the 
offeror to extend the acceptance date of the bid to allow for proper 
evaluation.
    Note: In those cases where more than one bid is received, an 
individual bid which is not in compliance with the Government's bid 
acceptance time shall be rejected as nonresponsive since consideration 
of such an offer would unfairly disadvantage other bidders.


<R05>
Sec. 814.404-70  Questions involving the responsiveness of a bid.

    Questions involving the responsiveness of a bid which cannot be 
resolved by the contracting officer may be submitted to the Comptroller 
General through the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and 
Materiel Management, Acquisition Administration Team, or the Chief 
Facilities Management Officer, Office of Facilities Management, as 
appropriate. Pertinent documentation must accompany the submission.

dated November 22, 1954.
    (b) When a bidder alleges a mistake in his or her bid prior to 
award, after complying with the provisions of FAR 14.407-3, the 
contracting officer will submit the complete file to the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management, Acquisition 
Administration Team, for an administrative determination. Based upon the 
evidence submitted, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and 
Materiel Management will determine the action to be taken by the 
contracting officer. Prior to its release to the contracting officer, 
this determination will be submitted to the General Counsel (025) for 
approval. Pending receipt of the determination, no award shall be made.
    (c) Based on the evidence, when the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Acquisition and Materiel Management believes that the case should be 
submitted to the Comptroller General for

[[Page 178]]

decision, he/she will prepare the submission and forward it to the 
Comptroller General through the General Counsel (025). The decision of 
the Comptroller General will be furnished to the contracting officer by 
the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management, 
Acquisition Administration Team. A copy of each such decision will be 
furnished to the General Counsel (025).

officer's proposed determination, prepared in accordance with FAR 
14.407-4, will be forwarded to the General Counsel (025) through the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management, 
Acquisition Administration Team, for legal coordination. The results of 
this coordination will be transmitted to the contracting officer by the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management, 
Acquisition Administration Team. The final determination on the alleged 
mistake in bid after award will be made by the contracting officer.
    (c) The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel 
Management, Acquisition Administration Team, will maintain the agency 
records of mistakes in bids after award required by FAR 14.407-4.

    (a) Any inquiries from a potential offeror of an unsolicited 
proposal shall be referred to the appropriate VA contact point 
designated in 815.506(a). The contact point will determine the nature of 
the potential proposal and determine what technical/professional 
disciplines need be consulted to determine the VA need for such a 
proposal and the likelihood that a formal proposal would be favorably 
reviewed. In consultation with such technical/professional offices, the 
VA contact point will inform the potential proposer of any additional 
information required to provide advance guidance as well as the 
information specified in FAR 15.504.
    (b) The FAR contact point will maintain a record of advance guidance 
provided and the disposition/recommendation regarding the potential 
offer.

    (a) When VA contact point determines that a comprehensive evaluation 
is to be undertaken (i.e., the proposal complies with the requirements 
in FAR 15.506-1(a) and is related to the mission of VA), the offeror 
will be contacted to

[[Page 180]]

ensure that all data that should be restricted in accordance with FAR 
15.509 has been identified.
    (b) The VA contact point will maintain a log of all unsolicited 
proposals which will be evaluated. The log will indicate:
    (1) The date the proposal was received;
    (2) The date that the unsolicited proposal has been determined to 
warrant a comprehensive evaluation;
    (3) A description of the proposal;
    (4) The offices requested to evaluate the proposal and the date such 
offices are requested to return their evaluations;
    (5) The date the reviewing offices finalize their respective 
evaluation; and
    (6) The final disposition of the proposal.
    (c) Each office which is assigned responsibility for reviewing an 
unsolicited proposal will be advised of the need to evaluate the 
proposal against the criteria set forth in FAR 15.507(a) (1) through 
(3), i.e., is the proposal available to the Government without 
restriction from another source, does it closely resemble a pending 
competitive acquisition, is the proposal lacking in demonstrated 
innovation or uniqueness? If the reviewers conclude in the affirmative 
as to any one of these questions, the VA contact point shall be advised 
and return the proposal to the proposer.
    (d) With regard to an unsolicited proposal being processed at a 
field facility, if the reviewing offices conclude that the unsolicited 
proposal should be accepted and provide the justification and 
certification required by FAR 15.507, the VA contact point will obtain 
the prior approval of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and 
Materiel Management (93) prior to proceeding with negotiation. In order 
to obtain the approval, the VA contact point will submit all necessary 
documentation supporting the noncompetitive negotiation including any 
justification and approval required by FAR Subpart 6.3 and results of 
any synopsis required by FAR Subpart 5.2 The Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Acquisition and Materiel Management will coordinate the proposal 
with the cognizant VA Central Office program official(s) and furnish the 
VA contact point with the final decision.
    (e) All copies of the unsolicited proposal will be controlled by the 
contact point by numbering each copy. If a reviewing office requires 
additional copies, the reviewing office will obtain approval of the VA 
contact point prior to duplication, numbering the copies as specified by 
the contact point. All copies will be returned to the VA contact point 
once review is completed.

    In evaluating start-up and other nonrecurring costs, the extent to 
which these costs are included in the proposed price and the intent to 
absorb or recover any such costs in any future noncompetitive 
procurement or other pricing action will be determined. The contracting 
officer will ascertain, with the assistance of the Assistant Inspector 
General for Policy, Planning and Resources (53), as required or 
considered necessary, that payment of such costs is not duplicated. For 
example, cost of equipment paid for by the Government through a setup or 
connection agreement will not be included in depreciation costs of a 
subsequently negotiated agreement.

and technical reviews are accomplished. To this end, initial and revised 
pricing of all negotiated prime contracts (including subcontract pricing 
under them) and contract modifications will be subject to technical 
analyses to the degree the contracting officer deems necessary (see 
801.602-70 for required legal reviews). Technical analyses of the 
proposals will be requested by the contracting officer from the 
appropriate technical personnel to address, as a minimum, the items set 
forth in FAR Subpart 15.805-4. Contracting officers shall not begin 
negotiation of or award any negotiated contracts or contract 
modifications before receipt, analysis and consideration of documented 
technical evaluations for every procurement action requiring such 
analysis under the conditions prescribed in FAR 15.805-4. The results of 
such analyses will be documented in the contract file and will also be 
made available to the auditor performing the preaward audit required by 
815.805-5.
    (b) When, in the opinion of the contracting officer, the complexity 
of the proposed contract warrants, he/she will submit the proposed 
contract to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel 
Management (93) for review and comment. When deemed advisable, the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management (93) 
will request the General Counsel to accomplish a legal review. This 
review is in addition to the legal review specified in 801.602-70.

other than those contracts awarded by the National Cemetery System for 
monuments or those contracts that contain the clause for service 
contracts (FAR 22.1006(c)) require the prior approval of the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management (90). The 
request for approval shall clearly set forth the need for the provision.
    (b) Any contract involving direct obligation of appropriations and 
which extends beyond the appropriation of the year in which the contract 
period begins or which is for more than one fiscal year, is to contain 
provisions to the effect that:
    (1) It is made for the period covered by the contract, subject to 
the availability of appropriations in the ensuing year(s), and
    (2) No service is to be performed by the contractor after September 
30 of each fiscal year unless and until specifically authorized by the 
contracting officer or representative.
    (c) Architect-engineer contracts, construction contracts, or 
professional engineer contracts, financed by ``no year appropriations''

                 Subpart 816.70_Unauthorized Agreements


<R05>
Sec. 816.7001  Letters of availability.

    (a) Description. A letter of availability (sometimes inappropriately 
called a letter of intent) is a letter to a supplier primarily for the 
purpose of obtaining a place on the supplier's production or delivery 
schedule for long lead time items. Such a letter typically indicates 
that products or services are being considered for procurement, but that 
the statement of intent is not to be construed as a commitment. Such 
letters of availability are sometimes solicited by prospective 
contractors, or they may be originated by Government personnel. A letter 
of availability is distinguished from a letter contract which is 
specifically authorized in FAR 16.603.

[[Page 182]]

    (b) Policy. (1) Unless specifically authorized by the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management, letters of 
availability are not to be utilized for the following reasons:
    (i) While such letters of availability may disclaim Government 
liability, they may induce potential contractors to initiate costly 
preparations in anticipation of contract award.
    (ii) Procurements announced in such letters do not always 
materialize. The result may be costly to the Government, the prospective 
contractor, or both. If the author of the letter of availability is an 
authorized contracting officer of the Department, the Government may be 
bound by action, even though the action is contrary to sound procurement 
practices and/or fiscal regulations. If the author of the letter of 
availability lacks procurement authority, the prospective contractor may 
incur substantial expenditures which may not be recovered from the 
Government, but for which the prospective contractor may seek to hold 
the unauthorized author personally liable.
    (iii) The issuance of a letter of availability may violate the 
``Anti-Deficiency Act'' (31 U.S.C. 1341).
    (2) It is recognized that potential contractors have a need to 
obtain procurement information at the earliest possible moment in order 
to make timely preparations. To this end, procurement personnel are 
expected to act as efficiently and expeditiously as possible on all 
procurement actions.

Sec. 817.105-1  Uses.

    (a) Pursuant to Title 38, United States Code, Chapter 1, Section 114 
(as amended by Pub. L. 101-237), multiyear contracting not exceeding 5 
years is authorized for obtaining supplies and services when the 
Secretary has made the following determinations:
    (1) Appropriations are available for obligation for the total 
payments for the fiscal year the contract is entered into plus the 
estimated amount of any cancellation charges.
    (2) The contract is in the best interest of the Government due to 
the effect it would have in:
    (i) Reducing cost;
    (ii) Achieving contract administration and other efficiencies;
    (iii) Increasing quality contract performance;
    (iv) Encouraging effective competition.
    (3) During the contract period:
    (i) There is a continuing need for the supplies or services;
    (ii) There is little likelihood of substantial changes in need for 
the supplies and services in terms of quantity or rate of delivery; and
    (iii) The specifications for the supplies or services are expected 
to be reasonably stable.
    (4) The risks relating to a prospective contractor's ability to 
perform in accordance with the specifications and other contract terms 
are not excessive;
    (5) The use of a multiyear contract will not inhibit competition 
from small business firms;
    (6) In the case of a pharmaceutical item for which a patent has 
expired less than 4 years before the solicitation issue date, there is 
no substantial likelihood that increased competition will

[[Page 183]]

occur during the term of the contact that would make the contract prices 
higher than would be reasonable.
    (b) The authority of the Secretary to enter into multiyear contracts 
and to make the determinations specified in 817.102-1(a) of this section 
is delegated as follows:
    (1) Heads of contracting activities. For contracts not requiring 
legal/technical reviews pursuant to 801.602-70 (for purposes of 
determining applicability of the thresholds, the total dollar amount of 
the contract over its full multiyear term will be used), and which do 
not contain a first year cancellation ceiling which exceeds 20 percent 
of the total dollar amount of the contract over the full multi-year 
term.
    (2) Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel 
Management, will approve all proposed uses of multiyear contracts not 
authorized for approval by heads of contracting activities. For approval 
purposes, the head of the contracting activity will justify and document 
the use of a multiyear contract against each of the criteria specified 
in 817.102-1 (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section. The justification 
will additionally delineate the cancellation ceiling and the method used 
for calculating that ceiling and will specify the advantages of 
multiyear contracts over other alternative methods, e.g., option year 
contracts.
    (c) Cancellation ceilings will be carefully developed in accordance 
with FAR 17.106-1.

                               Eligibility


<R05>
Sec. 819.602-3  Appealing Small Business Administration's decision to 
          issue Certificates of Competency.

    Formal VA appeals of an initial concurrence by the SBA Central 
Office in an SBA Regional Office decision to issue a Certificate of 
Competency (CoC) will be processed as follows:
    (a) When the contracting officer believes that VA should formally 
appeal the concurrence by the SBA Central Office in an SBA Regional 
Office decision to issue a CoC, the contracting officer will so notify 
the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management 
(95B) in writing within five business days after receipt of the SBA 
Central Office's written confirmation of its determination. Within ten 
business days of the contracting officer's receipt of the SBA's written 
confirmation (or within a period acceptable to VA and the SBA), the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management (95B) 
will advise the SBA Central Office that VA intends to file a formal 
appeal.
    (b) Within ten business days of the contracting officer's receipt of 
the SBA Central Office's written confirmation, the contracting officer 
will furnish an original and one copy of the appeal file to the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management (95B). The 
file must contain a copy of the bid/offer from the firm considered 
nonresponsible, a copy of the bid/offer from the firm otherwise in line 
for award, a copy of the bid, a copy of the bid abstract, a copy of 
SBA's CoC Review Committee report, a copy of all correspondence with SBA 
on the matter, and the contracting officer's narrative statement 
establishing the error, omission, or other basis for disputing SBA's 
proposed responsibility determination.
    (c) The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel 
Management (95B) will review the file prepared by the contracting 
officer. If the contracting officer's position is accepted, the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management (95B) will 
transmit the formal appeal to the SBA Central Office within ten business 
days after notifying that office of VA's intent to appeal (or within a 
period acceptable to VA and the SBA). The contracting officer will be 
informed of the final SBA decision.
    (d) If, after the Central Office review, it is decided that a formal 
appeal should not be made to the SBA, the contracting officer will be 
advised of this decision and that the CoC should be accepted by VA. The 
SBA Central Office will also be advised that VA will

[[Page 188]]

not pursue its formal appeal. If the decision concerns major 
construction projects and the Office of Facilities Management disagrees 
with the decision made by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition 
and Materiel Management, the matter will be referred to the Senior 
Procurement Executive for a final VA determination.

 Subpart 819.8_Contracting With the Small Business Administration (The 
                              8(a) Program)


<R05>
Sec. 819.800  General.

    (a) No contract will be entered into with SBA under section 8(a) of 
the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)) unless a certification is made 
by the Administrator of that agency, or designee, that SBA is competent 
to perform the contract.
    (b) When it is determined that the requirements of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs are appropriate for inclusion in this program, the 
contracting officer will make this fact known to proper officials of the 
SBA regional office servicing his/her area. However, when projects 
funded from minor construction appropriation (between $400,000 and $2 
million) are proposed for 8(a) acquisition, the Director, Office of 
Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) (00SB), shall be 
contracted by telephone or notified in writing in order to afford the 
OSDBU an opportunity to identify possible 8(a) sources prior to 
apprising SBA officials. If the certification required by paragraph (a) 
of this section is received, the Department of Veterans Affairs 
contracting officer will secure from SBA the name(s) and location(s) of 
their subcontractor(s) and the unit price(s) to be paid. Should these 
prices be within a range acceptable to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, the contracting officer will notify SBA of acceptance.
    (c) The contract will be made between the Department of Veterans 
Affairs and SBA and will be administered by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.
    (d) In addition to meeting the requirements of 801.602-70, 
contracting officers will secure cost and pricing data prescribed in FAR 
15.403-4 and 815.804-2 when negotiating contracts under the SBA 8(a) 
program. Contracting officers will request an audit in accordance with 
815.805-5 on proposals in excess of $500,000 before negotiating any 
contract or modification.

16, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 819.803  Selecting acquisitions for the 8(a) program.

    The contracting officer will specify in writing the time limit for 
SBA to propose an acceptable 8(a) subcontractor. The time limit should 
be between 30 and 45 days, but may be extended by the contracting 
officer.

[50 FR 793, Jan. 7, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 819.804  Evaluation, offering, and acceptance.

    (a) The contracting officer will notify SBA in writing of the time 
limit for contract negotiations in accordance with FAR 19.804-2. The 
time limit, as a minimum, should be 45 days, but may be extended by the 
contracting officer.

<R05>
Sec. 819.806  Pricing the 8(a) contract.

    In order to expedite the 8(a) process, SBA should be informed as 
soon as a disparity between the 8(a) offered price and the estimated 
fair market price is determined. The SBA and the VA contracting office 
should collaborate to determine if the disparity is:
    (a) A result of deficiencies in developing the fair market price, 
thereby requiring revision to the estimate;
    (b) A result of overpricing by the 8(a) company, thereby requiring 
further efforts to negotiate a decrease in the offered price; or
    (c) A legitimate differential which should be funded through the SBA 
business development expense.

[52 FR 37317, Oct. 6, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 819.807  Estimating fair market price.

    (a) Estimating the fair market price is a crucial initial step in 
determining what is a reasonable price for a negotiated 8(a) contract. 
For supplies and equipment, previous prices paid under competitive 
conditions, adjusted for inflation, may provide necessary data to make 
such an estimate.
    (b) Estimating fair market price for such services as architect-
engineer and construction may be accomplished through independent cost 
estimates and other pertinent data obtained from SBA when the estimated 
fair market price is not fully supportable from available documentation

<R05>
Sec. 819.7001  Policy.

    (a) Pub. L. 93-237 amended the Small Business Act by directing SBA 
to give ``special consideration'' to veterans of the Armed Forces in all 
SBA programs. Consistent with and in furtherance of that statute, it is 
the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to encourage 
participation by veteran-

[[Page 190]]

owned and operated small businesses, including Vietnam era and disabled, 
in VA acquisitions.
    (b) All VA facilities having procurement requirements for which 
veteran-owned small businesses are known sources, will take affirmative 
action to solicit these firms and assist them in participating in VA 
acquisition opportunities.

<R05>
Sec. 819.7002  Definition.

    A veteran-owned small business is a small business that is at least 
51 percent owned by a veteran who also controls and operates the 
business. Control in this context means exercising the power to make 
policy decisions. Operate in this context means actively involved in 
day-to-day management. For purposes of this definition, eligible 
veterans include:
    (a) Veterans who served in the U.S. Armed Forces and were discharged 
or released under conditions other than dishonorable.
    (b) Vietnam era veterans who served for a period of more than 180 
days, any part of which was between August 5, 1964, and May 7, 1975, and 
were discharged other than dishonorably.
    (c) Disabled veterans with a minimum compensable disability of 30 
percent, or a veteran who was discharged for disability.

<R05>
Sec. 819.7003  Procedure.

    (a) To obtain information on business development for veteran-owned 
businesses and further identify veteran-owned small businesses, 
contracting officers shall contact the veterans affairs officers at the 
local SBA district office. When counselling small businesses, 
contracting officers shall determine if the business is veteran-owned 
and operated and ensure that SF 129s are completed properly to identify 
veteran-owned business.
    (b) The veteran-owned business representation in 852.219-70 shall be 
included in all solicitations.

[55 FR 49901, Dec. 3, 1990]


<R05>
Sec. 819.7004  Waiver of the use of veteran-owned firms.

    It is the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide 
veteran-owned firms every opportunity to participate in the acquisition 
process. A contracting office wishing to waive this policy for a 
particular procurement involving other than small purchase procedures 
must first process a VA Form 90-2268. The contracting officer must 
clearly document on VAF 90-2268 the reasons that eligible veteran-owned 
firms are not intended to be solicited or quotations sought for the 
particular procurement. Exempt from this reporting requirement are SBA 
8(a) acquisitions.

         Subpart 831.70_Contract Cost Principles and Procedures


<R05>
Sec. 831.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart contains general cost principles and procedures for the 
determination and allowance of costs in connection with the negotiation 
and administration of cost reimbursement type contracts pertaining to 
the furnishing of vocational rehabilitation, education, and training to 
eligible veterans under chapter 31 of Title 38, United States Code.


<R05>
Sec. 831.7001  Allowable costs under cost reimbursement vocational 
          rehabilitation and education contracts or agreements.


<R05>
Sec. 831.7001-1  Tuition.

    (a) Except as provided in this section, when the contractor has a 
customary cost of tuition the charge to the Department of Veterans 
Affairs may not exceed that charged to similarly circumstanced 
nonveteran students; provided that where the contractor has more than 
one standard charge for the same service, the charge to the Department 
of Veterans Affairs will be the lowest price for the entire course, 
semester, quarter, or term which is offered or published.
    (b) VA will not normally pay tuition or incidental fees to 
institutions or establishments furnishing apprentice or other training 
on-the-job. VA may pay:
    (1) For such charges customarily made by nonprofit workshop or 
similar establishment for providing work adjustment training to 
similarly circumstanced nonveterans even though an incentive wage is 
paid the trainee as part of the training; or
    (2) For certain training expenses incurred by an employer providing 
on-the-job training following rehabilitation to the point of 
employability when such additional training is determined to be 
necessary by VA.
    (c) When the total cost of instruction is paid from Federal funds or 
a portion of the cost is covered by grants from the Federal Government, 
i.e., Smith-Hughes or other laws, excluding Federal Land Grant Funds, 
such subsidy

[[Page 199]]

will be taken into consideration in determining the charge to the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. The term, Federal Land Grant Funds, 
refers to those received under the Morrill-Nelson Act (Morrill Acts of 
1862 and 1890 and the Nelson amendment of 1907) and section 22 of the 
Bankhead-Jones Act of 1935.
    (d) Payments on behalf of a veteran who receives a fellowship, 
scholarship, grant-in-aid, assistantship, or similar award in complete 
or partial payment of tuition or fees or both will be made in accordance 
with the following:
    (1) The award will reduce, to the extent of the award, the amount of 
tuition or fee or both that is payable by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.
    (2) Awards which are not paid in cash, except those which are made 
specifically for the purpose of defraying the cost of room and board in 
dormitories which will be disregarded, will reduce to the extent of the 
award the charges for which the Department of Veterans Affairs is 
responsible.
    (3) Cash awards may be retained by the veterans and will not be 
deducted from charges ordinarily paid by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs.
    (4) Waivers of tuition and fees provided under law by States or 
other Government authority will be utilized to reduce the charges 
payable by Department of Veterans Affairs in accordance with such 
waivers.
    (e) Enrollment fees in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of 
registration may be paid, provided the institution or training 
establishment usually makes such a charge, and it does not exceed that 
charge made to other students or trainees.

[49 FR 12615, Mar. 29, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 40064, Sept. 29, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 831.7001-2  Special services or courses.

    Special services or courses are those services requested by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs which are over and above those 
customarily required by the institution for similarly circumstanced 
nonveterans and are considered by the contracting officer to be 
necessary for the rehabilitation of the trainee. The costs of such 
special services or courses will be negotiated prior to being requested 
by the Department of Veterans Affairs.


<R05>
Sec. 831.7001-3  Books, supplies and equipment required to be personally 
          owned.

    (a) Reimbursement for books, supplies, or equipment and referred to 
as supplies, will be made as provided in this section.
    (1) Reimbursement will be made for those supplies customarily 
required to be owned personally by all students taking the same course 
or courses except that reimbursement may be made for items which are not 
specifically required by the school for pursuit of the course, but are 
determined to be needed by VA because of the demands of the course, 
general possession by other students, and the disadvantage imposed on 
the veterans by not having the item. In no instance will the supplies be 
in a greater variety, quality, or amount than required of nonveteran 
students. In this instance required is in contradistinction to requested 
or desirable to have or necessary for a future profession or job but not 
required by the institution of all students in the course.
    (2) When supplies are available in several prices, grades, or 
qualities, reimbursement may be made only for such quality or grade that 
will meet the requirements.
    (3) Partial payment agreements in which the Department of Veterans 
Affairs shares payment with the veterans is not allowable.
    (4) The costs incurred by the institution in connection with the 
veteran's thesis such as typing, printing, microfilming, or otherwise 
reproducing the required number of copies; research expenses when 
certified by the veterans committee chairman, major professor, 
department head, or appropriate dean that such expenses are required in 
order to complete the course requiring the preparation of a thesis are 
considered as supplies and are authorized for reimbursement.
    (5) When the institution operates a bookstore or supply store for 
all students the reimbursement for supplies issued to trainees will be 
no greater than charges made to nonveteran students.

[[Page 200]]

    (6) Where the institution, training establishment, or employer 
arranges for issuance of supplies to all students by stores or 
establishments not institutionally owned and to pay such store or 
establishment for supplies issued to trainees, reimbursement is 
allowable provided the charges are no greater than those paid by 
nonveterans or to the institutions whichever is the lesser.
    (7) Supplies purchased by the institution specifically for trainees 
will be reimbursed at the net cost to the institution.
    (8) Where the institution does not provide or arrange for issuance 
of generally required books, tools and supplies for students attending 
the facility, the institution, in cooperation with VA, may designate 
certain stores and establishments to provide generally required books, 
tools and supplies for veterans pursuing a vocational rehabilitation 
program. The vendor will be reimbursed in the same manner as for 
supplies provided or arranged for by the institutions.
    (9) Where it is customary in a survey subject to permit each student 
to obtain the aggregate of books for the subject on a rental basis 
(commonly referred to as a rental set) and the ownership or permanent 
possession by the student is not required, reimbursement is authorized 
for the rental charge provided it does not exceed the charge made to 
nonveteran students.
    (10) Educational and training institutions furnishing supplies to 
trainees which are required to be owned personally or on a rental basis 
by all students pursuing the same or similar course may be compensated 
for such services in an amount not exceeding 10 percent of the allowable 
charge for the supplies furnished or rented except:
    (i) Where the tuition covers the charges for supplies or rentals or 
a stipulated fee is assessed all students, handling charges are not 
allowable.
    (ii) The handling charge is not allowable for Government-owned books 
procured by the institution from the Library of Congress.
    (iii) In cases where an item of equipment will exceed $50 in cost, 
effort will be made to secure a lower handling charge than for those 
costing a lesser amount. The agreed percent for such handling charges 
will be included in the contract or added as an addendum.

[49 FR 12615, Mar. 29, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 40064, Sept. 29, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 831.7001-4  Medical services and hospital care.

    (a) VA may pay the customary student health fee when payment of the 
fee is required for similarly circumstanced nonveterans. If payment of 
the fee is not required for similarly circumstanced nonveterans payment, 
payment may be made if it is determined by the Veterans Health 
Administration that such payment is in the best interest of the veteran 
and the government.
    (b) Where medical services or hospital care not covered by the 
customary students health fee are available in the school operated 
facilities or arrangements have been made by the institution with 
doctors and hospitals in the immediate area, reimbursement by the 
Veterans Benefits Administration for such services may be made in a 
contract for such services provided that the Director, VA Medical 
Center, determines:
    (1) That such arrangements are necessary to provide timely medical 
care for veterans attending the facility under provisions of Chapter 31; 
and
    (2) The general rates established for such services do not exceed 
the rates established by the Under Secretary for Health.
    (c) VA may reimburse a rehabilitation facility for incidental 
medical services provided during a veteran's program at the facility.

nonveteran pursuing the same or comparable course or courses will be 
made when:
    (1) The supplies are entirely consumed in the fabrication of a 
required project.
    (2) The supplies are not consumed but are of such a nature that they 
cannot be salvaged from the end product for reuse for further 
instructions by disassembling or dismantling the end product.
    (b) Reimbursement for consumable instructional supplies is not 
allowable when:
    (1) The supplies can be salvaged for reuse.
    (2) The supplies used in a project which has been elected by the 
student as an alternate class project in order to produce an end product 
of greater value than that which is normally required to learn the 
skills of the occupation and which will become his property upon 
completion.
    (3) The supplies used in a project which has been selected by the 
institution to provide the student with a more elaborate end product 
than is required to provide adequate instruction as an inducement to the 
veteran to elect a particular course of study.
    (4) The salable value of the end product is equal to or greater than 
the cost of the supplies used in its fabrication or assembly and a 
reasonable use has not been made of such supplies so that they are not 
readily salvaged from the end product to be reused for instructional 
purposes.
    (5) The end product is of permanent value and retained by the 
institution.
    (6) A third party provides the articles or equipment for repair or 
improvement and for which he or she would otherwise pay a commercial

<R05>
Sec. 833.103  Protests to the Department.

    (a) Filing of protests. (1) An interested party may protest to the 
contracting officer or, as an alternative, may request an independent 
review by filing a protest with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Acquisition and Materiel Management, Acquisition Administration Team, 
or, for solicitations issued by the Office of Facilities Management, the 
Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office of Facilities Management. A 
protest filed with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and 
Materiel Management or the Chief Facilities Management Officer will not 
be considered if the interested party has a protest on the same or 
similar issues pending with the contracting officer.
    (2) Protests must be in writing and addressed as follows:
    (i) Contracting officer protests--address where offer/bid is to be 
submitted;
    (ii) Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel 
Management, Acquisition Administration Team, Department of Veterans 
Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420; or
    (iii) Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office of Facilities 
Management, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., 
Washington, DC 20420.
    (3) Protests regarding certain issues may be dismissed by VA without 
consideration of the merits or forwarded to another agency for 
appropriate action. Among these protests are the following:
    (i) Contract administration. The administration of an existing 
contract is within the discretion of the contracting agency. Disputes 
between a contractor and the Department are resolved pursuant to the 
disputes clause of the contract and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. 
41 U.S.C. 601-613.
    (ii) Small business size standards and standard industrial 
classification. Challenges of established size standards or the size 
status of particular firms, and challenges of the selected standard 
industrial classification are for review solely by the Small Business 
Administration. 15 U.S.C. 637(b)(6); 13 CFR 121.3-6 (1984).
    (iii) Small business certificate of competency program. Any referral 
made to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section 8(b)(7) of 
the Small Business Act, or any issuance of a certificate of competency 
or refusal to issue a certificate under such section is not reviewed in 
accordance with bid protest procedures absent a showing of possible 
fraud or bad faith on the part of Government officials.
    (iv) Protests under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act. Since 
contracts are let under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act to the 
Small Business Administration at the contracting officer's discretion 
and on such terms as agreed upon by the procuring agency and the Small 
Business Administration, the decision to place or not to place a 
procurement under the 8(a) subcontract are not subject to review absent 
a showing of possible fraud or bad faith on the part of Government 
officials or that regulations may have been violated. 15 U.S.C. 637(a).
    (v) Affirmative determination of responsibility by the Contracting 
Officer. Because a determination that a bidder or offeror is capable of 
performing a contract is based in large measure on subjective judgments 
which generally are not readily susceptible to reasoned review, an 
affirmative determination of responsibility will not be reviewed, absent 
a showing that such determination was made fraudulently or in bad faith 
or that definitive responsibility

[[Page 204]]

criteria in the solicitation were not met.
    (vi) Walsh-Healey Public Contract Act. Challenges of the legal 
status of a firm as a regular dealer or manufacturer within the meaning 
of the Walsh-Healey Act is for determination solely by the procuring 
agency, the Small Business administration (if a small business is 
involved) and the Secretary of Labor. 41 U.S.C. 35-45.
    (vii) Subcontractor protests. The contracting agency will not 
consider subcontractor protests except where the subcontract is by or 
for the Government.
    (viii) Judicial proceedings. The contracting agency will not 
consider protests where the matter involved is the subject of litigation 
before a court of competent jurisdiction.
    (b) Where appropriate, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) 
procedures may be used to resolve protests at any stage in the protest 
process. The Department of Veterans Affairs Board of Contract Appeals 
(VABCA) is an independent and neutral entity within the Department of 
Veterans Affairs and is available to serve as the third-party neutral 
(Neutral) for bid protests. If ADR is used, the Department of Veterans 
Affairs will not furnish any documentation in an ADR proceeding beyond 
what is allowed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
    (c) Action upon receipt of protest. For protests filed with the 
contracting officer, the head of the contracting activity (HCA) shall be 
the approving official for the determinations identified in FAR 
33.103(f)(1) and (f)(3). If the HCA is also the contracting officer, the 
approving official shall be the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Acquisition and Materiel Management. For protests filed with the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management, Acquisition 
Administration Team, or the Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office 
of Facilities Management, those individuals shall be the approving 
officials for the determinations identified in FAR 33.103(f)(1) and 
(f)(3).
    (d) Requests for GAO advance decisions. When a written protest has 
been filed with the contracting officer and the contracting officer 
considers it desirable to do so, the contracting officer may request an 
advance decision from the Comptroller General. The submission to the 
Comptroller General will be sent through the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Acquisition and Materiel Management, Acquisition Administration Team 
or the Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office of Facilities 
Management, as appropriate, and will include the material indicated in 
FAR 33.104(a)(2). The contracting officer shall notify the protesting 
individual or firm promptly in writing of the decision of the 
Comptroller General.
    (e) Protest after award. When a written protest is filed with the 
contracting officer after contract award:
    (1) If FAR 33.103(f)(3) requires suspension of contract performance, 
the contracting officer shall seek to obtain a mutual agreement with the 
contractor to suspend performance on a no-cost basis and, if successful, 
shall document the suspension with a supplemental agreement. If 
unsuccessful, the contracting officer shall issue a stop-work order in 
accordance with contract clause FAR 52.233-3, Protest After Award.
    (2) If suspension of contract performance is not required by FAR 
33.103(f)(3) and if the contracting officer determines that the award 
was proper, the contracting officer shall furnish the protester a 
written explanation of the basis for the award which is responsive to 
the allegations of the protest. The contracting officer shall advise the 
protester that the protester may appeal the determination to the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management, Acquisition 
Administration Team, or the Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office 
of Facilities Management, in the case of a contract awarded by the 
Office of Facilities Management, or the Comptroller General, as 
specified in internal Department guidance.
    (3) If suspension of contract performance is not required by FAR 
33.103(f)(3) but the contracting officer determines that the award is 
questionable, the contracting officer may consult with the Office of the 
General Counsel (025) and shall advise the contractor of the protest and 
invite the contractor to

[[Page 205]]

submit comments and relevant information. The contracting officer shall 
submit the case promptly to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
Acquisition and Materiel Management, Acquisition Administration Team, or 
the Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office of Facilities 
Management, in the case of a contract awarded by the Office of 
Facilities Management, who may consult with the Office of the General 
Counsel (025) and who shall either advise the contracting officer of the 
appropriate action to take, or submit the case to the Comptroller 
General for a decision. The contracting officer shall provide interested 
parties with a copy of the final decision.
    (f) Agency appellate review of contracting officer's protest 
decision. An interested party may request an independent review of a 
contracting officer's protest decision by filing an appeal with the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management or, 
for solicitations issued by the Office of Facilities Management, with 
the Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office of Facilities 
Management. To be considered timely, the appeal must be received by the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management or, 
for solicitations issued by the Office of Facilities Management, by the 
Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office of Facilities Management, 
within 10 calendar days of the date the interested party knew, or should 
have known, whichever is earlier, of the basis for the appeal. Appeals 
shall be addressed as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this 
section. Appeals shall not extend GAO's timeliness requirements for 
appeals to GAO. By filing an appeal as provided herein, an interested 
party may waive its rights to further appeal to the Comptroller General 
at a later date. Agency responses to appeals submitted to the agency 
shall be reviewed and concurred in by the Office of the General Counsel 
(025).

<R05>
Sec. 833.104  Protests to GAO.

    (a) General. (1) When a protest before or after award has been 
lodged with the General Accounting Office (GAO), the contracting officer 
will prepare a report to be forwarded to the Deputy Assistant Secretary 
for Acquisition and Materiel Management, Acquisition Resources Service, 
or the Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office of Facilities 
Management, as appropriate, within 5 workdays after receipt of verbal 
notice of the protest or receipt of a copy of the protest, whichever 
occurs first, for preparation of the Department report. The report 
should include a copy of the documentation indicated in FAR 
33.104(a)(3)(ii).
    (2) Contracting officers are responsible for the notification 
procedures outlined in FAR 33.104(a)(2).
    (b) Protests before award. When the Department has received notice 
from the GAO of a preaward protest filed directly with GAO, award shall 
not be made until the matter is resolved, unless the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management, Acquisition Resources 
Service, or the Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office of 
Facilities Management, as appropriate, approves the head of contracting 
activity findings required by FAR 33.104(b)(1) and GAO has been notified 
pursuant to FAR 33.104(b)(2).
    (c) Protests after award. Protests after award shall be handled in a 
manner consistent with procedures identified for protests before award. 
Although persons involved or affected by the filing of a protest may be 
limited, at least the contractor shall be furnished the notice of the 
protest and its basis by the contracting officer. When VA receives from 
GAO, within ten calendar days after award, a notice of protest filed 
directly with GAO, and it is determined by the head of the contracting 
activity pursuant to FAR 33.104(c)(2) that contract performance should 
be authorized, the written findings will first be approved by the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management, Acquisition 
Resources Service (or the Chief Facilities Management Officer, Office of 
Facilities Management, as appropriate), and

[[Page 206]]

the GAO must be notified as required by FAR 33.104(c)(3).

    (a) When a dispute cannot be settled by agreement and a final 
decision under the Disputes clause of the contract is necessary, the 
contracting officer shall furnish the contractor his/her final decision 
in the matter.
    (b) The decision must be identified as a final decision, be in 
writing, and include a statement of facts in sufficient detail to enable 
the contractor to fully understand the decision and the basis on which 
it was made. It will normally be in the form of a statement of the claim 
or other description of the dispute with necessary references to the

decision shall, in addition to the material required by FAR 
33.211(a)(4), contain the following:

``equal'' products, the bidders must be placed on notice that the 
``brand name or equal'' provisions of the ``Material and Workmanship'' 
clause found at FAR 52.236.5 and any other provision which may authorize 
the submission of an ``equal'' product, will not apply. In order to 
properly alert bidders to this requirement, the clause found at 852.236-
90, ``Restriction on Submission and Use of Equal Products,'' shall be 
included in the solicitation.

Sec. 836.371  Notice to proceed.

    (a) Construction contractors will be given a written ``Notice to 
Proceed'' with the work. A letter notice to proceed will normally be 
sent only after performance and payment bonds and the completed contract 
forms, where applicable, have been returned by the contractor and are 
accepted by the contracting officer. If the urgency of the work or other

properly executed VA Form 10-2065, Funeral Arrangements, requesting that 
funeral and burial services for the deceased be procured. Burial will be 
made in the nearest National Cemetery having available grave space.
    (b) The contracting officer will enter into negotiations with local

carrier or by hearse from the VA facility to the funeral home and to the 
place of burial, any charges for an outside (shipment) box, and the 
charges for securing all necessary permits for removal or shipment of 
the body. These costs are not chargeable against the $300 allowance.

Part I, paragraph 14.37, the contracting officer will designate the 
Chief, Medical Administration Service, or representative, or the person 
designated by the medical center director to perform these functions, to 
be responsible for the medical inspection of the mortuary services 
performed and inspection of the merchandise furnished. This designee 
will also be responsible for certifying receipt on the receiving report.
    (e) The head of the contracting activity will assist the Chief, 
Medical Administration Service, or the person designated by the medical 
center director to perform these functions, in developing the local 
procedures specified in Veterans Health Administration Manual M-1, Part 
I, paragraph 14.37c.

within the statutory allowance, he/she will, prior to taking any further 
action, secure from the facility director a written determination that 
the disposition of the remains must be accomplished by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs as an administrative necessity. The facility director 
will also authorize in writing the expenditure of such additional funds 
as may be necessary for this purpose. The amount of these additional 
funds will be held to the minimum, keeping in mind, however, that the 
deceased must be given a proper and fitting interment.

<R05>
Sec. 842.101  Policy.

    (a) Pursuant to FAR policy encouraging interagency cross-servicing 
in field contract support services, contracting officers of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs will utilize the support services of 
other agencies to the extent feasible. Examples of such services are: 
preaward surveys; quality assurance and technical inspection of contract 
items; and review of contractors' procurement systems. Requirements for 
support services available from any other Government department or 
agency will be obtained on the basis of an approved negotiated 
interagency support agreement.
    (b) An interagency support agreement is a written instrument of 
understanding executed between the parties to the agreement. The 
agreement should state clearly the accord which has been reached between 
the two parties involved, especially the obligations assumed by the 
rights granted each. The agreement will be specific with respect to 
resources to be provided by both the supplying and receiving activities. 
It will also provide for funding and reimbursement arrangements, and 
clauses permitting revisions, modifications thereto, or cancellation 
thereof, will be included.

systems and subsequently waiving certifications for future 
solicitations; and
    (5) The cost of the inspections.
    (c) When either the USDA or the Department of Commerce is indicated 
as the inspection activity, the solicitation will also provide that the 
contractor is responsible for:
    (1) Arranging and paying for inspection services.

[[Page 219]]

    (2) Obtaining from the inspection activity a certificate indicating 
the product complies with specifications. Such certificate, or copy,

       Report of Employment Under Commercial Activities (OCT 1988)

    (a) Consistent with the Government post-employment conflict of 
interest regulations, the contractor shall give adversely affected 
Federal employees the right of first refusal for all employment openings 
under this contract for which they are qualified.
    (b) Definitions. (1) An ``adversely affected Federal employee'' is:
    (i) Any permanent Federal employee who is assigned to the government 
commercial activity, or
    (ii) Any employee identified for release from his or her competitive 
level or separated as a result of the contract.
    (2) ``Employment openings'' are position vacancies created by this 
contract which the contractor is unable to fill with personnel in

[[Page 227]]

the contractor's employee at the time of the contract award, including 
positions within a 50 mile radius of the commercial activity which 
indirectly arise in the contractor's organization as a result of the 
contractor's reassignment of employees due to the award of this 
contract.
    (3) The ``contract start date'' is the first day of contractor 
performance.
    (c) Filling employment openings. (1) For a period beginning with 
contract award and ending 90 days after the contract start date, no 
person other than an adversely affected Federal employee on the current 
listing provided by the contracting officer shall be offered an 
employment opening until all adversely affected and qualified Federal 
employees identified by the contracting officer have been offered the 
job and refused it.
    (2) The contractor may select any person for an employment opening 
when there are no qualified adversely affected Federal employees on the 
latest current listing provided by the contracting officer.
    (d) Contracting reporting requirements. (1) No later than five 
working days after contract award the contractor shall furnish the 
contracting officer with the following:
    (i) A list of employment openings including salaries and benefits,
    (ii) Sufficient job application forms for adversely affected Federal 
employees.
    (2) By contract start date, the contractor shall provide the 
contracting officer with the following:
    (i) The names of adversely affected Federal employees offered an 
employment opening,
    (ii) The date the offer was made,
    (iii) A brief description of the position,
    (iv) The date of acceptance of the offer and the effective date of 
employment,
    (v) The date of rejection of the offer, if applicable for salary and 
benefits contained in the rejected offer, and
    (vi) The names of any adversely affected Federal employees who 
applied but were not offered employment and the reason(s) for 
withholding an offer.
    (3) For the first 90 days after the contract start date, the 
contractor shall provide the contracting officer with the names of all 
persons hired or terminated under the contract within five working days 
of such hiring or termination.
    (e) Information provided to the contractor. (1) No later than 10 
working days after the contract award, the contracting officer shall 
furnish the contractor a current list of adversely affected Federal 
employees exercising the right of first refusal, along with their 
completed job application forms.
    (2) Between the contract award and start dates, the contracting 
officer shall inform the contractor of any reassignment or transfer of 
adversely affected employees to other Federal positions.
    (3) For a period up to 90 days after contract start date, the 
contracting officer will periodically provide the contractor with an 
updated listing of adversely affected Federal employees reflecting 
employees recently released from their competitive levels or separated 
as a result of the contract award.
    (f) Qualification determination. The contractor has a right under 
this clause to determine adequacy of the qualifications of adversely 
affected Federal employees for any employment openings. However, an 
adversely affected Federal employee who held a job in the Government 
commercial activity which directly corresponds to an employment opening 
shall be considered qualified for the job. Questions concerning the 
qualifications of adversely affected Federal employees for specific 
employment openings shall be referred to the contracting officer for 
determination. The contracting officer's determination shall be final 
and binding on all parties.
    (g) Relation to other statutes, regulations and employment policies. 
The requirements of this clause shall not modify or alter the 
contractor's responsibilities under statutes, regulations or other 
contract clauses pertaining to the hiring of veterans, minorities or 
handicapped persons.
    (h) Penalty for Noncompliance. Failure of the contractor to comply 
with any provision of this clause may be grounds for termination for 
default.

Sec. 852.209-70  Organizational conflicts of interest.

    The following provision will be used as prescribed in 809.508-2:

             Organizational Conflicts of Interest (APR 1984)

    (a) The offeror represents to the best of his/her knowledge and 
belief that the award of the contract would not involve organizational 
conflicts of interest as defined in this representation. The term 
organizational conflicts of interests shall mean that a relationship 
exists whereby an offeror or a contractor (including his/her chief 
executive, directors, proposed consultants and subcontractors) has 
interests which may: (1) Diminish his/her capacity to give impartial, 
technically sound, objective assistance and advice or may otherwise 
result in a biased work product; or (2) result in an unfair competitive 
advantage. It does not include the ``normal flow of benefits'' from the 
performance of a contract.

[[Page 228]]

    (b) Based on this representation and any other information solicited 
by the contracting officer, it may be determined organizational 
conflicts of interest exist which would warrant disqualifying the 
contractor for award of the contract unless the organizational conflicts 
of interest can be mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction 
by negotiating terms and conditions of the contract to that effect. In 
the case of a formally advertised solicitation, the apparent successful 
offeror may enter into a supplemental agreement which mitigates the 
organizational conflicts of interest.
    (c) Nondisclosure or misrepresentations of organizational conflicts 
of interest at the time of the offer, or arising as a result of a 
modification to the contract, may result in the termination of the 
contract at no expense to the Government.

                           (End of provision)

    (a) Solicitations and requests for proposals for technical medical 
and other technical equipment and devices issued by a field facility 
will normally require the contractor to provide operating and 
maintenance manuals.
    (b) The purpose of the requirement is for the manufacturer to 
provide the Department of Veterans Affairs a manual or groups of manuals 
that will allow the in-house repair of the equipment purchased. Unless 
the facility Chief, Engineering Service, indicates that such service 
manuals are not needed, each invitation for bid or request for proposal 
for technical medical or other technical equipment and devices will 
include the following clauses for operating and maintenance manuals:

                     Service Data Manual (NOV 1984)

    (a) The successful bidder will supply operation/service 
(maintenance) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity 
specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a 
minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) 
provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as 
well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) 
of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in 
(b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between 
manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, 
however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his responsibility in 
supplying the technical data called for therein.
    (b) Title Page and Front Matter--The title page shall include the 
equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and 
the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a

description of the function of each connector along with the connector 
type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of 
repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).
    (e) Section III, Operation--Section III will fully describe the 
operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control 
with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for 
each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as 
it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more 
illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any 
preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. 
Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they 
may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. 
Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment 
connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. 
For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many 
operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is 
quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form 
of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators Manual 
does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the 
minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein.
    Where applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software 
shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user 
modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment 
items with

[[Page 229]]

software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample 
outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance 
Section to identify equipment malfunctions which are software related.
    (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation-- This section shall 
describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. 
Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by 
technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics 
and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. 
The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and 
proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description 
shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit 
descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph 
(i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, 
simplified schematics should be included in this section.
    (g) Section V, Maintenance-- The maintenance section shall contain a 
list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive 
maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test 
equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be 
designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those 
items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically 
for the equipment being supplied. Sufficent data will be provided to 
enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive 
maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the 
manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the 
recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual 
inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit 
calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary 
to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for 
realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include 
either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or 
waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of 
conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause 
and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test 
technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable 
cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the 
preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted 
on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must 
be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included 
to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to 
restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall 
be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for 
selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, 
shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.
    (h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List--The replacement parts list 
shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical 
and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true 
manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.
    (i) Section VII, Drawings--Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be 
included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols 
and shall include the reference designations and component values or 
type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be 
engineering or productions sketches.

                             (End of clause)

    (c) Solicitations and requests for proposals for mechanical 
equipment (other than technical medical equipment and devices) issued by 
a field facility will include the following clause:

                     Service Data Manual (NOV 1984)

    The contractor agrees to furnish two copies of a manual, handbook or 
brochure containing operating, installation, and maintenance

Sec. 852.211-71  Guarantee clause.

    (a) When the bid or proposal will result in any purchase of 
equipment, the following clause will be used:

                          Guarantee (NOV 1984)

    The contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, 
workmanship and performance for a period of ___,\1\ said guarantee to 
run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The 
contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, 
replacement of all parts and material which are found to be defective 
during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be 
furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if 
installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the 
continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if 
installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of 
installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the 
contractor. \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Normally, insert one year. If industry policy covers a shorter 
or longer period, i.e., 90 days or for the life of the equipment, insert 
such period.
    \2\ The above clause will be modified to conform to standards of the 
industry involved.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Affairs facility), solicitations, including those for construction, will 
include the following provision:

                        Special Notice (APR 1984)

    Descriptive literature. The submission of descriptive literature 
with offers is not required and voluntarily submitted descriptive 
literature which qualifies the offer will require rejection of the 
offer.
    However, within 5 days after award of contract, the contractor will 
submit to the contracting officer literature describing the equipment 
he/she intends to furnish and indicating strict compliance with the 
specification requirements.
    The contracting officer will, by written notice to the contractor 
within 20 calendar days after receipt of the literature, approve, 
conditionally approve, or disapprove the equipment proposed to be 
furnished. The notice of approval or conditional approval will not 
relieve the contractor from complying with all requirements of the 
specifications and all other terms and conditions of this contract. A 
notice of conditional approval will state any further action required of 
the contractor. A notice of disapproval will cite reasons therefor.
    If the equipment is disapproved by the Government, the contractor 
will be subject to action under the Default provision of this contract. 
However, prior to default action the contractor will be permitted a 
period (at least 10 days) under that clause to submit additional 
descriptive literature on equipment originally offered or descriptive 
literature on other equipment.
    The Government reserves the right to require an equitable adjustment 
of the contract price for any extension of the delivery schedule 
necessitated by additional descriptive literature evaluations.

                           (End of provision)

    (b) The descriptive literature to be furnished by the contractor 
after award in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section is subject

    (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been 
identified in the schedule by a ``brand name or equal'' description, 
such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, 
and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will 
be satisfactory. Bids offering ``equal'' products (including products of 
the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) 
will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in 
the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient 
characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
    (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in his bid that he is 
offering an ``equal'' product, his bid shall be considered as offering a 
brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
    (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an ``equal'' product, the 
brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in 
the space provided in the Invitation for Bids, or such product shall be 
otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the 
determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the 
responsibility of the Government and will be based on information 
furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other 
information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO 
BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or 
securing any information which is not identified in the bid and 
reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure 
that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a 
part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, 
illustration, drawings or other information) necessary for the 
purchasing activity to: (i) Determine whether the product offered meets 
the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and 
(ii) establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the 
Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The 
information furnished may include specific references to information 
previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the 
purchasing activity.
    (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it 
conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall: 
(i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed 
modifications, and (ii) clearly mark any descriptive material to show 
the proposed modifications.
    (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product 
conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids 
will not be considered.

    (a) Contract work accomplished on the site by laborers, mechanics, 
and foremen/forewomen on the contractor's payroll and under his/her 
direct supervision shall be included in establishing the percent of work 
to be performed by the contractor. Cost of material and equipment 
installed by such labor may be included. The work by contractor's 
executive, supervisory and clerical forces shall be excluded in 
establishing compliance with the requirements of ths clause.
    (b) The contractor shall submit, simultaneously with schedule of 
costs required by Payments under Fixed-Price Construction Contract 
provision of the General Conditions of these specifications, a statement 
designating the branch or branches of contract work to be performed with 
his/her forces. The approved schedule of costs will be used in 
determining value of a branch or branches, or portions therof, of the 
work for the purpose of this article.
    (c) If, during the progress of work hereunder, the contractor 
requests a change in the branch or branches of the work to be performed 
by his/her forces and the contracting officer determines it to be in the 
best interests of the Government, the contracting officer may, at his/
her discretion, authorize a change in such branch or branches of said 
work. Nothing contained herein shall permit a reduction in the 
percentage of work to be performed by the contractor with his/her 
forces, it being expressly understood that this is a contract 
requirement without right or privilege of reduction.
    (d) In the event the contractor fails or refuses to meet the 
requirement of paragraph (a) of this clause, it is expressly agreed that 
the contract price will be reduced by 15 percent of the value of that 
portion of the percentage requirement which is accomplished by others. 
For the purposes of this clause, it is agreed that 15 percent is an 
acceptable estimate of the contractor's overhead and profit, or mark-up, 
on that portion of the work which the contractor fails or refuses to 
perform, with his/her own forces, in accordance with paragraph (a) of 
this clause.

activity of the construction schedule required by Section 01311, NETWORK 
ANALYSIS SYSTEM, a responsibility code for all activities of the network 
for which the contractor's forces will perform the work. The cost of 
these activities will be used in determining the portions of the total 
contract work to be executed by the contractor's forces for the purpose 
of this article.
    (c) If, during progress of work hereunder, the contractor requests a 
change in activities of work to be performed by contractor's forces and 
the contracting officer determines it to be in the best interest of the 
Government, the contracting officer may, at contracting officers' 
discretion, authorize a change in such activities of said work.

                           Guaranty (APR 1984)

    (a) Unless otherwise specifically provided for in the contract or

and equipment furnished under this contract are in accordance with the 
contract requirements. The contractor also guarantees that when 
installed all materials and equipment will be free from defects and will 
remain so for a period of at least one year from the date of acceptance 
by the Government.
    (b) If defects of any kind should develop during the period such 
guarantees are in force, the contracting officer shall immediately

the contractor the costs he/she (the contractor) would have incurred had 
he/she been required to effect repair or replacement.
    (c) Any correction or replacement of parts, materials, equipment, 
supplies or construction made pursuant to the provisions of this clause

duration as that set forth in (a) above and shall run from the date that 
such parts, materials, equipment, supplies or construction are replaced 
or corrected and accepted by the Government.

repair or replace, any damages to the site, buildings, or contents 
thereof that are caused by inferior or defective workmanship, or the use 
of inferior or defective materials or equipment in the performance of 
this contract. The contracting officer shall immediately notify the 
contractor in writing when such damage occurs. The Government shall have 
the right to require the contractor to repair or replace such damaged 
areas or equipment, or elect to permit such damage to remain as is and 
assess the contractor the costs he/she would have incurred had he/she 
been required to effect repair or replacement.
    (e) Should the contractor fail to proceed promptly, after 
notification by the contracting officer, to repair or replace any 
inferior or defective work, material, or equipment, or damage to the 
site, buildings, or contents, thereof, caused by inferior or defective 
work, or the use of inferior or defective materials, or equipment, the 
Government may have such work, material, equipment or damage repaired or 
replaced and charge all costs incident thereto to the contractor.

shall be subject to the elections set forth above unless otherwise 
provided in such special guaranties.
    (g) The decision of the contracting officer as to liability of the 
contractor under this clause is subject to the appeal procedures

    Supplement I (JAN 1988) If the specifications include guarantee 
period services, add the following paragraph (g) and redesignate 
paragraph (g) in the basic text as paragraph (h).

    (g) Should the contractor fail to prosecute the work or fail to 
proceed promptly to provide guarantee period services after notification 
by the contracting officer, the Government may, subject to the default 
clause contained at FAR section 52.249-10, Default (Fixed-Price 
Construction), and after allowing the contractor 10 days to correct and 
comply with the contract, terminate the right to proceed with the work 
(or the separable part of the work) that has been delayed or 
unsatisfactorily performed. In this event, the Government may take over 
the work and complete it by contract or otherwise, and may take 
possession of and use any materials, appliance, and plant on the work 
site necessary for completing the work. The contractor and its sureties 
shall be liable for any damages to the Government resulting from the 
contractor's refusal or failure to complete the work within this 
specified time, whether or not the contractor's right to proceed with 
the work is terminated. This liability includes any increased costs 
incurred by the Government in completing the work.

suppliers.
    (c) The Government or its representatives will not undertake to

[[Page 240]]

                      Work Coordination (APR 1984)

    The contractor shall be responsible to the Government for acts and 
omissions of his/her own employees, and subcontractors and their 
employees. The contractor shall also be responsible for coordination of 
the work of the trades, subcontractors, and material suppliers. The 
contractor shall, in advance of the work, prepare coordination drawings 
showing the location of openings through slabs, the pipe sleeves and 
hanger inserts, as well as the location and elevation of utility lines, 
including, but not limited to, conveyor systems, pneumatic tubes, ducts, 
and conduits and pipes 2 inches and larger in diameter. These drawings, 
including plans, elevations, and sections as appropriate shall clearly 
show the manner in which the utilities fit into the available space and 
relate to each other and to existing building elements. Drawings shall 
be of appropriate scale to satisfy the previously stated purposes, but 
not smaller than \3/8\-inch scale. Drawings may be composite (with 
distinctive colors for the various trades) or may be separate but fully 
coordinated drawings (such as sepias or photographic paper 
reproducibles) of the same scale. Separate drawings shall depict 
identical building areas or sections and shall be capable of being 
overlaid in any combination. The submitted drawings for a given area of 
the project shall show the work of all trades which will be involved in 
that particular area. Six complete composite drawings or six complete 
sets of separate reproducible drawings shall be received by the 
Government not less than 20 days prior to the scheduled start of the 
work in the area illustrated by the drawings, for the purpose of showing 
the contractor's planned methods of installation. The objectives of such 
drawings are to promote carefully planned work sequence and proper trade 
coordination, in order to assure the expeditious solutions of problems 
and the installation of lines and equipment as contemplated by the 
contract documents while avoiding or minimizing additional costs to the 
contractor and to the Government. In the event the contractor, in 
coordinating the various installations and in planning the method of 
installation, finds a conflict in location or elevation of any of the 
utilities with themselves, with structural items or with other 
construction items, he/she shall bring this conflict to the attention of 
the contracting officer immediately. In doing so, the contractor shall 
explain the proposed method of solving the problem or shall request 
instructions as to how to proceed if adjustments beyond those of usual 
trades coordination are necessary. Utilities installation work will not 
proceed in any area prior to the submission and completion of the 
Government review of the coordinated drawings for that area, nor in any 
area in which conflicts are disclosed by the coordination drawings until 
the conflicts have been corrected to the satisfaction of the contracting 
officer. It is the responsibility of the contractor to submit the 
required drawings in a timely manner consistent with the requirements to 
complete the work covered by this contract within the prescribed 
contract time.

    For contracts that do not contain a section entitled ``Network 
Analysis System (NAS),'' the clause entitled ``Payments under Fixed-
Price Construction Contracts'' in FAR 52.232-5 will be supplemented as 
follows:

      Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts (APR 1984)

    The clause entitled ``Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction 
Contracts'' in FAR 52.232-5 is implemented as follows:
    (a) Retainage:
    (1) The contracting officer may retain funds:
    (i) Where performance under the contract has been determined to be 
deficient or the contractor has performed in an unsatisfactory manner in 
the past; or
    (ii) As the contract nears completion, to ensure that deficiencies 
will be corrected and that completion is timely.
    (2) Examples of deficient performance justifying a retention of 
funds include, but are not restricted to, the following:
    (i) Unsatisfactory progress as determined by the contracting 
officer;
    (ii) Failure to meet schedule in Schedule of Work Progress;
    (iii) Failure to present submittals in a timely manner; or
    (iv) Failure to comply in good faith with approved subcontracting 
plans, certifications or contract requirements.
    (3) Any level of retention shall not exceed 10 percent either where 
there is determined to be unsatisfactory performance, or when the 
retainage is to ensure satisfactory completion. Retained amounts shall 
be paid promptly upon completion of all contract requirements, but 
nothing contained in this subparagraph shall be construed as limiting 
the contracting officer's right to withhold funds under other provisions 
of the contract or in accordance with the general law and regulations 
regarding the administration of Government contracts.

[[Page 241]]

    (b) The contractor shall submit a schedule of cost to the 
contracting officer for approval within 30 calendar days after date of 
receipt of notice to proceed. Such schedule will be signed and submitted 
in triplicate. The approved cost schedule will be one of the bases for 
determining progress payments to the contractor for work completed. This 
schedule shall show cost by the branches of work for each building or 
unit of the contract, as instructed by the resident engineer.
    (1) The branches shall be subdivided into as many subbranches as are 
necessary to cover all component parts of the contract work.
    (2) Costs as shown on this schedule must be true costs and, should 
the resident engineer so desire he/she may require the contractor to 
submit the original estimate sheets or other information to substantiate 
detailed makeup of schedule.
    (3) The sum of subbranches, as applied to each branch, shall equal 
the total cost of such branch. The total costs of all branches shall 
equal the contract price.
    (4) Insurance and similar items shall be prorated and included in 
the cost of each branch of the work.
    (5) The cost schedule shall include separate cost information for 
the systems listed below. The percentages listed below are proportions 
of the cost listed in contractor's cost schedule and identify, for 
payment purposes, the value of the work to adjust, correct and test 
systems after the material has been installed. Payment of the listed 
percentages will be made only after the contractor has demonstrated that 
each of the systems is substantially complete and operates as required 
by the contract.

    (6)(i) The contractor shall at the time of contract award furnish 
the total cost of the guarantee period services in accordance with 
specification section(s) covering guarantee period services. The 
contractor shall submit, within 15 calendar days of notice to proceed, 
the guarantee period performance program which shall include an itemized 
accounting of the number of workhours required to perform the guarantee

service, all of which will be subject to the contracting officer's 
approval.
    (ii) The cost of the guarantee service shall be prorated on an 
annual basis and paid in equal monthly payments by VA during the period 
of guarantee. In the event the installer does not perform satisfactorily 
during this period, all payments may be withheld, and the contracting 
officer shall inform the contractor of the unsatisfactory performance, 
allowing the contractor 10 days to correct deficiencies and comply with 
the contract. The guarantee period service is subject to those 
provisions as set forth in the Payment and Default clauses.

Sec. 852.236-83  Payments under fixed-price construction contracts 
          (including NAS).

    For contracts that contain a section entitled ``Network Analysis 
System (NAS),'' the clause entitled ``Payments under Fixed-Price 
Construction Contracts'' in FAR 52.232-5 is supplemented as follows:

      Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts (APR 1984)

    The clause entitled ``Payments under Fixed-Price Construction 
Contracts in FAR 52.232-5 is implemented as follows:
    (a) Retainage:
    (1) The contracting officer may retain funds:
    (i) Where performance under the contract has been determined to be 
deficient or the contractor has performed in an unsatisfactory manner in 
the past; or
    (ii) As the contract nears completion, to ensure that deficiencies 
will be corrected and that completion is timely.
    (2) Examples of deficient performance justifying a retention of 
funds include, but are not restricted to, the following:
    (i) Unsatisfactory progress as determined by the contracting 
officer;
    (ii) Failure either to meet schedules in Section Network Analysis 
System (NAS), or to process the Interim Arrow Diagram/Complete Project 
Arrow Diagram;
    (iii) Failure to present submittals in a timely manner; or
    (iv) Failure to comply in good faith with approved subcontracting 
plans, certifications or contract requirements.
    (3) Any level of retention shall not exceed 10 percent either where 
there is determined to be unsatisfactory performance, or when the 
retainage is to ensure satisfactory completion. Retained amounts shall 
be paid promptly upon completion of all contract requirements, but 
nothing contained in this subparagraph shall be construed as limiting 
the contracting officer's right to withhold funds under other provisions 
of the contract or in accordance with the general law and regulations 
regarding the administration of Government contracts.
    (b) The contractor shall submit a schedule of costs in accordance 
with the requirements of Section Network Analysis System (NAS) to the 
contracting officer for approval within 90 calendar days after date of 
receipt of notice to proceed. The approved cost schedule will be one of 
the bases for determining progress payments to the contractor for work 
completed.
    (1) Costs as shown on this schedule must be true costs and, should 
the resident engineer so desire, he/she may require the contractor to 
submit his/her original estimate sheets or other information to 
substantiate the detailed makeup of the cost schedule.
    (2) The total costs of all activities shall equal the contract 
price.
    (3) Insurance and similar items shall be prorated and included in 
each activity cost of the critical path method (CPM) network.
    (4) The CPM network shall include a separate cost loaded activity 
for adjusting and testing of the systems listed below. The percentages 
listed below will be used to determine the cost of adjust and test 
activities and identify, for payment purposes, the value of the work to 
adjust, correct and test systems after the material has been installed.
    (5) Payment for adjust and test activities will be made only after 
the contractor has demonstrated that each of the systems is 
substantially complete and operates as required by the contract.

    (6)(i) The contractor shall show on the critical path method (CPM) 
network the total cost of the guarantee period services in accordance 
with the guarantee period service section(s) of the specifications. This 
cost shall be priced out when submitting the CPM cost loaded network. 
The cost submitted shall be subject to the approval of the contracting 
officer. The activity on the CPM shall have money only and not activity 
time.
    (ii) The contractor shall submit with the CPM a guarantee period 
performance program which shall include an itemized accounting of the 
number of workhours required to perform the guarantee period service on 
each piece of equipment. The contractor shall also submit the 
established costs including employee fringe benefits and what the

    This clause is to be used on projects which do not include a section 
entitled ``Network Analysis System (NAS).''

[[Page 244]]

The cost-loaded activity network serves the same general purpose as the 
schedule of work progress.

                  Schedule of Work Progress (NOV 1984)

    (a) The contractor shall submit with the schedule of costs, a 
progress schedule that indicates the anticipated installation of work 
versus the elapsed contract time, for the approval of the contracting 
officer. The progress schedule time shall be represented in the form of 
a bar graph with the contract time plotted along the horizontal axis. 
The starting date of the schedule shall be the date the contractor 
receives the ``Notice to Proceed.'' The ending date shall be the 
original contract completion date. At a minimum, both dates shall be 
indicated on the progress schedule. The specific item of work, i.e., 
``Excavation'', ``Floor Tile'', ``Finish Carpentry'', etc., should be 
plotted along the vertical axis and indicated by a line or bar at which 
time(s) during the contract this work is scheduled to take place. The 
schedule shall be submitted in triplicate and signed by the contractor.
    (b) The actual percent completion will be based on the value of 
installed work divided by the current contract amount. The actual 
completion percentage will be indicated on the monthly progress report.
    (c) The progress schedule will be revised when individual or 
cumulative time extensions of 15 calendar days or more are granted for 
any reason. The revised schedule should indicate the new contract 
completion date and should reflect any changes to the installation 
time(s) of the items of work affected.
    (d) The revised progress schedule will be used for reporting future 
scheduled percentage completion.

forth in section GR, General Requirements, of this contract. It is the 
result of a study of wage conditions in the locality and establishes the 
minimum hourly rates of wages and fringe benefits for the described 
classes of labor in accordance with applicable law. No increase in the 
contract price will be allowed or authorized because of payment of wage 
rates in excess of those listed.
    (b) The contractor shall submit the required copies of payrolls to 
the contracting officer through the resident engineer or engineer 
officer, when acting in that capacity. Department of Labor Form WH-347, 
Payroll, available from the Superintendent of Documents, Government 
Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, may be used for this purpose. If, 
however, the contractor or subcontractor elects to use an individually

Sec. 852.236-88  Contract changes.

    The clauses, entitled ``Changes'' in FAR 52.243-4 and ``Differing 
Site Conditions'' in FAR 52.236-2 will be supplemented with the 
following two clauses. Both clauses shall be included in the 
contract.The clause in paragraph (a) of this section will apply to 
negotiated

[[Page 245]]

changes exceeding $500,000 and does not provide ceiling rates for 
indirect expenses. Such expenses will be included as part of the 
submission of certified cost and pricing data, will be negotiated by the 
contracting officer and will be audited in accordance with 815.505-5. 
When the negotiated change will be less than $500,000 the clause 
specified in paragraph (b) of this section will apply. Proposals over 
$100,000 and not exceeding $500,000 shall be accompanied by certificates 
of current cost or pricing data. If cost and pricing data are required 
for proposals of $100,000 or less, the contracting officer may require 
that it be certified in accordance with FAR 15.403-4(a)(2). It must be 
emphasized that the indirect cost rates are ceiling rates only, and the 
contracting officer will negotiate the indirect expense rates within the 
ceiling limitations. The clauses are a result of an approved FAR 
deviation pursuant to subpart 801.4.
    (a) Applicable to changes costing over $500,000:

   Changes--Supplement (For Changes Costing Over $500,000) (JUN 1987)

    The clauses entitled ``Changes'' in FAR 52.243-4 and ``Differing 
Site Conditions'' in FAR 52.236-2 are supplemented as follows:
    (a) When requested by the contracting officer, the contractor shall 
submit proposals for changes in work to the resident engineer. 
Proposals, to be submitted within 30 calendar days after receipt of 
request, shall be in legible form, original and two copies, with an 
itemized breakdown that will include material, quantities, unit prices, 
labor costs (separated into trades), construction equipment, etc. (Labor 
costs are to be identified with specific material placed or operation 
performed.) The contractor must obtain and furnish with a proposal an 
itemized breakdown as described above, signed by each subcontractor 
participating in the change regardless of tier. When certified cost or 
pricing data are required under FAR Subpart 15.403, the cost or pricing 
data shall be submitted in accordance with FAR 15.403-5.
    (b) When the necessity to proceed with a change does not allow 
sufficient time to negotiate a modification or because of failure to 
reach an agreement, the contracting officer may issue a change order 
instructing the contractor to proceed on the basis of a tentative price 
based on the best estimate available at the time, with the firm price to 
be determined later. Furthermore, when the change order is issued, the 
contractor shall submit a proposal for cost of changes in work within 30 
calendar days.
    (c) The contracting officer will consider issuing a settlement by 
determination to the contract, if the contractor's proposal required by 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause is not received within 30 calendar 
days, or if agreement has not been reached.
    (d) Bond premium adjustment, consequent upon changes ordered, will 
be made as elsewhere specified at the time of final settlement under the 
contract and will not be included in the individual change.

                             (End of clause)

    (b) Applicable to changes costing $500,000 or less:

  Changes--Supplement (For Changes Costing $500,000 or Less) (JUN 1987)

    The clauses entitled ``Changes'' in FAR 52.243-4 and ``Differing 
Site Conditions'' in FAR 52.236-2 are supplemented as follows:
    (a) When requested by the contracting officer, the contractor shall 
submit proposals for changes in work to the resident engineer. 
Proposals, to be submitted within 30 calendar days after receipt of 
request, shall be in legible form, original and two copies, with an 
itemized breakdown that will include material, quantities, unit prices, 
labor costs (separated into trades), construction equipment, etc. (Labor 
costs are to be identified with specific material placed or operation 
performed.) The contractor must obtain and furnish with a proposal an 
intemized breakdown as described above, signed by each subcontractor 
participating in the change regardless of tier. When certified cost or 
pricing data are required under FAR 15.403 for proposals over $100,000, 
the cost of pricing data shall be submitted in accordance with FAR 
15.403-5. No itemized breakdown will be required for proposals amounting 
to less than $1,000.
    (b) When the necessity to proceed with a change does not allow 
sufficient time to negotiate a modification or because of failure to 
reach an agreement, the contracting officer may issue a change order 
instructing the contractor to proceed on the basis of a tentative price 
based on the best estimate available at the time, with the firm price to 
be determined later. Furthermore, when the change order is issued, the 
contractor shall submit a proposal for cost of changes in work within 30 
calendar days.
    (c) The contracting officer will consider issuing a settlement by 
determination to the contract, if the contractor's proposal required by 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause is not received within 30 calendar 
days, or if agreement has not been reached.
    (d) Allowances not to exceed 10 percent each for overhead and profit 
for the party performing the work will be based on the

[[Page 246]]

value of labor, material, and use of construction equipment required to 
accomplish the change. As the value of the change increases, a declining 
scale will be used in negotiating the percentage of overhead and profit. 
Allowable percentages on changes will not exceed the following: 10 
percent overhead and 10 percent profit on the first $20,000; 7\1/2\ 
percent overhead and 7\1/2\ percent profit on the next $30,000; 5 
percent overhead and 5 percent profit on balance over $50,000. Profit 
shall be computed by multiplying the profit percentage by the sum of the 
direct costs and computed overhead costs.
    (e) The prime contractor's or upper-tier subcontractor's fee on work 
performed by lower-tier subcontractors will be based on the net 
increased cost to the prime contractor or upper-tier subcontractor, as 
applicable. Allowable fee on changes will not exceed the following: 10 
percent fee on the first $20,000; 7\1/2\ percent fee on the next 
$30,000; and 5 percent fee on balance over $50,000.
    (f) Not more than four percentages, none of which exceed the 
percentages shown above, will be allowed regardless of the number of 
tiers of subcontractors.
    (g) Where the contractor's or subcontractors' portion of a change 
involves credit items, such items must be deducted prior to adding 
overhead and profit for the party performing the work. The contractor's 
fee is limited to the net increase to contractor of subcontractors' 
portions cost computed in accordance herewith.
    (h) Where a change involves credit items only, a proper measure of 
the amount of downward adjustment in the contract price is the 
reasonable cost to the contractor if he/she had performed the deleted 
work. A reasonable allowance for overhead and profit are properly 
includable as part of the downward adjustment for a deductive change. 
The amount of such allowance is subject to negotiation.
    (i) Cost of Federal Old Age Benefit (Social Security) tax and of 
Workmen's Compensation and Public Liability insurance appertaining to 
changes are allowable. While no percentage will be allowed thereon for 
overhead or profit, prime contractor's fee will be allowed on such items 
in subcontractor's proposals.
    (j) Overhead and contractor's fee percentages shall be considered to 
include insurance other than mentioned herein, field and office 
supervisors and assistants, security police, use of small tools, 
incidental job burdens, and general home office expenses and no separate 
allowance will be made therefor. Assistants to office supervisors 
include all clerical, stenographic and general office help. Incidental 
job burdens include, but are not necessarily limited to, office 
equipment and supplies, temporary toilets, telephone and conformance to 
OSHA requirements. Items such as, but not necessarily limited to, review 
and coordination, estimating and expediting relative to contract changes 
are associated with field and office supervision and are considered to 
be included in the contractor's overhead and/or fee percentage.
    (k) Bond premium adjustment, consequent upon changes ordered, will 
be made as elsewhere specified at the time of final settlement under the 
contract and will not be included in the individual change.

Sec. 852.236-89  Buy American Act.

    The Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a-d) requires that only domestic 
construction material shall be used in the performance of contracts for 
construction. To clarify VA's position on foreign material, the 
following provision will be included in solicitations for construction 
that include FAR clause 52.225-5, Buy American Act--Construction 
Materials:

                       Buy American Act (NOV 1984)

    (a) Reference is made to the clause entitled ``Buy American Act--
Construction Materials,'' FAR 52.225-5.
    (b) Notwithstanding a bidder's right to offer identifiable foreign 
material in its bid pursuant to the above provisions, VA does not 
anticipate accepting an offer that includes foreign items.
    (c) If a bidder chooses to submit a bid which includes foreign 
materials, that bidder must provide a listing of the specific foreign 
materials he/she intends to use and a price for said materials. Because 
VA has a strong preference for domestic items, bidders are strongly 
urged to include bid prices for comparable domestic construction 
material. If VA determines not to accept foreign items and no comparable 
domestic items are provided the entire bid will be rejected.
    (d) Any foreign item proposed after award will be rejected unless 
the bidder proves to VA's satisfaction: (1) it was impossible to request 
the exemption prior to award, and (2) said domestic construction 
material is no longer available, or (3) where the price has escalated so 
dramatically after the contract has been awarded that it would be 
unconscionable to require performance at that price. The determinations 
require by (1), (2) or (3) of this paragraph shall be at the sole 
discretion of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

[[Page 247]]

    (e) By signing this bid, the bidder declares that all articles, 
materials and supplies for use on the project shall be domestic unless

    (a) Signing of the bid shall be deemed to be a certification by the 
bidder that:
    (1) Bidder is a construction contractor who owns, operates, or 
maintains a place of business, regularly engaged in construction, 
alteration or repair of buildings, structures, communication facilities, 
or other engineering projects, including furnishing and installing of 
necessary equipment; or
    (2) If newly entering into a construction activity, bidder has made 
all necessary arrangements for personnel, construction equipment, and 
required licenses to perform construction work; and
    (3) Upon request, prior to award, bidder will promptly furnish to 
the Government a statement of facts in detail as to bidder's previous 
experience (including recent and current contracts), organization 
(including company officers), technical qualifications, financial 
resources and facilities available to perform the contemplated work.
    (b) Unless otherwise provided in this contract, where the use of 
optional materials or construction is permitted the same standard of 
workmanship, fabrication and installation shall be required irrespective 
of which option is selected. The contractor shall make any change or 
adjustment in connecting work or otherwise necessitated by the use of 
such optional material or construction, without additional cost to the 
Government.
    (c) When approval is given for a system component having functional 
or physical characteristics different from those indicated or specified, 
it is the responsibility of the contractor to furnish and install 
related components with characteristics and capacities compatible with 
the approved substitute component as required for systems to function as 
noted on drawings and specifications. There shall be no additional cost 
to the Government.
    (d) In some instances it may have been impracticable to detail all 
items in specifications or on drawings because of variances in 
manufacturers' methods of achieving specified results. In such instances 
the contractor will be required to furnish all labor, materials, 
drawings, services and connections necessary to produce systems or 
equipment which are completely installed, functional, and ready for 
operation by facility personnel in accordance with their use.
    (e) Claims by the contractor for delay attributed to unusually 
severe weather must be supported by climatological data covering the 
period and the same period for the 10 preceding years. When the weather 
in question exceeds in intensity or frequency the 10 year average, the 
excess experienced shall be considered ``unusually severe.'' Comparison 
shall be on a monthly basis. Whether or not unusually severe weather in 
fact delays the work will depend upon the effect of weather on the 
branches of work being performed during the time under consideration.

value(s) of standard coverage(s) prevailing within the local community 
as to the specific medical specialty, or specialties, concerned, or such 
higher amount as the Contracting Officer deems necessary to protect the 
Government's interests]. However, if the Contractor is an entity or a 
subdivision of a State that either provides for self-insurance or limits 
the liability or the amount of insurance purchased by State entities, 
then the insurance requirement of this contract shall be fulfilled by 
incorporating the provisions of the applicable State law.
    (b) An apparently successful offeror, upon request of the 
Contracting Officer, shall, prior to contract award, furnish evidence of 
the insurability of the offeror and/or of all health-care providers who 
will perform under this contract. The submission shall provide evidence 
of insurability concerning the medical liability insurance required by

insurance, or limitations on liability or insurance.
    (c) The Contractor shall, prior to commencement of services under 
the contract, provide to the Contracting Officer Certificates of 
Insurance or insurance policies evidencing the required insurance 
coverage and an endorsement stating that any cancellation or material 
change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be

written notice to the Contracting Officer. Certificates or policies 
shall be provided for the Contractor and/or each health-care provider 
who will perform under this contract.
    (d) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer if it, or

notification shall provide evidence that the Contractor and/or health-
care providers will meet all the requirements of this clause, including

Sec. 852.237-71  Indemnification and insurance (vehicle and aircraft 
          service contracts).

    (a) Contracts for vehicle and aircraft services will utilize the 
following clause as provided in 828.306.

[[Page 249]]

                Indemnification and Insurance (APR 1984)

    (a) Indemnification. The contractor expressly agrees to indemnify 
and save the Government, its officers, agents, servants, and employees 
harmless from and against any and all claims, loss, damage, injury, and 
liability, however caused, resulting from, arising out of, or in any way 
connected with the performance of work under this agreement. Further, it 
is agreed that any negligence or alleged negligence of the Government, 
its offficers, agents, servants, and employees, shall not be a bar to a 
claim for indemnification unless the act or omission of the Government, 
its officers, agents, servants, and employees is the sole, competent, 
and producing cause of such claims, loss, damage, injury, and liability. 
At the option of the contractor, and subject to the approval by the 
contracting officer of the sources, insurance coverage may be employed 
as guaranty of indemnification.
    (b) Insurance. Satisfactory insurance coverage is a condition 
precedent to award of a contract. In general, a successful bidder must 
present safisfactory evidence of full compliance with State and local 
requirements, or those below stipulated, whichever are the greater. More 
specifically, workman's compensation and employer's liability coverage 
will conform to applicable State law requirements for the service 
contemplated, whereas general liability and automobile liability of 
comprehensive type, shall in the absence of higher statutory minimums, 
be required in the amounts per vehicle used of not less than $200,000 
per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and $20,000 per 
occurrence for property damage. State approved sources of insurance 
coverage ordinarily will be deemed acceptable to the Veterans' 
Administration installation, subject to timely certifications by such 
sources of the types and limits of the coverages afforded by the sources 
to the bidder. (In those instances where airplane service is to be used, 
substitute the word ``aircraft'' for ``automobile'' and ``vehicle'' and 
modify coverage to require aircraft public and passenger liability 
insurance of at least $200,000 per passenger and $500,000 per occurrence 
for bodily injury, other than passenger liability, and $200,000 per 
occurrence for property damage. Coverage for passenger liability bodily 
injury shall be at least $200,000 multiplied by the number of seats or 
passengers, whichever is greater.)

                             (End of clause)

    (b) Exceptions. The provisions of this 852.237-71 do not apply to 
emergency or sporadic ambulance service authorized by VA Manual MP-1, 
Part II, Chapter 3: Provided, That such service is not used solely for 
the purpose of avoiding entering into a continuing contract. Provided 
further, That such services will be obtained from firms known to carry 
insurance coverage in accordance with State or local requirements.

training sessions so that the conference facilities of VA installations 
in the city where the conference is held may be used.

space is not available, through hotels and motels which offer free 
conference facilities in exchange for a stipulated number of lodging 
reservations for participants. Surcharges per lodging or increased room 
rates, to offset the cost of the conference room, shall be considered 
payment for such space.
    (4) In the event none of these is available on the desired dates, 
consideration will be given to rescheduling the conference to avail VA 
of the use of facilities without payment of a fee.
    (5) If none of the above is practical, rental conference space will 
be obtained. Complete documentation of efforts to secure free conference 
space, as outlined above, will be maintained in the purchase order file. 
The costs of coffee, refreshments, meals, lodging, tips and other 
supplies and services not directly related to the presentations within 
the conference space are not allowable.
    (c) The conference coordinator of the requesting organization will 
continue to be responsible for individual room reservations, including

[61 FR 20493, May 7, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 871.102  Authorization for repairs to properties.

    (a) Except as provided in this subpart, Directors, Loan Guaranty 
Officers, and Assistant Loan Guaranty Officers, VA Regional Offices, are 
authorized to approve a repair program for any Department of Veterans 
Affairs property acquired under Chapter 37, Title 38, United States 
Code, where the cost does not exceed $25,000. A repair program means the 
aggregate amount of the proposed contracts which are contemplated in a 
property analysis by the Loan Guaranty activity.
    (b) In those cases where the expenditure is known or estimated to 
exceed $25,000, the request, together with the loan guaranty folder, 
will be forwarded to the Under Secretary for Benefits for approval.
    (c) During the period when the Department of Veterans Affairs has 
assumed custody of the property from a holder and prior to its 
conveyance to the Deparment of Veterans Affairs pursuant to 38 CFR 
36.4320, repairs are authorized not in excess of $3,500 when appropriate 
to make the property ready for sale at an earler date than would 
otherwise be possible if the repair program was delayed until such time 
as the Department of Veterans Affairs acquired absolute title. In those 
cases where the expenditure is known or estimated to exceed $3,500, the 
request, together with the loan guarantee folder, will be forwarded to 
the Under Secretary for Benefits for approval.
    (d) No repairs may be made to property by the holder when it has 
continued custody except for emergeny repairs not in excess of $500 
unless adequate notice has been given the Director, VA Regional Office. 
Emergency repairs as applied in this paragraph will be deemed to mean 
those requiring immediate action to preserve the property from serious 
damage or to correct a situation imminently dangerous to life or limb, 
and includes the initial cleanup of the property in order to prevent the 
risk of damage by fire or vandalism.
    (e) An approved management broker may be authorized, at the time a 
property is assigned, to incur expenses for fuel and utilities or other 
recurring items which are required to be furnished by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs to its tenants or are required in the maintenance of 
the property. Advance blanket authorizations to management brokers will 
be limited to repairs not in excess of $500 in any transaction, (the 
management broker will either submit receipts with the invoice or 
maintain such receipts for inspection). Expenditures in excess of $500 
require prior approval of the Director, Regional Office, having 
jurisdiction of the property. Repair jobs may not be split to circumvent 
this restriction.

Sec. 871.104  Qualification of bidders.

    (a) Qualification of bidders shall be established in accordance with 
procedures outlined in FAR Subpart 9.1 and subpart 809.1 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Management brokers are not considered acceptable bidders for 
repair contracts due to their close association on a fee basis with the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. This restriction would apply equally to 
any contracting firm in which the management broker has an interest and 
in which it could be presumed that such firm would have an advantage 
over the other bidders. This does not preclude the performance of work 
by management brokers of a routine recurring maintenance category or 
minor repairs by personnel employed directly on the payroll of the 
broker. In these cases, it must be established that any charges for such 
services are not in excess of the prevailing fees for like services in 
the area.


<R05>
Sec. 871.106  Lien waivers.

    (a) Contracts in the amount of $2,500 or more will contain a 
requirement that the contractor will sign a formal release in full or a 
lien waiver before payment may be made. The release or waiver will 
accompany the contractor's invoice.
    (b) Contractors will be required to notify the Director, Regional 
Office, of any subcontractors for services or materials in excess of 
$2,500. Such subcontractors will be required to sign the release or 
waiver jointly with the prime contractor or to execute release or waiver 
in the subcontractor's own name.
    (c) Prior to any authorized partial payment the contractor will be 
required to execute a release or waiver.
    (d) Due to the variations of local law, no standard release or 
waiver is prescribed. Each release or waiver will be prepared in 
accordance with local law and will be in form acceptable by the District 
Counsel.

maintain any mechanics lien or claim against the aforesaid premises.

    (b) Contracts in the amount of $2,500 or more where there is doubt 
as to the final responsibility of the contractor will provide maximum 
potection to the Government by including such requirements as are 
available under local law. Advice and approval of any contract 
stipulation or legal stipulations against liens will be obtained from 
the District Counsel.

noncontinuing service such as registration fee, etc.
    (b) The period for which payment of charges may be made will be the

on the Department of Veterans Affairs until such time as a supplemental 
agreement is negotiated to the contract.
    (b) Minor changes in course or course material not affecting the 
length of the course or number of lessons and not lowering the 
educational value of the course or the quality of the course material 
such as revision of text, the substitution of a newer lesson for an

directed or pointed specifically to veterans.
    (g) The rates, fees, and charges are not in excess of those charged 
nonveterans.

    Source: 81005, Dec. 22, 2000, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 903.901  Scope.

    This subpart implements the DOE Contractor Employee Protection 
Program as set forth at 10 CFR part 708. Part 708 establishes criteria 
and procedures for the investigation, hearing, and review of allegations 
from DOE contractor employees of employer reprisal resulting from 
employee disclosure of information to DOE, to Members of Congress, or to 
the contractor; employee participation in proceedings before Congress or 
pursuant to this subpart; or employee refusal to engage in illegal or 
dangerous activities, when such disclosure, participation, or refusal 
pertains to employer practices which the employee believes to be unsafe; 
to violate laws, rules, or regulations; or to involve fraud, 
mismanagement, waste, or abuse.


<R05>
Sec. 903.902  Definition.

    Contractor, as used in this subpart, has the meaning contained in 10 
CFR 708.2.

[[Page 269]]


<R05>
Sec. 903.903  Applicability.

    10 CFR part 708 is applicable to complaints of retaliation filed by 
employees of contractors, and subcontractors, performing work on behalf 
of DOE directly related to DOE-owned or leased facilities, if the 
complaint stems from a disclosure, participation, or refusal described 
in 10 CFR 708.5.


<R05>
Sec. 903.970  Remedies.

    (a) Contractors found to have retaliated against an employee in 
reprisal for such disclosure, participation or refusal are required to 
provide relief in accordance with decisions issued under 10 CFR part 
708.
    (b) 10 CFR part 708 provides that for the purposes of the Contract 
Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 605 and 606), a final decision issued pursuant 
to 10 CFR part 708 shall not be considered to be a claim by the 
Government against a contractor or a decision by the contracting officer 
subject to appeal. However, a contractor's disagreement and refusal to 
comply with a final decision could result in a contracting officer's 
decision to disallow certain costs or to terminate the contract for 
default. In such case, the contractor could file a claim under the 
Disputes clause of the contract regarding the disallowance of cost or 
the termination of the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 903.971  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.203-70, 
Whistleblower Protection for Contractor Employees, in contracts that 
involve work to be done on behalf of DOE directly related to activities 
at DOE-owned or leased sites.

Subpart 904.70_Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence Over Contractors


<R05>
Sec. 904.7000  Purpose.

    This subpart sets forth the Department of Energy policies and 
procedures regarding foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) 
over contractors. The procedures are designed to protect against an 
undue risk to the common defense and security which may result if 
classified information or special nuclear material is made available to 
DOE contractors or subcontractors who are owned, controlled, or 
influenced by foreign governments, individuals, or organizations. The 
procedures require certain offeror(s) and contractors/subcontractors to 
submit information which will help DOE to determine whether award of a 
contract to a firm, or continued performance of a contract by a firm, 
may pose an undue risk to the common defense and security because of the 
foreign influence.

[49 FR 11941, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9104, Feb. 25, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 904.7001  Applicability.

    The provisions of this subpart shall apply to all offeror(s), 
contractors, and subcontractors who will or do have access to classified 
information or a significant quantity of special nuclear material as 
defined in 10 CFR part 710. In this subpart, the term ``contractor'' 
shall also mean subcontractor at any tier, the term ``contract'' shall 
also mean subcontract at any tier, and the term ``special nuclear 
material'' shall also mean significant quantity of special nuclear 
material as defined in 10 CFR part 710.

[49 FR 11941, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9104, Feb. 25, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 904.7002  Definitions.

    Contracting officer means the DOE contracting officer.
    Foreign interest means any of the following:
    (1) Foreign government or foreign government agency or 
instrumentality thereof;
    (2) Any form of business enterprise organized under the laws of any 
country other than the United States or its possessions;
    (3) Any form of business enterprise organized or incorporated under 
the laws of the U.S., or a State or other jurisdiction within the U.S. 
which is owned, controlled, or influenced by a foreign government, 
agency, firm, corporation, or person, or
    (4) Any person who is not a U.S. citizen.
    Foreign ownership, control, or influence means the situation where 
the degree of ownership, control, or influence over an offeror(s) or a 
contractor by a foreign interest is such that a reasonable basis exists 
for concluding that compromise of classified information or special 
nuclear material may possibly result.

[49 FR 11941, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9104, Feb. 25, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 904.7003  Disclosure of foreign ownership, control, or influence.

    (a) If a contract requires a contractor to have access to classified 
information or a significant quantity of special nuclear material, the 
DOE must determine whether access to the information or material by a 
contractor who is or may be subject to FOCI may pose an undue risk to 
the common defense and security before a contract can be awarded.
    (b) If during the performance of a contract, the contractor comes 
under FOCI, then the DOE must determine whether any further access to 
the classified information or special nuclear material may pose an undue 
risk to the

[[Page 272]]

common defense and security through the possible compromise of that 
information or material. If the DOE determines that such a threat or 
potential threat exists, the contracting officer shall consider the 
alternatives of negotiating an acceptable method of isolating the 
foreign interest which owns, controls, or influences the contractor or 
terminating the contract.
    (c) It is essential for the DOE to obtain information about FOCI 
which is sufficient to help the Department determine whether award of a 
contract to a person or firm, or the continued performance of a contract 
by a person or firm, may pose undue risk to the common defense and 
security. Therefore, the provision specified at 952.204-73 shall be 
included in solicitations that involve offeror(s) or contractors that 
are subject to 904.7001.
    (d) The contracting officer shall not award or extend any contract 
subject to this subpart, exercise any options under a contract, modify 
any contracts subject to this subpart, or approve or consent to a 
subcontract subject to this subpart unless:
    (1) The contractor provides the information required by the 
solicitation provision at 48 CFR 952.204-73, and
    (2) The contracting officer has made a positive determination in 
accordance with 48 CFR 904.7004.

[49 FR 11941, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9104, Feb. 25, 1994; 62 
FR 42073, Aug. 5, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 904.7004  Findings, determination, and contract award or 
          termination.

    (a) Based on the information disclosed by the offeror(s) or 
contractor, and after consulting with the DOE Office of Safeguards and 
Security, the contracting officer must determine that award of a 
contract to an offeror(s) or continued performance of a contract by a 
contractor will not pose an undue risk to the common defense and 
security. The contracting officer need not prepare a separate finding 
and determination addressing FOCI; however, the memorandum of 
negotiation shall include a discussion of the applicability of this 
subpart and the resulting determination.
    (b) In those cases where FOCI does exist, and the DOE determines 
that an undue risk to the common defense and security may exist, the 
offeror(s) or contractor shall be requested to propose within a 
prescribed period of time a plan of action to avoid or mitigate the 
foreign influences by isolation of the foreign interest.
    (c) The types of plans that a contractor can propose are: measures 
which provide for physical or organizational separation of the facility 
or organizational component containing the classified information or 
special nuclear material; modification or termination of agreements with 
foreign interests; diversification or reduction of foreign source 
income; assignment of specific security duties and responsibilities to 
board members or special executive level committees; or any other 
actions to negate or reduce FOCI to acceptable levels. The plan of 
action may vary with the type of foreign interest involved, degree of 
ownership, and information involved so that each plan must be negotiated 
on a case by case basis. If the offeror(s) or contractor and the DOE 
cannot negotiate a plan of action that isolates the offeror(s) or 
contractor from FOCI satisfactory to the DOE, then the offeror(s) shall 
not be considered for contract award and affected existing contracts 
with a contractor shall be terminated.

all solicitations for contracts subject to 48 CFR 904.7001.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.204-74, 
Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence Over Contractor, in new 
contracts and contract modifications to existing contracts subject to

circumstances; e.g., when new vehicles are in short supply, the vehicles 
are to be used for experimental or test purposes, or the vehicles are 
acquired from exchange sale. In accordance with DOE-PMR 41 CFR 109-
38.5102, the statutory passenger vehicle allocation requirements for DOE 
shall apply to any purchase of used vehicles except in the case of 
vehicles to be used exclusively for experimental or test purposes.

regulations. Accordingly, the Director of Administration and the Heads 
of Contracting Activities will submit annually to the Director, Office 
of Property Management, within the Headquarters procurement 
organization, for approval, a forecast of plans for the purchase of such 
vehicles during the fiscal year. Such forecast shall be submitted so as 
to arrive at Headquarters on or before December 1 of each year. 
Additionally, the original and 2 copies of requisitions (GSA form 1781) 
for purchase of such vehicles shall also be forwarded to the above 
official for review and certification/approval prior to submission to 
GSA. All such documentation will be reviewed by this official and a 
determination made as to conformance with applicable annual forecasts 
and pertinent public laws and their implementations. (See DOE-PMR 41 CFR 
109-38.13.)

Sec. 909.104-3  Application of standards. (DOE coverage-paragraph (e))

    (e) DOE may select an entity which was newly created to perform the 
prospective contract, including, but not limited to, a joint venture or 
other similarly binding corporate partnership. In such instances when 
making the determination of responsibility pursuant to 48 CFR 9.103, the 
contracting officer may evaluate the financial resources of other 
entities only to the extent that those entities are legally bound, 
jointly and severally if more than one, by means of a performance 
guarantee or other equivalent enforceable commitment to supply the 
necessary resources to the prospective contractor and to assume all 
contractual obligations of the prospective contractor. The guaranteeing 
corporate entity(ies) must be found to have sufficient resources in 
order to satisfy its guarantee.

<R05>
Sec. 909.403  Definitions.

    In addition to the definitions set forth at FAR 9.403, the following 
definitions apply to this subpart:
    Debarring Official. The DOE Debarring Official is the Deputy

Sec. 909.406  Debarment.


<R05>
Sec. 909.406-2  Causes for debarment. (DOE coverage--paragraphs (c) and 
          (d))

    (c) The Debarring Official may debar a contractor for any other 
cause of so serious or compelling a nature that it affects the present 
responsibility of a DOE contractor. Such cause may include but is not 
limited to:
    (1) Commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with 
obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a private contract or 
subcontract; and
    (2) Inexcusable, prolonged, or repeated failure to pay a debt 
(including disallowed costs and overpayments) owed to DOE, provided the 
contractor has been notified of the determination of indebtedness, and 
further provided that the time for initiating any administrative or 
legal action to oppose or appeal the determination of indebtedness has 
expired or that such action, if initiated, has been concluded.
    (d) The Debarring Official may debar a contractor:
    (1) On the basis that an individual or organization is an affiliate 
of a debarred contractor, subject to the requirements of FAR 9.406-1(b) 
and 9.406-3(c);
    (2) For failure to observe the material provisions of a voluntary 
exclusion (see 10 CFR 1036.315 for discussion of voluntary exclusion).


<R05>
Sec. 909.406-3  Procedures. (DOE coverage--paragraphs (a), (b) and (d))

    (a) Investigation and referral. (1) Offices responsible for the 
award and administration of contracts are responsible for reporting to 
both the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Procurement and Assistance 
Management and the DOE Inspector General information about possible 
fraud, waste, abuse, or other wrongdoing which may constitute or 
contribute to a cause(s) for debarment under this subpart. Circumstances 
that involve possible criminal or fraudulent activities must be reported 
to the Office of the Inspector General in accordance with 10 CFR part 
1010, Conduct of Employees, Sec. 1010.217(b), Cooperation with the 
Inspector General.
    (2) At a minimum, referrals for consideration of debarment action 
should be in writing and should include the following information:
    (i) The recommendation and rationale for the referral;
    (ii) A statement of facts;
    (iii) Copies of documentary evidence and a list of all witnesses, 
including addresses and telephone numbers, together with a statement 
concerning their availability to appear at a fact-finding proceeding and 
the subject matter of their testimony;
    (iv) A list of parties including the contractor, principals, and 
affiliates (including last known home and business addresses, zip codes 
and DUNS Number);
    (v) DOE's acquisition history with the contractor, including recent 
experience under contracts and copies of pertinent contracts;
    (vi) A list of any known active or potential criminal 
investigations, criminal or civil proceedings, or administrative claims 
before the Board of Contract Appeals; and
    (vii) A statement regarding the impact of the debarment action on 
DOE programs. This statement is not required for referrals by the 
Inspector General.
    (3) Referrals may be returned to the originator for further 
information or development.
    (b) Decisionmaking process. Contractors proposed for debarment shall 
be afforded an opportunity to submit information and argument in 
opposition to the proposed debarment.
    (1) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in 
which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Debarring 
Official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in 
the administrative record, including any submissions made by the 
contractor. If the respondent fails to submit a timely written response 
to a notice of proposed debarment, the Debarring Official shall notify 
the respondent in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(e) that the contractor is 
debarred.
    (2) In actions not based upon a conviction or civil judgment, the 
contractor may request a fact-finding hearing to resolve a genuine 
dispute of material fact. In its request, the contractor must identify 
the material

[[Page 285]]

facts in dispute and the basis for disputing the facts. If the Debarring 
Official determines that there is a genuine dispute of material fact, 
the Debarring Official shall refer the matter to the Energy Board of 
Contract Appeals for a fact-finding conference.
    (3) Meeting. Upon receipt of a timely request therefor from a 
contractor proposed for debarment, the Debarring Official shall schedule 
a meeting between the Debarring Official and the respondent, to be held 
no later than 30 days from the date the request is received. The 
Debarring Official may postpone the date of the meeting if the 
respondent requests a postponement in writing. At the meeting, the 
respondent, appearing personally or through an attorney or other 
authorized representative, may present and explain evidence that causes 
for debarment do not exist, evidence of any mitigating factors, and 
arguments concerning the imposition, scope, or duration of a proposed 
debarment or debarment.
    (4) Fact-finding conference. The purpose of a fact-finding 
conference under this section is to provide the respondent an 
opportunity to dispute material facts through the submission of oral and 
written evidence; resolve facts in dispute; and provide the Debarring 
Official with findings of fact based, as applicable, on adequate 
evidence or on a preponderance of the evidence. The fact-finding 
conference shall be conducted in accordance with rules consistent with 
FAR 9.406-3(b) promulgated by the Energy Board of Contract Appeals. The 
Energy Board of Contract Appeals will notify the affected parties of the 
schedule for the hearing. The Energy Board of Contract Appeals shall 
deliver written findings of fact to the Debarring Official (together 
with a transcription of the proceeding, if made) within a certain time 
period after the hearing record closes, as specified in the Energy Board 
of Contract Appeals Rules. The findings shall resolve any disputes over 
material facts based upon a preponderance of the evidence, if the case 
involves a proposal to debar, or on adequate evidence, if the case 
involves a suspension. Since convictions or civil judgments generally 
establish the cause for debarment by a preponderance of the evidence, 
there usually is no genuine dispute over a material fact that would 
warrant a fact-finding conference for those proposed debarments based on 
convictions or civil judgments.
    (d) Debarring Official's decision. (4) The Debarring Official's 
final decision shall be based on the administrative record. In those 
actions where additional proceedings are necessary as to disputed 
material facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared and included 
in the final decision. In those cases where the contractor has requested 
and received a fact-finding conference, the written findings of fact 
shall be those findings prepared by the Energy Board of Contract 
Appeals. Findings of fact shall be final and conclusive unless within 15 
days of receipt of the findings, the Department or the respondent 
requests reconsideration, as provided in the Board's Rules, or unless 
set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Energy Board of 
Contract Appeals shall be provided a copy of the Debarring Official's 
final decision.


<R05>
Sec. 909.406-6  Requests for reconsideration of debarment.

    (a) At any time during a period of debarment, a respondent may 
submit to the Debarring or Suspending Official a written request for 
reconsideration of the scope, duration, or effects of the suspension/
debarment action because of new information or changed circumstances, as 
discussed at FAR 9.406-4(c).
    (b) In reviewing a request for reconsideration, the Debarring or 
Suspending Official may, in his or her discretion, utilize any of the 
procedures (meeting and fact-finding) set forth in 48 CFR (DEAR) 
909.406-3 and 909.407-3. The Debarring or Suspending Official's final 
disposition of the reconsideration request shall be in writing and shall 
set forth the reasons why the request has been granted or denied. A 
notice transmitting a copy of the disposition of the request for 
reconsideration shall be sent to the respondent and, if a fact-finding 
conference under 48 CFR (DEAR) 909.406-3(b)(4) is pending (as in the 
case of a request for reconsideration of a suspension, where the 
proposed debarment is the subject of a fact-finding conference), a copy 
of the

[[Page 286]]

disposition shall be transmitted to the Energy Board of Contract 
Appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 909.407-2  Causes for suspension. (DOE coverage--paragraph (d))

    (d) The Suspending Official may suspend an organization or 
individual:
    (1) Indicted for or suspected, upon adequate evidence, of the causes 
described in 48 CFR (DEAR) 909.406-2(c)(1).
    (2) On the basis of the causes set forth in 48 CFR (DEAR) 909.406-
2(d)(2).
    (3) On the basis that an organization or individual is an affiliate 
of a suspended or debarred contractor.


<R05>
Sec. 909.407-3  Procedures. (DOE coverage--paragraphs (b) and (e))

    (b) Decisionmaking process.
    (1) In actions based on an indictment, the Suspending Official shall 
make a decision based upon the administrative record, which shall 
include submissions made by the contractor in accordance with 48 CFR 
(DEAR) 909.406-3(b)(1) and 909.406-3(b)(3).
    (2) For actions not based on an indictment, the procedures in 48 CFR 
(DEAR) 909.406-3(b)(2) and FAR 9.407-3(b)(2) apply.
    (3) Coordination with Department of Justice. Whenever a meeting or 
fact-finding conference is requested, the Suspending Official's legal 
representative shall obtain the advice of appropriate Department of 
Justice officials concerning the impact disclosure of evidence at the 
meeting or fact-finding conference could have on any pending civil or 
criminal investigation or legal proceeding. If such Department of 
Justice official requests in writing that evidence needed to establish 
the existence of a cause for suspension not be disclosed to the 
respondent, the Suspending Official shall:
    (i) Decline to rely on such evidence and withdraw (without 
prejudice) the suspension or proposed debarment until such time as 
disclosure of the evidence is authorized; or
    (ii) Deny the request for a meeting or fact-finding and base the 
suspension decision solely upon the information in the administrative 
record, including any submission made by the respondent.
    (e) Notice of suspending official's decision. In actions in which 
additional proceedings have been held, following such proceedings, the 
Suspending Official shall notify respondent, as applicable, in 
accordance with paragraphs (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.
    (1) Upon deciding to sustain a suspension, the Suspending Official 
shall promptly send each affected respondent a notice containing the 
following information:
    (i) A reference to the notice of suspension, the meeting and the 
fact-finding conference;
    (ii) The Suspending Official's findings of fact and conclusions of 
law;
    (iii) The reasons for sustaining a suspension;
    (iv) A reference to the Suspending Official's waiver authority under 
48 CFR (DEAR) 909.405;
    (v) A statement that the suspension is effective throughout the 
Executive Branch as provided in FAR 9.407-1(d);
    (vi) Modifications, if any, of the initial terms of the suspension;
    (vii) A statement that a copy of the suspension notice was sent to 
GSA and that the respondent's name and address will be added to the GSA 
List; and
    (viii) If less than an entire organization is suspended, 
specification of the organizational element(s) or individual(s) included 
within the scope of the suspension.
    (2) If the Suspending Official decides to terminate a suspension, 
the Suspending Official shall promptly send, by certified mail, return 
receipt requested, each affected respondent a copy of the final decision 
required under this section.

[[Page 287]]


<R05>
Sec. 909.504  Contracting Officer's Responsibility. (DOE coverage-
          paragraphs (d) and (e)).

    (d) The contracting officer shall evaluate the statement by the 
apparent successful offeror or, where individual contracts are 
negotiated with all firms in the competitive range, all such firms for 
interests relating to a potential organizational conflict of interest in 
the performance of the proposed contract. Using that information and any 
other credible information, the contracting officer shall make written 
determination of whether those interests create an actual or significant 
potential organizational conflict of interest and identify any actions 
that may be taken to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. In 
fulfilling their responsibilities for identifying and resolving 
potential conflicts, contracting officers should avoid creating 
unnecessary delays, burdensome information requirements, and excessive 
documentation.
    (e) The contracting officer shall award the contract to the apparent 
successful offeror unless a conflict of interest is determined to exist 
that cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated. Before determining to 
withold award based on organizational conflict of interest 
considerations, the contracting officer shall notify the offeror, 
provide the reasons therefor, and allow the offeror a reasonable 
opportunity to respond. If the conflict of interest cannot be avoided, 
neutralized, or mitigated to the contracting officer's satisfaction, the 
contracting officer may disqualify the offeror from award and undertake 
the disclosure, evaluation, and determination process with the firm next 
in line for award. If the contracting officer finds that it is in the 
best interest of the United States to award the contract notwithstanding 
a conflict of interest, a request for waiver shall be submitted in 
accordance with 48 CFR 909.503. The waiver request and decisions shall 
be included in the contract file.

952.209-8, Organizational Conflicts of Interest Disclosure-Advisory and 
Assistance Services, in solicitations for advisory and assistance 
services expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. In 
individual procurements, the Head of the Contracting Activity may 
increase the period subject to disclosure in 952.209-8 (c)(1) up to 36 
months.


<R05>
Sec. 909.507-2  Contract Clause.

    (a)(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 48 CFR 
952.209-72, Organizational Conflicts of Interest, in each solicitation 
and contract for advisory and assistance services expected to exceed the 
simplified acquisition threshold.
    (2) Contracting officers may make appropriate modifications where 
necessary to address the potential for organizational conflicts of 
interest in individual contracts. Contracting officers shall determine 
the appropriate term of the bar of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the clause at 
48 CFR 952.209-72 and enter that term in the blank provided. In the 
usual case of a contract for advisory and assistance services a period 
of three, four, or five years is appropriate; however, in individual 
cases the contracting officer may insert a term of greater or lesser 
duration.
    (3) The contracting officer shall include Alternate I with the 
clause in instances in which a meaningful amount of subcontracting for 
advisory and assistance services is expected.
    (b) Contracts, which are not subject to part 970 but provide for the 
operation of a DOE site or facility or environmental remediation of a 
specific DOE site or sites, shall contain the organizational conflict of 
interest clause at 48 CFR 952.209-72. The organizational conflicts of 
interest clause in such contracts shall include Alternate I to that 
clause.

<R05>
Sec. 911.602  General.

    (d) Programs which maximize domestic energy supplies are eligible 
for priorities and allocations support depending on an executive 
decision made on a case-by-case basis. Eligibility is pursuant to 
section 104(a) of the Energy Conservation and Policy Act, Pub. L. 94-
163, which added a new section 101(c) to the Defense Production Act. 
Guidance is provided by 10 CFR part 216 and Department of Energy 
publication DOE/MA-0192, ``Priorities and Allocations Support for 
Energy: Keeping Energy Programs on Schedule,'' dated August 1985. Rated 
orders placed in support of authorized energy programs are equivalent to 
orders placed in support of authorized defense programs under the DPAS

    (e) The Heads of Contracting Activities shall ensure that members of

provisions of the DPAS regulation and that the related procedures are 
followed to ensure adherence to the regulation throughout the industrial 
supply chain. Under DPAS, it is mandatory that the priority rating be 
extended through the industrial chain from supplier to supplier.

<R05>
Sec. 915.207-70  Handling of proposals during evaluation.

    (a) Proposals furnished to the Government are to be used for 
evaluation purposes only. Disclosure outside the Government for 
evaluation is permitted only to the extent authorized by, and in 
accordance with, the procedures in this subsection.
    (b) While the Government's limited use of proposals does not require 
that the proposal bear a restrictive notice, proposers should, if they 
desire to maximize protection of their trade secrets or confidential or 
privileged commercial and financial information contained in them, apply 
the restrictive notice prescribed in paragraph (e) of the provision at 
48 CFR 52.215-1 to such information. In any event, information contained 
in proposals will be protected to the extent permitted by law, but the 
Government assumes no liability for the use or disclosure of information 
(data) not made subject to such notice in accordance with paragraph (e) 
of the provision at 48 CFR 52.215-1.
    (c) If proposals are received with more restrictive conditions than 
those in paragraph (e) of the provision at 48 CFR 52.215-1, the 
contracting officer or coordinating officer shall inquire whether the 
submitter is willing to accept the conditions of paragraph (e). If the 
submitter does not, the contracting officer or coordinating officer 
shall, after consultation with counsel, either return the proposal or 
accept it as marked. Contracting officers shall not exclude from 
consideration any proposals merely because they contain an authorized or 
agreed to notice, nor shall they be prejudiced by such notice.
    (d) Release of proposal information (data) before decision as to the 
award of a contract, or the transfer of valuable and sensitive 
information between competing offerors during the competitive phase of 
the acquisition process, would seriously disrupt the Government's 
decision-making process and undermine the integrity of the competitive 
acquisition process, thus adversely affecting the Government's ability 
to solicit competitive proposals and award a contract which would best 
meet the Government's needs and serve the public interest. Therefore, to 
the extent permitted by law, none of the information (data) contained in 
proposals, except as authorized in this subsection, is to be disclosed 
outside the Government before the Government's decision as to the award 
of a contract. In the event an outside evaluation is to be obtained, it 
shall be only to the extent authorized by, and in accordance with the 
procedures of, this subsection.
    (e)(1) In order to maintain the integrity of the procurement process 
and to assure that the propriety of proposals will be respected, 
contracting officers shall assure that the following notice is affixed 
to each solicited proposal prior to distribution for evaluation:

                Government Notice for Handling Proposals

    This proposal shall be used and disclosed for evaluation purposes 
only, and a copy of this Government notice shall be applied to any 
reproduction or abstract thereof. Any authorized restrictive notices 
which the submitter places on this proposal shall also be strictly 
complied with. Disclosure of this proposal outside the Government for 
evaluation purposes shall be made only to the extent authorized by, and 
in accordance with, the procedures in DEAR subsection 915.207-70.

                             (End of notice)

    (2) The notice at FAR 15.609(d) for unsolicited proposals shall be 
affixed to a cover sheet attached to each such proposal upon receipt by 
DOE. Use of the notice neither alters any obligation of the Government, 
nor diminishes any rights in the Government to use or disclose data or 
information.
    (f)(1) Normally, evaluations of proposals shall be performed only by 
employees of the Department of Energy. As used in this section, 
``proposals'' includes the offers in response to requests for proposals, 
sealed bids, program opportunity announcements, program research and 
development announcements, or any other method of solicitation where the 
review of proposals or bids is to be performed by other than peer 
review. In certain cases, in order to gain necessary expertise, 
employees of other agencies may be used in instances in which they will 
be available and committed during the period of evaluation. Evaluators 
or advisors who are not Federal employees,

[[Page 293]]

including employees of DOE management and operating contractors, may be 
used where necessary. Where such non-Federal employees are used as 
evaluators, they may only participate as members of technical evaluation 
committees. They may not serve as members of the Source Evaluation Board 
or equivalent board or committee.
    (2)(i) Pursuant to section 6002 of Pub. L. 103-355, a determination 
is required for every competitive procurement as to whether sufficient 
DOE personnel with the necessary training and capabilities are available 
to evaluate the proposals that will be received. This determination, 
discussed at FAR 37.204, shall be made in the memorandum appointing the 
technical evaluation committee by the Source Selection Official, in the 
case of Source Evaluation Board procurements, or by the Contracting 
Officer in all other procurements.
    (ii) Where it is determined such qualified personnel are not 
available within DOE but are available from other Federal agencies, a 
determination to that effect shall be made by the same officials in the 
same memorandum. Should such qualified personnel not be available, a 
determination to use non-Federal evaluators or advisors must be made in 
accordance with paragraph (f)(3) of this subsection.
    (3) The decision to employ non-Federal evaluators or advisors, 
including employees of DOE management and operating contractors, in 
Source Evaluation Board procurements must be made by the Source 
Selection Official with the concurrence of the Head of the Contracting 
Activity. In all other procurements, the decision shall be made by the 
senior program official or designee with the concurrence of the Head of 
the Contracting Activity. In a case where multiple solicitations are 
part of a single program and would call for the same resources for 
evaluation, a class determination to use non-Federal evaluators may be 
made by the DOE Procurement Executive.
    (4) Where such non-Federal evaluators or advisors are to be used, 
the solicitation shall contain a provision informing prospective 
offerors that non-Federal personnel may be used in the evaluation of 
proposals.
    (5) The nondisclosure agreement as it appears in paragraph (f)(6) of 
this subsection shall be signed before DOE furnishes a copy of the 
proposal to non-Federal evaluators or advisors, and care should be taken 
that the required handling notice described in paragraph (e) of this 
subsection is affixed to a cover sheet attached to the proposal before 
it is disclosed to the evaluator or advisor. In all instances, such 
persons will be required to comply with nondisclosure of information 
requirements and requirements involving Procurement Integrity, see FAR 
3.104; with requirements to prevent the potential for personal conflicts 
of interest; or, where a non-Federal evaluator or advisor is acquired 
under a contract with an entity other than the individual, with 
requirements to prevent the potential for organizational conflicts of 
interest.
    (6) Non-Federal evaluators or advisors shall be required to sign the 
following agreement prior to having access to any proposal:

                         Nondisclosure Agreement

    Whenever DOE furnishes a proposal for evaluation, I, the recipient, 
agree to use the information contained in the proposal only for DOE 
evaluation purposes and to treat the information obtained in confidence. 
This requirement for confidential treatment does not apply to 
information obtained from any source, including the proposer, without 
restriction. Any notice or restriction placed on the proposal by either 
DOE or the originator of the proposal shall be conspicuously affixed to 
any reproduction or abstract thereof and its provisions strictly 
complied with. Upon completion of the evaluation, it is agreed all 
copies of the proposal and abstracts, if any, shall be returned to the 
DOE office which initially furnished the proposal for evaluation. Unless 
authorized by the Contracting Officer, I agree that I shall not contact 
the originator of the proposal concerning any aspect of its elements.

Date:___________________________________________________________________

[[Page 294]]

                           (End of Agreement)

    (g) The submitter of any proposal shall be provided notice adequate 
to afford an opportunity to take appropriate action before release of 
any information (data) contained therein pursuant to a request under the 
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552); and, time permitting, the 
submitter should be consulted to obtain assistance in determining the 
eligibility of the information (data) in question as an exemption under 
the Act. (See also 48 CFR 24.2, Freedom of Information Act.)

Sec. 915.305  Proposal evaluation. (DOE coverage--paragraph (d))

    (d) Personnel from DOE, other Government agencies, consultants, and 
contractors, including those who manage or operate Government-owned 
facilities, may be used in the evaluation process as evaluators or 
advisors when their services are necessary and available. When personnel 
outside the Government, including those of contractors who operate or 
manage Government-owned facilities, are to be used as evaluators or 
advisors, approval and nondisclosure procedures as required by 48 CFR 
(DEAR) 915.207-70 shall be followed and a notice of the use of non-
Federal evaluators shall be included in the solicitation. In all 
instances, such personnel will be required to comply with DOE conflict 
of interest and nondisclosure requirements.

                     Subpart 915.4_Contract Pricing


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-2  Information to support proposal analysis. (DOE 
          coverage--paragraphs (a), (c) and (e))

    (a)(1) Field pricing assistance as discussed in FAR 15.404-2(a) is 
not required for the negotiation of DOE contract prices or modifications 
thereof. The term ``field pricing assistance'' refers to the Department 
of Defense (DOD) system for obtaining a price and/or cost analysis 
report from a cognizant DOD field level contract management office 
wherein requests for the review of a proposal submitted by an offeror 
are initiated and the recommendations made by the various specialists of 
the management office are consolidated into a single report that is 
forwarded to the office making the contract award for use in conducting 
negotiations. In the DOE, such review activities, except for reviews 
performed by professional auditors, are expected to be accomplished by 
pricing support personnel located in DOE Contracting Activities. The DOE 
contracting officer shall formally request the assistance of appropriate 
pricing support personnel, other than auditors, for the review of any 
proposal that exceeds $500,000, unless the contracting officer has 
sufficient data to determine the reasonableness of the proposed cost or 
price. Such pricing support may be requested for proposals below 
$500,000, if considered necessary for the establishment of a reasonable 
pricing arrangement. Contracting officers, however, are not precluded by 
this section from requesting pricing assistance from a cognizant DOD 
contract management office, provided an appropriate cross-servicing 
arrangement for pricing support services exists between the DOE and the 
servicing agency.
    (c)(1) When an audit is required pursuant to 48 CFR 915.404-2-70, 
``Audit as an aid in proposal analysis,'' the request for audit shall be 
sent directly to the Federal audit office assigned cognizance of the 
offeror or prospective contractor. When the cognizant agency is other 
than the Defense Contract Audit Agency or the Department of Health and 
Human Services, and an appropriate interagency agreement has not been 
established, the need for audit assistance shall be coordinated with the 
Office of Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.
    (2) The request for audit shall establish the due date for receipt 
of the auditor's report and in so doing shall allow as much time as 
possible for the auditor's review.
    (e)(6) Copies of technical analysis reports prepared by DOE 
technical or other pricing support personnel shall not normally be 
provided to the auditor. The contracting officer or the supporting 
price, cost, or financial analyst at the contracting activity shall 
determine the monetary impact of the technical findings.

[[Page 295]]


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-2-70   Audit as an aid in proposal analysis.

    (a) When a contract price will be based on cost or pricing data 
submitted by the offerors, the DOE contracting officer or authorized 
representative shall request a review by the cognizant Federal audit 
activity prior to the negotiation of any contract or modification 
including modifications under advertised contracts in excess of:
    (1) $500,000 for a firm fixed-price contract or a fixed-price 
contract with economic price adjustment provisions; or adjustment 
provisions; or
    (2) $1,000,000 for all other contract types, including initial 
prices, estimated costs of cost-reimbursement contracts, interim and 
final price redeterminations, and target and settlement of incentive 
contracts.
    (b) The requirement for auditor reviews of proposals which exceed 
the thresholds specified in paragraph (a) of this section may be waived 
at a level above the contracting officer when the reasonableness of the 
negotiated contract price can be determined from information already 
available. The contract file shall be documented to reflect the reason 
for any such waiver, provided, however, that independent Government 
estimates of cost or price shall not be used as the sole justification 
for any such waiver.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4  Profit. (DOE coverage--paragraphs (c) and (d))

    (c)(4)(i) Contracting officer responsibilities. The statutory 
limitations on profit and fees as set forth in FAR 15.404-4(c)(4)(i) 
shall be followed, except as exempted for DOE architect-engineer 
contracts covering Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and Bonneville Power 
Administration (BPA) functions. Pursuant to section 602(d) (13) and (20) 
of the Federal Property and Administration Services Act of 1949, as 
amended, those former AEC functions, as well as those of the BPA, now 
being performed by DOE are exempt from the 6 percent of cost restriction 
on contracts for architect-engineer services. The estimated costs on 
which the maximum fee is computed shall include facilities capital cost 
of money when this cost is included in cost estimates.
    (c)(6) In cases where a change or modification calls for 
substantially different work than the basic contract, the contractor's 
effort may be radically changed and a detailed analysis of the profit 
factors would be a necessity. Also, if the dollar amount of the change 
or contract modification is very significant in comparison to the 
contract dollar amount, a detailed analysis should be made.
    (d) Profit-analysis factors. A profit/fee analysis technique 
designed for a systematic application of the profit factors in FAR 
15.404-4(d) provides contracting officers with an approach that will 
ensure consistent consideration of the relative value of the various 
factors in the establishment of a profit objective and the conduct of 
negotiations for a contract award. It also provides a basis for 
documentation of this objective, including an explanation of any 
significant departure from it in reaching a final agreement. The 
contracting officer's analysis of these prescribed factors is based on 
information available prior to negotiations. Such information is 
furnished in proposals, audit data, performance reports, preaward 
surveys and the like.

    This section implements FAR 15.404-4(b) and (d).


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-70-1  General.

    (a) Objective. It is the intent of DOE to remunerate contractors for 
financial and other risks which they may assume, resources they use, and 
organization, performance and management capabilities they employ. 
Profit or fee shall be negotiated for this purpose; however, when profit 
or fee is determined as a separate element of the contract price, the 
aim of negotiation should be to fit it to the acquisition, giving due 
weight to effort, risk, facilities investment, and special factors as 
set forth in this subpart.
    (b) Commercial (profit) organization. Profit or fee prenegotiation 
objectives for contracts with commercial (profit) organizations shall be 
determined as provided in this subpart.
    (c) Nonprofit organizations. It is DOE's general policy to pay fees 
in contracts

[[Page 296]]

with nonprofit organizations other than educational institutions and 
governmental bodies; however, it is a matter of negotiation whether a 
fee will be paid in a given case. In making this decision, the DOE 
negotiating official should consider whether the contractor is 
ordinarily paid fees for the type of work involved. The profit objective 
should be reasonable in relation to the task to be performed and the 
requirements placed on the contractor.
    (d) Educational institutions. It is DOE policy not to pay fees under 
contracts with educational institutions.
    (e) State, local and Indian tribal governments. Profit or fee shall 
not be paid under contracts with State, local, and Indian tribal 
Governments.

Sec. 915.404-70-2  Weighted guidelines system.

    (a) To properly reflect differences among contracts and the 
circumstances relating thereto and to select an appropriate relative 
profit/fee in consideration of these differences and circumstances, 
weightings have been developed for application by the contracting 
officer to standard measurement bases representative of the prescribed 
profit factors cited in FAR 15.404-4(d) and paragraph (d) of this 
section. This is a structured system, referred to as weighted 
guidelines. Each profit factor or subfactor, or component thereof, has 
been assigned weights relative to their value to the contract's overall 
effort. The range of weights to be applied to each profit factor is also 
set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. Guidance on how to apply the 
weighted guidelines is set forth in 48 CFR 915.404-4-70-8.
    (b) Except as set forth in 48 CFR 915.404-4-70-4, the weighted 
guidelines shall be used in establishing the profit objective for 
negotiation of contracts where cost analysis is performed.
    (c) The negotiation process does not contemplate or require 
agreement on either estimated cost elements or profit elements. 
Accordingly, although the details of analysis and evaluation may be 
discussed in the fact-finding phase of the negotiation process in order 
to develop a mutual understanding of the logic of the respective 
positions, specific agreement on the exact weights of values of the 
individual profit factors is not required and need not be attempted.
    (d) The factors set forth in the following table are to be used in 
determining DOE profit objectives. The factors and weight ranges for 
each factor shall be used in all instances where the weighted guidelines 
are applied.

<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-70-3  Documentation.

    Determination of the profit or fee objective, in accordance with 
this subpart shall be fully documented. Since the profit objective is 
the contracting officer's pre-negotiation evaluation of a total profit 
allowance for the proposed contract, the amounts developed for each 
category of cost will probably change in the course of negotiation. 
Furthermore, the negotiated amounts will probably vary from the 
objective and from the pre-negotiation detailed application of the 
weighted guidelines technique to each element of the contractor's input 
to total performance. Since the profit objective is viewed as a whole 
rather than as its component parts, insignificant variations from the 
pre-negotiation profit objective, as a result of changes to the 
contractor's input to total performance, need not be documented in 
detail. Conversely, significant deviations from the profit objective 
necessary to reach a final agreement on profit or fee shall be explained 
in the price negotiation memorandum prepared in accordance with FAR 
15.406-3.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-70-4  Exceptions.

    (a) For contracts not expected to exceed $500,000, the weighted 
guidelines need not be used; however, the contracting officer may use 
the weighted guidelines for contracts below this amount if he or she 
elects to do so.
    (b) For the following classes of contracts, the weighted guidelines 
shall not be used:
    (1) Commercialization and demonstration type contracts;
    (2) Management and operating contracts;
    (3) Construction contracts;
    (4) Construction management contracts;
    (5) Contracts primarily requiring delivery of material supplied by 
subcontractors;
    (6) Termination settlements; and
    (7) Contracts with educational institutions.
    (c) In addition to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the 
contracting officer need not use the weighted guidelines in unusual 
pricing situations where the weighted guidelines method has been 
determined by the DOE negotiating official to be unsuitable. Such 
exceptions shall be justified in writing and shall be authorized by the 
Head of the Contracting Activity. The contract file shall include this 
documentation and any other information that may support the exception.
    (d) If the contracting officer makes a written determination that 
the pricing situation meets any of the circumstances set forth in this 
section, other methods for establishing the profit objective may be 
used. For contracts other than those subject to 48 CFR 917.6, the 
selected method shall be supported in a manner similar to that used in 
the weighted guidelines (profit factor breakdown and documentation of 
profit objectives); however, investment or other factors that would not 
be applicable to the contract shall be excluded from the profit 
objective determination. It is intended that the methods will result in 
profit objectives for noncapital intensive contracts that are below 
those generally developed for capital intensive contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-70-5  Special considerations--contracts with nonprofit 
          organizations (other than educational institutions).

    (a) For purposes of identification, nonprofit organizations are 
defined as those business entities organized and operated exclusively 
for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes, of which no part of 
the net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or 
individual, of which no substantial part of the activities is attempting 
to influence legislation or participating in any political campaign on 
behalf of any candidate for public office, and which are exempt from 
Federal income taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (b) In computing the amount of profit or fee to be paid, the DOE 
negotiating official shall take into account the tax benefits received 
by a nonprofit organization. While it is difficult to establish the 
degree to which a remuneration under any given contract contributes to 
an organization's overall net profit, the DOE negotiating official 
should assume that there is an element of profit in any amount to be 
paid.

[[Page 298]]

    (c) In order to assure consideration of the tax posture of nonprofit 
organizations during a profit or fee negotiation, the DOE negotiating 
official shall calculate the fee as for a contract with a commercial 
concern and then reduce it at least 25 percent. However, depending on 
the circumstances, the contracting officer may pay profit or fees 
somewhere between this amount and the appropriate profit or fee as if it 
were a commercial concern. When this is the case, the contract file 
shall be documented to specifically state the reason or reasons.
    (d) Where a contract with a nonprofit organization is for the 
operation of Government-owned facilities, the fee should be calculated 
using the procedures and schedules applicable to operating contracts as 
set forth in 48 CFR part 970.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-70-6  Contracts with educational institutions.

    In certain situations the DOE may contract with a university to 
manage or operate Government-owned laboratories. These efforts are 
generally apart from, and not in conjunction with, their other 
activities, and the complexity and magnitude of the work are not 
normally found in standard university research or study contracts. Such 
operating contracts are subject to the applicable provisions set forth 
in 48 CFR part 970.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-70-7  Alternative techniques.

    (a) Profit or fees to be paid on construction contracts and 
construction management contracts shall be determined in accordance with 
the applicable profit/fee technique for such contracts set forth in 48 
CFR 915.404-4-71.
    (b) Profit and fee to be paid on contracts under $500,000, not using 
the weighted guidelines, shall be judgmentally developed by the 
contracting officer by assigning individual dollar amounts to the 
factors appropriate to DOE profit considerations discussed in 48 CFR 
915.404-4-70-2(d).
    (c) Contracts which require only delivery or furnishing of goods or 
services supplied by subcontractors shall include a fee or profit which, 
in the best judgment of the contracting officer, is appropriate. It 
would be expected that there would be a declining relationship of 
profit/fee dollars in relation to total costs. The higher the cost of 
subcontracts, for example, the lower the profit/fee ratio to these 
costs.
    (d) Profit/Fee considerations in termination settlements are often a 
question of equity. They are a matter of negotiation. They should not, 
however, exceed what would have otherwise been payable under weighted 
guidelines had the termination not occurred.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-70-8  Weighted guidelines application considerations.

    The Department has developed internal procedures to aid the 
contracting officer in the application of weighted guidelines and to 
assure a reasonable degree of uniformity across the Department.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-71  Profit and fee-system for construction and 
          construction management contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-71-1  General.

    (a) Business concerns awarded a DOE construction or construction 
management contract shall be paid a profit or fee if requested or 
solicited. The profit or fee objective for a construction or 
construction management contract shall be an amount appropriate for the 
type of effort contained therein. It is the intent of DOE to
    (1) Reward contractors based on the complexity of work,
    (2) Reward contractors who demonstrate and establish excellent 
records of performance and
    (3) Reward contractors who contribute their own resources, including 
facilities and investment of capital.
    (b) Standard fees or across-the-board agreements will not be used or 
made. Profit or fee objectives are to be determined for each contract 
according to the effort or task contracted for thereunder.
    (c) Profit or fee payable on fixed-price and cost-reimbursable 
construction or construction management contracts shall be established 
in accordance with the appropriate procedures and schedules set forth in 
this subpart.

[[Page 299]]


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-71-2  Limitations.

    Amounts payable under construction and construction management 
contracts shall not exceed amounts derived from the schedules 
established for this purpose. Requests to pay fees in excess of these 
levels shall be forwarded to the Procurement Executive for review and 
approval.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-71-3  Factors for determining fees.

    (a) The profit policy stated in 48 CFR 915.404-4-71-1(a) reflects, 
in a broad sense, recognition that profit is compensation to contractors 
for the entrepreneurial function of organizing and managing resources 
(including capital resources), and the assumption of risk that all costs 
of performance (operating and capital) may not be reimbursable.
    (b) The best approach calls for a structure that allows judgmental 
evaluation and determination of fee dollars for prescribed factors which 
impact the need for, and the rewards associated with, fee or profit, as 
follows.
    (1) Management risk relating to performance, including the
    (i) Quality and diversity of principal work tasks required to do the 
job,
    (ii) Labor intensity of the job,
    (iii) Special control problems, and
    (iv) Advance planning, forecasting and other such requirements;
    (2) The presence or absence of financial risk, including the type 
and terms of the contract;
    (3) The relative difficulty of work, including consideration of 
technical and administrative knowledge, skill, experience and clarity of 
technical specifications;
    (4) Degree and amount of contract work required to be performed by 
and with the contractor's own resources, including the extent to which 
the contractor contributes plant, equipment, computers, or working 
capital (labor, etc.);
    (5) Duration of project;
    (6) Size of operation;
    (7) Benefits which may accrue to the contractor from gaining 
experience and know-how, from establishing or enhancing a reputation, or 
from being enabled to hold or expand a staff whose loyalties are 
primarily to the contractor; and
    (8) Other special considerations, including support of Government 
programs such as those relating to small, small disadvantaged, and 
women-owned small business in subcontracting, energy conservation, etc.
    (c) The total fee objective and amount for a particular negotiation 
is established by judgmental considerations of the factors in paragraph 
(b) of this section, assigning fee values as deemed appropriate for each 
factor and totaling the resulting amounts.
    (d) In recognition of the complexities of this process, and to 
assist in promoting a reasonable degree of consistency and uniformity in 
its application, fee schedules have been developed which set forth 
maximum fee amounts that contracting activities are allowed to negotiate 
for a particular transaction without obtaining prior approval of the 
Procurement Executive. In addition, the fee negotiation objective 
established in accordance with 48 CFR 915.404-4-71-3(a), (b), and (c) 
shall not exceed the applicable fee schedule amounts without prior 
approval of the Procurement Executive. To facilitate application to a 
contract, the fee amounts are related to the total cost base which is 
defined as total operating and capital costs.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-71-4  Considerations affecting fee amounts.

    (a) In selecting final fee amounts for the various factors in 48 CFR 
915.404-4-71-3 of this section, the DOE negotiating official will have 
to make several judgments as discussed in this subsection.
    (b) Complexity of a construction project shall be considered by 
analysis of its major parts. For a project which includes items of work 
of different degrees of complexity, a single average classification 
should be considered, or the work should be divided into separate 
classifications. The following class identifications are appropriate for 
proper fee determinations.
    (1) Class A--Manufacturing plants involving operations requiring a 
high degree of design layout or process control; nuclear reactors; 
atomic particle accelerators; complex laboratories or

[[Page 300]]

industrial units especially designed for handling radioactive materials.
    (2) Class B--Normal manufacturing processes and assembly operations 
such as ore dressing, metal working plant and simple processing plants; 
power plants and accessory switching and transformer stations; water 
treatment plants; sewage disposal plants; hospitals; and ordinary 
laboratories.
    (3) Class C--Permanent administrative and general service buildings, 
permanent housing, roads, railroads, grading, sewers, storm drains, and 
water and power distribution systems.
    (4) Class D--Construction camps and facilities and other 
construction of a temporary nature.
    (c) Normal management elements of principal tasks relating to a 
construction contract cover several categories of tasks with differing 
rates of application throughout the construction period. The principal 
elements of management effort are outlined in this paragraph. Although 
each project has a total management value equal to 100% for all 
elements, the distribution of effort among the various elements will be 
different for each project due to differences in project character or 
size. The basic management elements and the normal range of efforts 
expected to apply for a normal sized project are as follows. When the 
normally expected effort will not be performed by a contractor, this 
fact should be considered in arriving at appropriate fee amounts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Fee considerations dealing with the duration of a project are 
usually provided by the consideration given to the degree of complexity 
and magnitude of the work. In only very unusual circumstances should it 
be necessary to separately weight, positively or negatively, for the 
period of services or length of time involved in the project when 
determining fee levels.
    (e) The size of the operation is to a considerable degree a 
continuation of the complexity factor, and the degree and amount of work 
required to be performed by and with the contractor's own resources. 
Generally, no separate weighting, positively or negatively, is

[[Page 301]]

required for consideration of those factors.
    (f) The degree and amount of work required to be performed by and 
with the contractor's own resources affect the level of fees. Reasonable 
fees should be based on expectations of complete construction services 
normally associated with a construction or construction management 
contract. In the case of a construction contract, reduced services can 
be in the form of excessive subcontracting or supporting acquisition 
actions and labor relations interfaces being made by the government. If 
an unusual amount of such work is performed by other than the 
contractor, it will be necessary to make downward adjustments in the fee 
levels to provide for the reduction in services required.
    (g) The type of contract to be negotiated and the anticipated 
contractor cost risk shall be considered in establishing the appropriate 
fee objective for the contract.
    (h) When a contract calls for the contractor to use its own 
resources, including facilities and equipment, and to make its own cost 
investment (i.e., when there is no letter-of-credit financing), a 
positive impact on the fee amount shall be reflected.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-71-5  Fee schedules.

    (a) The schedules included in this paragraph, adjusted in accordance 
with provisions of this section and 48 CFR 915.404-4-71-6, provide 
maximum fee levels for construction and construction management 
contracts. The fees are related to the estimated cost (fee base) for the 
construction work and services to be performed. The schedule in 
paragraph (d) of this section sets forth the basic fee schedule for 
construction contracts. The schedule in paragraph (f) of this section 
sets forth the basic fee schedule for construction management contracts. 
A separate schedule in paragraph (h) of this section has been developed 
for determining the fee applicable to special equipment purchases and to 
reflect a differing level of fee consideration associated with the 
subcontractor effort under construction management contracts. (See 48 
CFR 915.404-4-71-6(c) and 915.404-4-71-6(d)).
    (b) The schedules cited in paragraph (a) of this section provide the 
maximum fee amount for a CPFF contract arrangement. If a fixed-price 
type contract is to be awarded, the fee amount set forth in the fee 
schedules shall be increased by an amount not to exceed 4 percent of the 
fee base.
    (c) The fee schedule shown in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section 
assumes a letter of credit financing arrangement. If a contract provides 
for or requires the contractor to make their own cost investment for 
contract performance (i.e., when there is no letter-of-credit 
financing), the fee amounts set forth in the fee schedules shall be 
increased by an amount equal to 5 percent of the fee amount as 
determined from the schedules.
    (d) The following schedule sets forth the base for construction 
contracts:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) When using the Construction Contracts Schedule for establishing 
maximum payable basic fees, the following adjustments shall be made to 
the Schedule fee amounts for complexity levels, excessive 
subcontracting, normal contractor services performed by the government 
or another contractor:
    (1) The target fee amounts, set forth in the fee schedule, shall not 
be adjusted for a Class A project, which is maximum complexity. A Class 
B project requires a 10 percent reduction in amounts. Class C and D 
projects require a 20 percent and 30 percent reduction, respectively. 
The various classes are defined in 48 CFR 915.404-4-71-4(b).

[[Page 302]]

    (2) The target fee schedule provides for 45 percent of the contract 
work to be subcontracted for such things as electrical and other 
specialties. Excessive subcontracting results when such efforts exceed 
45 percent of the total contract work. To establish appropriate fee 
reductions for excessive subcontracting, the negotiating official should 
first determine the amount of subcontracting as a percentage of the 
total contract work. Next, the negotiating official should determine a 
percentage by which the prime contractor's normal requirement (based on 
a requirement for doing work with its own forces) is reduced due to the 
excessive subcontracting and, finally, multiply the two percentages to 
determine a fee reduction factor.
    (3) If acquisition or other services normally expected of the 
contractor (see 48 CFR 915.404-4-71-4(c)) are performed by the 
government, or another DOE prime or operating contractor, a fee 
reduction may also be required. The negotiating official should first 
determine what percentage of the total procurement or other required 
services is performed by others. Then the negotiating official should 
apply this percentage reduction to the normally assigned weightings for 
the management services or effort as discussed in 48 CFR 915.404-4-71-
4(c) to arrive at the appropriate reduction factor.
    (f) The following schedule sets forth the base for construction 
management contracts:

    (g) When applying the basic Construction Management Contracts 
Schedule for determining maximum payable fees, no adjustments are 
necessary to such payable fees for contractor Force account labor used 
for work which should otherwise be subcontracted until such Force 
account work exceeds, in the aggregate, 20 percent of the base. 
Excessive use of Force account work results when such effort exceeds 20 
percent of the fee base; and, when this occurs, appropriate fee 
reductions for such excessive Force account labor shall be computed as 
follows:
    (1) Determine the percentage amount of Force account work to total 
contractor effort.
    (2) Determine the percentage amount of subcontract work reduced due 
to the use of Force account work.
    (3) Multiply the two percentages to determine the fee reduction 
factor. It is not expected that reductions in the Construction 
Management Contracts Schedule fee amounts will be made for complexity, 
reduced requirements and similar adjustments as made for construction 
contracts.
    (h) The schedule of fees for consideration of special equipment 
purchases and for consideration of the subcontract program under a 
construction management contract is as follows:

<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-71-6  Fee base.

    (a) The fee base shown in the Construction Contracts Schedule and 
Construction Management Contracts Schedule represents that estimate of 
cost to which a percentage factor is applied to determine maximum fee 
allowances. The fee base is the estimated necessary allowable cost of 
the construction work or other services which are to be performed. It 
shall include the estimated cost for, but is not limited to, the 
following as they may apply in the case of a construction or 
construction management contract:
    (1) Site preparation and utilities.
    (2) Construction (labor-materials-supplies) of buildings and 
auxiliary facilities.
    (3) Construction (labor-materials-supplies) to complete/construct 
temporary buildings.
    (4) Design services to support the foregoing.
    (5) General management and job planning cost.
    (6) Labor supervision.
    (7) Procurement and acquisition administration.
    (8) Construction performed by subcontractors.
    (9) Installation of government furnished or contractor acquired 
special equipment and other equipment.
    (10) Equipment (other than special equipment) which is to become 
Government property (including a component of Government property).
    (b) The fee base for the basic fee determination for a construction 
contract and construction management contract shall include all 
necessary and allowable costs cited in paragraph (a) of this section as 
appropriate to the type of contract; except, any home office G&A expense 
paid as a contract cost per cost principle guidance and procedures shall 
be excluded from the fee base. The fee base shall exclude:
    (1) Cost of land.
    (2) Cost of engineering (A&E work).
    (3) Contingency estimate.
    (4) Equipment rentals or use charges. (See 48 CFR 936.70.)
    (5) Cost of government furnished equipment or materials.
    (6) Special equipment as defined in 48 CFR 936.7201.
    (c) A separate fee base shall be established for special equipment 
for use in applying the Special Equipment Purchases or Subcontract Work 
Schedule (see 48 CFR 915.404-4-71-5(h)). The fee base for determination 
of applicable fees on special equipment shall be based on the estimated 
purchase price of the equipment.
    (d) The fee base under the Construction Management Contracts 
Schedule for a maximum basic fee determination for a construction 
management contract shall be comprised of only the costs of the 
construction manager's own efforts. However, it is recognized that in 
the case of construction management contracts, the actual construction 
work will be performed by subcontractors. In most cases the subcontract 
awards for the construction work will be made by the construction 
management contractor. Occasionally the contract may involve management 
of construction performed under a contract awarded by the Department or 
by one of the Department's operating contractors. In these cases, the 
actual cost of the subcontracted construction work shall be excluded 
from the fee base used to determine the maximum basic fee (under the 
Construction Management Contracts Schedule) applicable to a construction 
management contract. A separate fee base for additional allowances 
(using the Special Equipment Purchases or Subcontract Work Schedule) 
shall be established, which shall be comprised of those subcontract 
construction costs, special equipment purchases, and other items' costs 
that are contracted for or purchased by the construction manager.


<R05>
Sec. 915.404-4-72  Special considerations for cost-plus-award-fee 
          contracts.

    (a) When a contract is to be awarded on a cost-plus-award-fee basis 
several special considerations are appropriate. Fee objectives for 
management and operating contracts or other contracts as determined by 
the Procurement Executive, including those using the Construction, 
Construction Management, or Special Equipment Purchases/Subcontract Work 
schedules from 48 CFR 915.404-4-71-5, shall be developed pursuant to the 
procedures set forth in 48 CFR 970.15404-4-8. Fee objectives for

[[Page 304]]

other cost-plus-award-fee contracts shall be in accordance with 48 CFR 
916.404-2 and be developed as follows:
    (1) The base fee portion of the fee objective of an award fee 
contract may range from 0% up to the 50% level of the fee amount for a 
Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract, arrived at by using the weighted 
guidelines or other techniques (such as those provided in 48 CFR 
915.404-4-71 for construction and construction management contracts). 
However, the base amount should not normally exceed 50% of the otherwise 
applicable fixed fee. In the event this 50% limit is exceeded, 
appropriate documentation shall be entered into the contract file. In no 
event shall the base fee exceed 60% of the fixed fee amount.
    (2) The base fee plus the amount included in the award fee pool 
should normally not exceed the fixed fee (as subjectively determined or 
as developed from the fee schedule) by more than 50%. However, in the 
event the base fee is to be less than 50% of the fixed fee, the maximum 
potential award fee may be increased proportionately with the decreases 
in base fee amounts.
    (3) The following maximum potential award fees shall apply in award 
fee contracts: (percent is stated as percent of fee schedule amounts).

                                                               Maximum
               Base fee percent                  Award fee      total

    (b) Prior approval of the Procurement Executive, is required for 
total fee (base plus award fee pool) exceeding the guidelines in 48 CFR 
915.404-4-72(a)(3).

Sec. 915.408-70  Solicitation provision and contract clause.

    The contracting officer (after deleting ``under the clause at 48 CFR 
970.5203-3, Contractor's Organization'' from paragraph (a) if not a 
management and operating contract) shall insert the clause at 48 CFR 
952.215-70, Key Personnel, in contracts under which performance is 
largely dependent on the expertise of specific key personnel.

                   Subpart 915.6_Unsolicited Proposals


<R05>
Sec. 915.602  Policy.

    (a) Present and future needs demand the involvement of all resources 
in exploring alternative energy sources and technologies. To achieve 
this objective, it is DOE policy to encourage external sources of unique 
and innovative methods, approaches, and ideas by stressing submission of 
unsolicited proposals for government support. In furtherance of this 
policy and to ensure the integrity of the acquisition process through 
application of reasonable controls, the DOE:
    (1) Disseminates information on areas of broad technical concern 
whose solutions are considered relevant to the accomplishment of DOE's 
assigned mission areas;
    (2) Encourages potential proposers to consult with program personnel 
before expending resources in the development of written unsolicited 
proposals;
    (3) Endeavors to distribute unsolicited proposals to all interested 
organizations within DOE;
    (4) Processes unsolicited proposals in an expeditious manner and, 
where practicable, keeps proposers advised as discrete decisions are 
made;
    (5) Assures that each proposal is evaluated in a fair and objective 
manner; and, (6) Assures that each proposal will be used only for its 
intended purpose and the information, subject to applicable laws and 
regulations, contained therein will not be divulged without prior 
permission of the proposer.
    (b) Extensions of contract work resulting from unsolicited proposals 
shall be processed in accordance with the procedures at 48 CFR 943.170.


<R05>
Sec. 915.603  General. (DOE coverage--paragraph (e)).

    (e) Unsolicited proposals for the performance of support services 
are, except as discussed in this paragraph, unacceptable as the 
performance of such

[[Page 305]]

services is unlikely to necessitate innovative and unique concepts. 
There may be rare instances in which an unsolicited proposal offers an 
innovative and unique approach to the accomplishment of a support 
service. If such a proposal offers a previously unknown or an 
alternative approach to generally recognized techniques for the 
accomplishment of a specific service(s) and such approach will provide 
significantly greater economy or enhanced quality, it may be considered 
for acceptance. Such acceptance shall, however, require approval of the 
acquisition of support services in accordance with applicable DOE 
Directives and be processed as a deviation to the prohibition in this 
paragraph.


<R05>
Sec. 915.605  Content of unsolicited proposals. (DOE coverage--paragraph 
          (b)).

    (b)(5) Unsolicited proposals for nonnuclear energy demonstration 
activities not covered by existing formal competitive solicitations or 
program opportunity notices may include a request for federal assistance 
or participation, and shall be subject to the cost sharing provisions of 
48 CFR 917.70.


<R05>
Sec. 915.606  Agency procedures. (DOE coverage-paragraph (b)).

    (b) Unless otherwise specified in a notice of program interest, all 
unsolicited proposals should be submitted to the Unsolicited Proposal 
Coordinator, Office of Procurement and Assistance, Washington, DC 20585. 
If the proposer has ascertained the cognizant program office through 
preliminary contacts with program staff, the proposal may be submitted 
directly to that office. In such instances, the proposer should 
separately send a copy of the proposal cover letter to the unsolicited 
proposal coordinator to assure that the proposal is logged in the 
Department's automated tracking system for unsolicited proposals.


<R05>
Sec. 915.607  Criteria for acceptance of an unsolicited proposal. (DOE 
          coverage--paragraph (c)).

    (c) DOE's cost participation policy, at 48 CFR 917.70, shall be 
followed in determining the extent to which the DOE will participate in 
the cost for the proposed effort.

Sec. 916.404-2  Cost-plus-award-fee contracts.

    (d) Fee Determination Plans. Award fee arrangements limited to 
technical performance considerations are prohibited because they may 
increase cost disproportionately to any benefits gained. Instead, the 
award fee arrangement shall include both technical performance 
(including scheduling as appropriate) and business management 
considerations tailored to the needs of the particular situation. In 
addition, in a situation where cost estimating reliability and other 
factors are such that the negotiation of a separate predetermined 
incentive sharing arrangement applicable to cost performance is 
determined both feasible and advantageous, cost incentives may be added. 
The resulting contract would then be identified as a cost-plus-
incentive-fee/award-fee combination type. The goals and evaluation 
criteria should be results-oriented. The award fee should be 
concentrated on the end product of the contract, that is, output, be it 
hardware, research and development, demonstration or services, together 
with business management considerations. However, input criteria such as 
equal employment opportunity, small business programs, functional 
management areas, such as safety, security, etc., should not be 
disregarded and may be appropriate criteria upon which to base some part 
of the award fee. Specific goals or objectives shall be established in 
relation to each performance evaluation criterion against which 
contractor performance is measured.

    (a) This subpart implements 48 CFR subpart 17.6, Management and 
Operating Contracts. Departmental policies, procedures, provisions and 
clauses to be used in the award and administration of management and 
operating contracts that either implement or supplement the Federal 
Acquisition Regulation and parts 901 through 952 of this chapter are 
contained in 48 CFR part 970.
    (b) The requirements of this subpart apply to any Department of 
Energy management and operating contract, including performance-based 
management contracts as defined in 48 CFR 917.601. References in this 
subpart to ``management and operating contracts'' include performance-
based management contracts.

Sec. 917.601  Definitions.

    Performance-based contracting has the meaning contained in 48 CFR 
37.101.
    Performance-based management contract means a management and 
operating contract that employs, to the maximum extent practicable, 
performance-based contracting concepts and methodologies through the

<R05>
Sec. 917.7000  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart sets forth the DOE policy on cost participation by 
organizations performing research, development, and/or demonstration 
projects under DOE prime contracts. This subpart does not cover efforts 
and projects performed for DOE by other Federal agencies.
    (b) Cost participation is a generic term denoting any situation 
where the Government does not fully reimburse the performer for all 
allowable costs necessary to accomplish the project or effort under the 
contract. The term encompasses cost sharing, cost matching, cost 
limitation (direct or indirect), participation in kind, and similar 
concepts.


<R05>
Sec. 917.7001  Policy.

    (a) When DOE supports performer research, development, and/or 
demonstration efforts, where the principal purpose is ultimate 
commercialization and utilization of the technologies by the private 
sector, and when there are reasonable expectations that the performer 
will receive present or future economic benefits beyond the instant 
contract as a result of performance of the effort, it is DOE policy to 
obtain cost participation. Full funding may be provided for early phases 
of development programs when the technological problems are still great.
    (b) In making the determination to obtain cost participation, and 
evaluating present and future economic benefits to the performer, DOE 
will consider the technical feasibility, projected economic viability, 
societal and political acceptability of commercial application, as well 
as possible effects of other DOE-supported projects in competing 
technologies.
    (c) The propriety, manner, and amount of cost participation must be 
decided on a case-by-case basis.
    (d) Cost participation is required for demonstration projects unless 
exempted by the Under Secretary. Demonstration projects, pursuant to 
this subpart, include demonstrations of technological advances and field 
demonstrations of new methods and procedures, and demonstrations of 
prototype commercial applications for the exploration, development, 
production, transportation, conversion, and utilization of energy 
resources.

<R05>
Sec. 917.7200  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart discusses the policy for the use of a program 
opportunity notice solicitation approach to accelerate the demonstration 
of the technical feasibility and commercial application of all 
potentially beneficial non-nuclear energy sources and utilization 
technologies.
    (b) This subpart applies to demonstrations performed by individuals, 
educational institutions, commercial or industrial organizations, or 
other private entities, public entities, including State and local 
governments, but not other Federal agencies. For purposes of this 
subpart, commercial demonstration projects include demonstrations of 
technological advances, field

[[Page 309]]

demonstrations of new methods and procedures, and demonstration of 
prototype commercial applications for the exploration, development, 
production, transportation, conversion, and utilization of non-nuclear 
energy resources.


<R05>
Sec. 917.7201  Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 917.7201-1  General.

    (a) It is DOE's intent to encourage the submission of proposals to 
accelerate the demonstration of the technical, operational, economic, 
and commercial feasibility and environmental acceptability of particular 
energy technologies, systems, subsystems, and components. Program 
opportunity notices will be used to provide information concerning 
scientific and technological areas encompassed by DOE's programs. DOE 
shall, from time to time, issue program opportunity notices for 
proposals for demonstrations of various forms of non-nuclear energy and 
technology utilization.
    (b) Each program opportunity notice shall as a minimum describe: the 
goal of the intended demonstration effort; the time schedule for award; 
evaluation criteria; program policy factors; the amount of cost detail 
required; and proposal submission information. Program policy factors 
are those factors which, while not appropriate indicators of a 
proposal's individual merit (i.e., technical excellence, proposer's 
ability, cost, etc.), are relevant and essential to the process of 
choosing which of the proposals received will, taken together, best 
achieve the program objectives. All such factors shall be predetermined 
and specified in the notice so as to notify proposers that factors which 
are essentially beyond their control will affect the selection process.

      Subpart 917.73_Program Research and Development Announcements

    Source: 61 FR 41707, Aug. 9, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 917.7300  Scope of subpart.

    (a) This subpart discusses the policy for the use of a program 
research and development announcement (PRDA) solicitation approach to 
obtain and select proposals from the private sector for the conduct of 
research, development, and related activities in the energy field.


<R05>
Sec. 917.7301  Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 917.7301-1  General.

    (a) PRDAs shall be used to provide potential proposers with 
information concerning DOE's interest in entering into arrangements for 
research, development, and related projects in specified areas of 
interest. It is DOE's intent to solicit the submission of ideas which 
will serve as a basis for research, development, and related activities 
in the energy field. It is DOE's desire to encourage the involvement of 
small business concerns, small disadvantage business concerns, and 
women-owned small business concerns in research and development 
undertaken pursuant to PRDAs.
    (b) The PRDA should not replace existing acquisition procedures 
where a requirement can be sufficiently defined for solicitation under 
standard advertised or negotiated acquisition procedures. Similarly, it 
should not inhibit or curtail the submission of unsolicited proposals. 
However, a proposal which is submitted as though it were unsolicited but 
is in fact germane to an existing PRDA shall be treated as though 
submitted in response to the announcement or returned without action to 
the proposer, at the proposer's option. Further, the PRDA is not to be 
used in a competitive situation where it is appropriate to negotiate a 
study contract to obtain analysis and recommendations to be incorporated 
in the subsequent request for proposals.
    (c) The PRDA is to be used only where:
    (1) Research and development is required in support of a specific 
project area within an energy program with the objective of advancing 
the general scientific and technological base, and this objective is 
best achieved through:
    (i) A diversity of possible approaches, within the current state of 
the art, available for solving the problems;
    (ii) The involvement of a broad spectrum of organizations in seeking 
out solutions to the problems posed;

[[Page 310]]

    (iii) The application of the unique qualifications or specialized 
capabilities of many individual proposers which will enable them to 
perform portions of the research project (without necessarily possessing 
the qualifications to perform the entire project) so that the overall 
support may be broken into segments which cannot be ascertained in 
advance; and,
    (iv) The fostering of new and creative solutions.
    (2) Consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, it is 
anticipated that choices will have to be made among dissimilar concepts, 
ideas, or approaches; and
    (3) It is determined that a broad range of organizations exist that 
would be capable of contributing towards the overall research and 
development goals identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Each PRDA shall as a minimum describe: the area(s) of program 
interest; time schedule for award; proposal submittal information; 
evaluation criteria; and program policy factors. The PRDA should clearly 
emphasize to proposers that program policy factors are essentially 
beyond their control and will affect the selection process. The PRDA 
should also state that DOE reserves the right to select for award or 
support any, all, or none of the proposals received in response to an 
announcement.

<R05>
Sec. 917.7401  General.

    Special circumstances and situations may arise under cost-type 
contracts when, in the performance of the contract or subcontract, the 
performer shall be required, or otherwise find it necessary, to acquire 
real estate or interests therein by:
    (a) Purchase, on DOE's behalf or in its own name, with title 
eventually vesting in the Government.
    (b) Lease, and DOE assumes liability for, or otherwise will pay for 
the obligation under the lease.
    (c) Acquisition of temporary interest through easement, license or 
permit, and DOE funds the cost of the temporary interest.


<R05>
Sec. 917.7402  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Department of Energy that, when real estate 
acquisitions are made, the following policies and procedures shall be 
applied to such acquisitions:
    (a) Real estate acquisitions shall be mission essential; 
effectively, economically, and efficiently managed and utilized; and 
disposed of promptly, when not needed;
    (b) Acquisitions shall be justified, with documentation which 
describes the need for the acquisitions, general requirements, cost, 
acquisition method to be used, site investigation reports, site 
recommended for selection, and property appraisal reports; and
    (c) Acquisition by lease, in addition to the requirements in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
    (1) Shall not exceed a one-year term if funded by one-year 
appropriations.
    (2) May exceed a one-year term, when the lease is for special 
purpose space funded by no-year appropriations and approved by the 
Department.
    (3) Shall contain an appropriate cancellation clause which limits 
the Government's obligation to no more than the amount of rent to the 
earliest cancellation date plus a reasonable cancellation payment.
    (4) Shall be consistent with Government laws and regulations 
applicable to real estate management.


<R05>
Sec. 917.7403  Application.

    The clause at 48 CFR 952.217-70 shall be included in contracts or 
modifications where contractor acquisitions are expected to be made.

<R05>
Sec. 922.103-4  Approvals.

    (d) Approvals. (1) Where the cost to the Government may be affected, 
approval of hours of work in excess of the normal workweek is justified 
only in those instances and for those employees where it can be shown 
that overtime would provide needed and demonstrable impetus to the 
accomplishment of DOE objectives and that all other means of meeting 
these objectives have been considered and found inadequate or not 
feasible. Accordingly, the Heads of Contracting Activities shall:
    (i) Establish controls to prevent excess casual overtime and to 
assure that such overtime work is in the best interest of the 
Government. Casual overtime means (A) work in excess of the normal 
workweek (or in excess of an authorized extended workweek) which cannot 
be regularly scheduled in advance, or (B) regularly scheduled work in 
excess of the normal workweek for a period of four consecutive weeks or 
less; and
    (ii) Establish controls to assure that any use of any extended 
workweek schedule is in the best interest of the Government. Extended 
workweek means a workweek regularly scheduled and established in excess 
of the normal workweek for a period in excess of four consecutive weeks.

<R05>
Sec. 922.803  Responsibilities.

    (a) The Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs of 
the Department of Labor has been delegated authority and responsibility 
for carrying out the requirements of Executive Order 11246, as amended. 
In conjunction with the delegation, contracting officers shall be 
familiar with existing and any updated provisions of 41 CFR Ch. 60, and 
assist the Department of Labor in its compliance responsibilities. DOE 
contracting officers will include the applicable Equal Employment 
Opportunity (EEO)) and Affirmative Action Program (AAP) requirements in 
their solicitations and obtain the applicable reports of compliance from 
the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) (when 
required) prior to awarding of contracts. The provisions of 41 CFR Ch. 
60, are applicable to all DOE contracts.
    (d) The OFCCP requires that requests for pre-award clearances be 
directed to the OFCCP Regional Office in which the contractor's facility 
is (to be) located. If OFCCP finds the contractor in compliance, the 
contracting officer will be notified. Findings of non-compliance can be 
communicated to the contracting officer by the OFCCP or Headquarters 
Director or his designee. The appropriate Regional Office will provide 
the appropriate contact point in cases of non-compliance. The Director, 
Office of Civil Rights (DOE HQ), when requested, will provide assistance 
to contracting officers resolving non-compliance issues by providing 
assistance in obtaining a final decision from the OFCCP.

[49 FR 11998, Mar. 28, 1984; 49 FR 38951, Oct. 2, 1984, as amended at 58

<R05>
Sec. 922.804-1  Nonconstruction.

    In the event a prospective contractor or subcontractor is entering 
into its first contract containing the Equal Opportunity clause, the 
contracting officer shall determine that the prospective contractor 
understands and appears able to conform to the requirements of the EEO 
clause.


<R05>
Sec. 922.804-2  Construction.

    (a) Construction contracts, including cost-sharing contracts, are 
subject to OFCCP orders applicable in particular areas.
    (1) When a proposed nonexempt construction contract is within a 
geographic area where construction is subject to the provisions of 
Federal EEO Bid Conditions, Part I or Part II, the solicitation shall 
contain those bid conditions. The contracting officer shall include in 
such solicitation a provision that ``the offeror shall adhere to the 
affirmative action plan (bid conditions) set forth in this 
solicitation.''
    (2) Lists of areas for which OFCCP has designated specific 
affirmative action requirements are available through the Procurement 
Executive. Contracting officers should assure that this list and copies 
of pertinent orders are made available to all concerned DOE offices and 
to DOE contractors and construction subcontractors for work to be 
performed in the specified geographical areas.
    (b) Other nonexempt construction contracts. (1) When a proposed 
nonexempt construction contract is not in a ``plan area'' and is in the 
amount of $10,000 or more, offerors must agree to comply with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity clause.
    (2) When proposed nonexempt contracts of $1,000,000 or over are not 
in plan areas and have not been designated as high impact, offerors also 
must submit to the contracting officer details regarding specific 
affirmative action steps to be taken by the offeror in connection with 
all work under the contract. Such details shall include estimates of the 
percentage of minority group persons expected to be employed

[[Page 318]]

in each craft involved in the performance of the contract work. All 
solicitations for construction contracts shall reference the affirmative 
action requirements and the offeror's obligation to make good faith 
efforts to employ women in craft positions.
    (3) Pursuant to the OFCCP order dated August 30, 1976, agencies 
shall develop ``Special Bid Conditions'' for use on high impact projects 
in non-plan areas. These special bid conditions will include mandatory 
goals and timetables for the utilization of minorities. The Procurement 
Executive using the criteria issued by OFCCP will determine those 
projects that are ``high impact.'' The contracting officer is 
responsible for compliance with policies and procedures contained in the 
OFCCP ``Construction Compliance Program Operations Manual.'' Language 
for inclusion in solicitations or contracts contained in the manual may 
be modified, provided all of the requirements are retained. The 
contracting officer shall develop the goals and timetables and shall 
confer with the appropriate OFCCP regional office. The Office of Civil 
Rights will provide assistance as necessary, when requested. Special bid 
conditions will be submitted by the contracting officer to the 
appropriate OFCCP regional office for approval unless otherwise directed 
by the Procurement Executive. When special bid conditions are 
applicable, adequate presolicitation lead time should be allowed for 
submission of the special bid conditions to OFCCP national and regional 
offices.
    (c) An attempt to limit in any major respect the equal opportunity 
requirements included in an invitation for bids or request for proposals 
for a construction contract shall constitute grounds for a determination 
that the offeror does not qualify as a responsible offeror and for 
rejection of the bid or proposal. In the case of construction 
acquisition by DOE prime contractors, this determination shall be made 
only with the approval of the DOE contracting officer.

Sec. 923.570  Workplace substance abuse programs at DOE sites.

    (a) The Department of Energy (DOE), as part of its overall 
responsibilities to protect the environment, maintain public health and 
safety, and safeguard the national security, has established policies, 
criteria, and procedures for contractors to develop and implement 
programs that help maintain a workplace free from the use of illegal 
drugs.

<R05>
Sec. 923.7001  Nuclear safety.

    (a) The DOE regulates the nuclear safety of its major facilities 
under its own statutory authority derived from the Atomic Energy Act and 
other legislation. The DOE also regulates, under certain specific 
conditions, the use by its contractors of radioactive materials and 
ionizing radiation producing machines.

[49 FR 12003, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 59 FR 9106, Feb. 25, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 923.7002  Contract clauses.

    (a) A decision to include or not include environmental, safety and 
health clauses in DOE contracts shall be made by the contracting officer 
in consultation with appropriate environmental, safety and health 
program management personnel.
    (b) When work is to be performed at a facility where the DOE will 
exercise its statutory authority to enforce occupational safety and 
health standards applicable to the working conditions of the contractor 
and subcontractor employees at such facility, the clause at 952.223-71 
shall be used in such contract or subcontract if conditions (b) (1) 
through (3), are satisfied:
    (1) DOE work is segregated from the contractor's or subcontractor's 
other work;
    (2) The operation is of sufficient size to support its own safety 
and health services; and
    (3) The facility is government-owned, or leased by or for the 
account of the government.
    (c) In facilities not meeting the requirements of 923.7002(b) above 
and which are a production or utilization facility where there is use or 
possession of source, special nuclear, or byproduct materials, DOE 
policy is not to enforce radiological safety and health standards 
pursuant to the contract or subcontract but rather to rely upon Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing requirements (including agreements 
with states under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act). Pursuant to 
this policy, neither the clause found at 952.223-71 nor 952.223-72 is to 
be incorporated in the contracts or subcontracts for work at such 
facilities. Notwithstanding this general policy with respect to 
facilities not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) above, the 
Secretary or his designee may determine in special cases, that DOE needs 
to enforce radiological safety and health standards pursuant to the 
contract or subcontract (see paragraph (d) below). When such a 
determination is made, the clause found at 952.223-72 shall be included 
in the contract or subcontract.
    (d) In facilities not meeting the requirements of either 923.7002(b) 
or 923.7002(c) of this section and where there is a machine capable of 
producing ionizing radiation, it is DOE policy not to regulate such 
activity where it is adequately regulated by a state or other Federal 
agency. In such cases, neither clause 952.223-71 nor 952.223-72 shall be 
incorporated in the contract. Where the contracting officer, with 
appropriate environmental, safety and health advice determines that no 
state or other Federal agency exists to adequately regulate the 
operation and/or use of such machines, the clause found at 952.223-72 
shall be included in the contract. The Assistant Secretary for 
Environment, Safety and Health (or designee) shall be consulted to 
determine if a non-agreement (NRC) state or a facility located in a non-
agreement state has been reviewed by any other DOE office to establish 
that the state agency has the essential authority and resources for 
enforcing the radiation protection standards. This is to assure 
reasonable consistency in the assessment of radiation protection in non-
agreement states and subsequent use of 952.223-72.
    (e) In a situation where the contractor or subcontractor is 
performing DOE work at more than one location, inclusion of either, or 
both, 952.223-71 and 952.223-72 may be appropriate. In such cases, the 
contract or subcontract must include language to specify the extent of 
applicability of each clause used. For example, with a parenthetical: 
(Applicable only to work performed at a contractor site which has

952.223-71 or 952.223-72 clause in its contract or subcontract).

         Subpart 925.70_Acquisition of Nuclear Hot Cell Services

    Source: 58 FR 8910, Feb. 18, 1993, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 925.7000  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes policies for selection for contract award of 
nuclear hot cell services when one of the competitors is a foreign 
company. This subpart does not apply to the acquisition and use of 
nuclear hot cell facilities on-site at a DOE-owned or -leased facility.


<R05>
Sec. 925.7001  Definitions.

    Costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities, as used 
in this subpart, means any cost associated with the compliance with 
regulatory requirements governing the decommissioning of nuclear 
facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Such costs for 
foreign facilities and for Department of Energy facilities are costs of 
decommissioning associated with the compliance with foreign regulatory 
requirements or the Department's own requirements.
    Costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste, as used 
in this subpart, means any costs, whether required by regulation or 
incurred as a matter of prudent business practice, associated with the 
storage or disposal of nuclear waste.
    Foreign company, as used in this subpart, means a company which 
offers to perform nuclear hot cell services at a facility which is not 
subject to the laws and regulations of the United States, its agencies, 
and its political subdivisions.
    Nuclear hot cell services, as used in this subpart, means services 
related to the examination of, or performance of various operations on, 
nuclear fuel rods, control assemblies, or other components that are 
emitting large quantities of ionizing radiation, after discharge from 
nuclear reactors, which are performed in specialized facilities located 
away from commercial nuclear power plants, generally referred to in the 
industry as ``hot cells.''
    Nuclear waste, as used in this subpart, means any radioactive waste 
material subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or 
the Department of Energy, or in the case of foreign offers, by 
comparable foreign organizations.
    United States company, as used in this subpart, means a company 
which offers to perform nuclear hot cell services at a facility subject 
to the laws and regulations of the United States, its agencies, and its 
political subdivisions.


<R05>
Sec. 925.7002  Policy.

    In selecting offer(s) for award of contracts for nuclear hot cell 
services, costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities and 
storage and disposal of nuclear waste are to be considered in a way 
which affords United States and foreign companies an equal competition 
in accordance with 925.7003. Upon determining that no offer from a 
foreign firm has a reasonable chance of being selected for award, the 
requirements of this subpart will not apply.


<R05>
Sec. 925.7003  Requirements.

    (a) For the acquisition of nuclear hot cell services under the 
conditions in paragraph (b) of this section, the selection official in 
evaluating competitive offers for selection purposes only shall:
    (1) Consider neither costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear 
waste facilities nor costs related to the storage and disposal of 
nuclear waste, or
    (2) Add these costs to offers of foreign companies.
    (b) The requirements of this section apply under the following 
circumstances:
    (1) One or more of the offers is submitted by a United States 
company and includes costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear 
facilities and costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear 
waste because it is subject to such costs; and
    (2) One or more of the offers is submitted by a foreign company and 
does

[[Page 323]]

not include these types of costs. (A foreign company might not be 
subject to such costs or might not have to include these types of costs 
in its offer if the firm is subsidized in decommissioning activity or 
storage and disposal of nuclear waste, or a foreign government is 
performing the activities below the actual cost of the activity.)


<R05>
Sec. 925.7004  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.225-70, 
Subcontracting for Nuclear Hot Cell Services, in solicitations and 
contracts involving nuclear hot cell services. This clause does not flow 
down to second-tier subcontracts.

Sec. 926.7001  Policy.

    (a) Section 3021(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-
486) specifies that the Department of Energy shall, to the extent 
practicable, provide that not less than 10 percent of the total combined 
amounts obligated for competitively awarded contracts and subcontracts 
under the Energy Policy Act be expended with--
    (1) Small business concerns controlled by socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals or by women;
    (2) Historically Black colleges and universities; or
    (3) Colleges and universities having a student body in which more 
than 20 percent of the students are Hispanic Americans or Native 
Americans.
    (b) These three groups are collectively referred to in this section 
as ``Energy Policy Act target groups.''
    (c) Awards of Energy Policy Act procurements should be in the 
following descending order of preference:
    (1) Competitive awards pursuant to a set-aside for small 
disadvantaged business;
    (2) Competitive awards to small businesses owned and controlled by 
socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and by women for 
Energy Policy Act requirements under the Small Business Administration's 
section 8(a) program; and
    (3) Competitive awards that provide an evaluation preference in 
accordance with 926.7006 to offerors from the Energy Policy Act target 
groups.
    (d) The DOE implementation of Section 3021 requirements with regard 
to the award of subcontracts under Energy Policy Act procurements is 
discussed at 926.7006.
    (e) Competitive procedures, for purposes of Energy Policy Act 
implementation, consist of awards under set-asides to small 
disadvantaged business and firms certified as 8(a) Small Business 
Administration and competitive procedures in accordance with (FAR) 48 
CFR 15.6 and (DEAR) 48 CFR 915.6.


<R05>
Sec. 926.7002  Responsibilities.

    Offices initiating procurement requests have primary responsibility 
to identify potential contract requirements falling within the scope of 
section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act. Identification shall occur at the 
earliest possible point in time in the acquisition cycle, but not later 
than the submission of the procurement request to the contracting 
officer. For purposes of Section 3021, a contract requirement

[[Page 324]]

is any award that directly satisfies an Energy Policy Act program or 
requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 926.7003  Review of the procurement request.

    Any Energy Policy Act procurement, including basic research 
contracts with educational institutions, shall be reviewed in accordance 
with the Small Business and 8(a) Program Review Procedures in order to 
ensure that full consideration is given to the potential for making 
Energy Policy Act awards.

<R05>
Sec. 926.7004  Size standard for Energy Policy Act procurements.

    The size standard for Energy Policy Act engineering services 
procurements (SIC 8711) shall be the size standard specified for 
military and aerospace equipment and military weapons.


<R05>
Sec. 926.7005  Preferences under the Energy Policy Act.

    (a) Prime contracts. Solicitations for all competitive Energy Policy 
Act procurements not for 8(a) firms and in excess of the simplified 
acquisition threshold shall provide for an evaluation preference for 
offers received from entities from among the Energy Policy Act target 
groups. The evaluation criteria shall provide that in instances in which 
two or more proposals being considered for final selection are ranked as 
essentially equal after consideration of all technical and cost 
evaluation factors, and if one of these proposals is from an offeror 
from among an Energy Policy Act target group that offeror will be 
selected for award.
    (b) Subcontracts. (1) The contracting officer shall assure that all 
competitive Energy Policy Act solicitations over the simplified 
acquisition threshold contain:
    (i) A solicitation provision providing for consideration of the 
extent to which the offerors have provided for subcontracting 
opportunities to entities from among the Energy Policy Act target 
groups; and
    (ii) A clause providing for the maximum utilization of entities from 
among Energy Policy Act target groups in the performance of Energy 
Policy Act contracts.
    (2) In addition, the contracting officer shall assure that all 
competitive Energy Policy Act procurements expected to exceed $500,000 
($1,000,000 for construction) include a clause for reporting after award 
as part of the Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business 
Subcontracting Plan process.


<R05>
Sec. 926.7006  Goal measurement and reporting requirements.

    (a) General. The following types of contract awards for Energy 
Policy Act procurements shall be counted toward achievement by DOE of 
the 10 percent goal:
    (1) Any award set-aside for small disadvantaged business;
    (2) Any competitive section 8(a) award;
    (3) Any competitive award to one of the three target groups under an 
unrestricted procurement;
    (4) Any award to one of the three target groups conducted under 
simplified acquisition procedures in excess of the micro-purchase 
threshold; and,
    (5) Any competitively awarded subcontract to one of the three target 
groups under a prime award.
    (b) Prime contract awards. Award values and dollars obligated under 
prime contracts and modifications to prime contracts for Energy Policy 
Act requirements shall be reported through the Department of Energy 
Procurement and Assistance Data System.
    (c) Subcontract awards. The contractor shall be required to report, 
on an annual Federal Government fiscal year basis, its progress against 
Section 3021 goals by providing the actual dollar value of subcontract 
payments and the relationship of those payments to the incurred contract 
cost. If the contract includes reporting requirements under (FAR) 48 CFR 
52.219-9, Small Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting 
Plan, the contractor's progress against the Section 3021 goals shall be 
included as an addendum to Standard Form (SF) 294, Subcontracting Report 
for Individual Contracts, and/or SF 295, Summary Subcontract Report, as 
applicable, for

 Subpart 926.71_Implementation of Section 3161 of the National Defense 
                 Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993.

    Source: 62 FR 34861, June 27, 1997, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 926.7101  Policy.

    Consistent with the requirements of Section 3161(c)(2), 42 U.S.C. 
7474h(c)(2), in instances where DOE has determined that a change in 
workforce at a DOE Defense Nuclear Facility is necessary, the 
Department, to the extent practicable, is required to provide employees 
under Department of Energy contracts whose employment in positions at 
such a facility is terminated with a preference in any hiring of the 
Department. Consistent with published DOE guidance regarding Section 
3161, such preference in hiring extends to hiring by DOE contractors and 
subcontractors.


<R05>
Sec. 926.7102  Definition.

    Eligible employee means a current or former employee of a contractor 
or subcontractor employed at a DOE Defense Nuclear Facility--
    (1) Whose position of employment has been, or will be, involuntarily 
terminated (except if terminated for cause),
    (2) Who has met the eligibility criteria contained in Department of 
Energy guidance for contractor work force restructuring, as may be 
amended or supplemented from time to time, and
    (3) Who is qualified for a job vacancy with the Department or one of 
its contractors with respect to work under its contract with the 
Department at the time a position is available.


<R05>
Sec. 926.7103  Requirements.

    (a) Section 3161, 42 U.S.C. 7474h, confers a continuing right to a 
preference in hiring to an eligible employee of Department of Energy 
Defense Nuclear Facilities. This right to a preference in hiring 
includes employment opportunities of any Department of Energy 
contractor, regardless of the place of performance of the contract. 
Accordingly, eligible former employees of contractors and subcontractors 
employed at Department of Energy Defense Nuclear Facilities, to the 
extent practicable, shall be provided a hiring preference in employment 
opportunities of other Department of Energy contractors for work under 
their contracts.
    (b) The Office of Worker and Community Transition (WT) is 
responsible for establishing policies and procedures relating to the 
Department of Energy implementation of Section 3161. Contracting 
Officers, in concert with representatives of the field office 
responsible for implementation of Section 3161 at the Department of 
Energy Defense Nuclear Facility and local counsel, should consult with 
the Office of Worker and Community Transition to

[[Page 326]]

determine applicability of Section 3161 requirements, including hiring 
preference requirements, for displaced workers.


<R05>
Sec. 926.7104  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 48 CFR (DEAR) 
952.226-74, Displaced Employee Hiring Preference, in contracts (except 
for contracts for commercial items, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 403) which 
exceed $500,000 in value.

the impact of third party-owned patents covering technology that may be 
incorporated in the project which patents may ultimately affect 
widespread commercial use of the project results. In such situations, 
Patent Counsel shall be consulted to determine what modifications, if 
any, are to be made to the utilization of the Authorization and Consent 
and Patent Indemnity provisions or what other action might be deemed 
appropriate.


<R05>
Sec. 927.206  Refund of royalties.


<R05>
Sec. 927.206-1  General.

    The clause at 952.227-9, Refund of Royalties, obligates the 
contractor to inform DOE of the payment of royalties pertaining to the 
use of intellectual property, either patent or data related, in the 
performance of the contract. This information may result in 
identification of instances in which the Government already has a 
license for itself or others acting in its behalf or the right to 
sublicense others. Also, there may be pending antitrust actions or 
challenges to the validity of a patent or the proprietary nature of the 
data, or the contractor may be able to gain unrestricted access to the 
same data through other sources. In such situations the contractor may 
avoid the payment of a royalty in its entirety or may be charged a 
reduced royalty.

[[Page 328]]


<R05>
Sec. 927.206-2  Clause for refund of royalties.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.227-9, Refund 
of Royalties, in solicitations and contracts for experimental, research, 
developmental, or demonstration work or other solicitations and 
contracts in which the contracting officer believes royalties will have 
to be paid by the contractor or a subcontractor of any tier.


<R05>
Sec. 927.207  Classified contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 927.207-1  General.

    Unauthorized disclosure of classified subject matter, whether in a 
patent application or resulting from the issuance of a patent, may be a 
violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, other laws 
relating to espionage and national security, and provisions of the 
proposed contract pertaining to disclosure of information.

         Subpart 927.3_Patent Rights Under Government Contracts


<R05>
Sec. 927.300  General.

    (a) One of the primary missions of the Department of Energy is the 
use of its procurement process to ensure the conduct of research, 
development, and demonstration leading to the ultimate commercialization 
of efficient sources of energy. To accomplish its mission, DOE must work 
in cooperation with industry in the development of new energy sources 
and in achieving the ultimate goal of widespread commercial use of those 
energy sources. To this end, Congress has provided DOE with the 
authority to invoke an array of incentives to secure the 
commercialization of new technologies developed for DOE. One such 
important incentive is provided by the patent system.
    (b) Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 2182 and 42 U.S.C. 5908, DOE takes title 
to all inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the 
course of or under contracts with large, for-profit companies, foreign 
organizations, and others not beneficiaries of Pub. L. 96-517. 
Regulations dealing with Department's authority to waive its title to 
subject inventions, including the relevant statutory objectives, exist 
at 10 CFR part 784. Pursuant to that section, DOE may waive the 
Government's patent rights in appropriate situations at the time of 
contracting to encourage industrial participation, foster commercial 
utilization and competition, and make the benefits of DOE activities 
widely available to the public. In addition to considering the waiver of 
patent rights at the time of contracting, DOE will also consider the 
incentive of a waiver of patent rights upon the reporting of an 
identified invention when requested by such entities or by the employee-
inventor with the permission of the contractor. These requests can be 
made whether or not a waiver request was made at the time of 
contracting. Waivers for identified inventions will be granted where it 
is determined that the patent waiver will be a meaningful incentive to 
achieving the development and ultimate commercial utilization of 
inventions. Where DOE grants a waiver of the Government's patent rights, 
either at the time of contracting or after an invention is made, certain 
minimum rights and obligations will be required by DOE to protect the 
public interest.
    (c) Another major DOE mission is to manage the nation's nuclear 
weapons and other classified programs, where research and development 
procurements are directed toward processes and equipment not available 
to the public. To accomplish DOE programs for bringing private industry 
into these and other special programs to the maximum extent permitted by 
national security and policy considerations, it is desirable that the 
technology developed in these programs be made available on a selected 
basis for use in the particular fields of interest and under controlled 
conditions by properly cleared industrial and scientific research 
institutions. To ensure such availability and control, the grant of 
waivers in these programs may necessarily be more limited, either by the 
imposition of field of use restrictions or national security measures, 
than in other DOE programs.

<R05>
Sec. 927.302  Policy.

    (a) Except for contracts with organizations that are beneficiaries 
of Public Law 96-517, the United States, as represented by DOE, shall 
normally acquire title in and to any invention or discovery conceived or 
first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under the 
contract, allowing the contractor to retain a nonexclusive, revocable, 
paid-up license in the invention and the right to request permission to 
file an application for a patent and retain title to any ensuing patent 
in any foreign country in which DOE does not elect to secure patent 
rights. DOE may approve the request if it determines that such approval 
would be in the national interest. The contractor's nonexclusive license 
may be revoked or modified by DOE only to the extent necessary to 
achieve expeditious practical application of the invention pursuant to 
any application for and the grant of an exclusive license in the 
invention to another party.
    (b) In contracts having as a purpose the conduct of research, 
development, or demonstration work and in certain other contracts, DOE 
may need to require those contractors that are not the beneficiaries of 
Public Law 96-517 to license background patents to ensure reasonable 
public availability and accessibility necessary to practice the subject 
of the contract in the fields of technology specifically contemplated in 
the contract effort. That need may arise where the contractor is not 
attempting to take the technology resulting from the contract to the 
commercial marketplace, or is not meeting market demands. The need for 
background patent rights and the particular rights that should be 
obtained for either the Government or the public will depend upon the 
type, purpose, and scope of the contract effort, impact on the DOE 
program, and the cost to the Government of obtaining such rights.
    (c) Provisions to deal specifically with DOE background patent 
rights are contained in paragraph (k) of the clause at 952.227-13. That 
paragraph may be modified with the concurrence of Patent Counsel in 
order to reflect the equities of the parties in particular contracting 
situations. Paragraph (k) should normally be deleted for contracts with 
an estimated cost and fee or price of $250,000 or less and may not be 
appropriate for certain types of study contracts; for planning 
contracts; for contracts with educational institutions; for contracts 
for specialized equipment for in-house Government use, not involving use 
by the public; and for contracts the work products of which will not be 
the subject of future procurements by the Government or its contractors.
    (d) The Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and 
Intellectual Property shall:
    (1) Make the determination that whether reported inventions are 
subject inventions under the patent rights clause of the contract;
    (2) Determine whether and where patent protection will be obtained 
on inventions;
    (3) Represent DOE before domestic and foreign patent offices;
    (4) Accept assignments and instruments confirmatory of the 
Government's rights to inventions; and
    (5) Represent DOE in patent, technical data, and copyright matters 
not specifically reserved to the Head of the Agency or designee.

    (b) DOE shall not use the clause at (FAR) 48 CFR 52.227-12 except in 
situations where patent counsel grants a request for advance waiver 
pursuant to 10 CFR part 784 and supplies the contracting officer with 
that clause with appropriate modifications. Otherwise, in instances in 
which DOE grants an advance waiver or waives its rights in an identified

consult with patent counsel for the appropriate clause.
    (c) Any contract that has as a purpose the design, construction,

rights with respect to further use of the facility by or on behalf of 
the Government upon termination of the contract. The patent rights 
clause in such contracts must include the following facilities license 
paragraph:

    [Insert appropriate paragraph no.] Facilities License. In addition 
to the rights of the parties with respect to inventions or discoveries 
conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or 
under this contract, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to 
the Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in and to 
any inventions or discoveries regardless of when conceived or actually 
reduced to practice or acquired by the Contractor at any time through 
completion of this contract and which are incorporated or embodied in 
the construction of the facility or which are utilized in the operation 
of the facility or which cover articles, materials, or products 
manufactured at the facility (1) to practice or have practiced by or for 
the Government at the facility, and (2) to transfer such license with 
the transfer of that facility. Notwithstanding the acceptance or 
exercise by the Government of these rights, the Government may contest 
at any time the enforceability, validity or scope of, title to, any 
rights or patents herein licensed.

               Subpart 927.4_Technical Data and Copyrights


<R05>
Sec. 927.400  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart sets forth DOE's policy, procedures, and instructions 
for contract clauses with respect to the acquisition and use of 
technical data and copyrights in contracts or subcontracts entered into, 
with or for the benefit of the Government.


<R05>
Sec. 927.402  Acquisition and use of technical data.


<R05>
Sec. 927.402-1  General.

    (a) The provisions herein pertain to research, development, 
demonstration and supply contracts. Special considerations for contracts 
for the operation, design, or construction of Government-owned 
facilities are covered by subpart 970.27. Under DOE's broad charter to 
perform research, development, and demonstration work, in both nuclear 
and nonnuclear fields, and to meet the objectives stated in 927.402-2, 
DOE has extensive needs for technical data. The satisfaction of these 
needs and the achievement of DOE's objectives through a sound data 
policy are found in the balancing of the needs and equities of the 
Government, its contractors, and the general public.
    (b) It is important to keep a clear distinction between contract 
requirements for the delivery of technical data and rights in technical 
data. The legal rights which the Government acquires in technical data 
in DOE contracts, other than management and operating contracts (see 48 
CFR 970.2704)

[[Page 331]]

and other contracts involving the production of data necessary for the 
management or operation of DOE facilities or a DOE site, are set forth 
in Rights in Data--General clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14 as modified in 
accordance with 927.409 of this subpart. In those contracts involving 
the production of data necessary for the management or operation of DOE 
facilities or a DOE site, after consultation with Patent Counsel the 
clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1 shall be used. However, those clauses do not 
obtain for the Government delivery of any data whatsoever. Rather, known 
requirements for the technical data to be delivered by the contractor 
shall be set forth as part of the contract. The Additional Technical 
Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 may be used along with the 
Rights in Data--General clause to enable the contracting officer to 
require the contractor to furnish additional technical data, the 
requirement for which was not known at the time of contracting. There 
is, however, a built-in limitation on the kind of technical data which a 
contractor may be required to deliver under either the contract or the 
Additional Technical Data Requirements clause. This limitation is found 
in the withholding provision of paragraph (g) of the Rights in Data--
General clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, as amended at 48 CFR 927.409(a), 
which provides that the Contractor need not furnish limited rights data 
or restricted computer software. Unless Alternate II or III to the 
Rights in Data--General clause is used, it is specifically intended that 
the contractor may withhold limited rights data or restricted computer 
software even though a requirement for technical data specified in the 
contract or called for delivery pursuant to the Additional Technical 
Data Requirements clause would otherwise require the delivery of such 
data.
    (c) In contracts involving access to certain categories of DOE-owned 
restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, DOE has reserved the 
right to receive reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions 
and discoveries, including its related data and technology. Accordingly, 
in contracts where access to such restricted data is to be provided to 
contractors, the following parenthetical phrase shall be inserted after 
``contract data'' in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of the clause at 952.227-75, 
after ``technical data'' in paragraph (b)(2) of the clause at 952.227-
77, or after ``technical data'' in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of the clause at 
952.227-78 as appropriate: ``(except Restricted Data in category C-24, 
10 CFR part 725, in which DOE has reserved the right to receive 
reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, 
including related data and technology).'' In addition, there are other 
types of contract situations (e.g., no cost contracts for studies or 
evaluation) wherein the contractor is given access to restricted data. 
In such contract situations, limitations on the use of such data may be 
appropriate.

[49 FR 12004, Mar. 28, 1984, as amended at 63 FR 10505, Mar. 4, 1998; 65 
FR 81007, Dec. 22, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 927.402-2  Policy.

    The technical data policy is directed toward achieving the following 
objectives:
    (a) Making the benefits of the energy research, development and 
demonstration programs of DOE widely available to the public in the 
shortest practicable time;
    (b) Promoting the commercial utilization of the technology developed 
under DOE programs;
    (c) Encouraging participation by private persons in DOE energy 
research, development, and demonstration programs; and
    (d) Fostering competition and preventing undue market concentration 
or the creation or maintenance of other situations inconsistent with the 
antitrust laws.


<R05>
Sec. 927.403  Negotiations and deviations.

    Contracting officers shall contact Patent Counsel assisting their 
contracting activity or the Assistant General Counsel for Technology 
Transfer and Intellectual Property for assistance in selecting, 
negotiating, or approving appropriate data and copyright clauses in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in this subpart and 48 CFR part 
27.4. In particular, contracting officers shall seek the prompt

[[Page 332]]

and timely advice of Patent Counsel regarding any situation not in 
conformance with this subpart and prescribed clauses, including the 
inclusion or modification of alternate paragraphs of the Rights in Data 
clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, as amended at 48 CFR 927.409(a), the 
exclusion of specific items from said clause, the exclusion of the 
Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16, and 
the inclusion of any special provisions in a particular contract.

[63 FR 10505, Mar. 4, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 927.404  Rights in technical data in subcontracts. (DOE coverage--
          paragraphs (g), (k), (l), and (m))

    (g)(4) Contractors are required by paragraph (d)(3) of the clause at 
FAR 52.227-14, as modified pursuant to 48 CFR 927.409(a)(1), to acquire 
permission from DOE to assert copyright in any computer software first 
produced in the performance of the contract. This requirement reflects 
DOE's established software distribution program, recognized at FAR 
27.404(g)(2), and the Department's statutory dissemination obligations. 
When a contractor requests permission to assert copyright in accordance 
with paragraph (d)(3) of the Rights in Data--General clause as 
prescribed for use at 48 CFR 927.409(a)(1), Patent Counsel shall 
predicate its decision on the considerations reflected in paragraph (e) 
of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2 Rights in Data--Technology Transfer.
    (k) Subcontracts. (1)(i) It is the responsibility of prime 
contractors and higher tier subcontractors, in meeting their obligations 
with respect to contract data, to obtain from their subcontractor the 
rights in, access to, and delivery of such data on behalf of the 
Government. Accordingly, subject to the policy set forth in this 
subpart, and subject to the approval of the contracting officer, where 
required, selection of appropriate technical data provisions for 
subcontracts is the responsibility of the prime contractors or higher-
tier subcontractors. In many, but not all instances, use of the Rights 
in Technical Data clause of FAR 52.227-14, as modified pursuant to 48 
CFR 927.409(a)(1), in a subcontract will provide for sufficient 
Government rights in and access to technical data. The inspection rights 
afforded in Alternate V of that clause normally should be obtained only 
in first-tier subcontracts having as a purpose the conduct of research, 
development, or demonstration work or the furnishing of supplies for 
which there are substantial technical data requirements as reflected in 
the prime contract.
    (ii) If a subcontractor refuses to accept technical data provisions 
affording rights in and access to technical data on behalf of the 
Government, the contractor shall so inform the contracting officer in 
writing and not proceed with the award of the subcontract without 
written authorization of the contracting officer.
    (iii) In prime contracts (or higher-tier subcontracts) which contain 
the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at FAR 52.227-16, it 
is the further responsibility of the contractor (or higher-tier 
subcontractor) to determine whether inclusion of such clause in a 
subcontract is required to satisfy technical data requirements of the 
prime contract (or higher-tier subcontract).
    (2) As is the case for DOE in its determination of technical data 
requirements, the Additional Technical Data Requirements clause at FAR 
52.227-16 should not be used at any subcontracting tier where the 
technical data requirements are fully known. Normally, the clause will 
be used only in subcontracts having as a purpose the conduct of 
research, development, or demonstration work. Prime contractors and 
higher-tier subcontractors shall not use their power to award 
subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights in the 
subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software for 
their private use, and they shall not acquire rights to limited rights 
data or restricted computer software on behalf of the Government for 
standard commercial items without the prior approval of Patent Counsel.
    (l) Contractor licensing. In many contracting situations the 
achievement of DOE's objectives would be frustrated if the Government, 
at the time of contracting, did not obtain on behalf of responsible 
third parties and itself limited license rights in and to limited

[[Page 333]]

rights data or restricted computer software or both necessary for the 
practice of subject inventions or data first produced or delivered in 
the performance of the contract. Where the purpose of the contract is 
research, development, or demonstration, contracting officers should 
consult with program officials and Patent Counsel to consider whether 
such rights should be acquired. No such rights should be obtained from a 
small business or non-profit organization, unless similar rights in 
background inventions of the small business or non-profit organization 
have been authorized in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(f). In all cases 
when the contractor has agreed to include a provision assuring 
commercial availability of background patents, consideration should be 
given to securing for the Government and responsible third parties at 
reasonable royalties and under appropriate restrictions, co-extensive 
license rights for data which are limited rights data and restricted 
computer software. When such license rights are deemed necessary, the 
Rights in Data-General clause at FAR 52.227-14 should be supplemented by 
the addition of Alternate VI as provided at 48 CFR 952.227-14. Alternate 
VI will normally be sufficient to cover limited rights data and 
restricted computer software for items and processes that were used in 
the contract and are necessary in order to insure widespread commercial 
use or practical utilization of a subject of the contract. The 
expression ``subject of the contract'' is intended to limit the 
licensing required in Alternate VI to the fields of technology 
specifically contemplated in the contract effort and may be replaced by 
a more specific statement of the fields of technology intended to be 
covered in the manner described in the patent clause at 48 CFR 952.227-
13 pertaining to ``Background Patents.'' Where, however, limited rights 
data and restricted computer software cover the main purpose or basic 
technology of the research, development, or demonstration effort of the 
contract, rather than subcomponents, products, or processes which are 
ancillary to the contract effort, the limitations set forth in 
subparagraphs (k)(1) through (k)(4) of Alternate VI of 48 CFR 952.227-14 
should be modified or deleted. Paragraph (k) of 48 CFR 952.227-14 
further provides that limited rights data or restricted computer 
software may be specified in the contract as being excluded from or not 
subject to the licensing requirements thereof. This exclusion can be 
implemented by limiting the applicability of the provisions of paragraph 
(k) of 48 CFR 952.227-14 to only those classes or categories of limited 
rights data and restricted computer software determined as being 
essential for licensing. Although contractor licensing may be required 
under paragraph (k) of 48 CFR 952.227-14, the final resolution of 
questions regarding the scope of such licenses and the terms thereof, 
including provisions for confidentiality, and reasonable royalties, is 
then left to the negotiation of the parties.
    (m) Access to restricted data. In contracts involving access to 
certain categories of DOE-owned Category C-24 restricted data, as set 
forth in 10 CFR part 725, DOE has reserved the right to receive 
reasonable compensation for the use of its inventions and discoveries, 
including its related data and technology. Accordingly, in contracts 
where access to such restricted data is to be provided to contractors, 
Alternate VII shall be incorporated into the rights in technical data 
clause of the contract. In addition, in any other types of contracting 
situations in which the contractor may be given access to restricted 
data, appropriate limitations on the use of such data must be specified.

[63 FR 10505, Mar. 4, 1998, as amended at 65 FR 81007, Dec. 22, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 927.404-70  Statutory programs.

    Occasionally, Congress enacts legislation that authorizes or 
requires the Department to protect from public disclosure specific data 
first produced in the performance of the contract. Examples of such 
programs are ``the Metals Initiative'' and section 3001(d) of the Energy 
Policy Act. In such cases DOE Patent Counsel is responsible for 
providing the appropriate contractual provisions for protecting the data 
in accordance with the statute. Generally, such clauses will be based 
upon the Rights in Data-General clause prescribed for use at 48 CFR 
927.409(a) with

[[Page 334]]

appropriate modifications to define and protect the ``protected data'' 
in accordance with the applicable statute. When contracts under such 
statutes are to be awarded, contracting officers must acquire from 
Patent Counsel the appropriate contractual provisions. Additionally, the 
contracting officer must consult with DOE program personnel and Patent 
Counsel to identify data first produced in the performance of the 
contract that will be recognized by the parties as protected data and 
what data will be made available to the public notwithstanding the 
statutory authority to withhold the data from public dissemination.

[63 FR 10506, Mar. 4, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 927.408  Cosponsored research and development activities.

    Because of the Department of Energy's statutory duties to 
disseminate data first produced under its contracts for research, 
development, and demonstration, the provisions of FAR 27.408 do not 
apply to cosponsored or cost shared contracts.

Sec. 927.409  Solicitation provisions and contract clauses. (DOE 
          coverage-paragraphs (a), (h), (s), and (t))

    (a)(1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at FAR 
52.227-14, Rights in Data-General, substituting the following paragraph 
(a) and including the following paragraph (d)(3) and Alternate V in 
solicitations and contracts if it is contemplated that data will be 
produced, furnished, or acquired under the contract; except contracting 
officers are authorized to use Alternate IV rather than paragraph (d)(3) 
in contracts for basic or applied research with educational institutions 
except where software is specified for delivery or except where other 
special circumstances exist:

    (a) Definitions.
    (1) Computer data bases, as used in this clause, means a collection 
of data in a form capable of, and for the purpose of, being stored in, 
processed, and operated on by a computer. The term does not include 
computer software.
    (2) Computer software, as used in this clause, means (i) computer 
programs which are data comprising a series of instructions, rules, 
routines, or statements, regardless of the media in which recorded, that 
allow or cause a computer to perform a specific operation or series of 
operations and (ii) data comprising source code listings, design 
details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae, and related 
material that would enable the computer program to be produced, created, 
or compiled. The term does not include computer data bases.
    (3) Data, as used in this clause, means recorded information, 
regardless of form or the media on which it may be recorded. The term 
includes technical data and computer software. For the purposes of this 
clause, the term does not include data incidental to the administration 
of this contract, such as financial, administrative, cost and pricing, 
or management information.
    (4) Form, fit, and function data, as used in this clause, means data 
relating to items, components, or processes that are sufficient to 
enable physical and functional interchangeability, as well as data 
identifying source, size, configuration, mating, and attachment 
characteristics, functional characteristics, and performance 
requirements; except that for computer software it means data 
identifying source, functional characteristics, and performance 
requirements but specifically excludes the source code, algorithm, 
process, formulae, and flow charts of the software.
    (5) Limited rights data, as used in this clause, means data, other 
than computer software, developed at private expense that embody trade 
secrets or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged. 
The Government's rights to use, duplicate, or disclose limited rights 
data are as set forth in the Limited Rights Notice of subparagraph 
(g)(2) of this section if included in this clause.
    (6) Restricted computer software, as used in this clause, means 
computer software developed at private expense and that is a trade 
secret; is commercial or financial and is confidential or privileged; or 
is published copyrighted computer software, including minor 
modifications of any such computer software. The Government's rights to 
use, duplicate, or disclose restricted computer software are as set 
forth in the Restricted Rights Notice of subparagraph (g)(3) of this 
section if included in this clause.
    (7) Technical data, as used in this clause, means recorded data, 
regardless of form or characteristic, that are of a scientific or 
technical nature. Technical data does not include computer software, but 
does include manuals and instructional materials and technical data 
formatted as a computer data base.
    (8) Unlimited rights, as used in this clause, means the rights of 
the Government to use, disclose, reproduce, prepare derivative

[[Page 335]]

works, distribute copies to the public, including by electronic means, 
and perform publicly and display publicly, in any manner, including by 
electronic means, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or permit 
others to do so.
    (d)(3) The Contractor agrees not to assert copyright in computer 
software first produced in the performance of this contract without 
prior written permission of the DOE Patent Counsel assisting the 
contracting activity. When such permission is granted, the Patent 
Counsel shall specify appropriate terms, conditions, and submission 
requirements to assure utilization, dissemination, and commercialization 
of the data. The Contractor, when requested, shall promptly deliver to 
Patent Counsel a duly executed and approved instrument fully 
confirmatory of all rights to which the Government is entitled.

    (2) However, rights in data in these specific situations will be 
treated as described, where the contract is--
    (i) For the production of special works of the type set forth in FAR 
27.405(a), but the clause at FAR 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General, 
shall be included in the contract and made applicable to data other than 
special works, as appropriate (See paragraph (i) of FAR 27.409);
    (ii) For the acquisition of existing data works, as described in FAR 
27.405(b) (See paragraph (j) of FAR 27.409);
    (iii) To be performed outside the United States, its possessions, 
and Puerto Rico, in which case agencies may prescribe different clauses 
(See paragraph (n) of FAR 27.409);
    (iv) For architect-engineer services or construction work, in which 
case contracting officers shall utilize the clause at FAR 52.227-17, 
Rights in Data-Special Works;
    (v) A Small Business Innovation Research contract (See paragraph (l) 
of FAR 27.409);
    (vi) For management and operation of a DOE facility (see 48 CFR 
970.2704) or other contracts involving the production of data necessary 
for the management or operation of DOE facilities or a DOE site, after 
consultation with Patent Counsel (See 927.402-1(b)); or
    (vii) Awarded pursuant to a statute expressly providing authority 
for the protection of data first produced thereunder from disclosure or 
dissemination. (See 927.404-70).
    (h) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at FAR 52.227-
16, Additional Data Requirements, in solicitations and contracts 
involving experimental, developmental, research, or demonstration work 
(other than basic or applied research to be performed solely by a 
university or college where the contract amount will be $500,000 or 
less) unless all the requirements for data are believed to be known at 
the time of contracting and specified in the contract. See FAR 
27.406(b). This clause may also be used in other contracts when 
considered appropriate.

                                * * * * *

    (s) Contracting officers shall incorporate the solicitation 
provision at FAR 52.227-23, Rights to Proposal Data (Technical), in all 
requests for proposals.
    (t) Contracting officers shall include the solicitation provision at 
952.227-84 in all solicitations involving research, developmental, or

Sec. 931.205-47  Costs related to legal and other proceedings. (DOE 
          coverage-paragraph (h)).

    (h) Costs Associated with Whistleblower Actions.
    (1) Definitions for purposes of this paragraph (h):
    Covered contractors and subcontractors means those contractors and 
subcontractors with contracts exceeding $5,000,000.
    Employee whistleblower action means any action filed by an employee 
in Federal or state court for redress of a retaliatory act by a 
contractor and any administrative procedure initiated by an employee 
under 29 CFR Part 24, 48 CFR subpart 3.9, 10 CFR Part 708 or 42 U.S.C. 
7239.
    Retaliatory act means a discharge, demotion, reduction in pay, 
coercion, restraint, threat, intimidation or other similar negative 
action taken against an employee by a contractor as a result of an 
employee's activity protected as a whistleblower activity by a Federal 
or state statute or regulation.
    Settlement and award costs means defense costs and costs arising 
from judicial orders, negotiated agreements, arbitration, or an order 
from a Federal agency or board and includes compensatory damages, 
underpayment for work performed, and reimbursement for a complainant 
employee's legal counsel.

[[Page 338]]

    (2) For costs associated with employee whistleblower actions where a 
retaliatory act is alleged against a covered contractor or 
subcontractor, the contracting officer:
    (i) May authorize reimbursement of costs on a provisional basis, in 
appropriate cases;
    (ii) Must consult with the Office of General Counsel whistleblower 
costs point of contact, who will consult with other Headquarters points 
of contact as appropriate, before making a final allowability 
determination; and
    (iii) Must determine allowability of defense, settlement and award 
costs on a case-by-case basis after considering the terms of the 
contract, relevant cost regulations, and the relevant facts and 
circumstances, including federal law and policy prohibiting reprisal 
against whistleblowers, available at the conclusion of the employee 
whistleblower action.
    (3) Covered contractors and subcontractors must segregate legal 
costs, including costs of in-house counsel, incurred in the defense of 
an employee whistleblower action so that the costs are separately 
identifiable.
    (4) If a contracting officer provisionally disallows costs 
associated with an employee whistleblower action for a covered 
contractor or subcontractor, funds advanced by the Department may not be 
used to finance costs connected with the defense, settlement and award 
of an employee whistleblower action.
    (5) Contractor defense, settlement and award costs incurred in 
connection with the defense of suits brought by employees under section 
2 of the Major Fraud Act of 1988 are excluded from coverage of this 
section.

    (b) The DOE contracting officer has primary responsibility for

responsibility for debt collection.

                   Subpart 932.8_Assignment of Claims


<R05>
Sec. 932.803  Policies.

    (d) In the case of prime contracts, when it has been determined that 
the financing of contracts will be facilitated in the interest of DOE 
programs, it is the policy of DOE that such contracts provide, or be 
amended without consideration (see Assignment of Claims Act of 1940) to 
provide, in conformance with FAR 32.804, that payments to be made to an 
assignee shall not be subject to reduction or setoff. In the case of 
subcontracts, when loans are made for the purpose of financing 
performance of subcontracts under DOE prime contracts, financing 
institutions or the Government as guarantor in those instances in which 
such loans are guaranteed should not be required to incur risks of loss 
by reason of possible diversion of assigned subcontracts proceeds for 
payment of other claims of the prime contractor against the borrower, 
otherwise unrelated to the assigned subcontracts. The Head of the 
Contracting Activity shall require the adoption of these policies and 
practices by DOE prime contractors with respect to DOE subcontract work. 
The Head of the Contracting Activity should inform the Chief Financial 
Officer, Headquarters of each DOE contractor who is unwilling to adopt 
policies consistent with this paragraph and the reasons given in support 
of the contractor's position.

Sec. 932.970  Implementing DOE policies and procedures.

    (a) Invoice payments--(1) Contract Settlement Date. For purposes of 
determining any interest penalties under cost-type contracts, the 
effective date of contract settlement shall be the effective date of the 
final contract modification issued to acknowledge contract settlement 
and to close out the contract.
    (2) Constructive acceptance periods. Where the contracting officer 
determines, in writing, on a case-by-case basis, that it is not 
reasonable or feasible for DOE to perform the acceptance or approval 
function within the standard period, the contracting officer should 
specify a longer constructive acceptance or approval period, as 
appropriate. Considerations include, but are not limited to, the nature 
of supplies or services involved, geographical site location, inspection 
and testing requirements, shipping and acceptance terms, and available 
DOE resources.
    (b) Contract financing payments. Contracting officers may specify 
payment due dates that are less than the standard 30 days when a 
determination is made, in writing, on a case-by-case basis, that a 
shorter contract financing payment cycle will be required to finance 
contract work. In such cases, the contracting officer should coordinate 
with the finance and program officials that will be involved in the 
payment process to ensure that the contract payment terms to be 
specified in solicitations and resulting contract awards can be 
reasonably met. Consideration should be given to geographical 
separation, workload, contractor ability to submit a proper request, and 
other factors that could affect timing of payment. However, payment due 
dates that are less than 7 days for progress payments or less than 14 
days for interim payments on cost-type contracts are not authorized.

               Subpart 932.70_DOE Loan Guarantee Authority


<R05>
Sec. 932.7002  Authority.

    Guaranteed loan applications shall be authorized and transmitted to 
the Federal Reserve Board only by the Secretary, or designee specified 
for that purpose, and only when made pursuant to enabling legislation or 
other authority; e.g., by executive order or regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 932.7003  Policies.

    The following policies governing the exercise of its loan guarantee 
authority have been established by DOE:
    (a) The use of the loan guarantee authority is not restricted to 
contracts or subcontracts of any particular type or class. Each case is 
to be evaluated on its own merits and under the particular circumstances 
applicable thereto.
    (b) The fact that a contract has been awarded as a result of 
competitive bidding should not, of itself, render the loan ineligible 
for guarantee by DOE if the contractor is financially responsible and 
its need for working capital is the result of the impact of a defense 
program or any other DOE program for which guaranteed loans are 
authorized.
    (c) The guarantee authority should, in general, not be used in 
connection with loans to contractors required to furnish performance 
bonds, except in those cases in which the time likely to be required for 
the surety or DOE to take over in the event of default will result in 
delays which cannot be tolerated by the particular program concerned. 
When performance bonds have been furnished, the surety shall be required 
to subordinate its rights in favor of the guaranteed loan.
    (d) The criterion that the materials or services to be provided 
cannot readily be acquired from alternative sources does not require the 
finding that the materials or services are absolutely unobtainable 
elsewhere. The criterion should be so applied as to permit guarantees of 
loans when, although the materials or services can be obtained 
elsewhere, such factors as the urgency of supply schedules, technical 
capacity

[[Page 341]]

of the contractor, comparative prices, and time and expense involved in 
reissuing the contract, including termination payment, establish that it 
is to the Government's advantage not to resort to alternative sources 
merely because the contractor or subcontractor may require a guaranteed 
loan.
    (e) If it is known at the time the contract is to be awarded that 
the low offeror who is technically qualified and competent to furnish 
the required materials and services will require a guaranteed loan, the 
contracting officer should obtain appropriate advice and in reaching a 
decision should consider at least the following:
    (1) The savings to be realized by awarding the contract to the low 
offeror;
    (2) The risk to the Government in guaranteeing a loan; and
    (3) The likelihood, if award is made to the second low offeror, of 
that offeror's applying for a guaranteed loan at a later date.

Extreme care should be exercised in rejecting a low bid or proposal 
simply because the low offeror requires a guaranteed loan.
    (f) The amount of the loan should bear reasonable relationship to 
such factors as the value and terms of the contract, the probable 
investment required to be made by the contractor in payrolls and 
inventories, the frequency with which contract payments are to be made, 
and the borrower's current working capital position.
    (g) Borrowings for working capital purposes under guaranteed loans 
shall be limited to the amount necessary to perform the contract for 
which the loan is sought. In order that the contractor will also use its 
own funds in the performance of the contracts, amounts outstanding under 
the loan or line-of-credit shall be limited to an amount not to exceed 
90 percent of the borrower's investment in its contracts, regardless of 
the total amount of the loan or line of credit authorized. The 
borrower's investment includes all items for which the borrower would be 
entitled to payment on performance or termination of contracts, but does 
not include any items for which no work has been done nor expenditures 
made.
    (h) Unless there are exceptional circumstances, the loan should 
mature not later than 30 days after the estimated date of final payment 
under the contract.

App. 2091) shall be essentially the same as those set forth in FAR 
32.304, Procedures, FAR 32.305, Loan Guarantees for Terminated 
Contracts, and FAR 32.306 Loan Guarantee for Subcontacts; except that 
any contrary provisions required by enabling legislation authorizing the 
loan shall govern.

Sec. 932.7004-2  Criteria.

    (a) The materials or services to be furnished by the contractor are 
necessary to the Government interest.
    (b) The materials or services cannot as a practical matter be 
obtained from alternate sources without delay or impeding the 
Government's interest, except that no small business concern shall be 
held ineligible for the issuance of such guarantee by reason of 
alternative sources of supply.
    (c) The contractor has demonstrated its inability to obtain the 
necessary financing in conventional credit channels without the 
guarantee.
    (d) There is reasonable assurance that the loan can be repaid.
    (e) The contractor is competent to perform the contract.

<R05>
Sec. 933.103  Protests to the agency. (DOE coverage--paragraphs (f), 
          (i), (j), and (k))

    (f) If FAR 33.103(f) requires that award be withheld or performance 
be suspended or the awarded contract be terminated pending resolution of 
an agency protest, authority to award and/or continue performance of the 
protested contract may be requested by the Head of the Contracting 
Activity (HCA), concurred in by counsel, and approved by the Procurement 
Executive.
    (i)(1) Protests filed with the contracting officer before or after 
award shall be decided by the Head of the Contracting Activity except 
for the following cases, which shall be decided by the Procurement 
Executive:
    (i) The protester requests that the protest be decided by the 
Procurement Executive.
    (ii) The HCA is the contracting officer of record at the time the 
protest is filed, having signed either the solicitation where the award 
has not been made, or the contract, where the award or nomination of the 
apparent successful offeror has been made.
    (iii) The HCA concludes that one or more of the issues raised in the 
protest have the potential for significant impact on DOE acquisition 
policy.
    (2) Upon receipt of a protest requesting a decision by the 
Procurement Executive, the contracting activity shall immediately 
provide a copy of the protest to the Office of Clearance and Support.
    (j) The Department of Energy encourages direct negotiations between 
an offeror and the contracting officer in an attempt to resolve 
protests. In those situations where the parties are not able to achieve 
resolution, the Department favors the use of alternative dispute 
resolution (ADR) techniques to resolve protests. A protest requesting a 
decision at the Headquarters level shall state whether the protester is 
willing to utilize ADR techniques such as mediation or nonbinding 
evaluation of the protest by a neutral. Upon receipt of a protest 
requesting a decision at the Headquarters level, the Office of Clearance 
and Support will explore with the protester whether the use of ADR 
techniques would be appropriate to resolve the protest. Both parties 
must agree that the use of such techniques is appropriate. If the 
parties do not mutually agree to utilize ADR to resolve the protest, the 
protest will be processed in accordance with the procedures set forth in 
paragraph (k).
    (k) Upon receipt of a protest lodged with the Department, the 
contracting officer shall prepare a report similar to that discussed in 
FAR 33.104(a)(3)(iii). In the case of a protest filed at the 
Headquarters level, the report shall be forwarded to the Office of 
Clearance and Support within 21 calendar days of being notified of such 
a protest with a proposed response to the protest. The Procurement 
Executive (for protests at the Headquarters level or those specific HCA 
protests cited in paragraph (i)(1)

[[Page 343]]

of this section) or an HCA (for protests at the contracting activity 
level) will render a decision on a protest within 35 calendar days, 
unless a longer period of time is determined to be needed.

Sec. 933.104  Protests to GAO. (DOE coverage--paragraphs (a), (b), (c), 
          and (g))

    (a)(2) The contracting officer shall provide the notice of protest.
    (b) Protests before award. (1) When the Department has received 
notice from the GAO of a protest filed directly with the GAO, a contract 
may not be awarded until the matter is resolved, unless authorized by 
the Head of the Contracting Activity in accordance with FAR 33.104(b). 
Before the Head of the Contracting Activity authorizes the award, the 
required finding shall be concurred in by the DOE counsel handling the 
protest, endorsed by the Senior Program Official, and approved by the 
Procurement Executive. The finding shall address the likelihood that the 
protest will be sustained by the GAO.
    (c) Protests after award. Before the Head of the Contracting 
Activity authorizes performance, the finding required by FAR 
33.104(c)(2) shall be concurred in by the DOE counsel handling the 
protest, endorsed by the Senior Program Official, and approved by the 
Procurement Executive.
    (g) Notice to GAO. (1) The report to the GAO regarding a decision 
not to comply with the GAO's recommendation, discussed at FAR 33.104(f), 
shall be provided by the HCA making the award, after approval of the 
Procurement Executive. If a DOE-wide policy issue is involved, the 
report shall be provided by the Procurement Executive.
    (2) It is the policy of the Department to comply promptly with 
recommendations set forth in Comptroller General Decisions except for 
compelling reasons.
    (3) The GAO does not have jurisdiction to consider subcontractor 
protests. 933.106 Solicitation provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 933.106  Solicitation provisions.

suppliers. Where the cost of reproduction is $10 or more, the charge 
shall be a minimum of $10 and subject to a maximum of $500, depending 
upon the size of the project and the number of drawings and the volume 
of specifications involved. Where the cost of reproduction is less than 
$10, the contracting officer has authority to make distribution at cost 
of reproduction, or free of charge, as a particular situation dictates.
    (b) No refund for the return of plans and specifications will be 
made except when the invitation is canceled. Under such circumstances, 
refund of payments will be made upon return of the plans and 
specifications in good condition to the issuing office.
    (c) Plans and specifications will be issued without charge to such 
organizations as The Associated General Contractors of America, American 
Road Builders' Association, Dodge Reports, Blue Reports, Brown's 
Letters, Inc., builders and contractors exchanges in the locality in

in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the General Accounting 
Office in sections 3020-10 and 3030 of Title 7 of GAO Manual for 
Guidance of Federal Agencies.
    (e) If the contracting officer desires to have the architect-
engineer or construction manager handle the furnishing of plans and 
specifications and payments therefor, the invitations for bids should so 
state, and the architect-engineer or construction management contract 
shall provide the manner in which the receipts are to be handled, 
generally as a credit to the contract.
    (f) No charge will be made to original receivers of plans and 
specifications for revised sheets of drawings and revised pages of 
specifications which are issued by amendments to invitations.
    (g) Plans and specifications may be issued in complete sets only, or

shall not be used to acquire information technology unrelated to the 
mission of the M&O contract either for sole use by DOE employees or 
employees of other DOE contractors, or for use by other Federal agencies 
or their contractors.
    (b) Other than M&O contracts. Where it has been determined that a 
contractor (other than an M&O contractor or its subcontractor) will 
acquire information technology either for sole use by DOE employees or 
for the furnishing of the information technology as government-furnished 
property under another contract, and after receiving written 
authorization from their cognizant DOE contracting office pursuant to 48 
CFR part 51, DOE contractors working under cost-reimbursement-type 
contracts may place orders against authorized contracts. All

Information Management may authorize an M&O contractor to acquire 
information technology for use by the following:
    (1) One or more other contractor(s) performing on-site at the same 
DOE-owned or -leased facility as the M&O contractor, or
    (2) Other M&O contractors.

Representative (COR) for the purpose of performing certain technical 
functions in administering a contract. These functions include, but are 
not limited to, technical monitoring, inspection, approval of shop 
drawings, testing, and approval of samples. The COR acts solely as a 
technical representative of the contracting officer and is not 
authorized to perform any function that results in a change in the 
scope, price, terms or conditions of the contract. COR designations must 
be made in writing by the contracting officer, and shall identify the 
responsibilities and limitations of the designation. A copy of the COR 
designation must be furnished to the contractor and the contract 
administration office.

<R05>
Sec. 942.704  Billing rates.

    (b) When the contracting officer or auditor responsible for 
establishing billing rates, in accordance with FAR 42.704, has not 
established such rates or such rates are not current for the performance 
periods (contractor FY) under contract, the DOE contracting officer 
responsible for administration of the contract shall establish an 
appropriate rate(s) for billing purposes. If the contractor holds more 
than one DOE contract covering that period of performance, the DOE 
office with the largest unliquidated obligations as of the beginning of 
that performance period shall take the lead in establishing the required 
billing rate for use on DOE contracts. Once appropriate billing rates 
are established by the responsible contracting officer designated by FAR 
42.704, such rates shall be adopted by the contracting officer and all 
billings and payments shall be retroactively revised to reflect the 
agreed upon rate(s).


<R05>
Sec. 942.705-1  Contracting officer determination procedure. (DOE 
          coverage--paragraphs (a) and (b))

    (a)(3) The Department of Energy shall use the contracting officer 
determination procedure for all business units for which it shall be 
required to negotiate final indirect cost rates. A list of such business 
units is maintained by the Office of Policy, within the Headquarters 
procurement organization.

[[Page 349]]

    (b)(1) Pursuant to FAR 52.216-7, Allowable Cost and Payment, 
contractors shall be requested to submit their final indirect cost rate 
proposals reflecting actual cost experience during the covered period to 
the cognizant contracting officer responsible for negotiating their 
final rates.
    The DOE negotiating official shall request all needed audit service 
in accordance with internal procedures.

<R05>
Sec. 942.705-4  State and local governments.

    A list of cognizant agencies for State/local government 
organizations is periodically published in the Federal Register by the 
Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The responsible agencies are 
notified of such assignments. The current negotiated rates for State/
local government activities is distributed to each CDO by the Office of 
Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.

agencies for the negotiation and approval of indirect cost rates. The 
Federal agency with the largest dollar value of awards (contracts plus 
federal financial assistance dollars) will be designated as the 
cognizant agency. There is no published list of assigned agencies. The 
Office of Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization, 
distributes to each CDO the rates established by the cognizant agency.

                   Subpart 942.8_Disallowance of Costs


<R05>
Sec. 942.803  Disallowing costs after incurrence.

    (a) Contracting officer receipt of vouchers. Vouchers and invoices 
submitted to DOE shall be submitted to the contracting officer or 
designee for review and approval for payment. If the examination of a 
voucher or invoice raises a question regarding the allowability of a 
cost submitted therein, the contracting officer, shall:
    (1) Hold informal discussion with the contractor as appropriate.
    (2) Issue a notice (letter, memo, etc.) to the contractor advising 
of cost disallowed or to be disallowed and advising the contractor that 
it may:
    (i) Submit a written claim as to why the cost should be reimbursed--
if in disagreement with the disallowance.
    (ii) File a claim under the disputes clause, which will be processed 
in accordance with disputes procedures in the event disagreements cannot 
be settled.
    (3) Process the voucher or invoice for payment and advise the 
finance office to deduct the disallowed cost when scheduling the voucher 
for payment.
    (c) Auditor reports and other sources of questioned costs. (1) From 
time to time reports are received from professional auditors that may 
question the allowability of an incurred cost. Such reports are received 
as the result of auditors, in their independent role under OMB Circular 
A-73 or their own charters, scheduling and conducting financial or 
compliance audits of government contracts or as the result of an 
independent request for auditor service, as discussed in 942.70 Audit 
Services.
    (2) When auditor reports or other notifications question cost or 
consider them unallowable, the contracting officer shall follow up such 
reports and resolve all such cost issues promptly by determining, 
through discussions with the contractor and/or auditor within six months 
of the audit report date, or date of receipt if a non-Federal audit. One 
of the following courses of action shall be pursued:
    (i) Accept and implement audit recommendations as submitted.

[[Page 350]]

    (ii) Accept the principle of the audit recommendation but reject the 
cost questioned amount.
    (iii) Reject audit findings and recommendations.
    (3) When implementing the accepted course of action, the contracting 
officer shall--
    (i) Hold discussions with the auditor and contractor as appropriate.
    (ii) Issue a notice in writing advising the contractor of the 
government's intent to disallow the cost questioned, if the contracting 
officer agrees with the auditor concerning the questioned costs.
    (iii) Negotiate a mutual settlement of questioned costs if they are 
agreed with in principle but there is a difference of opinion as to a 
proper amount.
    (iv) Negotiate a mutual settlement of questioned costs if the 
auditor recommendations are acceptable to the contracting officer but 
the contractor does not accept the finding or disallowance.
    (v) Issue a final decision of the contracting officer disallowing 
the questionable cost where differences cannot be resolved, advising of 
the contractor's right to appeal the decision, and advising the 
procedure to be followed if it is decided to make such an appeal.
    (vi) Initiate immediate recoupment actions for all disallowed cost 
owed the government by:
    (A) Requesting the contractor to provide a credit adjustment 
(offset) against amounts billed the government on the next or future 
invoice(s) if such shall be submitted under a contract for which the 
disallowed cost applies.
    (B) Deducting (offset) the disallowed cost from the next or future 
invoice(s) submitted under the contract; if the contractor provides no 
adjustment under the contract for which the disallowed cost applies; 
provided such reduction is deemed appropriate.
    (C) Advising the contractor that a refund shall be directly payable 
to the government in situations where there are insufficient payments 
owed by the government to effect recovery via (A) or (B) above or an 
offset is otherwise inappropriate.
    (vii) Promptly notify the appropriate finance office of refunds 
directly payable to the government to ensure proper billing and follow-
up action for collection.

<R05>
Sec. 950.7000  Scope of subpart.

    The General Services Administration (GSA) and, in some cases, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) Military Traffic Management Command 
negotiate agreements with commercial organizations to provide certain 
discounts to contractors traveling under Government cost-reimbursable 
contracts. In the case of discount air fares and hotel/motel room rates, 
the GSA has established agreements with certain airlines and thousands 
of hotels/motels to extend discounts which were previously only 
available to Federal employees on official travel status. DOD has 
negotiated agreements with car rental companies for special rates with 
unlimited mileage which were also to be used by only Federal employees 
on official Government business. GSA Federal Property Management 
Regulations (FPMRs) make these three travel discounts available to 
Government cost-reimbursable contractors at the option of the vendor.

extent practicable in accordance with contractual terms and conditions. 
Vendors providing the service may require that Government contractor 
employees furnish a letter of identification signed by the authorizing 
contracting officer. Contracting officers shall provide CRCs with a 
``Standard Letter of Identification'' when appropriate to do so. An

Sec. 950.7010  Financial protection requirements.

    DOE contractors with whom statutory nuclear hazards indemnity 
agreements under the authority of section 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended, are executed will not normally be required or 
permitted to furnish financial protection by purchase of insurance to 
cover public liability

[[Page 358]]

for nuclear incidents. However, if authorized by the DOE Headquarters 
office having responsibility for contractor casualty insurance programs, 
DOE contractors may be (a) permitted to furnish financial protection to 
themselves or (b) permitted to continue to carry such insurance at cost 
to the Government if they currently maintain insurance for such 
liability.

[56 FR 57828, Nov. 14, 1991]

           Subpart 950.71_General Contract Authority Indemnity


<R05>
Sec. 950.7101  Applicability.

    (a) The DOE also has general contract authority to enter into 
indemnity agreements with its contractors. Under such authority a 
certain measure of protection is extended to the DOE contractor against 
risk of liability, but the assumption of liability by DOE will be 
expressly subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Prior to 
enactment of section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act 1954, as amended, this 
authority was exercised in a number of Atomic Energy Commission 
contracts and this type of indemnification remains in some DOE 
contracts.
    (b) It is the policy of the DOE, subsequent to the enactment of 
section 170, to restrict indemnity agreements with DOE contractors, with 
respect to protection against public liability for a nuclear incident, 
to the statutory indemnity provided under section 170. However, it is 
recognized that circumstances may exist under which a DOE contractor may 
be exposed to a risk of public liability for a nuclear occurrence which 
would not be covered by the statutory indemnity.
    (c) While it is normally DOE policy to require its non-management 
and operating contractors to obtain insurance coverage against public 
liability for nonnuclear risks, there may be circumstances in which a 
contractual indemnity may be warranted to protect a DOE non-management 
and operating contractor against liability for uninsured nonnuclear 
risks.
    (d) If circumstances as mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section do arise, it shall be the responsibility of the Heads of 
Contracting Activities to submit to the Head of the Agency or designee 
for review and decision, all pertinent information concerning the need 
for, or desirability of, providing a general authority indemnity to a 
DOE contractor.
    (e) Where the indemnified risk is nonnuclear, the amount of general 
authority indemnity extended to a fixed-price contractor should normally 
have a maximum obligation equivalent to the amount of insurance that the 
contractor usually carries to cover such risks in its other commercial 
operations or, if the risk involved is dissimilar to those normally 
encountered by the contractor, the amount that it otherwise would have 
reasonably procured to insure this contract risk.
    (f) In the event that a DOE contractor has been extended both a 
statutory indemnity and a general authority indemnity, the general 
authority indemnity will not apply to the extent that the statutory 
indemnity applies.
    (g) The provisions of this subsection do not restrict or affect the 
policy of DOE to pay its cost-reimbursement type contractors for the 
allowable cost of losses and expenses incurred in the performance of the 
contact work, within the maximum amount of the contract obligation.

        Subpart 951.1_Contractor Use of Government Supply Sources


<R05>
Sec. 951.101  Policy.

    (a) It is DOE policy that contractors performing under cost-
reimbursement contracts should meet their requirements from Government 
sources of supply when these sources are available to them, and if it is 
economically advantageous or otherwise in the best interest of the 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 951.102  Authorization to use Government supply sources.

    (a) The Head of the Contracting Activity may authorize contractors 
performing under cost-reimbursement contracts and subcontractors 
performing under cost-reimbursement subcontracts, where all higher tier 
contracts and subcontracts are cost-type, to use Government supply 
sources in accordance with the requirements and procedures in FAR Part 
51, DOE PMR 41 CFR 109-26, and any necessary approval from the agency 
involved. This authority may be redelegated to the level of contracting 
officer. Direct acquisition by the DOE, rather than by a contractor 
under cost-reimbursement contracts, shall be required where deemed 
necessary by the Head of the Contracting Activity in order to carry out 
special requirements of appropriation acts or other applicable laws 
relating to particular items.
    (c)(1) The DOE central point of contact for the assignment, 
correction, or deletion of FEDSTRIP activity address codes is the Office 
of Property Management, within the Headquarters procurement 
organization.
    (e)(4)(iii) Materials, supplies, and equipment acquired from 
Government sources of supply under the procedures described herein must 
be used exclusively in connection with Government work, except as 
otherwise authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity.

[49 FR 12042, Mar. 28, 1984; 49 FR 38951, Oct. 2, 1984, as amended at 59 
FR 9108, Feb. 25, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 951.103  Ordering from Government supply sources.

    (b) The Procurement Executive shall be informed of instances in 
which GSA sources of supply are not used because of the quality of the 
items available from GSA or when a Federal Supply Schedule contractor 
refuses to honor an order.

           Subpart 951.70_Contractor Employee Travel Discounts


<R05>
Sec. 951.7002  Responsibilities.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 952.251-70, 
Contractor employee travel discounts, in all cost-reimbursable 
solicitations and contracts when significant costs for rail travel, car 
rental, or lodging will be required to perform the contract. The 
contracting officer may furnish the contractor with appropriate 
identification letters.

information.

                           Security (SEP 1997)

    (a) Responsibility. It is the contractor's duty to safeguard all 
classified information, special nuclear material, and other DOE 
property. The contractor shall, in accordance with DOE security 
regulations and requirements, be responsible for safeguarding all 
classified information and protecting against sabotage, espionage, loss 
or theft of the classified documents and material in the contractor's 
posession in connection with the performance of work under this 
contract. Except as otherwise provided in this contract, the contractor 
shall, upon completion or termination of this contract, transmit to DOE 
any classified matter in the posession of the contractor or any person 
under the contractor's control in connection with performance of this 
contract. If retention by the contractor of any classified matter is 
required after the completion or termination of the contract, the 
contractor shall identify the items and types or categories of matter 
proposed for retention, the reasons for the

[[Page 362]]

retention of the matter, and the proposed period of retention. If the 
retention is approved by the contracting officer, the security 
provisions of the contract shall continue to be applicable to the matter 
retained. Special nuclear material shall not be retained after the 
completion or termination of the contract.
    (b) Regulations. The contractor agrees to comply with all security 
regulations and requirements of DOE in effect on the date of award.
    (c) Definition of classified information. The term classified 
information means Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, or National 
Security Information.
    (d) Definition of restricted data. The term Restricted Data means 
all data concerning (1) design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic

include data declassified or removed from the Restricted Data category 
pursuant to Section 142 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (e) Definition of formerly restricted data. The term Formerly 
Restricted Data means all data removed from the Restricted Data category 
under section 142 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (f) Definition of National Security Information. The term National 
Security Information means any information or material, regardless of 
its physical form or characteristics, that is owned by, produced for or 
by, or is under the control of the United States Government, that has 
been determined pursuant to Executive Order 12356 or prior Orders to 
require protection against unauthorized disclosure, and which is so 
designated.
    (g) Definition of Special Nuclear Material (SNM). SNM means: (1) 
plutonium, uranium enriched in the isotope 233 or in the isotope 235, 
and any other material which pursuant to the provisions of Section 51 of 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, has been determined to be 
special nuclear material, but does not include source material; or (2) 
any material artificially enriched by any of the foregoing, but does not 
include source material.
    (h) Security clearance of personnel. The contractor shall not permit 
any individual to have access to any classified information, except in 
accordance with the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, Executive 
Order 12356, and the DOE's regulations or requirements applicable to the 
particular level and category of classified information to which access 
is required.
    (i) Criminal liability. It is understood that disclosure of any 
classified information relating to the work or services ordered 
hereunder to any person not entitled to receive it, or failure to 
safeguard any classified information that may come to the contractor or 
any person under the contractor's control in connection with work under 
this contract, may subject the contractor, its agents, employees, or 
subcontractors to criminal liability under the laws of the United 
States. (See the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 2011 
et seq.; 18 U.S.C. 793 and 794; and E.O. 12356.)
    (j) Subcontracts and purchase orders. Except as otherwise authorized 
in writing by the contracting officer, the contractor shall insert 
provisions similar to the foregoing in all subcontracts and purchase 
orders under this contract.

<R05>
Sec. 952.204-70  Classification/Declassification.

    As prescribed in 904.404(d)(2), the following clause shall be 
included in all contracts which involve classified information.

               Classification/Declassification (SEP 1997)

    In the performance of work under this contract, the contractor or 
subcontractor shall comply with all provisions of the Department of 
Energy's regulations and mandatory DOE directives which apply to work 
involving the classification and declassification of information, 
documents, or material. In this section, ``information'' means facts, 
data, or knowledge itself; ``document'' means the physical medium on or 
in which information is recorded; and ``material'' means a product or 
substance which contains or reveals information, regardless of its 
physical form or characteristics. Classified information is ``Restricted 
Data'' and ``Formerly Restricted Data'' (classified under the Atomic 
Energy Act of 1954, as amended) and ``National Security Information'' 
(classified under Executive Order 12958 or prior Executive Orders).
    The original decision to classify or declassify information is 
considered an inherently Governmental function. For this reason, only 
Government personnel may serve as original classifiers, i.e., Federal 
Government Original Classifiers. Other personnel (Government or 
contractor) may serve as derivative classifiers which involves making 
classification decisions based upon classification guidance which 
reflect decisions made by Federal Government Original Classifiers.
    The contractor or subcontractor shall ensure that any document or 
material that may contain classified information is reviewed by either a 
Federal Government or a Contractor Derivative Classifier in accordance 
with classification regulations including mandatory DOE directives and 
classification/declassification guidance furnished to

[[Page 363]]

the contractor by the Department of Energy to determine whether it 
contains classified information prior to dissemination. For information 
which is not addressed in classification/declassification guidance, but 
whose sensitivity appears to warrant classification, the contractor or 
subcontractor shall ensure that such information is reviewed by a 
Federal Government Original Classifier.
    In addition, the contractor or subcontractor shall ensure that 
existing classified documents (containing either Restricted Data or 
Formerly Restricted Data or National Security Information) which are in 
its possession or under its control are periodically reviewed by a 
Federal Government or Contractor Derivative Declassifier in accordance 
with classification regulations, mandatory DOE directives and 
classification/declassification guidance furnished to the contractor by 
the Department of Energy to determine if the documents are no longer 
appropriately classified. Priorities for declassification review of 
classified documents shall be based on the degree of public and 
researcher interest and the likelihood of declassification upon review. 
Documents which no longer contain classified information are to be 
declassified. Declassified documents then shall be reviewed to determine 
if they are publicly releasable. Documents which are declassified and 
determined to be publicly releasable are to be made available to the 
public in order to maximize the public's access to as much Government 
information as possible while minimizing security costs.
    The contractor or subcontractor shall insert this clause in any 
subcontract which involves or may involve access to classified 
information.

<R05>
Sec. 952.204-71  Sensitive foreign nations controls.

    In accordance with 904.404(d)(3), the contracting officer shall 
include the following clause.

              Sensitive Foreign Nations Controls (APR 1994)

    (a) In connection with any activities in the performance of this 
contract, the contractor agrees to comply with the ``Sensitive Foreign 
Nations Controls'' requirements attached to this contract, relating to 
those countries, which may from time to time, be identified to the 
contractor by written notice as sensitive foreign nations. The 
contractor shall have the right to terminate its performance under this 
contract upon at least 60 days' prior written notice to the contracting 
officer if the contractor determines that it is unable, without 
substantially interfering with its polices or without adversely 
impacting its performance to continue performance of the work under this 
contract as a result of such notification. If the contractor elects to 
terminate performance, the provisions of this contract regarding 
termination for the convenience of the Government shall apply.
    (b) The provisions of this clause shall be included in any 
subcontracts.

<R05>
Sec. 952.204-72  Disclosure of information.

    As prescribed in 904.404(d)(4) this clause may be used in place of 
the clauses entitled ``Security,'' 952.204-2, and ``Classification,'' 
952.204-70, in contracts with educational institutions for research 
involving nuclear technology which could but is not expected to produce 
classified information or restricted data.

                  Disclosure of Information (APR 1994)

    (a) It is mutually expected that the activities under this contract 
will not involve classified information. It is understood, however, that 
if in the opinion of either party, this expectation changes prior to the 
expiration or terminating of all activities under this contract, said 
party shall notify the other party accordingly in writing without delay. 
In any event, the contractor shall classify, safeguard, and otherwise 
act with respect to all classified information in accordance with 
applicable law and the requirements of DOE, and shall promptly inform 
DOE in writing if and when classified information becomes involved, or 
in the mutual judgment of the parties it appears likely that classified 
information or material may become involved. The contractor shall have 
the right to terminate performance of the work under this contract and 
in such event the provisions of this contract respecting termination for 
the convenience of the Government shall apply.
    (b) The contractor shall not permit any individual to have access to 
classified information except in accordance with the Atomic Energy Act 
1954, as amended, Executive Order 12356, and DOE's regulations or

    (d) Prior to award of a contract under this solicitation, the DOE

an undue risk to the common defense and security as a result of its 
access to classified information or a significant quantity of special 
nuclear material in the performance of the contract. In making the 
determination, the contracting officer may consider a voting trust or 
other arrangements proposed by the offeror to mitigate or avoid FOCI. 
The contracting officer may require the offeror to submit such 
additional information as deemed pertinent to this determination.
    (e) The offeror shall require any subcontractors having access to 
classified information or a significant quantity of special nuclear 
material to provide responses to the questions in paragraph (c) of this 
provision directly to the DOE contracting officer.
    (f) Information submitted by the offeror in response to the 
questions in (c) above is to be used solely for purposes of evaluating 
foreign ownership, control, or influence and shall be treated by DOE, to

Sec. 952.204-74  Foreign ownership, control, or influence over 
          contractor.

    As prescribed in 904.7005(b), insert the following contract clause 
in new contracts and contract modifications to existing contracts 
subject to 904.70.

   Foreign Ownership, Control, or Influence Over Contractor (APR 1984)

    (a) For purposes of this clause, a foreign interest is defined as 
any of the following:
    (1) A foreign government or foreign government agency;
    (2) Any form of business enterprise organized under the laws of any 
country other than the United States or its possessions;
    (3) Any form of business enterprise organized or incorporated under 
the laws of the U.S., or a State or other jurisdiction within the U.S., 
which is owned, controlled, or influenced by a foreign government, 
agency, firm, corporation or person; or
    (4) Any person who is not a U.S. citizen.
    (b) Foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI) means the 
situation where the degree of ownership, control, or influence over a 
contractor by a foreign interest is such that a reasonable basis exists 
for concluding that compromise of classified information, special 
nuclear material as defined in 10 CFR part 710, may result.
    (c) For purposes of this clause, subcontractor means any 
subcontractor at any tier and the term contracting officer shall mean 
DOE contracting officer. When this clause is

[[Page 366]]

included in a subcontract, the term contractor shall mean subcontractor 
and the term contract shall mean subcontract.
    (d) The contractor shall immediately provide the contracting officer 
written notice of any changes in the extent and nature of FOCI over the 
contractor which would affect the answers to the questions presented in 
DEAR 952.204-73. Further, notice of changes in ownership or control 
which are required to be reported to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, or the Department of Justice 
shall also be furnished concurrently to the contracting officer.
    (e) In those cases where a contractor has changes involving FOCI, 
the DOE must determine whether the changes will pose an undue risk to 
the common defense and security. In making this determination, the 
contracting officer shall consider proposals made by the contractor to 
avoid or mitigate foreign influences.
    (f) If the contracting officer at any time determines that the 
contractor is, or is potentially, subject to FOCI, the contractor shall 
comply with such instructions as the contracting officer shall provide 
in writing to safeguard any classified information or significant 
quantity of special nuclear material.
    (g) The contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially 
to the language of this clause including this paragraph (g) in all 
subcontracts under this contract that will require access to classified 
information or a significant quantity of special nuclear material. 
Additionally, the contractor shall require such subcontractors to submit 
a completed certification required in DEAR 952.204-73 prior to award of 
a subcontract. Information to be provided by a subcontractor pursuant to 
this clause may be submitted directly to the contracting officer.
    (h) Information submitted by the contractor or any affected 
subcontractor as required pursuant to this clause shall be treated by 
DOE to the extent permitted by law, as business or financial information 
submitted in confidence to be used solely for purposes of evaluating 
FOCI.
    (i) The requirements of this clause are in addition to the 
requirement that a contractor obtain and retain the security clearances 
required by the contract. This clause shall not operate as a limitation 
on DOE's rights, including its rights to terminate this contract.
    (j) The contracting officer may terminate this contract for default 
either if the contractor fails to meet obligations imposed by this 
clause, e.g., provide the information required by this clause, comply 
with the contracting officer's instructions about safeguarding 
classified information, or make this clause applicable to 
subcontractors, or if, in the contracting officer's judgment, the 
contractor creates an FOCI situation in order to avoid performance or a 
termination for default. The contracting officer may terminate this 
contract for convenience if the contractor becomes subject to FOCI and 
for reasons other than avoidance of performance of the contract, cannot, 
or chooses not to, avoid or mitigate the FOCI problem.

advance clearances on oral, written, and audio/visual informational

    The contractor shall not engage in, nor subcontract for, any 
printing (as that term is defined in Title I of the U.S. Government 
Printing and Binding Regulations in effect on the effective date of this 
contract) in connection with the performance of work under this 
contract. Provided, however, that performance of a requirement under 
this contract involving the duplication of less than 5,000 copies of a 
single unit, or no more than 25,000 units in the aggregate of multiple 
units, will not be deemed to be printing. A unit is defined as one 
sheet, size 8\1/2\ by 11 inches one side only, one color. A requirement 
is defined as a single publication document.
    (1) The term printing includes the following processes: composition, 
plate making, presswork, binding, microform publishing, or the end items 
produced by such processes.
    (2) If fulfillment of the contract will necessitate reproduction in 
excess of the limits set forth above, the contractor shall notify the 
contracting officer in writing and obtain the contracting officer's 
approval prior to acquiring on DOE's behalf production, acquisition, and 
dissemination of printed matter. Such printing must be obtained from the 
Government Printing Office (GPO), a contract source designated by GPO or 
a Joint Committee on Printing authorized federal printing plant.
    (3) Printing services not obtained in compliance with this guidance 
will result in the cost of such printing being disallowed.

provision:

Organizational Conflicts of Interest Disclosure-Advisory and Assistance 
                           Services (JUN 1997)

    (a) Organizational conflict of interest means that because of other 
activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or 
potentially unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the 
Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract work 
is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive 
advantage.
    (b) An offeror notified that it is the apparent successful offeror 
shall provide the statement described in paragraph (c) of this 
provision. For purposes of this provision, ``apparent successful 
offeror'' means the proposer selected for final negotiations or, where 
individual contracts are negotiated with all firms in the competitive 
range, it means all such firms.
    (c) The statement must contain the following:
    (1) A statement of any past (within the past twelve months), 
present, or currently planned financial, contractual, organizational, or 
other interests relating to the performance of the statement of work. 
For contractual interests, such statement must include the name, 
address, telephone number of the client or client(s), a description of 
the services rendered to the previous client(s), and the name of a 
responsible officer or employee of the offeror who is knowledgeable

[[Page 368]]

about the services rendered to each client, if, in the 12 months 
preceding the date of the statement, services were rendered to the 
Government or any other client (including a foreign government or 
person) respecting the same subject matter of the instant solicitation, 
or directly relating to such subject matter. The agency and contract 
number under which the services were rendered must also be included, if 
applicable. For financial interests, the statement must include the 
nature and extent of the interest and any entity or entities involved in 
the financial relationship. For these and any other interests enough 
such information must be provided to allow a meaningful evaluation of 
the potential effect of the interest on the performance of the statement 
of work.
    (2) A statement that no actual or potential conflict of interest or 
unfair competitive advantage exists with respect to the advisory and 
assistance services to be provided in connection with the instant 
contract or that any actual or potential conflict of interest or unfair 
competitive advantage that does or may exist with respect to the 
contract in question has been communicated as part of the statement 
required by (b) of this provision.
    (d) Failure of the offeror to provide the required statement may 
result in the offeror being determined ineligible for award. 
Misrepresentation or failure to report any fact may result in the 
assessment of penalties associated with false statements or such other 
provisions provided for by law or regulation.

Sec. 952.209-72   Organizational conflicts of interest.

    As prescribed at 48 CFR 909.507-2, insert the following clause:

             Organizational Conflicts of Interest (JUN 1997)

    (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the 
contractor (1) is not biased because of its financial, contractual, 
organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this 
contract, and (2) does not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over 
other parties by virtue of its performance of this contract.
    (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to 
performance or participation by the contractor and any of its affiliates 
or their successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as 
``contractor'') in the activities covered by this clause as a prime 
contractor, subcontractor, cosponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in 
any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs 
when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control 
another or when a third party has the power to control both.
    (1) Use of Contractor's Work Product. (i) The contractor shall be 
ineligible to participate in any capacity in Department contracts, 
subcontracts, or proposals therefor (solicited and unsolicited) which 
stem directly from the contractor's performance of work under this 
contract for a period of (Contracting Officer see DEAR 9.507-2 and enter 
specific term) years after the completion of this contract. Furthermore, 
unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, the Contractor 
shall not perform any advisory and assistance services work under this 
contract on any of its products or services or the products or services 
of another firm if the contractor is or has been substantially involved 
in their development or marketing. Nothing in this subparagraph shall 
preclude the contractor from competing for follow-on contracts for 
advisory and assistance services.
    (ii) If, under this contract, the contractor prepares a complete or 
essentially complete statement of work or specifications to be used in 
competitive acquisitions, the contractor shall be ineligible to perform 
or participate in any capacity in any contractual effort which is based 
on such statement of work or specifications. The contractor shall not 
incorporate its products or services in such statement of work or 
specifications unless so directed in writing by the contracting officer, 
in which case the restriction in this subparagraph shall not apply.
    (iii) Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the contractor from 
offering or selling its standard and commercial items to the Government.
    (2) Access to and use of information. (i) If the contractor, in the 
performance of this contract, obtains access to information, such as 
Department plans, policies, reports, studies, financial plans, internal 
data protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or data which 
has not been released or otherwise made available to the public, the 
contractor agrees that without prior written approval of the contracting 
officer it shall not:
    (A) use such information for any private purpose unless the 
information has been released or otherwise made available to the public;
    (B) compete for work for the Department based on such information 
for a period of six (6) months after either the completion of this 
contract or until such information is released or otherwise made 
available to the public, whichever is first;
    (C) submit an unsolicited proposal to the Government which is based 
on such information until one year after such information is

[[Page 369]]

released or otherwise made available to the public; and
    (D) release such information unless such information has previously 
been released or otherwise made available to the public by the 
Department.
    (ii) In addition, the contractor agrees that to the extent it 
receives or is given access to proprietary data, data protected by the 
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or other confidential or privileged 
technical, business, or financial information under this contract, it 
shall treat such information in accordance with any restrictions imposed 
on such information.
    (iii) The contractor may use technical data it first produces under 
this contract for its private purposes consistent with paragraphs 
(b)(2)(i) (A) and (D) of this clause and the patent, rights in data, and 
security provisions of this contract.
    (c) Disclosure after award. (1) The contractor agrees that, if 
changes, including additions, to the facts disclosed by it prior to 
award of this contract, occur during the performance of this contract, 
it shall make an immediate and full disclosure of such changes in 
writing to the contracting officer. Such disclosure may include a 
description of any action which the contractor has taken or proposes to 
take to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of 
interest. The Department may, however, terminate the contract for 
convenience if it deems such termination to be in the best interest of 
the Government.
    (2) In the event that the contractor was aware of facts required to 
be disclosed or the existence of an actual or potential organizational 
conflict of interest and did not disclose such facts or such conflict of 
interest to the contracting officer, DOE may terminate this contract for 
default.
    (d) Remedies. For breach of any of the above restrictions or for 
nondisclosure or misrepresentation of any facts required to be disclosed 
concerning this contract, including the existence of an actual or 
potential organizational conflict of interest at the time of or after 
award, the Government may terminate the contract for default, disqualify 
the contractor from subsequent related contractual efforts, and pursue 
such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
    (e) Waiver. Requests for waiver under this clause shall be directed 
in writing to the contracting officer and shall include a full 
description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. 
If it is determined to be in the best interests of the Government, the 
contracting officer may grant such a waiver in writing.

                             (End of clause)

    ALTERNATE I: In accordance with 909.507-2 and 970.0905, include the 
following alternate in the specified types of contracts.
    (f) Subcontracts. (1) The contractor shall include a clause, 
substantially similar to this clause, including this paragraph (f), in 
subcontracts expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold 
determined in accordance with FAR part 13 and involving the performance 
of advisory and assistance services as that term is defined at FAR 
37.201. The terms ``contract,'' ``contractor,'' and ``contracting 
officer'' shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's 
rights.
    (2) Prior to the award under this contract of any such subcontracts 
for advisory and assistance services, the contractor shall obtain from 
the proposed subcontractor or consultant the disclosure required by DEAR 
909.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests 
disclosed present an actual or significant potential for an 
organizational conflict of interest. Where an actual or significant 
potential organizational conflict of interest is identified, the 
contractor shall take actions to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate the 
organizational conflict to the satisfaction of the contractor. If the 
conflict cannot be avoided or neutralized, the contractor must obtain 
the approval of the DOE contracting officer prior to entering into the 
subcontract.

requirement to collect or record information calling either for answer 
to identical questions from 10 or more persons other than Federal 
employees, or information from Federal employees which is to be used for 
statistical compilations of general public interest, the Paperwork 
Reduction Act will apply to this contract. No plan, questionnaire,

solicitations and contracts.

         Subcontracting for Nuclear Hot Cell Services (MAR 1993)

    (a) Definitions.
    Costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities, as used 
in this clause, means any cost associated with the compliance with 
regulatory requirements governing the decommissioning of nuclear 
facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Such costs for 
foreign facilities and for Department of Energy facilities are costs of 
decommissioning associated with the compliance with foreign regulatory 
requirements or the Department's own requirements.
    Costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear waste, as used 
in this clause, means any costs, whether required by regulation or 
incurred as a matter of prudent business practice, associated with the 
storage or disposal of nuclear waste.
    Foreign company, as used in this clause, means a company which 
offers to perform nuclear hot cell services at a facility which is not 
subject to the laws and regulations of the United States, its agencies, 
and its political subdivisions.
    Nuclear hot cell services, as used in this clause, means services 
related to the examination of, or performance of various operations on, 
nuclear fuel rods, control assemblies, or other components that are 
emitting large quantities of ionizing radiation, after discharge from 
nuclear reactors, which are performed in specialized facilities located 
away from commercial nuclear power plants, generally referred to in the 
industry as ``hot cells.''
    Nuclear waste, as used in this clause, means any radioactive waste 
material subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or 
the Department of Energy, or in the case of foreign offers, by 
comparable foreign organizations.
    United States company, as used in this clause, means a company which 
offers to perform nuclear hot cell services at a facility subject to the 
laws and regulations of the United States, its agencies, and its 
political subdivisions.
    (b) In selecting a competitive offer for a first-tier subcontract 
acquisition of nuclear hot cell services, the contractor shall (1) 
consider neither costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear waste 
facilities nor costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear 
waste, or (2) add these costs to offers of foreign companies, if--
    (i) one or more of the offers is submitted by a United States 
company and includes costs related to the decommissioning of nuclear 
facilities and costs related to the storage and disposal of nuclear 
waste because it is subject to such cost; and
    (ii) one or more of the offers is submitted by a foreign company and 
does not include these types of costs. (A foreign company might not be 
subject to such costs or might not have to include these types of cost 
in its offer if the firm is subsidized in decommissioning activity or 
storage and disposal of nuclear waste, or a foreign government is 
performing the activities below the actual cost of the activity.)
    (c) Upon determining that no offer from a foreign firm has a 
reasonable chance of being selected for award, the requirements of this 
clause will not apply.

Sec. 952.227-9  Refund of royalties.

    As prescribed in 927.206-2, insert the following clause:

                     Refund of Royalties (MAR 1995)

    (a) The contract price includes certain amounts for royalties 
payable by the Contractor or subcontractors or both, which amounts have 
been reported to the Contracting Officer.
    (b) The term royalties as used in this clause refers to any costs or 
charges in the nature of royalties, license fees, patent or license 
amortization costs, or the like, for the use of or for rights in patents 
and patent applications in connection with performing this contract or 
any subcontract here-under. The term also includes any costs or charges 
associated with the access to, use of, or other right pertaining to data 
that is represented

[[Page 376]]

to be proprietary and is related to the performance of this contract or 
the copying of such data or data that is copyrighted.
    (c) The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Officer, before 
final payment under this contract, a statement of royalties paid or 
required to be paid in connection with performing this contract and 
subcontracts hereunder together with the reasons.
    (d) The Contractor will be compensated for royalties reported under 
paragraph (c) of this clause, only to the extent that such royalties 
were included in the contract price and are determined by the 
Contracting Officer to be properly chargeable to the Government and 
allocable to the contract. To the extent that any royalties that are 
included in the contract price are not, in fact, paid by the Contractor 
or are determined by the Contracting Officer not to be properly 
chargeable to the government and allocable to the contract, the contract 
price shall be reduced. Repayment or credit to the Government shall be 
made as the Contracting Officer directs. The approval by DOE of any 
individual payments or royalties shall not prevent the Government from 
contesting at any time the enforceability, validity, scope of, or title 
to, any patent or the proprietary nature of data pursuant to which a 
royalty or other payment is to be or has been made.
    (e) If, at any time within 3 years after final payment under this

reimburse the Government in a corresponding amount.
    (f) The substance of this clause, including this paragraph (f), 
shall be included in any subcontract in which the amount of royalties 
reported during negotiation of the subcontract exceeds $250.

Sec. 952.227-11  Patent rights--retention by the contractor (short 
          form).

    As prescribed in 927.303(a), insert the following clause:

   Patent Rights--Retention by the Contractor (Short Form) (MAR 1995)

    (a) Definitions.
    (1) Invention means any invention or discovery which is or may be 
patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the United States 
Code, or any novel variety of plant which is or may be protected under 
the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et seq.).
    (2) Made when used in relation to any invention means the conception 
of first actual reduction to practice of such invention.
    (3) Nonprofit organization means a university or other institution 
of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and 
exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code 
(26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any nonprofit scientific or educational 
organization qualified under a state nonprofit organization statute.
    (4) Practical application means to manufacture, in the case of a 
composition or product; to practice, in the case of a process or method; 
or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, 
under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being 
utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or 
Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.
    (5) Small business firm means a small business concern as defined at 
section 2 of Public Law 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and implementing 
regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. 
For the purpose of this clause, the size standards for small business 
concerns involved in Government procurement and subcontracting at 13 CFR 
121.3-8 and 13 CFR 121.3-12, respectively, will be used.
    (6) Subject invention means any invention of the contractor 
conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of 
work under this contract, provided that in the case of a variety of 
plant, the date of determination (as defined in section 41(d) of the 
Plant Variety Protection Act, 7 U.S.C. 2401(d)) must also occur during 
the period of contract performance.
    (7) Agency licensing regulations and agency regulations concerning 
the licensing of Government-owned inventions mean the Department of 
Energy patent licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781.
    (b) Allocation of principal rights. The Contractor may retain the 
entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject 
invention subject to the provisions of this clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. 
With respect to any subject invention in which the Contractor retains 
title, the Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have 
practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention 
throughout the world.
    (c) Invention disclosure, election of title, and filing of patent 
application by Contractor. (1) The Contractor will disclose each subject 
invention to the Department of Energy (DOE) within 2 months after the 
inventor discloses

[[Page 377]]

it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters. 
The disclosure to DOE shall be in the form of a written report and shall 
identify the contract under which the invention was made and the 
inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to 
convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the 
disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, 
chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The 
disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of 
the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been 
submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for 
publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to 
the DOE, the Contractor will promptly notify that agency of the 
acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or 
of any on sale or public use planned by the Contractor.
    (2) The Contractor will elect in writing whether or not to retain 
title to any such invention by notifying DOE within 2 years of 
disclosure to DOE. However, in any case where publication, on sale or 
public use has initiated the l-year statutory period wherein valid 
patent protection can still be obtained in the United States, the period 
for election of title may be shortened by DOE to a date that is no more 
than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.
    (3) The Contractor will file its initial patent application on a 
subject invention to which it elects to retain title within 1 year after 
election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory 
period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United 
States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will 
file patent applications in additional countries or international patent 
offices within either 10 months of the corresponding initial patent 
application or 6 months from the date permission is granted by the 
Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent 
applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
    (4) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure, election, and 
filing under subparagraphs (c)(l), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at 
the discretion of the agency, be granted.
    (d) Conditions when the Government may obtain title. The Contractor 
will convey to the Federal agency, upon written request, title to any 
subject invention--
    (1) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect title to the 
subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this 
clause, or elects not to retain title; provided, that DOE may only 
request title within 60 days after learning of the failure of the 
Contractor to disclose or elect within the specified times.
    (2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent 
applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause; 
provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a patent application 
in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, 
but prior to its receipt of the written request of the Federal agency, 
the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that country.
    (3) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue 
the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, 
or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a 
subject invention.
    (e) Minimum rights to Contractor and protection of the Contractor 
right to file. (1) The Contractor will retain a nonexclusive royalty-
free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the 
Government obtains title, except if the Contractor fails to disclose the 
invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. 
The Contractor's license extends to its domestic subsidiary and 
affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the 
Contractor is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the 
same scope to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so 
at the time the contract was awarded. The license is transferable only 
with the approval of the Federal agency, except when transferred to the 
successor of that part of the Contractor's business to which the 
invention pertains.
    (2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by 
DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application 
of subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license 
submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 
and agency licensing regulations. This license will not be revoked in 
that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has 
achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the 
invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any 
foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of DOE to 
the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries 
or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that 
foreign country.
    (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will 
furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or 
modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such 
other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the 
Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be 
revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in 
accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and agency

[[Page 378]]

regulations concerning the licensing of Government owned inventions, any 
decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.
    (f) Contractor action to protect the Government's interest. (1) The 
Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to 
DOE all instruments necessary to (i) establish or confirm the rights the 
Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to which 
the Contractor elects to retain title, and (ii) convey title to DOE when 
requested under paragraph (d) of this clause and to enable the 
government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that 
subject invention.
    (2) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its 
employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose 
promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the 
administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the 
Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the 
Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of 
this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent 
applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's 
rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, 
as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this 
clause. The Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee 
agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of 
reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent 
applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
    (3) The Contractor will notify DOE of any decision not to continue 
the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend 
in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, 
not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period 
required by the relevant patent office.
    (4) The Contractor agrees to include, within the specification of 
any United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon 
covering a subject invention, the following statement, ``This invention 
was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded 
by the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain 
rights in the invention.''
    (g) Subcontracts. (1) The Contractor will include this clause, 
suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, 
regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work to 
be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit 
organization. The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the 
Contractor in this clause, and the Contractor will not, as part of the 
consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the 
subcontractor's subject inventions.
    (2) The contractor shall include in all other subcontracts, 
regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, demonstration, or 
research work the patent rights clause at 952.227-13.
    (3) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, DOE, subcontractor, 
and the Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties 
created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor 
and DOE with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, 
however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any 
jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with 
proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.
    (h) Reporting on utilization of subject inventions. The Contractor 
agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than 
annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at 
obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or its 
licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding 
the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross 
royalties received, by the Contractor, and such other data and 
information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to 
provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with 
any march-in proceeding undertaken by that agency in accordance with 
paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE 
agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the 
Government without permission of the Contractor.
    (i) Preference for United States industry. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any 
assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any 
subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that 
any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use 
of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the 
United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an 
agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its 
assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to 
grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be 
likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under 
the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
    (j) March-in rights. The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any 
subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right in 
accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental 
regulations of the agency to require the Contractor, an assignee or 
exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, 
partially

[[Page 379]]

exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible 
applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the 
circumstances, and, if the Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee 
refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself 
if DOE determines that--
    (1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has 
not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, 
effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject 
invention in such field of use;
    (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs 
which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their 
licensees;
    (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use 
specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not 
reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
    (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by 
paragraph (i) of this clause has not been obtained or waived or because 
a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention 
in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
    (k) Special provisions for contracts with nonprofit organizations. 
If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that--
    (1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be 
assigned without the approval of the Federal agency, except where such 
assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary 
functions the management of inventions; provided, that such assignee 
will be subject to the same provisions as the Contractor;
    (2) The Contractor will share royalties collected on a subject 
invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors 
(when DOE deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned 
in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;
    (3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Contractor 
with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including 
payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject 
inventions will be utilized for the support of scientific research or 
education; and
    (4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances 
to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business 
firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when 
licensing a subject invention if the Contractor determines that the 
small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention 
which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to 
practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are 
not small business firms; provided, that the Contractor is also 
satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources 
to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a 
preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the 
contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that the Secretary of 
Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions 
regarding small business applicants, and the Contractor will negotiate 
changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the 
Secretary of Commerce when that Secretary's review discloses that the 
Contractor could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the 
requirements of this subparagraph (k)(4).
    (l) Communications. (1) The contractor shall direct any 
notification, disclosure, or request to DOE provided for in this clause 
to the DOE patent counsel assisting the DOE contracting activity, with a 
copy of the communication to the Contracting Officer.
    (2) Each exercise of discretion or decision provided for in this 
clause, except subparagraph (k)(4), is reserved for the DOE Patent 
Counsel and is not a claim or dispute and is not subject to the Contract 
Disputes Act of 1978.
    (3) Upon request of the DOE Patent Counsel or the contracting 
officer, the contractor shall provide any or all of the following:
    (i) A copy of the patent application, filing date, serial number and 
title, patent number, and issue date for any subject invention in any 
country in which the contractor has applied for a patent;
    (ii) A report, not more often than annually, summarizing all subject 
inventions which were disclosed to DOE individually during the reporting 
period specified; or
    (iii) A report, prior to closeout of the contract, listing all 
subject inventions or stating that there were none.

protectable under the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321, et 
seq.).
    Practical application, as used in this clause, means to manufacture, 
in the case of a composition or product; to practice, in the case of a 
process or method; or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; 
and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish

[[Page 380]]

that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the 
extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the 
public on reasonable terms.
    Subject invention, as used in this clause, means any invention of 
the Contractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the 
course of or under this contract.
    Patent Counsel, as used in this clause, means the Department of 
Energy Patent Counsel assisting the procuring activity.
    DOE patent waiver regulations, as used in this clause, means the 
Department of Energy patent waiver regulations in effect on the date of 
award of this contract. See 10 CFR part 784.
    Agency licensing regulations and applicable agency licensing 
regulations, as used in this clause, mean the Department of Energy 
patent licensing regulations at 10 CFR part 781.
    (b) Allocations of principal rights. (1) Assignment to the 
Government. The Contractor agrees to assign to the Government the entire 
right, title, and interest throughout the world in and to each subject 
invention, except to the extent that rights are retained by the 
Contractor under subparagraph (b)(2) and paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (2) Greater rights determinations. (i) The Contractor, or an 
employee-inventor after consultation with the Contractor, may request 
greater rights than the nonexclusive license and the foreign patent 
rights provided in paragraph (d) of this clause on identified inventions 
in accordance with the DOE patent waiver regulations. A request for a 
determination of whether the Contractor or the employee-inventor is 
entitled to acquire such greater rights must be submitted to the Patent 
Counsel with a copy to the Contracting Officer at the time of the first 
disclosure of the invention pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2) of this 
clause, or not later than 8 months thereafter, unless a longer period is 
authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer for good cause shown in 
writing by the Contractor. Each determination of greater rights under 
this contract shall be subject to paragraph (c) of this clause, unless 
otherwise provided in the greater rights determination, and to the 
reservations and conditions deemed to be appropriate by the Secretary of 
Energy or designee.
    (ii) Within two (2) months after the filing of a patent application, 
the Contractor shall provide the filing date, serial number and title, a 
copy of the patent application (including an English-language version if 
filed in a language other than English), and, promptly upon issuance of 
a patent, provide the patent number and issue date for any subject 
invention in any country for which the Contractor has been granted title 
or the right to file and prosecute on behalf of the United States by the 
Department of Energy.
    (iii) Not less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the 
response period for any action required by the Patent and Trademark 
Office, notify the Patent Counsel of any decision not to continue 
prosecution of the application.
    (iv) Upon request, the Contractor shall furnish the Government an 
irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application 
file.
    (c) Minimum rights acquired by the Government. (1) With respect to 
each subject invention to which the Department of Energy grants the 
Contractor principal or exclusive rights, the Contractor agrees as 
follows:
    (i) The Contractor hereby grants to the Government a nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have 
practiced each subject invention throughout the world by or on behalf of 
the Government of the United States (including any Government agency).
    (ii) The Contractor agrees that with respect to any subject 
invention in which DOE has granted it title, DOE has the right in 
accordance with the procedures in the DOE patent waiver regulations (10 
CFR part 784) to require the Contractor, an assignee, or exclusive 
licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially 
exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible 
applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the 
circumstances, and if the Contractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee 
refuses such a request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself 
if it determines that--
    (A) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has 
not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, 
effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject 
invention in such field of use;
    (B) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs 
which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their 
licensees;
    (C) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use 
specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not 
reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
    (D) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by 
paragraph (i) of this clause has neither been obtained nor waived or 
because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject 
invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
    (iii) The Contractor agrees to submit on request periodic reports no 
more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention 
or on efforts at obtaining such utilization of a subject invention or on 
efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the 
Contractor or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include 
information regarding the status of development, date of first 
commercial sale or use, gross

[[Page 381]]

royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and 
information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to 
provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with 
any march-in proceedings undertaken by that agency in accordance with 
subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of this clause. To the extent data or 
information supplied under this section is considered by the Contractor, 
its licensee, or assignee to be privileged and confidential and is so 
marked, the Department of Energy agrees that, to the extent permitted by 
law, it will not disclose such information to persons outside the 
Government.
    (iv) The Contractor agrees, when licensing a subject invention, to 
arrange to avoid royalty charges on acquisitions involving Government 
funds, including funds derived through a Military Assistance Program of 
the Government or otherwise derived through the Government, to refund 
any amounts received as royalty charges on a subject invention in 
acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the Government, and to provide for 
such refund in any instrument transferring rights in the invention to 
any party.
    (v) The Contractor agrees to provide for the Government's paid-up 
license pursuant to subparagraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause in any 
instrument transferring rights in a subject invention and to provide for 
the granting of licenses as required by subparagraph (c)(1)(ii) of this 
clause, and for the reporting of utilization information as required by 
subparagraph (c)(1)(iii) of this clause, whenever the instrument 
transfers principal or exclusive rights in a subject invention.
    (2) Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) shall be deemed to grant 
to the Government any rights with respect to any invention other than a 
subject invention.
    (d) Minimum rights to the Contractor. (1) The Contractor is hereby 
granted a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent 
application filed in any country on a subject invention and any 
resulting patent in which the Government obtains title, unless the 
Contractor fails to disclose the subject invention within the times 
specified in subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause. The Contractor's 
license extends to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, 
within the corporate structure of which the Contractor is a part and 
includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent 
the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract 
was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE 
except when transferred to the successor of that part of the 
Contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
    (2) The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by 
DOE to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application 
of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive 
license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions in 37 CFR 
part 404 and agency licensing regulations. This license will not be 
revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the 
Contractor has achieved practical applications and continues to make the 
benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The 
license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the 
discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or its 
domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical 
application in that foreign country.
    (3) Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will 
furnish the Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or 
modify the license, and the Contractor will be allowed 30 days (or such 
other time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the 
Contractor) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be 
revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in 
accordance with applicable agency licensing regulations and 37 CFR part 
404 concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any 
decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license.
    (4) The Contractor may request the right to acquire patent rights to 
a subject invention in any foreign country where the Government has 
elected not to secure such rights, subject to the conditions in 
subparagraphs (d)(4)(i) through (d)(4)(vii) of this clause. Such request 
must be made in writing to the Patent Counsel as part of the disclosure 
required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, with a copy to the DOE 
Contracting Officer. DOE approval, if given, will be based on a 
determination that this would best serve the national interest.
    (i) The recipient of such rights, when specifically requested by 
DOE, and three years after issuance of a foreign patent disclosing the 
subject invention, shall furnish DOE a report stating:
    (A) The commercial use that is being made, or is intended to be 
made, of said invention, and
    (B) The steps taken to bring the invention to the point of practical 
application or to make the invention available for licensing.
    (ii) The Government shall retain at least an irrevocable, 
nonexclusive, paid-up license to make, use, and sell the invention 
throughout the world by or on behalf of the Government (including any 
Government agency) and States and domestic municipal governments, unless 
the Secretary of Energy or designee determines that it would not be in 
the public interest to acquire the license for the States and domestic 
municipal governments.
    (iii) If noted elsewhere in this contract as a condition of the 
grant of an advance waiver of the Government's title to inventions under 
this contract, or, if no advance waiver

[[Page 382]]

was granted but a waiver of the Government's title to an identified 
invention is granted pursuant to subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause upon 
a determination by the Secretary of Energy that it is in the 
Government's best interest, this license shall include the right of the 
Government to sublicense foreign governments pursuant to any existing or 
future treaty or agreement with such foreign governments.
    (iv) Subject to the rights granted in subparagraphs (d)(1), (2), and 
(3) of this clause, the Secretary of Energy or designee shall have the 
right to terminate the foreign patent rights granted in this 
subparagraph (d)(4) in whole or in part unless the recipient of such 
rights demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or 
designee that effective steps necessary to accomplish substantial 
utilization of the invention have been taken or within a reasonable time 
will be taken.
    (v) Subject to the rights granted in subparagraphs (d)(1), (2), and 
(3) of this clause, the Secretary of Energy or designee shall have the 
right, commencing four years after foreign patent rights are accorded 
under this subparagraph (d)(4), to require the granting of a 
nonexclusive or partially exclusive license to a responsible applicant 
or applicants, upon terms reasonable under the circumstances, and in 
appropriate circumstances to terminate said foreign patent rights in 
whole or in part, following a hearing upon notice thereof to the public, 
upon a petition by an interested person justifying such hearing:
    (A) If the Secretary of Energy or designee determines, upon review 
of such material as he deems relevant, and after the recipient of such 
rights or other interested person has had the opportunity to provide 
such relevant and material information as the Secretary or designee may 
require, that such foreign patent rights have tended substantially to 
lessen competition or to result in undue market concentration in any 
section of the United States in any line of commerce to which the 
technology relates; or
    (B) Unless the recipient of such rights demonstrates to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee at such hearing that 
the recipient has taken effective steps, or within a reasonable time 
thereafter is expected to take such steps, necessary to accomplish 
substantial utilization of the invention.
    (vi) If the contractor is to file a foreign patent application on a 
subject invention, the Government agrees, upon written request, to use 
its best efforts to withhold publication of such invention disclosures 
for such period of time as specified by Patent Counsel, but in no event 
shall the Government or its employees be liable for any publication 
thereof.
    (vii) Subject to the license specified in subparagraphs (d) (1), 
(2), and (3) of this clause, the contractor or inventor agrees to convey 
to the Government, upon request, the entire right, title, and interest 
in any foreign country in which the contractor or inventor fails to have 
a patent application filed in a timely manner or decides not to continue 
prosecution or to pay any maintenance fees covering the invention. To 
avoid forfeiture of the patent application or patent, the contractor or 
inventor shall, not less than 60 days before the expiration period for 
any action required by any patent office, notify the Patent Counsel of 
such failure or decision, and deliver to the Patent Counsel, the 
executed instruments necessary for the conveyance specified in this 
paragraph.
    (e) Invention identification, disclosures, and reports. (1) The 
Contractor shall establish and maintain active and effective procedures 
to assure that subject inventions are promptly identified and disclosed 
to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters within 6 months 
of conception and/or first actual reduction to practice, whichever 
occurs first in the performance of work under this contract. These 
procedures shall include the maintenance of laboratory notebooks or 
equivalent records and other records as are reasonably necessary to 
document the conception and/or the first actual reduction to practice of 
subject inventions, and records that show that the procedures for 
identifying and disclosing the inventions are followed. Upon request, 
the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a description of 
such procedures for evaluation and for determination as to their 
effectiveness.
    (2) The Contractor shall disclose each subject invention to the DOE 
Patent Counsel with a copy to the Contracting Officer within 2 months 
after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel 
responsible for patent matters or, if earlier, within 6 months after the 
Contractor becomes aware that a subject invention has been made, but in 
any event before any on sale, public use, or publication of such 
invention known to the Contractor. The disclosure to DOE shall be in the 
form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the 
invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently 
complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding, to the 
extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, 
operation, and physical, chemical, biological, or electrical 
characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any 
publication, on sale, or public use of the invention and whether a 
manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication 
and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of 
disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to DOE, the Contractor shall

[[Page 383]]

promptly notify Patent Counsel of the acceptance of any manuscript 
describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use 
planned by the Contractor. The report should also include any request 
for a greater rights determination in accordance with subparagraph 
(b)(2) of this clause. When an invention is disclosed to DOE under this 
paragraph, it shall be deemed to have been made in the manner specified 
in Sections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of 42 U.S.C. 5908, unless the Contractor 
contends in writing at the time the invention is disclosed that is was 
not so made.
    (3) The Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer the 
following:
    (i) Interim reports every 12 months (or such longer period as may be 
specified by the Contracting Officer) from the date of the contract, 
listing all subject inventions during that period, and including a 
statment that all subject inventions have been disclosed (or that there 
are not such inventions), and that such disclosure has been made in 
accordance with the procedures required by paragraph (e)(1) of this 
clause.
    (ii) A final report, within 3 months after completion of the 
contracted work listing all subject inventions or containing a statement 
that there were no such inventions, and listing all subcontracts at any 
tier containing a patent right clause or containing a statement that 
there were no such subcontracts.
    (4) The Contractor agrees to require, by written agreement, its 
employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose 
promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the 
administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the 
Contractor each subject invention made under contract in order that the 
Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of 
this clause, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent 
applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's 
rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, 
as a minimum, the information required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this 
clause.
    (5) The Contractor agrees, subject to FAR 27.302(j), that the 
Government may duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and 
all other reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished 
pursuant to this clause.
    (f) Examination of records relating to inventions. (1) The 
Contracting Officer or any authorized representative shall, until 3 
years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine 
any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of 
the Contractor relating to the conception or first actual reduction to 
practice of inventions in the same field of technology as the work under 
this contract to determine whether--
    (i) Any such inventions are subject inventions;
    (ii) The Contractor has established and maintains the procedures 
required by subparagraphs (e) (1) and (4) of this clause;
    (iii) The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the 
procedures.
    (2) If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor 
invention which the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject 
invention, the Contractor may be required to disclose the invention to 
DOE for a determination of ownership rights.
    (3) Any examination of records under this paragraph will be subject 
to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the 
information involved.
    (g) Withholding of payment (This paragraph does not apply to 
subcontracts).
    (1) Any time before final payment under this contract, the 
Contracting Officer may, in the Government's interest, withhold payment 
until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 percent of the amount of this 
contract, whichever is less, shall have been set aside if, in the 
Contracting Officer's opinion, the Contractor fails to--
    (i) Convey to the Government, using a DOE-approved form, the title 
and/or rights of the Government in each subject invention as required by 
this clause.
    (ii) Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for 
identifying and disclosing subject inventions pursuant to subparagraph 
(e)(1) of this clause;
    (iii) Disclose any subject invention pursuant to subparagraph (e)(2) 
of this clause;
    (iv) Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to subparagraph 
(e)(3)(i) of this clause; or
    (v) Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to 
subparagraph (h)(4) of this clause.
    (2) Such reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting 
Officer has determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever 
deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other 
information required by this clause.
    (3) Final payment under this contract shall not be made before the 
Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer all disclosures of 
subject inventions required by subparagraph (e)(2) of this clause, and 
acceptable final report pursuant to subparagraph (e)(3)(ii) of this 
clause, and the Patent Counsel has issued a patent clearance 
certification to the Contracting Officer.
    (4) The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums 
withheld up to the maximum authorized above. No amount shall be withheld 
under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is 
being withheld under other provisions of the contract. The withholding 
of any amount or the subsequent payment thereof shall not be

[[Page 384]]

construed as a waiver of any Government rights.
    (h) Subcontracts. (1) The contractor shall include the clause at 48 
CFR 952.227-11 (suitably modified to identify the parties) in all 
subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, 
demonstration, or research work to be performed by a small business firm 
or domestic nonprofit organization, except where the work of the 
subcontract is subject to an Exceptional Circumstances Determination by 
DOE. In all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, 
developmental, demonstration, or research work, the contractor shall 
include this clause (suitably modified to identify the parties). The 
contractor shall not, as part of the consideration for awarding the 
subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.
    (2) In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to 
accept such a clause the Contractor--
    (i) Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting 
Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and 
other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; 
and
    (ii) Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written 
authorization of the Contracting Officer.
    (3) In the case of subcontracts at any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, 
and Contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created 
by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and DOE 
with respect to those matters covered by this clause.
    (4) The Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in 
writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a 
patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable 
patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, 
and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the 
Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall furnish a copy of such 
subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the 
subcontracts that have been awarded.
    (5) The contractor shall identify all subject inventions of the 
subcontractor of which it acquires knowledge in the performance of this 
contract and shall notify the Patent Counsel, with a copy to the 
contracting officer, promptly upon identification of the inventions.
    (i) Preference United States industry. Unless provided otherwise, no 
Contractor that receives title to any subject invention and no assignee 
of any such Contractor shall grant to any person the exclusive right to 
use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless such 
person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention will be 
manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual 
cases, the requirement may be waived by the Government upon a showing by 
the Contractor or assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have 
been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that 
would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or 
that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially 
feasible.
    (j) Atomic energy. (1) No claim for pecuniary award of compensation 
under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, shall 
be asserted with respect to any invention or discovery made or conceived 
in the course of or under this contract.
    (2) Except as otherwise authorized in writing by the Contracting 
Officer, the Contractor will obtain patent agreements to effectuate the 
provisions of subparagraph (e)(1) of this clause from all persons who 
perform any part of the work under this contract, except nontechnical 
personnel, such as clerical employees and manual laborers.
    (k) Background Patents. (1) Background Patent means a domestic 
patent covering an invention or discovery which is not a subject 
invention and which is owned or controlled by the Contractor at any time 
through the completion of this contract:
    (i) Which the contractor, but not the Government, has the right to 
license to others without obligation to pay royalties thereon, and
    (ii) Infringement of which cannot reasonably be avoided upon the 
practice of any specific process, method, machine, manufacture, or 
composition of matter (including relatively minor modifications thereof) 
which is a subject of the research, development, or demonstration work 
performed under this contract.
    (2) The Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government 
a royalty-free, nonexclusive license under any background patent for 
purposes of practicing a subject of this contract by or for the 
Government in research, development, and demonstration work only.
    (3) The Contractor also agrees that upon written application by DOE, 
it will grant to responsible parties, for purposes of practicing a 
subject of this contract, nonexclusive licenses under any background 
patent on terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. If, 
however, the Contractor believes that exclusive rights are necessary to 
achieve expeditious commercial development or utilization, then a 
request may be made to DOE for DOE approval of such licensing by the 
Contractor.
    (4) Notwithstanding subparagraph (k)(3) of this clause, the 
contractor shall not be obligated to license any background patent if 
the Contractor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary of 
Energy or designee that:

[[Page 385]]

    (i) A competitive alternative to the subject matter covered by said 
background patent is commercially available or readily introducible from 
one or more other sources; or
    (ii) The Contractor or its licensees are supplying the subject 
matter covered by said background patent in sufficient quantity and at 
reasonable prices to satisfy market needs, or have taken effective steps 
or within a reasonable time are expected to take effective steps to so 
supply the subject matter.
    (l) Publication. It is recognized that during the course of the work 
under this contract, the Contractor or its employees may from time to 
time desire to release or publish information regarding scientific or 
technical developments conceived or first actually reduced to practice 
in the course of or under this contract. In order that public disclosure 
of such information will not adversely affect the patent interests of 
DOE or the Contractor, patent approval for release of publication shall 
be secured from Patent Counsel prior to any such release or publication.
    (m) Forfeiture of rights in unreported subject inventions. (1) The 
Contractor shall forfeit and assign to the Government, at the request of 
the Secretary of Energy or designee, all rights in any subject invention 
which the Contractor fails to report to Patent Counsel within six months 
after the time the Contractor:
    (i) Files or causes to be filed a United States or foreign patent 
application thereon; or
    (ii) Submits the final report required by subparagraph (e)(2)(ii) of 
this clause, whichever is later.
    (2) However, the Contractor shall not forfeit rights in a subject 
invention if, within the time specified in subparagraph (m)(1) of this 
clause, the Contractor:
    (i) Prepares a written decision based upon a review of the record 
that the invention was neither conceived nor first actually reduced to 
practice in the course of or under the contract and delivers the 
decision to Patent Counsel, with a copy to the Contracting Officer; or
    (ii) Contending that the invention is not a subject invention, the 
Contractor nevertheless discloses the invention and all facts pertinent 
to this contention to the Patent Counsel, with a copy to the Contracting 
Officer; or
    (iii) Establishes that the failure to disclose did not result from 
the Contractor's fault or negligence.
    (3) Pending written assignment of the patent application and patents 
on a subject invention determined by the Secretary of Energy or designee 
to be forfeited (such determination to be a final decision under the 
Disputes clause of this contract), the Contractor shall be deemed to 
hold the invention and the patent applications and patents pertaining 
thereto in trust for the Government. The forfeiture provision of this 
paragraph (m) shall be in addition to and shall not supersede other 
rights and remedies which the Government may have with respect to 
subject inventions.

Government and responsible third parties, for purposes of practicing a 
subject of this contract, a nonexclusive license in any limited rights 
data or restricted computer software on terms and conditions reasonable 
under the circumstances including appropriate provisions for 
confidentiality; provided, however, the contractor shall not be obliged 
to license any such data if the contractor demonstrates to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy or designee that:
    (1) Such data are not essential to the manufacture or practice of 
hardware designed or fabricated, or processes developed, under this 
contract;
    (2) Such data, in the form of results obtained by their use, have a 
commercially competitive alternate available or readily introducible 
from one or more other sources;
    (3) Such data, in the form of results obtained by their use, are 
being supplied by the contractor or its licensees in sufficient quantity 
and at reasonable prices to satisfy market needs, or the contractor or 
its licensees have taken effective steps or within a reasonable time are 
expected to take effective steps to so supply such data in the form of 
results obtained by their use; or
    (4) Such data, in the form of results obtained by their use, can be 
furnished by another firm skilled in the art of manufacturing items or 
performing processes of the same general type and character necessary to 
achieve the contract results.

                   Rights to Proposal Data (APR 1994)

    Except for technical data contained on pages __ of the contractor's 
proposal dated __ which are asserted by the contractor as being 
proprietary data, it is agreed that, as a condition of the award of this 
contract, and notwithstanding the provisions of any notice appearing on

Sec. 952.227-84  Notice of right to request patent waiver.

    Include this provision in all appropriate solicitations in 
accordance with 48 CFR 927.409(t).

                Right to Request Patent Waiver (FEB 1998)

    Offerors have the right to request a waiver of all or any part of 
the rights of the United States in inventions conceived or first 
actually reduced to practice in performance of the contract that may be 
awarded as a result of this solicitation, in advance of or within 30 
days after the effective date of contracting. Even where such advance 
waiver is not requested or the request is denied, the contractor will 
have a continuing right under the contract to request a waiver of the 
rights of the United States in identified inventions, i.e., individual 
inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in 
performance of the contract. Domestic small businesses and domestic 
nonprofit organizations normally will receive the patent rights clause 
at DEAR 952.227-11 which permits the contractor to retain title to such 
inventions, except under contracts for management or operation of a 
Government-owned research and development facility or under contracts 
involving exceptional circumstances or intelligence activities. 
Therefore, small businesses and nonprofit organizations normally need 
not request a waiver. See the patent rights clause in the draft contract 
in this solicitation. See DOE's patent waiver regulations at 10 CFR part 
784.

          engineer contracts.

    In accordance with the provisions prescribed at 949.505 include the 
following clause in a cost-reimbursement architect-engineer contract.

                         Termination (APR 1994)

    (a) Notice of termination for default or convenience. The 
contracting officer may at any time terminate performance of the work 
under this contract in whole or from time to time in part for the 
default of the architect-engineer or for the convenience of the 
Government by written notice to the architect-engineer stating the 
ground for termination. Such termination shall be effective in the 
manner and upon the date specified in said notice and shall be without 
prejudice to any claims which the Government may have against the 
architect-engineer. Upon receipt of such notice and except as otherwise 
directed by the contracting officer, the architect-engineer shall:
    (1) Stop work under the contract on the date and to the extent 
specified in the notice of termination;
    (2) Place no further orders or subcontracts for materials, services, 
or facilities, except as may be necessary for completion of such portion 
of the work under the contract as is not terminated; and
    (3) Terminate all orders and subcontracts to the extent they relate 
to the performance of work terminated by the notice of termination.
    (b) Termination for default.
    (1) If the architect-engineer refuses or fails to prosecute the 
work, or any separable part thereof, with such diligence as will ensure 
its completion within the time specified in this contract, or any 
extension thereof; or fails to complete said work within such time; or 
if the architect-engineer fails to perform any of the other requirements 
of this contract, and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 
days (or such longer period as the contracting officer may authorize in 
writing) after receipt of notice from the contracting officer specifying 
such failure, the contracting officer may terminate for default the 
architect-engineer's right to proceed with the work as to which there 
has been delay, provided that the performance of the work shall not be 
terminated for default because of any delays in the completion of work 
due to unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or 
negligence of the architect-engineer, including, but not restricted to, 
acts of God, or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its 
sovereign or contractual capacity, acts of another architect-engineer in 
the performance of a contract with the Government, fires, floods, 
epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, and 
unusually severe weather or delay of subcontractors or suppliers arising 
from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the fault or 
negligence of both the architect-engineer and subarchitect-engineers or 
suppliers; and if the architect-engineer within ten (10) days from the 
beginning of any such

[[Page 391]]

delay (unless the contracting officer grants a further period of time 
prior to the date of final settlement of the contract) notifies the 
contracting officer in writing of the causes of delay. The contracting 
officer shall ascertain the facts and the extent of the delay and extend 
the time for completing the work when, in his judgment, the findings of 
fact justify such an extension, and his findings of fact thereon shall 
be final and conclusive on the parties hereto, subject only to appeal by 
the architect-engineer to the head of the agency or his designee in 
accordance with ``Disputes'' clause of this contract.
    (2) If, after notice of termination of this contract for default 
under (1) above, it is determined for any reason that the architect-
engineer was not in default pursuant to (1), or that the architect-
engineer failure to perform or to make progress in performance is due to 
causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the 
architect-engineer pursuant to the provisions of this clause relating to 
excusable delays, the notice of termination shall be deemed to have been 
issued for the convenience of the Government under this clause, and the 
rights and obligations to the parties hereto shall in such event be 
governed accordingly.
    (c) Liability for costs on default. If performance of the work under 
this contract is terminated for the default of the architect-engineer, 
the Government may complete or employ any other person or persons to 
complete the work, and the architect-engineer shall be liable to the 
Government for increased costs occasioned the Government by the default.
    (d) Terms of settlement. Upon the termination of performance of work 
under this contract, full and complete settlement of all claims of the 
architect-engineer with respect to the terminated work shall be made as 
follows:
    (1) Assumption of contractor's obligations. The Government shall 
have the right in its decision to assume all obligations, commitments, 
and claims that the architect-engineer may have theretofore in good 
faith undertaken or incurred in connection with the terminated work, the 
cost of which would be allowable in accordance with the provisions of 
this contract; and the architect-engineer shall, as a condition of 
receiving the payments mentioned in this article, execute and deliver 
all such papers and take all such steps as the contracting officer may 
require for the purpose of fully vesting in the Government all the 
rights and benefits of the architect-engineer, related to such 
obligations, commitments, and claims.
    (2) Payments for allowable costs. The Government shall treat as 
allowable costs all expenditures made in accordance with the clause 
herein entitled ``Allowable cost and Payment,'' not previously so 
allowed or otherwise credited.
    (3) Payment for termination expense. If performance of work under 
the contract is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the 
Government shall reimburse the architect-engineer for such further 
expenditures made after the date of termination for the protection of 
Government property and for such legal and accounting services in 
connection with settlement as are required or approved by the 
contracting officer.
    (4) Payments on account of fixed fee. If performance work under the 
contract is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the 
architect-engineer shall be paid that portion of the fixed fee which the 
work actually completed, so determined by the contracting officer, bears 
to the entire work under this contract less payments previously made on 
account of the fee. If performance of the work under the contract is 
terminated for the default of the architect-engineer, no further payment 
beyond that amount due on completed work with appropriate fee payment, 
shall accrue on account of the fixed price.
    (5) Computation of amount due. In arriving at the amount, if any, 
due the architect-engineer under this article, there shall be deducted 
from what would otherwise be due (i) all unliquidated advances and all 
other unliquidated payments on account theretofore made to the 
contractor, (ii) any claims of the Government against the contractor in 
connection with this contract, and (iii) all deductions due under the 
terms of this contract and not otherwise recovered by or credited to the 
Government.
    (6) Property accounting and release. The architect-engineer shall 
furnish the accounting for Government-owned property required by the 
clause entitled ``Property'' and the assignment, closing financial 
statement, and release required by the clause entitled ``Allowable Cost 
and Payments.''
    (e) Rights and remedies of the Government. The rights and remedies 
of the Government provided in this article are in addition to any other 
rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.

type and in such amount as DOE shall determine to be appropriate to 
cover such public liability, provided that the costs of such financial 
protection are reimbursed to the contractor by DOE.
    (d)(1) Indemnification. To the extent that the contractor and other 
persons indemnified are not compensated by any financial protection 
permitted or required by DOE, DOE will indemnify the contractor and 
other persons indemnified against (i) claims for public liability as 
described in subparagraph (d)(2) of this clause; and (ii) such legal 
costs of the contractor and other persons indemnified as are approved by 
DOE, provided that DOE's liability, including such legal costs, shall 
not exceed the amount set forth in section 170e.(1)(B) of the Act in the 
aggregate for each nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation 
occurring within the United States or $100 million in the aggregate for 
each nuclear incident occurring outside the United States, irrespective 
of the number of persons indemnified in connection with this contract.
    (2) The public liability referred to in subparagraph (d)(1) of this 
clause is public liability as defined in the Act which (i) arises out of 
or in connection with the activities under this contract, including 
transportation; and (ii) arises out of or results from a nuclear 
incident or precautionary evacuation, as those terms are defined in the 
Act.
    (e)(1) Waiver of Defenses. In the event of a nuclear incident, as

and
    (C) Any issue or defense based on any statute of limitations, if 
suit is instituted within 3 years from the date on which the claimant 
first knew, or reasonably could have known, of his injury or change and 
the cause thereof. The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be 
effective regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be 
deemed jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. 
The waiver shall be judicially enforceable in accordance with its terms 
by the claimant against the person indemnified.
    (v) The term extraordinary nuclear occurrence means an event which 
DOE has determined to be an extraordinary nuclear occurrence as defined 
in the Act. A determination of whether or not there has been an 
extraordinary nuclear occurrence will be made in accordance with the 
procedures in 10 CFR part 840.

site of and in connection with the activity where the extraordinary 
nuclear occurrence takes place, if benefits therefor are either payable 
or required to be provided under any workmen's compensation or 
occupational disease law;
    (vi) Shall not apply to any claim resulting from a nuclear incident 
occurring outside the United States;
    (vii) Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set 
forth in this clause and in insurance policies, contracts or other proof 
of financial protection; and
    (viii) Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense 
of, any claim or portion of claim which is not within the protection 
afforded under (A) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 
170e. of the Act, and (B) the terms of this agreement and the terms of 
insurance policies, contracts, or other proof of financial protection.
    (f) Notification and litigation of claims. The contractor shall give 
immediate written notice to DOE of any known action or claim filed or 
made against the contractor or other person indemnified for public 
liability as defined in paragraph (d)(2). Except as otherwise directed 
by DOE, the contractor shall furnish promptly to DOE, copies of all 
pertinent papers received by the contractor or filed with respect to 
such actions or claims. DOE shall have the right to, and may collaborate 
with, the contractor and any other person indemnified in the settlement 
or defense of any action or claim and shall have the right to (1) 
require the prior approval of DOE for the payment of any claim that DOE 
may be required to indemnify hereunder; and (2) appear through the 
Attorney General on behalf of the contractor or other person indemnified 
in any action brought upon any claim that DOE may be required to 
indemnify hereunder, take charge of such action, and settle or defend 
any such action. If the settlement or defense of any such action or 
claim is undertaken by DOE, the contractor or other person indemnified 
shall furnish all reasonable assistance in effecting a settlement or 
asserting a defense.
    (g) Continuity of DOE obligations. The obligations of DOE under this 
clause shall not be affected by any failure on the part of the 
contractor to fulfill its obligation under this contract and shall be 
unaffected by the death, disability, or termination of existence of the 
contractor, or by the completion, termination or expiration of this 
contract.
    (h) Effect of other clauses. The provisions of this clause shall not 
be limited in any way by, and shall be interpreted without reference to, 
any other clause of this contract, including the clause entitled 
Contract Disputes, provided, however, that this clause shall be subject 
to the clauses entitled Covenant Against Contingent Fees, and Accounts, 
records, and inspection, and any provisions that are later added to this 
contract as required by applicable Federal law, including statutes, 
executive orders and regulations, to be included in Nuclear Hazards 
Indemnity Agreements.
    (i) Civil penalties. The contractor and its subcontractors and 
suppliers who are indemnified under the provisions of this clause are 
subject to civil penalties, pursuant to 234A of the Act, for violations 
of applicable DOE nuclear-safety related rules, regulations, or orders.
    (j) Criminal penalties. Any individual director, officer, or 
employee of the contractor or of its subcontractors and suppliers who 
are indemnified under the provisions of this clause are subject to 
criminal penalties, pursuant to 223(c) of the Act, for knowing and 
willful violation of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and 
applicable DOE nuclear safety-related rules, regulations or orders which 
violation results in, or, if undetected, would have resulted in a 
nuclear incident.
    (k) Inclusion in subcontracts. The contractor shall insert this 
clause in any subcontract which may involve the risk of public 
liability, as that term is defined in the Act and further described in 
paragraph (d)(2) above. However, this clause shall not be included in 
subcontracts in which the subcontractor is subject to Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC) financial protection requirements under section 170b. 
of the Act or NRC agreements of indemnification under section 170c. or 
k. of the Act for the activities under the subcontract.

    Contracts with an effective date after the date of (date to be that 
of the Final Rule resulting from the proposed rule herein), do not 
require the effective date provision in this clause. Delete the title.
    Use the EFFECTIVE DATE title and the following language, for those 
contracts:


Sec. ``(  ) This indemnity agreement shall be applicable with respect to 
          nuclear incidents occurring on or after __.''
    (1) Those that contained an indemnity pursuant to Public Law 85-840 
prior to August 20, 1988, include the effective date provision above, 
inserting the effective date of the contract modification that replaced 
the Public Law 85-804 indemnity with an interim Price-Anderson based 
indemnity. Pursuant to the Price-Anderson Amendments Act, this 
substitution must have taken place by February 20, 1989.
    (2) Those that contained, and continue to contain, either of the 
previous Nuclear Hazards Indemnity clauses, include the effective date 
provision above, inserting ``August 20, 1988.''
    (3) Those with an effective date between August 20, 1988, and the 
date of the Final Rule, that (a) had ``interim coverage'' or (b) did not 
have ``interim coverage'' but have now been determined to be covered 
under the PAAA, include the effective date provision above, inserting 
the contract effective date.

                                Note III

    The following alternate will be added to the above Nuclear Hazards 
Indemnity Agreement clause for all contracts that contain a general 
authority indemnity pursuant to 950.7101. Caution: Be aware that for 
contracts that will have this provision added which do not contain an 
effective date provision, this paragraph shall be marked (1). In the 
event an Effective Date provision has been included, it shall be market 
(m).

Sec. ``(  ) To the extent that the contractor is compensated by any 
          financial protection, or is indemnified pursuant to this 
          clause, or is effectively relieved of pubic liability by an 
          order or orders limiting same, pursuant to 170e of the Act, 
          the provisions of the clause providing general authority 
          indemnity shall not apply.''

Sec. 952.251-70  Contractor employee travel discounts.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 951.70, insert the following clause.

             Contractor Employee Travel Discounts (DEC 2000)

    (a) The contractor shall take advantage of travel discounts offered 
to Federal contractor employee travelers by AMTRAK, hotels, motels, or 
car rental companies, when use of such discounts would result in lower 
overall trip costs and the discounted services are reasonably available. 
Vendors providing these services may require the contractor employee to 
furnish them a letter of identification signed by the authorized 
contracting officer.
    (b) Contracted airlines. Contractors are not eligible for GSA 
contract city pair fares.
    (c) Discount rail service. AMTRAK voluntarily offers discounts to 
Federal travelers on official business and sometimes extends those 
discounts to Federal contractor employees.
    (d) Hotels/motels. Many lodging providers extend their discount 
rates for Federal employees to Federal contractor employees.
    (e) Car rentals. The Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) of 
the Department of Defense negotiates rate agreements with car rental 
companies that are available to Federal travelers on official business. 
Some car rental companies extend those discounts to Federal contractor 
employees.
    (f) Obtaining travel discounts.
    (1) To determine which vendors offer discounts to Government 
contractors, the contractor may review commercial publications such as 
the Official Airline guides Official Traveler, Innovata, or National 
Telecommunications. The contractor may also

[[Page 395]]

obtain this information from GSA contract Travel Management Centers or 
the Department of Defense's Commercial Travel Offices.
    (2) The vendor providing the service may require the Government 
contractor to furnish a letter signed by the contracting officer. The 
following illustrates a standard letter of identification.

                       OFFICIAL AGENCY LETTERHEAD

TO: Participating Vendor
SUBJECT: OFFICIAL TRAVEL OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR

(FULL NAME OF TRAVELER), the bearer of this letter is an employee of 
(COMPANY NAME) which has a contract with this agency under Government 
contract (CONTRACT NUMBER). During the period of the contract (GIVE 
DATES), AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE CONTRACT VENDOR, the employee is 
eligible and authorized to use available travel discount rates in 
accordance with Government contracts and/or agreements. Government 
Contract City Pair fares are not available to Contractors.

   Subpart 970.01_Management and Operating Contract Regulatory System


<R05>
Sec. 970.0100  Scope of part.

    This part provides Departmental policies, procedures, provisions, 
and clauses that implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) and other parts of the Department of Energy Acquisition 
Regulation (DEAR) for the award and administration of the Department's 
management and operating contracts, as defined at 48 CFR subpart 17.6. 
The FAR and other parts of the DEAR apply to management and operating 
contracts. See 48 CFR 970.5200 for guidance regarding which provisions 
and clauses (from FAR, DEAR Part 970, or other parts of the DEAR) to 
include in management and operating contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0103  Publication and codification.

    (a) Organization of Part 970. (1) To the extent possible, the titles 
and text of the subparts, sections, and subsections of this part are 
numbered to correspond with related material that is contained in the 
FAR.
    (2) The number to the left of the decimal point represents the DEAR 
part number (i.e., 970). The numbers to the right of the decimal point 
and to the left of the dash represent, in order, the DEAR subpart (first 
two digits), and the DEAR section number (second two digits). The 
numbers to the right of the dash represent the DEAR subsection. A second 
dash may follow the DEAR subsection number. As applicable, numbers to 
the right of the second dash represent subordinate subsections.
    (3) To the extent practicable, the subpart number corresponds with 
the FAR part which contains related coverage, and the section number 
corresponds with the FAR subpart which contains related coverage (e.g., 
the coverage

[[Page 400]]

contained in DEAR 970.0309 corresponds with material contained in FAR 
3.9).
    (4) Where the FAR does not contain related coverage on a particular 
subject, the DEAR section number will be numbered using numbers of 70 
and up (e.g., 970.0370).
    (b) Special Note Regarding Clause Numbering. The section number for 
clauses prescribed in part 970 are numbered to correspond with the 
subpart in which the clause is prescribed (e.g., 970.5203-1 is 
prescribed for use at subpart 970.03).

  Subpart 970.03_Improper Business Practices and Personal Conflicts of 
                                Interest


<R05>
Sec. 970.0309  Whistleblower Protection of Contractor Employees.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0309-1  Applicability.

    The contracting officer shall refer to 48 CFR subpart 903.9 
regarding the applicability of the DOE Employee Protection Program to 
management and operating contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0370  Management Controls and Improvements.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0370-1  Policy.

    (a) Management and operating contractors shall develop and maintain 
systems of management and quality control to discourage waste, fraud and 
abuse; and to ensure that components, products, and services that are 
provided to DOE satisfy the contractor's obligations under the contract.
    (b) As a part of the required overall management structure, the 
contractor must maintain management control systems which, in compliance 
with the requirements of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5203-1:
    (1) Are documented and satisfactory to DOE;
    (2) Ensure that all levels of management are accountable for 
effective management systems and internal controls within their areas of 
assigned responsibility;
    (3) Cover both programmatic and administrative functions;
    (4) Provide reasonable assurance that Government resources are 
safeguarded against theft, fraud, waste, and unauthorized use;
    (5) Promote efficient and effective operations;
    (6) Ensure that all obligations and costs incurred are in compliance 
with the intended purposes and the terms and conditions of the contract;
    (7) Properly record, manage, and report all revenues, expenditures, 
transactions and assets;
    (8) Maintain financial, statistical and other reports necessary to 
maintain accurate, reliable, and timely accountability and management 
controls;
    (9) Are periodically reviewed to ensure that the systems provide 
reasonable assurance that the objectives of the system are being 
accomplished and that these controls are working effectively;
    (10) Are in accordance with the Comptroller General's standards for 
internal controls, as set forth in the General Accounting Office Policy 
and Procedures Manual For Guidance To Federal Agencies, (Oct 1984), as 
amended.
    (c) Management and operating contractors shall also develop and 
maintain a baseline program of quality assurance that will implement 
documented performance and quality standards, and management controls 
and assessment techniques to ensure components, services, and products 
meet DOE's, design criteria and other governing and applicable 
specifications.
    (d) DOE expects all its contractors to seek to identify improvements 
in any aspect of performance. Management and operating contracts are 
very large and complex; therefore, the opportunities to identify changes 
in performance that will increase the effectiveness or efficiency of 
contract performance are more prevalent than under other contracts. The 
clause at 48 CFR 970.5203-2 requires DOE management and operating 
contractors to affirmatively seek to identify, evaluate, and institute, 
where appropriate, processes that will improve the effectiveness or 
efficiency of any aspect of contract performance. It further requires 
the contractor to communicate any such improvements to DOE, other 
management and operating contractors, and DOE major facilities 
contractors. The contractor is required to participate in efforts by 
those contractors to address common

[[Page 401]]

problems or the institution of improvements. It allows the contractor to 
enlist the aid of the DOE contracting officer where necessary to 
institute or communicate the improvements. The obligations under the 
clause in no way affect the contractor's obligations under other 
provisions of the contract to notify or acquire the approval of the 
contracting officer.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0370-2  Contract clause.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5203-1, 
Management Controls, in all management and operating contracts.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5203-2, 
Performance Improvement and Collaboration, in all management and 
operating contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0371  Conduct of employees of DOE management and operating 
          contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0371-1  Scope of section.

    This section establishes the policies for maintaining satisfactory 
standards of conduct on the part of individuals employed by DOE 
management and operating contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0371-2  Applicability.

    The policies in this section are applicable to all DOE management 
and operating contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0371-3  Definition.

    Employees, as used in this section, are defined to mean individuals 
employed by the contractor, both full and part-time, who are assigned to 
work under a DOE management and operating contract.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0371-4  Gratuities.

    Employees of a management and operating contractor shall not, under 
circumstances which might reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to 
influence the recipients in the conduct of their duties, accept any 
gratuity or special favor from individuals or organizations with whom 
the contractor is doing business, or proposing to do business, in 
accomplishing the work under the contract. Reference is made to the 
requirements prescribed in 48 CFR 3.502.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0371-5  Use of privileged information.

    Management and operating contractor employees shall not use 
privileged information for personal gain, or make other improper use of 
privileged information which is acquired in connection with their 
employment on contract work. For the purposes of this subsection, the 
term ``privileged information'' includes but is not limited to, 
unpublished information relating to technological and scientific 
developments; medical, personnel, or security records of individuals; 
anticipated materials' requirements or pricing action; possible new 
sites for DOE program operations; internal DOE decisions; policy 
development; and knowledge of selections of contractors or 
subcontractors in advance of official announcement.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0371-6  Incompatibility between regular duties and private 
          interests.

    (a) Employees of a management and operating contractor shall not be 
permitted to make or influence any decisions on behalf of the contractor 
which directly or indirectly affect the interest of the Government, if 
the employee's personal concern in the matter may be incompatible with 
the interest of the Government. For example: An employee of a contractor 
will not negotiate, or influence the award of, a subcontract with a 
company in which the individual has an employment relationship or 
significant financial interest; and an employee of a contractor will not 
be assigned the preparation of an evaluation for DOE or for any DOE 
contractor of some technical aspect of the work of another organization 
with which the individual has an employment relationship, or significant 
financial interest, or which is a competitor of an organization (other 
than the contractor who is the individual's regular employer) in which 
the individual has an employment relationship or significant financial 
interest.
    (b) The contractor shall be responsible for informing employees that 
they are expected to disclose any incompatibilities between duties 
performed for the contractor and their private interests and to refer 
undecided questions to the contractor.

[[Page 402]]


<R05>
Sec. 970.0371-7  Outside employment of contractor employees.

    Employees of a management and operating contractor are entitled to 
the same rights and privileges with respect to outside employment as 
other citizens. Therefore, there is no general prohibition against 
contractor employees having outside employment. However, no employee of 
a contractor performing work on a full or part-time basis under a DOE 
management and operating contract may engage in employment outside 
official hours of duty or while on leave if such employment will:
    (a) In any manner interfere with the proper and effective 
performance of the duties of the position;
    (b) Appear to create a conflict-of-interest situation, or
    (c) Appear to subject DOE or the contractor to public criticism or 
embarrassment.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0371-8  Employee disclosure concerning other employment 
          services.

    (a) Management and operating contractors are responsible for 
requiring its employees to file with the contractor, a written 
disclosure statement concerning outside employment services which 
involve the use of information in the area of the employee's employment 
with the contractor. The disclosure shall contain such information 
concerning the outside employment as the contractor may prescribe. As a 
minimum, the employee's disclosure shall:
    (1) Acknowledge that the employee has read and is familiar with:
    (i) The requirements and restrictions prescribed in this section,
    (ii) DOE publication entitled, ``Reporting Results of Scientific and 
Technical Work Funded by DOE'', and
    (iii) The requirements of the contractor's contract with DOE 
relating to patents.
    (2) Include information concerning any rate of remuneration 
significantly in excess of the employee's regular rate of remuneration;
    (3) Identify any actual or potential conflicts with DOE's policies 
regarding conduct of employees of DOE's contractors set forth in this 
section;
    (4) Address any potential impacts that such employment may have on 
the contractor's responsibility to report fully and promptly to DOE all 
significant research and development information; and
    (5) Identify any potential conflicts such employment may have with 
the patent provisions of the contractor's contract with DOE.
    (b) The contractor shall provide a copy of all disclosures to the 
contracting officer.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0371-9  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5203-3, 
Contractor's Organization, in all management and operating contracts. 
The approval authority of the Secretary of Energy required in paragraph 
(c) may not be delegated. In paragraph (a) the words ``and managerial 
personnel (see 48 CFR 970.5245-1(j))'' may be inserted after ``(see 48 
CFR 952.215-70)''.

                  Subpart 970.04_Administrative Matters


<R05>
Sec. 970.0404  Safeguarding classified information.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0404-1  Definitions.

    Classified Information means any information or material that is 
owned by or produced for, or is under the control of the United States 
Government, and determined pursuant to provisions of Executive Order 
12356 of April 2, 1982 (3 CFR, 1982 Comp., p. 166), or prior orders, or 
as authorized under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, to 
require protection against unauthorized disclosure, and is so 
designated.
    Counterintelligence means information gathered and activities 
conducted to protect against espionage, other intelligence activities, 
sabotage, or assassinations conducted for or on behalf of foreign 
powers, organizations or persons, or international terrorist activities, 
but not including personnel, physical, document or communication 
security programs.
    Restricted data means data which is defined, in section 11, of the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, as ``all data concerning:

[[Page 403]]

    (1) Design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons;
    (2) The production of special nuclear material; or
    (3) The use of special nuclear material in the production of energy, 
but shall not include data declassified or removed from the Restricted 
Data category pursuant to section 142.''


<R05>
Sec. 970.0404-2  General.

    (a) The basis of DOE's security requirements is the Atomic Energy 
Act of 1954, as amended.
    (b) DOE regulations concerning national security information are 
codified at 10 CFR parts 1045 and 710. Supplemental security material is 
found in the DOE Directives system. Foreign ownership, control, or 
influence over contractors as it relates to security is discussed at 48 
CFR 904.70 also applies to management and operating contracts. 
Regulations pertaining to the protection of restricted data are found 
under 10 CFR part 1016.
    (c) Statutory requirements to be observed in connection with the 
release of Restricted Data to foreign governments are contained in the 
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Sections 141 and 144 (42 U.S.C. 2161 and 
2164).
    (d) Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2168) prohibits 
the unauthorized dissemination of unclassified nuclear information with 
respect to the atomic energy defense programs pertaining to:
    (1) The design of production facilities or utilization facilities;
    (2) Security measures (including security plans, procedures, and 
equipment) for the physical protection of:
    (i) Production or utilization facilities,
    (ii) Nuclear material contained in such facilities, or
    (iii) Nuclear materials in transit; or
    (3) The design, manufacture, or utilization of any atomic weapon or 
component if the design, manufacture, or utilization of such weapon or 
component was contained in any information declassified or removed from 
the Restricted Data category pursuant to section 142 of the Atomic 
Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2162).
    (e) Executive Order 12333, United States Intelligence Activities, 
provides for the organization and control of United States foreign 
intelligence and counterintelligence activities. In accordance with this 
Executive Order, DOE has established a counterintelligence program which 
is described in DOE Order 5670.3 (as amended). All DOE elements, 
including management and operating contractors and other contractors 
managing DOE-owned facilities which require access authorizations, 
should undertake the necessary precautions to ensure that DOE and 
covered contractor personnel, programs and resources are properly 
protected from foreign intelligence threats and activities.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0404-3  Responsibilities of contracting officers.

    (a) If access to Restricted Data may be required during the 
solicitation process for a management and operating contract, security 
clearances shall be obtained in accordance with applicable DOE 
Directives in the safeguards and security series.
    (b) Management and operating contracts which may require the 
processing or storage of Restricted Data or Special Nuclear Material 
require application of the applicable DOE Directives in the safeguards 
and security series.
    (c) The contracting officer shall refer to 48 CFR 904.71 for 
guidance concerning the prohibition on award of a DOE contract under a 
national security program to a company owned by an entity controlled by 
a foreign government when access to proscribed information is required 
to perform the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0404-4  Solicitation provision and contract clauses.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5204-1, 
Counterintelligence, into all management and operating contracts and 
other contracts for the management of DOE-owned facilities which include 
the security and classification/declassification clauses.
    (b) The contracting officer shall refer to 48 CFR 904.404 and 48 CFR 
904.7103 for the prescription of solicitation provisions and contract 
clauses relating to safeguarding classified information and

[[Page 404]]

foreign ownership, control, or influence over contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0407  Contractor records retention.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0407-1  Applicability.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0407-1-1  Alternate retention schedules.

    Records produced under the Department's contracts involving 
management and operation responsibilities relative to DOE-owned or -
leased facilities are to be retained and disposed of in accordance with 
the guidance contained in DOE G 1324.5B, Records Management Program and 
DOE Records Schedules (see current version), rather than those set forth 
at 48 CFR subpart 4.7, Contractor Records Retention.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0407-1-2  Access to and ownership of records.

    Contracting officers may agree to contractor ownership of certain 
categories of records designated in the instruction contained in 
paragraph (b) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5204-3, Access to and 
Ownership of Records, provided the Government's rights to inspect, copy, 
and audit these records are not limited. These rights must be retained 
by the Government in order to carry out the Department's statutory 
responsibilities required by the Atomic Energy Act and other statutes 
for oversight of its contractors, including compliance with the 
Department's health, safety and reporting requirements, and protection 
of the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0407-1-3  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 48 CFR 970.5204-
3, Access to and Ownership of Records, in management and operating 
contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0470  Department of Energy Directives.


<R05>
Sec. 970.0470-1  General.

    (a) The contractor is required to comply with the requirements of 
applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations, unless relief 
has been granted by the appropriate authority. For informational 
purposes, the contracting officer may append the contract with a list of 
applicable laws or regulations (see 970.5204-2, Laws, Regulations, and 
DOE Directives, paragraph (a)).
    (b) The Department of Energy Directives System is a system of 
instructions, including orders, notices, manuals, guides, and standards, 
for Departmental elements. In certain circumstances, requirements 
contained in these directives may apply to a contractor through 
operation of a contract clause. Program and requirements personnel are 
responsible for identifying requirements in the Directives System which 
are applicable to a contract, and for developing a list of applicable 
requirements and providing it to the contracting officer for inclusion 
in the contract.
    (c) Where directives requirements are established using either the 
Standards/Requirements Identification Process or the Work Smart 
Standards Process, the applicable process should also be used to 
establish the environment, safety, and health portion of the list 
identified in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Environmental, safety, and health (ES&H) requirements 
appropriate for work conducted under a management and operating contract 
may be determined by a DOE approved process to evaluate the work and the 
associated hazards, and identify an appropriately tailored set of 
standards, practices, and controls, such as a tailoring process included 
in a DOE approved Safety Management System implemented under 48 CFR 
970.5223-1, Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health into Work 
Planning and Execution. When such a process is used, the contracting 
officer shall ensure that the set of tailored requirements, as approved 
by DOE pursuant to the process, is incorporated into the list identified 
in paragraph (b) of this section. These requirements shall supersede, in 
whole or in part, the contractual environmental, safety, and health 
requirements previously made applicable to the contract by List B. If 
the tailored set of requirements identifies an alternative requirement 
which varies from an ES&H requirement of an otherwise applicable law or 
regulation, the contractor must request an exemption or other 
appropriate regulatory relief that may be specified in the governing 
regulation.

Sec. 970.0905  Organizational conflicts of interest.

    Management and operating contracts shall contain an organizational 
conflict of interest clause substantially similar to the clause at 48 
CFR 952.209-72, Organizational Conflicts of Interest, and which is 
appropriate to the statement of work of the individual contract. In 
addition, the contracting officer shall assure that the clause contains 
appropriate restraints on intra-corporate relations between the 
contractor's organization and personnel operating the Department's 
facility and its parent corporate body and affiliates. Such restraints 
shall include personnel access to the facility, technical transfer of 
information from the facility, and the availability from the facility of 
other advantages flowing from performance of the contract. The 
contracting officer is responsible for ensuring that M&O contractors 
adopt policies and procedures in the award of subcontracts that will 
meet the Department's need to safeguard against a biased work product 
and an unfair competitive advantage. To this end, the organizational 
conflicts of interest clause in management and operating contracts shall 
include Alternate I.

    (a) In the award of a management and operating contract, the 
contracting officer shall determine that the prospective contractor is a 
responsible contractor and is capable of providing all necessary 
financial, personnel, and other resources in performance of the 
contract.
    (b) DOE contracts with entities that have been created solely for 
the purpose of performing a specific management and operating contract. 
Generally, such newly created entities will have very limited financial 
and other resources. In such instances, when making the determination of 
responsibility required under this section, the contracting officer may 
evaluate the financial resources of other entities only to the extent 
that those entities are legally bound, jointly and severally if more 
than one, by means of a performance guarantee or other equivalent 
enforceable commitment to supply the necessary resources to the 
prospective contractor and to assume all contractual obligations of the 
prospective contractor. A performance guarantee should be the means used 
unless an equivalent degree of commitment can be obtained by an 
alternative means.

<R05>
Sec. 970.1100  Policy.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1100-1  Performance-based contracting.

    (a) It is the policy of the Department of Energy to use, to the 
maximum extent practicable, performance-based contracting methods in its 
management and operating contracts. Office of Federal Procurement Policy 
Letter 91-2 provides guidance concerning the development and use of 
performance-based contracting concepts and methodologies that may be 
generally applied to management and operating contracts. Performance-
based contracts: Describe performance requirements in terms of results 
rather than methods of accomplishing the work; use measurable (i.e., 
terms of quality, timeliness, quantity) performance standards and 
objectives and quality assurance surveillance plans; provide performance 
incentives (positive or negative) where appropriate; and specify 
procedures for award or incentive fee reduction when work activities are 
not performed or do not meet contract requirements.
    (b) The use of performance-based statements of work, where feasible, 
is the preferred method for establishing work requirements. Such 
statements of work and other documents used to establish work 
requirements (such as work authorization directives) should describe 
performance requirements and expectations in terms of outcome, results, 
or final work products, as opposed to methods, processes, or design.
    (c) Contract performance requirements and expectations should be 
consistent with the Department's strategic planning goals and 
objectives, as made applicable to the site or facility through 
Departmental programmatic and financial planning processes. Measurable 
performance criteria, objective measures, and where appropriate, 
performance incentives, shall be structured to correspond to the 
performance requirements established in the statement of work and other 
documents used to establish work requirements.
    (d) Quality assurance surveillance plans shall be developed to 
facilitate the assessment of contractor performance and ensure the 
appropriateness of any award or incentive fee payment. Such plans shall 
be tailored to the contract performance objectives, criteria, and 
measures, and shall, to the maximum extent practicable, focus on the 
level of performance required by the performance objectives rather than 
the methodology used by the contractor to achieve that level of 
performance.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1100-2  Additional considerations.

    (a) While it is not feasible to set forth standard language which 
would apply to every contract situation, language must be designed for 
inclusion in a management and operating contract to describe clearly the 
work being undertaken; the controls, as appropriate, to be exercised by 
DOE over the performance of that work; and the relationship contemplated 
between the parties.
    (b) The language shall also include the following with respect to 
subcontracting performance of the work described pursuant to paragraph 
(a) of this section: ``The contractor shall, when directed by DOE and 
may, but only when authorized by DOE, enter into subcontracts for the 
performance of any part of the work under this clause.''
    (c) The provisions required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section shall be set forth in the statement of work of the contract.

Sec. 970.1504-1  Price analysis.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-1-1  Fees for management and operating contracts.

    This subsection sets forth the Department's policies on fees for 
management and operating contracts and may be applied to other contracts 
as determined by the Procurement Executive, or designee.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-1-2  Fee policy.

    (a) DOE management and operating contractors may be paid a fee in 
accordance with the requirements of this subsection.
    (b) There are three basic principles underlying the Department's fee 
policy:
    (1) The amount of available fee should reflect the financial risk 
assumed by the contractor.
    (2) It is the policy of the Department, when work elements cannot be 
fixed price, incentive fees (including award fees) tied to objective 
measures should be used to the maximum extent appropriate.
    (3) When work elements cannot be fixed price and award fees are 
employed, they should be tied to either objective or subjective 
measures. Each measure should, to the maximum extent appropriate, be 
directly tied to a specific portion of the fee pool.
    (c) Fee objectives and amounts are to be determined for each 
contract. Standard fees or across-the-board fee agreements will not be 
used or made. Due to the nature of funding management and operating 
contracts, it is anticipated that fee shall be established in accordance 
with the annual funding cycle; however, with the prior approval of the 
Procurement Executive, or designee, a longer period may be used where 
necessary to incentivize performance objectives that span funding cycles 
or to optimize cost reduction efforts.
    (d) Annual fee amounts shall be established in accordance with this 
subsection. Annual amounts shall not exceed maximum amounts derived from 
the appropriate fee schedule (and Classification Factor, if applicable) 
unless approved in advance by the Procurement Executive, or designee. In 
no event shall any fee exceed statutory limits imposed by 41 U.S.C. 
254(b).
    (e)(1) Contracting Officers shall include negative fee incentives in 
contracts when appropriate. A negative fee incentive is one in which the 
contractor will not be paid the full target fee amount when the actual 
performance level falls below the target level established in the 
contract.
    (2) Negative fee incentives may only be used when:
    (i) A target level of performance can be established, which the 
contractor can reasonably be expected to reach;
    (ii) The value of the negative incentive is commensurate with the 
lower level of performance and any additional administrative costs;
    (iii) Factors likely to prevent attainment of the target level of 
performance are clearly within the control of the contractor; and
    (iv) The contract indicates clearly a level below which performance 
is not acceptable.
    (f) Prior to the issuance of a competitive solicitation or the 
initiation of negotiations for an extension of an existing contract, the 
HCA shall coordinate the maximum available fee, as allowed by 48 CFR 
970.1504-1-1, and the fee amount targeted for negotiation, if less, with 
the Procurement Executive, or designee. Solicitations shall identify 
maximum available fee under the contract and may invite offerors to 
propose fee less than the maximum available.
    (g) When a contract subject to this subsection requires a contractor 
to use its own facilities or equipment, or other resources to make its 
own cost investment for contract performance, (e.g., when there is no 
letter-of-credit financing) consideration may be given, subject to 
approval by the Procurement Executive, or designee, to increasing the 
total available fee amount above that otherwise provided by this 
subsection.
    (h) Multiple fee arrangements should be used in accordance with 48 
CFR 970.1504-1-4.

[[Page 408]]


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-1-3  Special considerations: Laboratory management and 
          operation.

    (a) For the management and operation of a laboratory, the 
contracting officer shall consider whether any fee is appropriate. 
Considerations should include:
    (1) The nature and extent of financial or other liability or risk 
assumed or to be assumed under the contract;
    (2) The proportion of retained earnings (as established under 
generally accepted accounting methods) that are utilized to fund the 
performance of work related to the DOE contracted effort;
    (3) Facilities capital or capital equipment acquisition plans;
    (4) Other funding needs, to include contingency funding, working 
capital funding, and provision for funding unreimbursed costs deemed 
ordinary and necessary;
    (5) The utility of fee as a performance incentive; and
    (6) The need for fee to attract qualified contractors, 
organizations, and institutions.
    (b) In the event fee is considered appropriate, the contracting 
officer shall determine the amount of fee in accordance with this 
subsection.
    (1) Costs incurred in the operation of a laboratory that are 
allowable and allocable under the cost principles (i.e., commercial 
using 48 CFR 31.2, nonprofit using OMB Circular A-122, or university-
affiliated using OMB Circular A-21), regulations (including 48 CFR 
970.31), or statutes applicable to the operating contractor should be 
classified as direct or indirect (overhead or G&A) charges to the 
contract and not included as proposed fee. Exceptions must be approved 
by the Procurement Executive, or designee.
    (2) Except as specified in 48 CFR 970.1504-1-3(c)(3), the maximum 
total amount of fee shall be calculated in accordance with 48 CFR 
970.1504-1-5 or 48 CFR 970.1504-1-9, as appropriate. The total amount of 
fee under any laboratory management and operating contract or other 
designated contract shall not exceed, and may be significantly less 
than, the result of that calculation. In determining the total amount of 
fee, the contracting officer shall consider the evaluation of the 
factors in paragraph (a) of this subsection as well as any benefits the 
laboratory operator will receive due to its tax status.
    (c) In the event fee is considered appropriate, the contracting 
officer shall establish the type of fee arrangement in accordance with 
this subsection.
    (1) The amount of fee may be established as total available fee with 
a base fee portion and a performance fee portion. Base fee, if any, 
shall be an amount in recognition of the risk of financial liability 
assumed by the contractor and shall not exceed the cost risk associated 
with those liabilities or the amount calculated in accordance with 48 
CFR 970.1504-1-5, whichever is less. The total available fee, excepting 
any base fee, shall normally be associated with performance at or above 
the target level of performance as defined by the contract. If 
performance in either of the two general work categories appropriate for 
laboratories (science/technology and support) is rated at less than the 
target level of performance, the total amount of the available fee shall 
be subject to downward adjustment. Such downward adjustment shall be 
subject to the terms of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5215-3, Conditional 
Payment of Fee, Profit, or Incentives, if contained in the contract.
    (2) The amount of fee may be established as a fixed fee in 
recognition of the risk of financial liability to be assumed by the 
contractor, with such fixed fee amount not exceeding the cost risk 
associated with the liabilities assumed or the amount of fee calculated 
in accordance with 48 CFR 970.1504-1-5, whichever is less.
    (3) If the fixed fee or total available fee exceeds 75% of the fee 
that would be calculated per 48 CFR 970.1504-1-5 or 48 CFR 970.1504-1-9; 
or if a fee arrangement other than one of those set forth in paragraphs 
(c) (1) or (2) of this subsection is considered appropriate, the 
approval of the Procurement Executive, or designee, shall be obtained 
prior to its use.
    (4) Fee, if any, as well as the type of fee arrangement, will 
normally be established for the life of the contract. It will be 
established at time of award, as part of the extend/compete decision, at

[[Page 409]]

the time of option exercise, or at such other time as the parties can 
mutually reach agreement, e.g., negotiations. Such agreement shall 
require the approval of the Procurement Executive, or designee.
    (5) Fee established for longer than one year shall be subject to 
adjustment in the event of a significant change (greater than +/-10% or 
a lessor amount if appropriate) to the budget or work scope.
    (6) Retained earnings (reserves) shall be identified and a plan for 
their use and disposition developed.
    (7) The use of retained earnings as a result of performance of 
laboratory management and operation may be restricted if the operator is 
an educational institution.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-1-4  Types of contracts and fee arrangements.

    (a) Contract types and fee arrangements suitable for management and 
operating contracts may include cost, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-
award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, firm-fixed-
price or any combination thereof (see 48 CFR 16.1). In accordance with 
48 CFR 970.1504-1-2(b)(1), the fee arrangement chosen for each work 
element should reflect the financial risk for project failure that 
contractors are willing to accept. Contracting officials shall structure 
each contract and the elements of the work in such a manner that the 
risk is manageable and, therefore, assumable by the contractor.
    (b) Consistent with the concept of a performance-based management 
contract, those contract types which incentivize performance and cost 
control are preferred over a cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangement. 
Accordingly, a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract in instances other than 
those set forth in 48 CFR 970.1504-1-3(c)(2) may only be used when 
approved in advance by the Procurement Executive, or designee.
    (c) A cost-plus-award-fee contract is generally the appropriate 
contract type for a management and operating contract.
    (1) Where work cannot be adequately defined to the point that a 
fixed price contract is acceptable, the attainment of acquisition 
objectives generally will be enhanced by using a cost-plus-award-fee 
contract or other incentive fee arrangement to effectively motivate the 
contractor to superior performance and to provide the Department with 
flexibility to evaluate actual performance and the conditions under 
which it was achieved.
    (2) The construct of fee for a cost-plus-award-fee management and 
operating contract is that total available fee will equal a base fee 
amount and a performance fee amount. The total available fee amount 
including the performance fee amount the contractor may earn, in whole 
or in part during performance, shall be established annually (or as 
otherwise agreed to by the parties and approved by the Procurement 
Executive, or designee), in an amount sufficient to motivate performance 
excellence.
    (3) However, consistent with concepts of performance-based 
contracting, it is Departmental policy to place fee at risk based on 
performance. Accordingly, a base fee amount will be available only when 
approved in advance by the Procurement Executive, or designee, except as 
permitted in 48 CFR 970.1504-1-3(c)(1). Any base fee amount shall be 
fixed, expressed as a percent of the total available fee at inception of 
the contract, and shall not exceed that percent during the life of the 
contract.
    (4) The performance fee amount may consist of an objective fee 
component and a subjective fee component. Objective performance 
measures, when appropriately applied, provide greater incentives for 
superior performance than do subjective performance measures and should 
be used to the maximum extent appropriate. Subjective measures should be 
used when it is not feasible to devise effective predetermined objective 
measures applicable to cost, technical performance, or schedule for 
particular work elements.
    (d) Consistent with performance-based contracting concepts, 
performance objectives and measures related to performance fee should be 
as clearly defined as possible and, where feasible, expressed in terms 
of desired performance results or outcomes. Specific measures for 
determining performance achievement should be used. The contract should 
identify the amount and

[[Page 410]]

allocation of fee to each performance result or outcome.
    (e) Because the nature and complexity of the work performed under a 
management and operating contract may be varied, opportunities may exist 
to utilize multiple contract types and fee arrangements. Consistent with 
paragraph (a) of this subsection and 48 CFR 16.1, the contracting 
officer should apply that contract type or fee arrangement most 
appropriate to the work component. However, multiple contract types or 
fee arrangements:
    (1) Must conform to the requirements of 48 CFR part 915 and 48 CFR 
parts 15 and 16, and
    (2) Where appropriate to the type, must be supported by:
    (i) Negotiated costs subject to the requirements of the Truth in 
Negotiations Act,
    (ii) A pre-negotiation memorandum, and
    (iii) A plan describing how each contract type or fee arrangement 
will be administered.
    (f) Cost reduction incentives are addressed in the clause at 48 CFR 
970.5215-4, Cost Reduction. This clause provides for incentives for 
quantifiable cost reductions associated with contractor proposed changes 
to a design, process, or method that has an established cost, technical, 
and schedule baseline, is defined, and is subject to a formal control 
procedure. The clause is to be included in management and operating 
contracts as appropriate. Proposed changes must be: Initiated by the 
contractor, innovative, applied to a specific project or program, and 
not otherwise included in an incentive under the contract. Such cost 
reduction incentives do not constitute fee and are not subject to 
statutory or regulatory fee limitations; however, they are subject to 
all appropriate requirements set forth in this subpart.
    (g) Operations and field offices shall take the lead in developing 
and implementing the most appropriate pricing arrangement or cost 
reduction incentive for the requirements. Pricing arrangements which 
provide incentives for performance and cost control are preferred over 
those that do not. The operations and field offices are to ensure that 
the necessary resources and infrastructure exist within both the 
contractor's and government's organizations to prepare, evaluate, and 
administer the pricing arrangement or cost reduction incentive prior to 
its implementation.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-1-5  General considerations and techniques for determining 
          fixed fees.

    (a) The Department's fee policy recognizes that fee is remuneration 
to contractors for the entrepreneurial function of organizing and 
managing resources, the use of their resources (including capital 
resources), and, as appropriate, their assumption of the risk that some 
incurred costs (operating and capital) may not be reimbursed.
    (b) Use of a purely cost-based structured approach for determining 
fee objectives and amounts for DOE management and operating contracts is 
inappropriate considering the limited level of contractor cost, capital 
goods, and operating capital outlays for performance of such contracts. 
Instead of being solely cost-based, the desirable approach calls for a 
structure that allows evaluation of the following eight significant 
factors, as outlined in order of importance, and the assignment of 
appropriate fee values (subject to the limitations on fixed fee in 48 
CFR 970.1504-1-6):
    (1) The presence or absence of financial risk, including the type 
and terms of the contract;
    (2) The relative difficulty of work, including specific performance 
objectives, environment, safety and health concerns, and the technical 
and administrative knowledge, and skill necessary for work 
accomplishment and experience;
    (3) Management risk relating to performance, including:
    (i) Composite risk and complexity of principal work tasks required 
to do the job;
    (ii) Labor intensity of the job;
    (iii) Special control problems; and
    (iv) Advance planning, forecasting and other such requirements;
    (4) Degree and amount of contract work required to be performed by 
and with the contractor's own resources, as compared to the nature and 
degree of

[[Page 411]]

subcontracting and the relative complexity of subcontracted efforts, 
subcontractor management and integration;
    (5) Size and operation (number of locations, plants, differing 
operations, etc.);
    (6) Influence of alternative investment opportunities available to 
the contractor (i.e., the extent to which undertaking a task for the 
Government displaces a contractor's opportunity to make a profit with 
the same staff and equipment in some other field of activity);
    (7) Benefits which may accrue to the contractor from gaining 
experience and knowledge of how to do something, from establishing or 
enhancing a reputation, or from having the opportunity to hold or expand 
a staff whose loyalties are primarily to the contractor; and
    (8) Other special considerations, including support of Government 
programs such as those relating to small and minority business 
subcontracting, energy conservation, etc.
    (c) The total fee objective for a particular annual fixed fee 
negotiation is established by evaluating the factors in this subsection, 
assigning fee values to them, and totaling the resulting amounts 
(subject to limitations on total fixed fee in 48 CFR 970.1504-1-6).


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-1-6  Calculating fixed fee.

    (a) In recognition of the complexities of the fee determination 
process, and to assist in promoting a reasonable degree of consistency 
and uniformity in its application, the following fee schedules set forth 
the maximum amounts of fee that contracting activities are allowed to 
award for a particular fixed fee transaction calculated annually.
    (b) Fee schedules representing the maximum allowable annual fixed 
fee available under management and operating contracts have been 
established for the following management and operating contract efforts:
    (1) Production;
    (2) Research and Development; and
    (3) Environmental Management.
    (c) The schedules are:

Sec. 970.1504-1-7  Fee Base.

    (a) The fee base is an estimate of necessary allowable costs, with 
some exclusions. It is used in the fee schedules to determine the 
maximum annual fee for a fixed fee contract. That portion of the fee 
base that represents the cost of the Production, Research and 
Development, or Environmental Management work to be performed, shall be 
exclusive of the cost of source and special nuclear materials; estimated 
costs of land, buildings and facilities whether to be leased, purchased 
or constructed; depreciation of Government facilities; and any estimate 
of effort for which a separate fee is to be negotiated.
    (b) Such portion of the fee base, in addition to the adjustments in 
paragraph (a) of this subsection, shall exclude:
    (1) Any part of the estimated cost of capital equipment (other than 
special equipment) which the contractor procures by subcontract or other 
similar costs which is of such magnitude or nature as to distort the 
technical and management effort actually required of the contractor;
    (2) At least 20% of the estimated cost or price of subcontracts and 
other major contractor procurements;
    (3) Up to 100% of the estimated cost or price of subcontracts and 
other major contractor procurements if they are of a magnitude or nature 
as to distort the technical and management effort actually required of 
the contractor;
    (4) Special equipment as defined in 48 CFR 970.1504-1-8;
    (5) Estimated cost of Government-furnished property, services and 
equipment;
    (6) All estimates of costs not directly incurred by or reimbursed to 
the operating contractor;
    (7) Estimates of home office or corporate general and administrative 
expenses that shall be reimbursed through the contract;
    (8) Estimates of any independent research and development cost or 
bid and proposal expenses that may be approved under the contract;
    (9) Any cost of work funded with uncosted balances previously 
included in a fee base of this or any other contract performed by the 
contractor;

[[Page 413]]

    (10) Cost of rework attributable to the contractor; and
    (11) State taxes.
    (c) In calculating the annual fee amounts associated with the 
Production, Research and Development, or Environmental Management work 
to be performed, the fee base is to be allocated to the category 
reflecting the work to be performed and the appropriate fee schedule 
utilized.
    (d) The portion of the fee base associated with the Production, 
Research and Development, or Environmental Management work to be 
performed and the associated schedules in this part are not intended to 
reflect the portion of the fee base or related compensation for unusual 
architect-engineer, construction services, or special equipment provided 
by the management and operating contractor. Architect-engineer and 
construction services are normally covered by special agreements based 
on the policies applying to architect-engineer or construction 
contracts. Fees paid for such services shall be calculated using the 
provisions of 48 CFR 91504-1-5 relating to architect-engineer or 
construction fees and shall be in addition to the operating fees 
calculated for the Production, Research and Development, or 
Environmental Management work to be performed. Special equipment 
purchases shall be addressed in accordance with the provisions of 48 CFR 
970.1504-1-8 relating to special equipment.
    (e) No schedule set forth in 48 CFR 915.404-4-71-5 or 48 CFR 
970.1504-1-6 shall be used more than once in the determination of the 
fee amount for an annual period, unless prior approval of the 
Procurement Executive, or designee, is obtained.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-1-8  Special equipment purchases.

    (a) Special equipment is sometimes procured in conjunction with 
management and operating contracts. When a contractor procures special 
equipment, the DOE negotiating official shall determine separate fees 
for the equipment which shall not exceed the maximum fee allowable as 
established using the schedule in 48 CFR 915.404-4-71-5(h).
    (b) In determining appropriate fees, factors such as complexity of 
equipment, ratio of procurement transactions to volume of equipment to 
be purchased and completeness of services should be considered. Where 
possible, the reasonableness of the fees should be checked by their 
relationship to actual costs of comparable procurement services.
    (c) For purposes of this subsection, special equipment is equipment 
for which the purchase price is of such a magnitude compared to the cost 
of installation as to distort the amount of technical direction and 
management effort required of the contractor. Special equipment is of a 
nature that requires less management attention. When a contractor 
procures special equipment, the DOE negotiating official shall determine 
separate fees for the equipment using the schedule in 48 CFR 915.404-4-
71-5(h). The determination of specific items of equipment in this 
category requires application of judgment and careful study of the 
circumstances involved in each project. This category of equipment would 
generally include:
    (1) Major items of prefabricated process or research equipment; and
    (2) Major items of preassembled equipment such as packaged boilers, 
generators, machine tools, and large electrical equipment. In some 
cases, it would also include special apparatus or devices such as 
reactor vessels and reactor charging machines.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-1-9  Special considerations: Cost-plus-award-fee.

    (a) When a management and operating contract is to be awarded on a 
cost-plus-award-fee basis, several special considerations are 
appropriate.
    (b) All annual performance incentives identified under these 
contracts are funded from the annual total available fee, which consists 
of a base fee amount (which may be zero) and a performance fee amount 
(which typically will consist of an incentive fee component for 
objective performance requirements, an award fee component for 
subjective performance requirements, or both).
    (c) The annual total available fee for the contract shall equal the 
product of

[[Page 414]]

the fee(s) that would have been calculated for an annual fixed fee 
contract and the classification factor(s) most appropriate for the 
facility/task. If more than one fee schedule is applicable to the 
contract, the annual total available fee shall be the sum of the 
available fees derived proportionately from each fee schedule; 
consideration of significant factors applicable to each fee schedule; 
and application of a Classification Factor(s) most appropriate for the 
work.
    (d) Classification Factors applied to each Facility/Task Category 
are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          Classification

laboratory, or
    (v) As designated by the Procurement Executive, or designee. 
(Classification factor 3.0)
    (2) Facility/Task Category B. The main focus of effort performed is 
related to:
    (i) The safeguarding and maintenance of nuclear weapons or nuclear 
material;
    (ii) The manufacture or assembly of nuclear components;
    (iii) The physical cleanup, processing, handling, or storage of 
nuclear radioactive or toxic chemicals, or other substances which pose a 
significant threat to the environment or the health and safety of 
workers or the public, if the nature of the work uses state of the art 
technologies or applications in such operations and/or the inherent 
difficulty or risk of the work is more demanding than that found in 
similar industrial/DOE settings (i.e., nuclear energy, chemical or 
petroleum processing, industrial environmental cleanup);
    (iv) The detailed planning necessary for the assembly/disassembly of 
nuclear weapons/components;
    (v) Construction of facilities involving operations requiring a high 
degree of design layout or process control;
    (vi) Research and development directly supporting paragraphs 
(e)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this subsection and not conducted 
in a laboratory; or
    (vii) As designated by the Procurement Executive, or designee. 
(Classification factor 2.5)
    (3) Facility/Task Category C. The main focus of effort performed is 
related to:
    (i) The physical cleanup, processing, or storage of nuclear 
radioactive or toxic chemicals if the nature of the work uses routine 
technologies in cleanup, processing or storage operations and/or the 
inherent difficulty or risk of the work is similar to that found in 
similar industrial/DOE settings (i.e., nuclear energy, chemical 
processing, industrial environmental cleanup);
    (ii) Plant and facility maintenance;
    (iii) Plant and facility security (other than the safeguarding of 
nuclear weapons and material);
    (iv) Construction of facilities involving operations requiring

laboratory; or
    (vi) As designated by the Procurement Executive, or designee. 
(Classification factor 2.0)
    (4) Facility/Task Category D. The main focus of the effort performed 
is research and development conducted at a laboratory. (Classification 
factor 1.25)
    (f) Where the Procurement Executive, or designee, has approved a 
base fee, the Classification Factors shall be reduced, as approved by 
the Procurement Executive, or designee.
    (g) Any risks which are indemnified by the Government (for example, 
by the Price-Anderson Act) will not be considered as risk to the 
contractor.
    (h) All management and operating contracts awarded on a cost-plus-
award-fee basis shall set forth in the contract, or the Performance 
Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) required by the contract clause at 48 
CFR 970.5215-1, Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee 
Amount, a site specific method of rating the contractor's performance of 
the contract requirements and a method of fee determination tied to the 
method of rating.
    (i) Prior approval of the Procurement Executive, or designee, is 
required for an annual total available fee amount exceeding the 
guidelines in paragraph (c) of this subsection.
    (j) DOE Operations/Field Office Managers must ensure that all 
important areas of contract performance are specified in the contract or 
Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s), even if such areas are 
not assigned specific weights or percentages of available fee.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-1-10  Special considerations: Fee limitations.

    In situations where the objective performance incentives are of 
unusual difficulty or where the successful completion of the performance 
incentives would provide extraordinary value to the Government, fees in 
excess of those allowed under 48 CFR 970.1504-1-5 and 48 CFR 970.1504-1-
9 may be allowed with the approval of the Procurement Executive, or 
designee. Requests to allow fees in excess of those provided under other 
provisions of this fee policy must be accompanied by a written 
justification with detailed supporting rationale as to how the specific 
circumstances satisfy the two criteria listed in this subsection.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-1-11  Documentation.

    The contracting officer shall tailor the documentation of the 
determination of fee prenegotiation objective based on 48 CFR 15.406-1, 
Prenegotiation objectives, and the determination of the negotiated fee 
in accordance with 48 CFR 15.406-3, Documenting the negotiation. The 
contracting officer shall include as part of the documentation: the 
rationale for the allocation of cost and the assignment of Facility/Task 
Categories; a discussion of the calculations described in 48 CFR 
970.1504-1-5; and discussion of any other relevant provision of this 
subsection.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-2  Price negotiation.

    (a) Management and operating contract prices (fee) and DOE 
obligations to support contract performance shall be governed by:
    (1) The level of activity authorized and the amount of funds 
appropriated for DOE approved programs by specific program legislation;
    (2) Congressional budget and reporting limitations;
    (3) The amount of funds apportioned to DOE;
    (4) The amount of obligational authority allotted to program 
officials and Approved Funding Program limitations; and
    (5) The amount of funds actually available to the DOE operating 
activity as determined in accordance with applicable financial 
regulations and directives.
    (b) Funds shall be obligated and made available by contract 
provision or modification after the funds become available for 
obligation for payment to support performance of DOE approved projects, 
tasks, work authorizations, or services.
    (c) Contractor expenditures shall be limited to the overall amount 
of funds available and obligated on the contract. As prescribed at 48 
CFR 970.3270(b), the clause at 48 CFR

[[Page 416]]

970.5232-4, Obligation of Funds, is used for this purpose.

Sec. 970.1504-3-1  Cost or pricing data.

    (a) The certification requirements of 48 CFR 15.406-2 are not 
applied to DOE cost-reimbursement management and operating contracts.
    (b) The contracting officer shall ensure that management and 
operating contractors and their subcontractors obtain cost or pricing 
data prior to the award of a negotiated subcontract or modification of a 
subcontract in accordance with 48 CFR 15.406-2, and incorporate 
appropriate contract provisions similar to those set forth at 48 CFR 
52.215-10 and 48 CFR 52.215-11 that provide for the reduction of a 
negotiated subcontract price by any significant amount that the 
subcontract price was increased because of the submission of defective 
cost or pricing data by a subcontractor at any tier.
    (c) The clauses at 48 CFR 52.215-12 and 48 CFR 52.215-13 shall be 
included in management and operating contracts.

<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-4-1  Make-or-buy plans.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-4-2  Policy.

    (a) Contracting officers shall require management and operating 
contractors to develop and implement make-or-buy plans that establish a 
preference for providing supplies or services (including construction 
and construction management) on a least-cost basis, subject to program 
specific make-or-buy criteria. The emphasis of this make-or-buy 
structure is to eliminate bias for in-house performance where an 
activity may be performed at less cost or otherwise more efficiently 
through subcontracting.
    (b) A work activity, supply or service is provided at ``least cost'' 
when, after consideration of a variety of appropriate programmatic, 
business, and financial factors, it is concluded that performance by 
either ``in-house'' resources or by contracting out is likely to provide 
the property or service at the lowest overall cost. Programmatic factors 
include, but are not limited to, program specific make-or-buy criteria 
established by the Department of Energy, the impact of a ``make'' or a 
``buy'' decision on mission accomplishment, and anticipated changes to 
the mission of the facility or site. Business factors pertain to such 
elements as market conditions, past experience in obtaining similar 
supplies or services, and overall operational efficiencies that might be 
available through either in-house performance or contracting out. Among 
the financial factors that may be considered to determine a least-cost 
alternative in a make-or-buy analysis are both recurring and one-time 
costs attributable to either retaining or contracting out a particular 
item, financial risk, and the anticipated contract price.
    (c) In developing and implementing its make-or-buy plan, a 
contractor shall be required to assess subcontracting opportunities and 
implement subcontracting decisions in accordance with the following:
    (1) The contractor shall conduct internal productivity improvement 
and cost-reduction programs so that in-house performance options can be 
made more efficient and cost-effective.
    (2) The contractor shall consider subcontracting opportunities with 
the maximum practicable regard for open communications with potentially 
affected employees and their representatives. Similarly, a contractor 
will communicate its plans, activities, cost-benefit analyses, and 
decisions with those stakeholders likely to be affected by such 
decisions, including representatives of the community and local 
businesses.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1504-4-3  Requirements.

    (a) Development of program-specific make-or-buy criteria.
    (1) Program specific make-or-buy criteria are those factors that 
reflect specific mission or program objectives (including operational 
efficiency, contractor diversity, environment, safety and health, work 
force displacement and restructuring, and collective bargaining 
agreements) and that, upon their application to a specific work effort, 
would override a decision based on

[[Page 417]]

a purely economic rationale. These criteria are to be used to assess 
each work effort identified in a facility's or site's make-or-buy plan 
to determine the appropriateness of a contractor's make-or-buy 
decisions.
    (2) Heads of Contracting Activities shall ensure that program 
specific make-or-buy criteria are developed and provided to the 
contractor for use in its make-or-buy plan administration activities for 
the facility, site, or specific program, as appropriate. Although the 
Head of the Contracting Activity has the responsibility for ensuring 
that the program-specific make-or-buy criteria are developed and 
provided to the contractor, the actual development of the program 
specific make or buy criteria should be accomplished by the appropriate 
collaboration of headquarters and field office program, technical, and 
business specialists. Accordingly, these organizations and individuals 
should be relied on for the development of the program specific make or 
buy criteria so that they appropriately reflect program considerations 
applicable to the contractor's make-or-buy decisions.
    (b) Make-or-buy plan property and services. Supplies or services 
estimated to cost less than one (1) percent of the estimated total 
operating cost for a year or $1 million for the same year, whichever is 
less, need not be included in the contractor's make-or-buy plan. 
However, adjustments may be made to these thresholds where programmatic 
or cost considerations would indicate that a particular supply or 
service should be included in the make-or-buy plan.
    (c) Competitive solicitation requirements.
    (1) To the extent practicable, a competitive solicitation for the 
management and operation of a Department of Energy facility or site 
should:
    (i) Identify those programs, projects, work areas, functions or 
services that the Department intends for the successful offeror to 
include in any make-or-buy plan; and
    (ii) Require the submission of a preliminary make-or-buy plan for 
the period of performance of the contract from each offeror as part of 
its proposal submitted in response to the competitive solicitation.
    (2) If the requirement for each offeror to submit a preliminary 
make-or-buy plan as part of its proposal is impractical or otherwise 
incompatible with the acquisition strategy, consideration should be 
given to structuring the evaluation criteria for the competitive 
solicitation in such a manner as to permit the evaluation of an 
offeror's approach to conducting its make-or-buy program within the 
context of the contractual requirements.
    (3) The successful offeror's preliminary make-or-buy plan shall be 
submitted for final approval within 180 days after contract award, 
consistent with the requirements of 48 CFR 970.5215-2(c), Make-or-Buy 
Plan.
    (d) Evaluation of the contractor's make-or-buy plan. In evaluating 
the contractor's make-or-buy plan, the contracting officer shall 
consider the following factors:
    (1) The program specific make-or-buy criteria (such as operational 
efficiency, contractor diversity, environment, safety and health, work 
force displacement and restructuring, and collective bargaining 
agreements) with particular attention to the effect of a ``buy'' 
decision on the contractor's ability to maintain core competencies 
needed to accomplish mission-related programs and projects;
    (2) The impact of a ``make'' or ``buy'' decision on contract cost, 
schedule, and performance and financial risk;
    (3) The potential impact of a ``make'' or ``buy'' decision on known 
future mission or program activities at the facility or site;
    (4) Past experience at the facility or site regarding ``make-or-
buy'' decisions for the same, or similar, supplies or services;
    (5) Consistency with the contractor's approved subcontracting plan, 
as required by the clause entitled ``Small, Small Disadvantaged and 
Women-Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan'' (48 CFR 52.219-9), and 
implementation of section 3021 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
    (6) Local market conditions, including contractor work force 
displacement and the availability of firms that can meet the work 
requirements with regard to quality, quantity, cost, and timeliness;

[[Page 418]]

    (7) Where the construction of new or additional facilities is 
required, that the cost of such facilities is in the Government's best 
interest when compared to subcontracting or privatization alternatives; 
and
    (8) Whether all relevant requirements and costs of performing the 
work by the contractor and through subcontracting are considered and any 
different requirements for the same work are reconciled.
    (e) Approval. The contracting officer shall approve all plans and 
revisions thereto. Once approved, a make-or-buy plan shall remain 
effective for the term of the contract (up to a period of five years), 
unless circumstances warrant a change.
    (f) Administration. The contractor's performance against the 
approved make-or-buy plan shall be monitored to ensure that:
    (1) The contractor is complying with the plan;
    (2) Items identified for deferral decisions are addressed in a 
timely manner; and
    (3) The contractor periodically updates the make-or-buy plan based 
on changed circumstances or significant new work.

Sec. 970.1706  Management and operating contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1706-1  Award, renewal, and extension.

    (a) Contract term. Effective work performance under a management and 
operating contract is facilitated by the use of a relatively long 
contract term of up to ten (10) years. Accordingly, management and 
operating contracts shall provide for a basic contract term not to 
exceed five (5) years and may include an option(s) to extend the term 
for additional periods; provided, that no one option period exceeds five 
(5) years in duration and the total term of

[[Page 419]]

the contract, including any options exercised, does not exceed ten (10) 
years. The specific term of the base period and of any options periods 
shall be determined at the time of the authorization to compete or 
extend the contract. The term ``option'' as used in this subpart means a 
unilateral right in the contract by which the Government can extend the 
term of the contract. Accordingly, except as may be provided for through 
the inclusion of an option(s) in the contract to extend the term, any 
extension to continue the contract with the incumbent contractor beyond 
its term shall only occur when such extension can be justified under one 
of the statutory authorities identified in 48 CFR 6.302 and when 
authorized by the Head of the Agency.
    (b) Exercise of option. As part of the review required by 48 CFR 
17.605(b), the contracting officer shall assess whether competing the 
contract will produce a more advantageous offer than exercising the 
option. The incumbent contractor's past performance under the contract, 
the extent to which performance-based management contract provisions are 
present, or can be negotiated into, the contract, and the impact of a 
change in a contractor on the Department's discharge of its programs are 
considerations that shall be addressed in the contracting officer's 
decision that the exercise of the option is in the Government's best 
interest. The contracting officer's decision shall be approved by the 
Procurement Executive and the cognizant Assistant Secretary(s).
    (c) Conditional Authorization of Non-competitive Extension Made 
Pursuant to Authority Under CICA. Authorization to extend a management 
and operating contract by the Head of the Agency shall be considered 
conditional upon the successful negotiation of the contract to be 
extended in accordance with the Department's negotiation objectives. The 
Head of the Contracting Activity shall advise the Procurement Executive 
no later than 6 months after receipt of the conditional authorization as 
to whether the Department's objectives will be met and, if not, the 
contracting activity's plans for competing the requirement.


<R05>
Sec. 970.1706-2  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 48 CFR 52.217-9, 
Option to Extend the Term of the Contract, in all management and 
operating contracts when the inclusion of an option is appropriate.

contracts, each management and operating contract shall include a 
subcontracting plan which is effective for the term of the contract. 
Goals for the contract shall be negotiated annually when revised funding 
levels are determined. The plan should include provisions for revising 
the goals or any other sections of the plan. Such revisions shall be in 
writing, approved by the contracting officer, and shall be specifically 
made a material part of the contract.

<R05>
Sec. 970.2201-1-2  Policies.

    (a) The extent of Government ownership of the nation's energy plant 
and materials, and the overriding concerns of national defense and 
security, impose special conditions on personnel and labor relations in 
the energy program. Such special conditions include the need for 
continuity of vital operations at DOE installations; retention by DOE of 
absolute authority on all questions of security; and DOE review of labor 
expenses under management and operating contracts as a part of its 
responsibility for assuring judicious expenditure of public funds. It is 
the intent of DOE that personnel and labor policies throughout the 
energy program reflect the best experience of American industry in 
aiming to achieve the type of stable labor-management relations that are 
essential to the proper development of the energy program. The following 
enunciates the principles upon which the DOE policy is based:
    (1) Employment standards. (i) Management and operating contractors 
are expected to bring experienced, proven personnel from their private 
operations to staff key positions on the contract work and to recruit 
other well-qualified personnel as needed. Such personnel should be 
employed and treated during employment without discrimination by reason 
of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Contractors shall be 
required to take affirmative action to achieve these objectives.
    (ii) The job qualifications and suitability of prospective employees 
should be established by the contractor prior to employment by careful 
personnel investigations. Such personnel investigations should include, 
as appropriate: A credit check; verification of high school degree/
diploma or degree/diploma granted by an institution of higher learning 
within the last 5 years; contacts with listed personal references; 
contacts with listed employers for the past 3 years (excluding 
employment of less than 60 days duration, part-time employments, and 
craft/union employments); and local law enforcement checks when such 
checks are not prohibited by State or local law or regulation, and when 
the individual resides in the jurisdiction where the contractor is 
located. When a DOE access authorization (security clearance) will be 
required, the aforementioned preemployment checks must be conducted and 
the applicant's job qualifications and suitability must be established 
before a request is made to the DOE to process the applicant for access 
authorization. Evidence must be furnished to the DOE with the 
applicant's security forms that specify: The date each check was 
conducted, the entity contacted that provided information concerning the 
applicant, a synopsis of the information provided as a result of each 
contact, and a statement that all information available has been 
reviewed and favorably adjudicated in accordance with the contractor's 
personnel policies. When an applicant is being hired specifically for a 
position which requires a DOE access authorization, the applicant shall 
not be placed in that position prior to the access authorization being 
granted by the DOE unless an exception has been obtained from the Head 
of the Contracting Activity, or designee. If an applicant is placed in 
that position prior to access authorization being granted by the DOE, 
the applicant may not be afforded access to classified matter or special 
nuclear materials (in categories requiring access authorization) until 
the DOE notifies the employer that access authorization has been 
granted. Management and operating contractors and other contractors 
operating DOE facilities may include the requirements set forth in this 
subsection in subcontracts (appropriately modified to identify the 
parties) wherein subcontract employees will be required to hold DOE 
access authorization in order to perform on-site duties, such as 
protective force operations.
    (iii) Consistent with the policies set forth in this subpart, the 
contractor is responsible for maintaining satisfactory standards for 
employee qualifications, performance, conduct, and business ethics under 
its own personnel policies.
    (2) Security. On all matters of security at its facilities, DOE 
retains absolute authority and neither the regulations and policies 
pertaining to security, nor their administration, are matters for 
collective bargaining between

[[Page 421]]

the contractor's management and labor. Insofar as DOE security 
regulations affect the collective bargaining process, the security 
policies and regulations will be made known to both parties. To the 
fullest extent feasible, DOE will consult with representatives of the 
contractor's management and labor when formulating security regulations 
and policies that may affect the collective bargaining process.
    (3) Wages, salaries, and employee benefits. (i) Wages, salaries, and 
employee benefits shall be administered in a manner designated to adapt 
the normal practices and conditions of industry or institutions of 
higher education to the contract work, and to provide for appropriate 
review by DOE. Area practices, valid patterns, and well-established 
commercial or academic practices of the contractors, as appropriate, 
form the criteria for the establishment and adjustment of compensation 
schedules.
    (ii) The aspects of wages, hours, and working conditions which are 
the substance of collective bargaining in normal organized industries 
will be left to the orderly processes of negotiation and agreement 
between DOE contractor management and employee representatives with 
maximum possible freedom from Government interference.
    (4) Employee relations. The handling of employee relations on 
contract work, including such matters as the conduct and discipline of 
the work force and the handling of employee grievances, is part of the 
normal management responsibility of the contractor.
    (5) Collective bargaining. (i) DOE review of collective bargaining 
practices will be premised on the view that management's trusteeship for 
the operation of the Government facilities includes the duty to adopt 
practices which are fundamental to the friendly adjustment of disputes, 
and which experience has shown, promote orderly collective bargaining 
relationships. Practices inconsistent with this view may be objected to 
if not found to be otherwise clearly warranted.
    (ii) Consistent with the policy of assuring continuity of operation 
of vital facilities, all collective bargaining agreements at DOE-owned 
facilities should provide that grievances and disputes involving the 
interpretation or application of the agreement will be settled without 
resorting to strike, lockout, or other interruption of normal 
operations. For this purpose, each collective bargaining agreement 
entered into during the period of performance of this contract should 
provide an effective grievance procedure with arbitration as its final 
step, unless the parties mutually agree upon some other method of 
assuring continuity of operation for the term of the collective 
bargaining agreement.
    (iii) DOE expects its management and operating contractors and the 
unions representing the contractor's employees to cooperate fully with 
the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
    (6) Personnel training. DOE encourages and supports personnel 
training programs aimed at improving work efficiency or developing 
needed skills which are not otherwise obtainable.
    (7) Working conditions. Accident, fire, health, and occupational 
hazards associated with DOE activities will be held to a practical 
minimum level and controlled in the interest of maintenance of health 
and prevention of accidents. Subject to DOE control, contractors shall 
be required to maintain comprehensive continuous preventive and 
protective programs appropriate to the particular activities throughout 
all operations. Appropriate financial protection in case of occupational 
disability must be provided to employees on DOE projects.
    (b) Title to payroll and associated records under certain contracts 
for the management and operation of DOE facilities, and for necessary 
miscellaneous construction incidental to the function of these 
facilities, shall vest in the Government. Such records are to be 
disposed of in accordance with DOE directions. For such contracts, the 
Solicitor of Labor has granted a tolerance from the Department of Labor 
Regulations to omit from the prescribed labor clauses the requirement 
for the retention of payrolls and associated records

[[Page 422]]

for a period of three years after completion of the contract. Under this 
tolerance, the records retention requirements for all labor clauses in 
the contract and the Fair Labor Standards Act are satisfied by disposal 
of such records in accordance with applicable DOE directives.

Sec. 970.2204-1-1  Administrative controls and criteria for application 
          of the Davis-Bacon Act in operational or maintenance 
          activities.

    (a) Particular work items falling within one or more of the 
following criteria normally will be classified as noncovered by the 
Davis-Bacon Act, hereinafter referred to in this section as the ``Act.''
    (1) Individual work items estimated to cost $2,000 or less. The 
total dollar amount of the management and operating contract is not a 
factor to be considered and bears no relation to individual work items 
classified as construction, alteration and/or repair, including painting 
and decorating. However, no item of work, the cost of which is estimated 
to be in excess of $2,000, shall be artificially divided into portions 
less than $2,000 for the purpose of avoiding the application of the Act.
    (2) Work and services that are a part of operational and maintenance 
activities or which, being very closely and directly involved therewith, 
are more in the nature of operational activities than construction, 
alteration, and/or repair work. This includes work and services which 
would involve a material risk to continuity of operations, to life or 
property, or to DOE operating requirements, if performed by persons 
other than the contractor's regular production and maintenance forces. 
However, any decision that contracts or work items are noncovered for 
these reasons must be made by the Head of the Contracting Activity 
without power of delegation.
    (3) Assembly, modification, setup, installation, replacement, 
removal, rearrangement, connection, testing, adjustment, and calibration 
of machinery and equipment. However, it is noted that these activities 
are covered if they are part of, or would be a logical part of, the 
construction of a facility, or if construction-type work which is not 
``incidental'' to the overall effort is involved.
    (4) Experimental development of equipment, processes, or devices, 
including assembly, fitting, installation, testing, reworking, and 
disassembly. This refers to equipment, processes, and devices which are 
assembled for the purpose of conducting a test or experiment. The design 
may be only conceptual in character, and professional personnel who are 
responsible for the experiment participate in the assembly. Specifically 
excluded from the category of experimental development are buildings and 
building utility services, as distinguished from temporary connections 
thereto. Also specifically excluded from this category is equipment to 
be used for continuous testing (e.g., a machine to be continuously used 
for testing the tensile strength of structural members).
    (5) Experimental work in connection with peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. This refers to equipment, processes and devices which are 
assembled and/or set in place and interconnected for the

[[Page 423]]

purpose of conducting a test or experiment. The nature of the test or 
experiment is such that professional personnel who are responsible for 
the test or experiment and/or data to be derived therefrom must, by 
necessity, participate in the assembly and interconnections. 
Specifically excluded from experimental work are buildings, building 
utility services, structural changes, drilling, tunneling, excavation, 
and back-filling work which can be performed according to customary 
drawings and specifications, and utility services of modifications to 
utility services, as distinguished from temporary connections thereto. 
Work in this category may be performed in mines or in other locations 
specifically constructed for tests or experiments.
    (6) Emergency work to combat the effects of fire, flood, earthquake, 
equipment failure, accident, or other casualties, and to restart the 
operational activity following the casualty. Work which is not directly 
related to restarting the activity or which involves rebuilding or 
replacement of a structure, structural components, or equipment is 
excluded from this category.
    (7) Decontamination, including washing, scrubbing, and scraping to 
remove contamination; removal of contaminated soil or other material; 
and painting or other resurfacing, provided that such painting or 
resurfacing is an integral part of the decontamination activity and 
performed by the employees of the contractors performing the 
decontamination.
    (8) Burial of contaminated soil waste or contained liquid; however, 
initial preparatory work readying the burial ground for use (e.g., any 
grading or excavating that is a part of initial site preparation, 
fencing, drilling wells for continued monitoring of contamination, 
construction of guard or other office space) is covered. Work performed 
subsequent to burial which involves the placement of concrete or other 
like activity is also covered.
    (b) The classification of a contract as a contract for operational 
or maintenance activities does not necessarily mean that all work and 
activities at the contract location are classifiable as outside coverage 
of the Act since it may be necessary to separate work which should be 
classified as covered. Therefore, the Heads of Contracting Activities 
shall establish and maintain controls for the careful scrutiny of 
proposed work assignments under such contracts to assure that:
    (1) Contractors whose contracts do not contemplate the performance 
of work covered by the Act with the contractor's own forces are neither 
asked nor authorized to perform work within the scope of the Act. If the 
actual work assignments do involve covered work, the contract should be 
modified to include applicable provisions of the Act.
    (2) Where covered work is performed by a contractor whose contract 
contains provisions required by the Act, such work is performed as 
required by law and the contract. After the contractor has been 
informed, as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this subsection, that 
certain work is covered, the responsibilities of the Head of the 
Contracting Activity to assure compliance is the same as it would be if 
the work were being performed under a separate construction contract.
    (3) Controls provided for above include consideration by the Head of 
the Contracting Activity and the contractor, before work is begun or 
contracted out, of the relation of the Act to the annual programming of 
work; the contractor's work orders; and work contracted out in excess of 
$2,000. The Head of the Contracting Activity may, if consistent with 
DOE's responsibilities as described in this subsection, prescribe from 
time to time classes of work as to which applicability or 
nonapplicability of the Act is clear, for which the Head of the 
Contracting Activity will require no further DOE determination on 
coverage in advance of the work. For all work, controls to be 
established by the Head of the Contracting Activity should provide for 
notification to the contractor before work is begun as to whether such 
work is covered. The Head of the Contracting Activity is responsible for 
submitting to the Wage and Hours Division, Employment Standards 
Administration, Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. 20210, all DOE 
requests for project area or installation wage determinations, or 
individual determinations, or extensions or modification thereto. 
Requests

[[Page 424]]

for such determinations shall be made on Standard Form 308, at least 30 
calendar days before they are required for use in advertising for bids 
or requests for proposals.
    (c) Experimental installations. Within DOE programs, a variety of 
experiments are conducted involving materials, fuels, coolants, and 
processing equipment. Certain types of situations where tests and 
experiments have presented coverage questions are described as follows:
    (1) Set-ups of device and/or processes. The proving out of 
investigative findings and theories of a scientific and technical nature 
may require the set-up of various devices and/or processes at an early, 
pre-prototype stage of development. These may range from laboratory 
bench size to much larger set-ups. As a rule, these set-ups are made 
within established facilities (normally laboratories), required utility 
connections are made to services provided as a part of the basic 
facilities, and the activity as a whole falls within the functional 
purpose of the facility. Such set-ups are generally not covered. 
However, the erection of structures which are public works is covered if 
construction type work, other than incidental work, is involved. 
Preparatory work for the set-up requiring structural changes or 
modifications of basic utility services, as distinguished from 
connections thereto, is covered. The following are illustrations of 
noncovered set-ups of devices and/or processes:
    (i) Assembly of piping and equipment within existing ``hot cell'' 
facilities for proving out a conceptual design of a chemical processing 
unit;
    (ii) Assembly of equipment, including adaptation and modification 
thereof, in existing ``hot cell'' facilities to prove out a conceptual 
design for remotely controlled machining equipment;
    (iii) Assembly of the first graphite pile in a stadium at Stagg 
Field in Chicago;
    (iv) Assembly of materials and equipment for particular aspects of 
the direct current thermonuclear experiments to explore feasibility and 
to study other ramifications of the concept of high energy injection and 
to collect data thereon.
    (2) Loops. Many experiments are carried on in equipment assemblies, 
called loops, in which liquids or gases are circulated under monitored 
and controlled conditions. For purposes of determining coverage under 
the Act, loops may be classed as loop facilities or as loop set-ups. 
Both of these classes of loops can include in-reactor loops and out-of-
reactor loops. In differentiating between clearly identified loop set-
ups and loop facilities, an area exists in which there have been some 
questions of coverage, such as certain loops at the Material Test 
Reactor and at Engineering Test Reactor and the Idaho National 
Engineering and Environmental Laboratory site. Upon clarification of 
this area, further illustrations will be added. In the meantime, the 
differentiation between loop set-ups and loop facilities must be made on 
a case-by-case basis, taking into account the total criteria set forth 
in this subpart.
    (i) Loop set-ups. The assembly, erection, modification, and 
disassembly of a loop set-up is noncovered. A noncontroversial example 
of a loop set-up is one which is assembled in a laboratory, e.g., Oak 
Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory, or Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory, for a particular test and thereafter 
disassembled. However, preparatory work for a loop set-up requiring 
structural changes or modifications of basic utility services as 
distinguished from connections thereto is covered, as are material and 
equipment that are installed for a loop set-up which is a permanent part 
of the facility or which is use for a succession of experimental 
programs.
    (ii) Loop facilities. A loop facility differs from a loop set-up in 
that it is of a more permanent character. It is usually, but not always, 
of greater size. It normally involves the building or modification of a 
structure. Sometimes it is installed as a part of construction of the 
facility. It may be designed for use in a succession of experimental 
programs over a longer period of time. Examples of loop facilities are 
the in-reactor ``K'' loops at Hanford and the large Aircraft Nuclear 
Propulsion loop at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental 
Laboratory site. The

[[Page 425]]

on-site assembly and erection of such loop facilities are covered. 
However, once a loop facility is completed and becomes operational, the 
criteria set forth in this paragraph for operational and maintenance 
activities apply.
    (3) Reactor component experiments. Other experiments are carried on 
by insertion of experimental components within reactor systems without 
the use of a loop assembly. An example of reactor facilities erected for 
such experimental purposes are the special power excursion test reactors 
(SPETRs) at the National Reactor Test Site which are designed for 
studying reactor behavior and performance characteristics of certain 
reactor components. Such a facility may consist of a reactor vessel, 
pressurizing tank, coolant loops, pumps, heat exchangers, and other 
auxiliary equipment as needed. The facility also may include sufficient 
shielding to permit work on the reactor to proceed following a short 
period of power interruption, and buildings as needed to house the 
reactor and its auxiliary equipment. The erection and on-site assembly 
of such a reactor facility is covered, but the components whose 
characteristics are under study are excluded from coverage. To 
illustrate, one of the SPETRs planned for studies of nuclear reactor 
safety is designed to accommodate various internal fuel and control 
assemblies. The internal structure of the pressure vessel is designed so 
that cores of different shapes and sizes may be placed in the vessel for 
investigation, or the entire internal structure may be easily removed 
and replaced by a structure which will accept a different core design. 
Similarly, the control rod assembly is arranged to provide for 
flexibility in the removal of instrument leads and experimental 
assemblies from within the core.
    (4) Tests or experiments in peaceful uses of nuclear energy. These 
tests or experiments are varied in nature and some are only in a 
planning stage. They consist of one or more nuclear or nonnuclear 
detonations for the purposes of acquiring data. The data can include 
seismic effects, radiation effects, amount of heat generated, amount of 
material moved and so forth. Some of these tests are conducted in 
existing mines, while others are conducted in facilities specifically 
constructed for the tests or experiments. In general, all work which can 
be performed in accordance with customary drawings and specifications, 
as well as other work in connection with preparation of facilities is 
treated as covered work. Such work includes tunneling, drilling, 
excavation and back-filling, erection of buildings or other structures, 
and installation of utilities. The installation of the nonnuclear 
material or nuclear device to be detonated, and the instrumentation and 
connection between such material or device and the instrumentation are 
treated as noncovered work.
    (5) Tests or experiments in military uses of nuclear energy. As in 
970.2204-1-1(c)(4), these tests or experiments can be varied in nature. 
However, under this category it is intended to include only detonation 
of nonnuclear material or nuclear devices. The material or devices can 
be detonated either underground, at ground level, or above the ground. 
These tests or experiments have been conducted in, on, or in connection 
with facilities specifically constructed for such tests or experiments. 
As in tests or experiments in peaceful uses of nuclear energy, all work 
which can be performed in accord with customary drawings and 
specifications, as well as other work in connection with preparation of 
facilities are treated as covered work. Such work includes building 
towers or similar structures, tunneling, drilling, excavation and 
backfilling, erection of buildings or other structures, and installation 
of utilities. The installation of the nonnuclear material or nuclear 
devices and instrumentation are treated as noncovered work.
    (d) Construction site contiguous to an established manufacturing 
facility. As DOE-owned property sometimes encompasses several thousand 
acres of real estate, a number of separate facilities may be located in 
areas contiguous to each other on the same property. These facilities 
may be built over a period of years, and established manufacturing 
activities may be regularly carried on at one site at the same time that 
construction of another facility is underway at another site. On 
occasion,

[[Page 426]]

the regular manufacturing activities of the operating contractor at the 
first site may include the manufacture, assembly, and reconditioning of 
components and equipment which in other industries would normally be 
done in established commercial plants. While the manufacture of 
components and equipment in the manufacturing plant is noncovered, the 
installation of any such manufactured items on a construction job is 
covered.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2208  Equal employment opportunity.

    The equal employment opportunity provisions of 48 CFR subpart 22.8 
and subpart 922.8 of this chapter, including Executive Order 11246 and 
41 CFR part 60, are applicable to DOE management and operating 
contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2210  Service Contract Act.

    The Service Contract Act of 1965 is not applicable to contracts for 
the management and operation of DOE facilities, but it is applicable to 
subcontracts under such contracts (see 48 CFR 970.5244-1).


<R05>
Sec. 970.2270  Unemployment compensation.

    (a) Each state has its own unemployment compensation system to 
provide payments to workers who become unemployed involuntarily and 
through no fault of their own. Funds are provided for unemployment 
compensation benefits through a payroll tax on employers. Most DOE 
contractors are subject to the unemployment compensation tax laws of the 
states in which they are located. It is the policy to assure, both in 
the negotiation and administration of cost-reimbursement type contracts, 
that economical and practical arrangements are made and practiced with 
respect to unemployment compensation.
    (b) Contract exempt from state laws. (1) Some contractors are exempt 
from state unemployment compensation laws, usually on grounds that they 
are nonprofit organizations or subdivisions of State governments. Most 
states, however, permit such employers to elect unemployment 
compensation coverage on a voluntary basis. Under such circumstances, 
all existing or prospective cost-reimbursement contractors shall be 
encouraged to provide unemployment compensation coverage or equivalent 
substitutes.
    (2) It is also DOE policy that, prior to the award or extension of a 
management and operating contract, exempt contractors or prospective 
contractors shall be required to submit to the contracting officer a 
statement that they will either elect coverage or provide equivalent 
substitutes for unemployment compensation, or in the alternative, submit 
evidence that it is impractical to do so. If any exempt contractor or 
prospective contractor submits that it is impractical to elect coverage 
or to provide an equivalent substitute, appropriate Office of Contract 
and Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement 
organization, staff shall review that position prior to recommending an 
award or extension of the contract. If there are substantial reasons for 
not electing coverage or for not providing equivalent substitutes, a 
contract may be awarded or extended. Headquarters' staff review and 
recommendation shall be based on such factors as:
    (i) The specific provisions of the unemployment compensation law of 
the State;
    (ii) The extent to which the establishment of special conditions on 
DOE work may have an adverse effect on the contractor's general policies 
and operating costs in its private operations;
    (iii) The numerical relationship between the contractor's private 
work force and its employees performing only work for DOE;
    (iv) The contractor's record with respect to work force stability 
and the general outlook with respect to future work force stability;
    (v) In a replacement contractor situation, whether or not the prior 
contractor had coverage or suitable substitutes; and
    (vi) The particular labor relations implications involved.

<R05>
Sec. 970.2703  Patent rights.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2703-1  Purposes of patent rights clauses.

    (a) DOE sites and facilities are managed and operated on behalf of 
the Department of Energy by a contractor, pursuant to management and 
operating contracts that are generally awarded for a five (5) year term, 
with the possibility for renewal. Special provisions relating to patent 
rights are appropriately incorporated into an M&O contract because of 
the unique circumstances and responsibilities of managing and operating 
a Government-owned facility, as compared to other federally funded 
research and development contracts.
    (b)(1) Technology transfer mission clause. In accordance with Public 
Law 101-189, section 3133(d), DOE may grant technology transfer 
authority to M&O contractors operating a DOE facility. Generally, M&O 
contractors have the right to elect to retain title to inventions made 
under the contract, whether a nonprofit or educational organizations, as 
a result of 35 U.S.C. 200 et seq. (Bayh-Dole Act), or a large business, 
as a result of a class patent waiver issued pursuant to 10 CFR part 784. 
Under such contracts, the M&O contractor assumes responsibilities for 
commercializing retained inventions, in accordance with the Technology 
Transfer Mission clause provided at 970.5227-3. That clause also governs 
such activities as the distribution of royalties earned from inventions 
made under the contract and the transfer of patent rights in inventions 
made under the contract to successor contractors.
    (2) If the M&O contractor is a nonprofit organization or small 
business firm having technology transfer authority, the following 
clauses are inserted into the M&O contract: 970.5227-3 and 970.5227-10.
    (3) If the M&O contract has technology transfer as a mission and is 
to be performed by a for-profit, large business firm that has been 
granted an advance class waiver, the following clauses are inserted into 
the M&O contract: 970.5227-3 and 970.5227-12. The terms of the clause at 
970.5227-12 are subject to modification to conform to the terms of the 
class waiver.
    (4) If the M&O contract does not have a technology transfer mission 
and is to be performed by a for-profit, large business firm and does not 
have advance class waiver under 10 CFR part 784, the patent rights 
clause at 970.5227-11 is inserted into the M&O contract, and the 
Technology Transfer Mission clause is inapplicable.
    (5) If the contractor is an educational institution, a non-profit 
organization or a small business firm and is conducting privately funded 
technology transfer activities, involving the use of private funds to 
conduct licensing and marketing activities related to inventions made 
under the contract in accordance with the Bayh-Dole Act, DOE may modify 
the patent rights clause (970.5227-10) to address issues such as the 
disposition of royalties earned

[[Page 431]]

under the privately funded technology transfer program, the transfer of 
patent rights to a successor contractor, allowable cost restrictions 
concerning privately funded technology transfer activities, and the 
Government's freedom from any liability related to licensing under the 
contractor's privately funded technology transfer program.
    (c) Contracting officers must consult with DOE patent counsel 
assisting the contracting activity or the Assistant General Counsel for 
Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property for assistance in 
selecting for use in the solicitation, negotiating, or approving 
appropriate patent rights clauses for a M&O contract. It may be 
appropriate to include more than one patent rights clause in a 
solicitation if the successful contractor could, for instance, be either 
an educational or a large business. If a large business may be selected 
for performance of a contract that will include a technology transfer 
clause, the solicitation must include the clause at 970.5227-12 to 
reflect the waiver that will likely be granted. If the solicitation 
includes more than one patent clause, it must include an explanation of 
the circumstances under which the appropriate clause will be used. The 
final award must contain only one patent rights clause.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2703-2  Patent rights clause provisions for management and 
          operating contractors.

    (a) Allocation of Principal Rights: Bayh-Dole provisions. If the 
management and operating contractor is an educational institution or 
nonprofit organization, the patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-10 
must be inserted into the M&O contract. Such entities are beneficiaries 
of Bayh-Dole Act, including the paramount right of the contractor to 
elect to retain title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced 
to practice in performance of work under the contract, except in DOE-
exempted areas of technology or in operation of DOE facilities primarily 
dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons related programs.
    (b) Allocation of Principal Rights: Government title. (1) The patent 
rights clause provided at 970.5227-11 must be incorporated into the M&O 
contract if the contractor is a for-profit, large business firm and the 
contract does not have a technology transfer mission or if, without 
regard to the type of contractor, the contract is for the operation of a 
DOE facility primarily dedicated to naval nuclear propulsion or weapons 
related programs. That clause provides for DOE's statutory obligation to 
take title to inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice 
in the course of or under an M&O contract, and does not contemplate an 
advance class waiver of Government rights in inventions, or 
participation by the contractor in technology transfer activities.
    (2) While only in rare circumstances does a for-profit large 
business contractor whose contract contains no technology transfer 
mission receive rights in or title to inventions made under the 
contract, the contractor does have the right to request a license or 
foreign patent rights in inventions made under the contract, and may 
petition for a waiver of Government rights in identified inventions. The 
patent rights clause 970.5227-11 does not include many of the provisions 
of patent rights clauses 970.5227-10 and 970.5227-12, related to the 
filing of patent applications by the contractor, the granting of rights 
in inventions by the contractor to third parties (preference for United 
States industry), and conditions allowing the Government to grant 
licenses to third parties in inventions retained by the contractor 
(march-in rights). Any instrument granting rights in inventions made 
under a contract governed by patent rights clause 970.5227-11 must 
include these additional provisions within its terms and conditions.
    (c) Allocation of Principal Rights: Contractor right to elect title 
under an advance class waiver. If the M&O contractor is a for-profit, 
large business firm and the Government has granted an advance class 
waiver of Government rights in inventions made in the course of or under 
the M&O contract, under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 
(42 U.S.C. 2182) and the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Act of 1974 (42 
U.S.C. 5908(c)), the patent rights clause provided at 970.5227-12 must 
be inserted

[[Page 432]]

into the M&O contract, unless the terms and conditions of such an 
approved waiver alter or replace the patent rights clause provisions 
pursuant to 10 CFR part 784.
    (d) Extensions of time--DOE discretion. The patent rights clauses 
for M&O contracts require the contractor to take certain actions within 
prescribed time periods to comply with the contract and preserve its 
rights in inventions. The M&O contractor may request extensions of time 
in which to take such actions by submitting written justification to 
DOE, and DOE may grant the contractor's requests, on a case-by-case 
basis. If the time period expired due to negligence by the contractor, 
DOE may grant a request for an extension of time upon a showing by the 
contractor that corrective procedures are in place to avoid such 
negligence in the future. If a contractor is requesting an extension of 
time in which to elect to retain title to an invention, DOE may grant 
the request if the extension allows the contractor to conduct further 
experimentation, market research, or other analysis helpful to determine 
contractor interest in electing title to the invention, among other 
considerations. Generally, the extensions of time are for periods of 
between six (6) months to one (1) year.
    (e) Facilities license. These include the rights to make, use, 
transfer, or otherwise dispose of all articles, materials, products, or 
processes embodying inventions or discoveries used or embodied in the 
facility regardless of whether or not conceived or first actually 
reduced to practice under or in the course of such a contract. The 
patent rights clauses, 970.5227-10, 970.5227-11, 970.5227-12, each 
contain a provision granting the Government this facilities license.
    (f) Deletion of classified inventions provision. If DOE determines 
that the research, development, demonstration or production work to be 
performed during the course of a management and operating contract most 
probably will not involve classified subject matter or result in any 
inventions that require security classification, DOE patent counsel may 
advise the contracting officer to delete the patent rights clause 
provision entitled, ``Classified Inventions'' from the M&O contract.
    (g) Alternate 1--Weapons Related Research or Production. If DOE 
grants technology transfer authority to a DOE facility, pursuant to 
Public Law 101-189, section 3133(d), and the DOE owned facility is 
involved in weapons related research and development, or production, 
then Alternate 1 of the patent rights clauses must be inserted into the 
M&O contract. Alternate 1 defines weapons related subject inventions and 
restricts the contractor's rights with respect to such inventions.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2704  Rights in data.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2704-1  General.

    (a) Rights in data relating to the performance of the contract and 
to all facilities are significant in assuring continuity of the 
management and operation of DOE facilities. It is crucial in assuring 
DOE's continuing ability to perform its statutory missions that DOE 
obtain rights to all data produced or specifically used by its 
management and operating contractors and appropriate subcontractors. In 
order to obtain the necessary rights in technical data, DOE contracting 
officers shall assure that management and operating contracts contain 
either the Rights in Data clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data--
Facilities, or the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data--
Technology Transfer. Selection of the appropriate clause is dependent 
upon whether technology transfer is a mission of the management and 
operating contract pursuant to the National Competitiveness Technology 
Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711 et seq., as 
amended). If technology transfer is not a mission of the management and 
operating contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data--
Facilities, shall be used. In those instances in which technology 
transfer is a mission of the contract, the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, 
Rights in Data--Technology Transfer, shall be used.
    (b) Employees of the management and operating contractor may not be 
used to assist in the preparation of a proposal or bid for services 
which are

[[Page 433]]

similar or related to those being performed under the contract, which 
are to be performed by the contractor or its parent or affiliate 
organization for commercial customers unless the employee has been 
separated from work under the DOE contract for such period as the Head 
of the Contracting Activity or designee shall have directed.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2704-2  Procedures.

    (a) The clauses at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data-Facilities, and 
48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data--Technology Transfer, both provide 
generally for Government ownership and for unlimited rights in the 
Government for all data first produced in the performance of the 
contract and unlimited rights in data specifically used in the 
performance of the contract. Both clauses provide that, subject to 
patent, security, and other provisions of the contract, the contractor 
may use contract data for its private purposes. The contractor, under 
either clause, must treat any data furnished by DOE or acquired from 
other Government agencies or private entities in the performance of 
their contracts in accordance with any restrictive legends contained 
therein.
    (b) Since both clauses secure access to and, if requested, delivery 
of technical data used in the performance of the contract, there is 
generally no need to use the Additional Technical Data Requirements 
clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in the management and operating contract.
    (c)(1) Paragraph (d) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in 
Data--Facilities, and paragraph (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, 
Rights in Data--Technology Transfer, provide for the inclusion in 
subcontracts of the Rights in Technical Data--General clause at 48 CFR 
52.227-14, with Alternate V, and modified in accordance with DEAR 
927.409. Those clauses also provide for the inclusion in appropriate 
subcontracts Alternates II, III, and IV to the clause at 48 CFR 52.227-
14 with DOE's prior approval and the inclusion of the Additional 
Technical Data Requirements clause at 48 CFR 52.227-16 in all 
subcontracts for research, development, or demonstration and all other 
subcontracts having special requirements for the production or delivery 
of data. In subcontracts, including subcontracts for related support 
services, involving the design or operation of any plants or facilities 
or specially designed equipment for such plants or facilities that are 
managed or operated by the contractor under its contract with DOE, the 
management and operating contractor shall use the Rights in Data--
Facilities clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1.
    (2) Where, however, a subcontract is to be awarded by the management 
and operating contractor in connection with a program, as discussed at 
927.404-70, which provides statutory authority to protect from public 
disclosure, data first produced under contracts awarded pursuant to the 
program, contracting officers shall ensure that the management and 
operating contractor includes in that subcontract the rights in data 
clause provided by DOE Patent Counsel, consistent with any accompanying 
guidance.
    (3) Management and operating contractors and higher-tier 
subcontractors shall not use their power to award subcontracts as 
economic leverage to acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights 
data or restricted computer software for their private use, nor may they 
acquire rights in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted 
computer software except through the use of Alternate II or III to the 
clause at 48 CFR 52.227-14, respectively, without the prior approval of 
DOE Patent Counsel.
    (d)(1) Paragraphs (e) and (f) of the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, 
Rights in Data--Facilities, and paragraphs (g) and (h) of the clause at 
48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data--Technology Transfer, provide for the 
contractor's granting a nonexclusive license in any limited rights data 
and restricted computer software specifically used in performance of the 
contract.
    (2) In certain instances the objectives of DOE would be frustrated 
if the Government did not obtain, at the time of contracting, limited 
license rights on behalf of responsible third parties and the 
Government, and to limited rights data or restricted computer software 
or both necessary for the practice of subject inventions or data first 
produced or delivered in the performance of the

[[Page 434]]

contract. This situation may arise in the performance of management and 
operating contracts and contracts for the management or operation of a 
DOE facility or site. Contracting officers should consult with program 
officials and Patent Counsel. No such rights should be obtained from a 
small business or non-profit organization, unless similar rights in 
background inventions of the small business or non-profit organization 
have been authorized in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(f). Where such a 
background license is in DOE's interest, a provision that provides 
substantially as Alternate VI at 48 CFR 952.227-14 should be added to 
the appropriate clause, 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in Data--Facilities, 
or 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights in Data--Technology Transfer.
    (e) The Rights in Data--Technology Transfer clause at 48 CFR 
970.5227-2 differs from the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1, Rights in 
Data--Facilities, in the context of its more detailed treatment of 
copyright. In management and operating contracts that have technology 
transfer as a mission, the right to assert copyright in data first 
produced under the contract will be a valuable right, and 
commercialization of such data, including computer software, will assist 
the management and operating contractor in advancing the technology 
transfer mission of the contract. The clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, 
Rights in Data--Technology Transfer, provides for DOE approval of DOE's 
taking a limited copyright license for a period of five years, and, in 
certain rare cases, specified longer periods in order to contribute to 
commercialization of the data.
    (f) Contracting officers should consult with Patent Counsel to 
assure that requirements regarding royalties and conflicts of interest 
associated with asserting copyright in data first produced under the 
contract are appropriately addressed in the Technology Transfer Mission 
clause (48 CFR 970.5227-3) of the management and operating contract. 
Where it is not otherwise clear which DOE program funded the development 
of a computer software package, such as where the development was funded 
out of a contractor's overhead account, the DOE program which was the 
primary source of funding for the entire contract is deemed to have 
administrative responsibility. This issue may arise, among others, in 
the decision whether to grant the contractor permission to assert 
copyright. See paragraph (e) of the Rights in Data--Technology Transfer 
clause at 970.5227-2.
    (g) In management and operating contracts involving access to DOE-
owned Category C-24 restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, 
DOE has reserved the right to receive reasonable compensation for the 
use of its inventions and discoveries, including its related restricted 
data and technology. Alternate I to each clause shall be used where 
access to Category C-24 restricted data is contemplated in the 
performance of a contract.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2704-3  Contract clauses.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 48 CFR 
970.5227-1, Rights in Data--Facilities, in management and operating 
contracts which do not contain the clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-2, Rights 
in Data--Technology Transfer. The contracting officer shall include the 
clause with its Alternate I in contracts where access to Category C-24 
restricted data, as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, is to be provided to 
contractors.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5227-2, 
Rights in Data--Technology Transfer, in management and operating 
contracts which contain the clause at 970.5227-3, Technology Transfer 
Mission. The contracting officer shall include the clause with its 
Alternate I in contracts where access to Category C-24 restricted data, 
as set forth in 10 CFR part 725, is to be provided to contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2770  Technology Transfer.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2770-1  General.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for implementing the 
National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, Public Law 
101-189, (15 U.S.C. 3711 et seq., as amended). The Act requires that 
technology transfer be established as a mission of each Government-owned 
laboratory operated under contract by a non-Federal

[[Page 435]]

entity. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 
expanded the definition of ``laboratory'' to include weapon production 
facilities that are operated for national security purposes and are 
engaged in the production, maintenance, testing, or dismantlement of a 
nuclear weapon or its components.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2770-2  Policy.

    All new awards for or extensions of existing DOE laboratory or 
weapon production facility management and operating contracts shall have 
technology transfer, including authorization to award Cooperative 
Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), as a laboratory or 
facility mission under Section 11(a)(1) of the Stevenson-Wydler 
Technology Innovation Act of 1980, Public Law 96-480 (15 U.S.C. 3701 et 
seq., as amended). A management and operating contractor for a facility 
not deemed to be a laboratory or weapon production facility may be 
authorized on a case-by-case basis to support the DOE technology 
transfer mission including, but not limited to, participating in CRADAs 
awarded by DOE laboratories and weapon production facilities.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2770-3  Technology transfer and patent rights.

    The National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989 (NCTTA) 
established technology transfer as a mission for Government-owned, 
contractor-operated laboratories, including weapons production 
facilities, and authorizes those laboratories to negotiate and award 
cooperative research and development agreements with public and private 
entities for purposes of conducting research and development and 
transferring technology to the private sector. In implementing the 
NCTTA, DOE has negotiated technology transfer clauses with the 
contractors managing and operating its laboratories. Those technology 
transfer clauses must be read in concert with the patent rights clause 
required by this subpart. Thus, each management and operating contractor 
holds title to subject inventions for the benefit of the laboratory or 
facility being managed and operated by that contractor.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2770-4  Contract clause.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5227-3, 
Technology Transfer Mission, in each solicitation for a new or an 
extension of an existing laboratory or weapon production facility 
management and operating contract.
    (b) If the contractor is a nonprofit organization or small business 
eligible under 35 U.S.C. 200 et seq., to receive title to any inventions 
under the contract and proposes to fund at private expense the 
maintaining, licensing, and marketing of the inventions, the contracting 
officer shall use the basic clause with its Alternate I.
    (c) If the facility is operated for national security purposes and 
engaged in the production, maintenance, testing, or dismantlement of a 
nuclear weapon or its components, the contracting officer shall use the 
basic clause with its Alternate II.

                   Subpart 970.28_Bonds and Insurance


<R05>
Sec. 970.2803  Insurance.


<R05>
Sec. 970.2803-1  Workers' Compensation Insurance.

    (a) Policies and requirements. (1) Workers' compensation insurance 
protects employers against liability imposed by workers' compensation 
laws for injury or death to employees arising out of, or in the course 
of, their employment. This type of insurance is required by state laws 
unless employers have acceptable programs of self-insurance.
    (2) Special requirements. Certain workers' compensation laws contain 
provisions which result in limiting the protection afforded persons 
subject to such laws. The policy with respect to these limitations as 
they affect persons employed by management and operating contractors is 
set forth as follows:
    (i) Elective provisions. Some worker's compensation laws permit an 
employer to elect not to be subject to its provisions. It is DOE policy 
to require these contractors to be subject to workers' compensation laws 
in jurisdictions permitting election.
    (ii) Statutory immunity. Under the provisions of some workers' 
compensation

[[Page 436]]

laws, certain types of employers; e.g., nonprofit educational 
institutions, are relieved from liability. If a contractor has a 
statutory option to accept liability, it is DOE policy to require the 
contractor to do so.
    (iii) Limited medical benefits. Some workers' compensation laws 
limit the liability of the employer for medical care to a maximum dollar 
amount or to a specified period of time. In such cases, a contractor's 
workers' compensation insurance policy should contain a standard 
extrastatutory medical coverage endorsement.
    (iv) Limits on occupational disease coverage and employers' 
liability. Some workers' compensation laws do not provide coverage for 
all occupational diseases. In such situations, a contractor's workers' 
compensation insurance policy should contain voluntary coverage for all 
occupational diseases.
    (3) Contractor ``employees' benefit plan''--self-insurers. The 
policies and requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
apply where management and operating contractors purchase workers' 
compensation insurance. With respect to self-insured contractors, the 
objectives specified in paragraph (a)(2) also shall be met through 
primary or excess workers' compensation and employers' liability 
insurance policy(ies) or an approved combination thereof. ``Employees'' 
benefit plans'' which were established in prior years may be continued 
to contrast termination at existing benefit levels.
    (b) Assignment of responsibilities. (1) Office of Contract and 
Resource Management, within the Headquarters procurement organization, 
other officials, and the Heads of Contracting Activities, consistent 
with their delegations of responsibility, shall assure management and 
operating contracts are consistent with the policies and requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) In discharging assigned responsibility, the Heads of Contracting 
Activities shall:
    (i) Periodically review workers' compensation insurance programs of 
management and operating contractors in the light of applicable workers' 
compensation statutes to assure conformance with the requirements of 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (ii) Evaluate the adequacy of coverage of ``self-insured'' workers'' 
compensation programs;
    (iii) Provide arrangements for the administration of any existing 
``employees'' benefit plans until such plans'' are terminated; and
    (iv) Submit to the Office of Contract and Resource Management, 
within the Headquarters procurement organization, all proposals for the 
modification of existing ``employees' benefit plans.''
    (3) The Office of Contract and Resource Management, within the 
Headquarters procurement organization, is responsible for approving 
management and operating contractor ``employees' benefit plans.''


<R05>
Sec. 970.2803-2  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 48 CFR 970.5228-
1, Insurance--Litigation and Claims, in all management and operating 
contracts. Paragraphs (h)(3) and (j)(2) of that clause apply to a 
nonprofit contractor only to the extent specifically provided in the 
individual contract.

<R05>
Sec. 970.2902-1  Exemptions from Federal excise taxes.

    (a) The exemption respecting taxes on communication services or 
facilities has been held to extend to such services when furnished to 
DOE management and operating contractors who pay for such services or 
facilities from advances made to them by DOE under their contracts.
    (b) Where it is considered that a request for an additional 
exemption in the performance of a management and operating contract 
would be justified, a recommendation that such a request be made should 
be forwarded to the Chief Financial Officer, Headquarters.
    (c) Where tax exemption certificates are required in connection with 
the taxes cited in this section, the Head of the Contracting Activity 
will supply standard Government forms (SF 1094, U.S. Tax Exemption 
Certificate) on request.

    It is DOE policy to secure those immunities or exemptions from state 
and local taxes to which it is entitled under the Federal Constitution 
or state laws. In carrying out this policy, the Heads of Contracting 
Activities shall:
    (a) Take all necessary steps to preclude payment of any taxes for 
which any of the immunities or exemptions cited in this subpart are 
available. Advice of Counsel should be sought as to the availability of 
such immunities or exemptions;
    (b) Acquire directly and furnish to contractors as Government 
furnished property, equipment, material, or services when, in the 
opinion of the Head of the Contracting Activity:
    (1) Such direct acquisition will result in substantial savings to 
the Government, taking into consideration any additional administrative 
costs;
    (2) Such direct acquisition will not have a substantial adverse 
effect on the relationship between DOE and its contractor; and
    (3) Such direct acquisition will not have a substantial adverse 
effect on the DOE program or schedules.

<R05>
Sec. 970.3101-00-70  Scope of subpart.

    (a) The Procurement Executive is responsible for developing and 
revising the policy and procedures for the determination of allowable 
costs reimbursable under a management and operating contract, and for 
coordination with other Headquarters' offices having joint interests.
    (b) The Head of the Contracting Activity is responsible for 
following the policy, principles and standards set forth in this subpart 
in establishing the compensation and reimbursement provisions of 
contracts and subcontracts and for submission of deviations for 
Headquarters consideration and approval.


<R05>
Sec. 970.3101-9  Advance agreements (DOE coverage-paragraph (i)).

    (i) At any time, in accordance with the contract terms and 
conditions, the contracting officer may pursue an advance agreement in 
connection with any cost item under a contract.


<R05>
Sec. 970.3101-10  Cost certification.

    (a) Certain contracts require certification of the costs proposed 
for final payment purposes. Section 48 CFR 970.4207-03-02 states the 
administrative procedures for the certification provisions and the 
related contract clause prescription.
    (b) If unallowable costs are included in final cost settlement 
proposals, penalties may be assessed. Section 48 CFR 970.4207-03-02 
states the administrative

[[Page 438]]

procedures for penalty assessment provisions and the related clause 
prescription.


<R05>
Sec. 970.3102-3-70  Home office expenses.

    (a) For on-site work, DOE's fee for management and operating 
contracts, determined under the policy of and calculated per the 
procedures in 48 CFR 970.1504-1-3, generally provides adequate 
compensation for home or corporate office general and administrative 
expenses incurred in the general management of the contractor's business 
as a whole.
    (1) DOE recognizes that some Home Office Expenses are incurred for 
the benefit of a management and operating contract. DOE has elected to 
recognize that benefit through fee due to the difficulty of determining 
the dollar value applicable to any management and operating contract. 
The difficulty arises because:
    (i) The general construct of a management and operating contract 
results in minimal Home Office involvement in the contract work, and
    (ii) Conventional Home Office Expense allocation techniques that use 
bases such as total operating costs, labor dollars, hours etc., are not 
appropriate because they inherently assume significant contractor 
investment (in terms of its own resources, such as, labor, material, 
overhead, etc.). Contractor investments are minimal under DOE's 
operating and management contracts. The contracts are totally financed 
by DOE advance payments, and DOE provides government-owned facilities, 
property, and other needed resources.
    (2) From time to time, the fee for a management and operating 
contract may not be adequate compensation for Home Office Expenses 
incurred for the benefit of the contract. An indication that such a case 
exists is the need for significant home office support to deal with 
issues at the site that occur without the fault or negligence of the 
contractor, for example, the need for home office legal support to deal 
with third party, environmental, safety, or health issues.
    (3) In such a case, the contracting officer, after obtaining the 
HCA's approval, may consider a contractor request for additional 
compensation. The contractor may request:
    (i) Fee in addition to its normal fee (but see 48 CFR 970.1504-1-
3(b)(1) if the contract is for the management and operation of a 
laboratory); or
    (ii) Compensation on the basis of actual cost.
    (4) Because the contract's fee provides some compensation for Home 
Office Expenses, the contractor's request for additional compensation 
must always be for an amount less than the Home Office Expenses that are 
incurred for the benefit of the management and operating contract.
    (b) For off-site work, the DOE allows Home Office Expenses under 
architect-engineer, supply and research contracts with commercial 
contractors performing the work in their own facilities. Home Office 
Expenses may, however, be included for reimbursement under such DOE off-
site architect-engineer, supply and research contracts, only to the 
extent that they are determined, after careful examination, to be 
allowable, reasonable, and properly allocable to the work. Work 
performed in a contractor's own facilities under a management and 
operating or construction contract may likewise be allowed to bear the 
properly allocable portion of allowable Home Office Expenses.

<R05>
Sec. 970.3102-05-4  Bonding costs. (DOE coverage-paragraph (d))

    (d) The allowability of bonding costs shall be determined pursuant 
to 48 CFR 970.5228-1, Insurance-litigation and claims.


<R05>
Sec. 970.3102-05-6  Compensation for personal services. (DOE coverage-
          paragraphs (a) and (p))

    (a)(6) In determining the reasonableness of compensation, the 
compensation of each individual contractor employee normally need not be 
subjected to review and approval. Generally, the compensation paid 
individual employees should be left to the judgment of contractors 
subject to the limitations of DOE-approved compensation policies, 
programs, classification systems, and schedules, and amounts of money

[[Page 439]]

authorized for wage and salary increases for groups of employees. 
However, the contracting officer shall designate a compensation 
threshold appropriate for the particular situation. The contract shall 
specifically provide that contracting officer approval is required for 
compensating an individual contractor employee above the threshold if a 
total of 50 percent or more of such compensation is reimbursed under DOE 
cost-type contracts. For purposes of designating the threshold, total 
compensation includes only the employee's salary and cash bonus or 
incentive compensation.
    (7)(i) Reimbursable costs for compensation for personal services are 
to be set forth in a personnel appendix which is a part of the contract. 
This personnel appendix shall be negotiated using the principles and 
policies of 48 CFR 31.205-6, Compensation, as supplemented by this 
section, 970.3102-05-6, and other pertinent parts of the DEAR. Costs 
that are unallowable under other contract terms shall not be allowable 
as compensation for personnel services.
    (ii) The personnel appendix sets forth in detail personnel costs and 
related expenses allowable under the contract and documents personnel 
policies, practices and plans which have been found acceptable by the 
contracting officer. The contractor will advise DOE of any proposed 
changes in any matters covered by these policies, practices or plans 
which relate to personnel costs. The personnel appendix may be modified 
from time to time in writing by mutual agreement of the contractor and 
DOE without execution of an amendment to the contract. Such 
modifications shall be evidenced by execution of written numbered 
approval letters from the contracting officer or his representative. 
Types of personnel costs and related expenses addressed in the personnel 
appendix, or amendments thereto, are as follows: Salaries and wages; 
bonuses and incentive compensation; overtime, shift differential, 
holiday, and other premium pay for time worked; welfare benefits and 
retirement programs; paid time off, and salaries and wages to employees 
in their capacity as union stewards and committeemen for time spent in 
handling grievances, or serving on labor management (contractor) 
committees provided, however, that the contracting officer's approval is 
required in each instance of total compensation to an individual 
employee above an annual rate as specified in the personnel appendix.
    (p)(1) Notwithstanding the costs cited in this subsection, incurred 
for compensation of a senior executive in excess of the benchmark 
compensation amount determined applicable for the contractor fiscal year 
by the Administrator, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, are 
unallowable. Allowable costs of executive compensation shall be 
determined pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 31.205-6(p).

Sec. 970.3102-05-46  Travel costs.

    (a) Costs for transportation, lodging, meals, and incidental 
expenses.
    (1) Costs incurred by contractor personnel on official company 
business are allowable, subject to the limitations contained in this 
subsection. Costs for transportation may be based on mileage rates, 
actual costs incurred, or on a combination thereof, provided the method 
used results in a reasonable charge. Costs for lodging, meals, and 
incidental expenses may be based on per diem, actual expenses, or a 
combination thereof, provided the method used results in a reasonable 
charge.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection, costs 
incurred for lodging, meals, and incidental expenses (as defined in the 
regulations cited in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this 
subsection) shall be considered to be reasonable and allowable only to 
the extent that they do not exceed on a daily basis the maximum per diem 
rates in effect at the time of travel as set forth in the--
    (i) Federal Travel Regulation, prescribed by the General Services 
Administration (41 CFR chapters 300 through 304), for travel in the 
conterminous 48

prescribed by the Department of Defense, for travel in Alaska, Hawaii, 
The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and territories and possessions of the 
United States, available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent 
of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402,

    (iii) Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign 
Areas), section 925, ``Maximum Travel Per Diem Allowances for Foreign

covered in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this subsection, available 
on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. 
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock No. 744-008-
00000-0.
    (3) In special or unusual situations, actual costs in excess of the 
maximum per diem rates are allowable provided that such amounts do not 
exceed the higher amounts authorized for Federal civilian employees as 
permitted in the regulations referenced in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), 
or (iii) of this subsection. For such higher amounts to be allowable, 
all of the following conditions must be met:
    (i) One of the conditions warranting approval of the actual expense 
method, as set forth in the regulations referred to in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this subsection, must exist.
    (ii) A written justification for use of the higher amounts must be 
approved by an officer of the contractor's organization or designee to 
ensure that the authority is properly administered and controlled to 
prevent abuse.
    (iii) If it becomes necessary to exercise the authority to use the 
higher actual expense method repetitively or on a continuing basis in a 
particular area, the contractor must obtain advance approval from the 
contracting officer.
    (iv) Documentation to support actual costs incurred shall be in 
accordance with the contractor's established practices, subject to 
paragraph (a)(7) of this subsection, and provided that a receipt is 
required for each expenditure of $75.00 or more. The approved 
justification required by paragraph (a)(3)(ii) and, if applicable, 
paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this subsection must be retained.
    (4) Paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this subsection do not 
incorporate the regulations cited in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), and 
(iii) of this subsection in their entirety. Only the maximum per diem 
rates, the definitions of lodging, meals, and incidental expenses, and 
the regulatory coverage dealing with special or unusual situations are 
incorporated in this subsection.
    (5) An advance agreement (see 48 CFR 31.109 and 48 CFR 970.3101-9) 
with respect to compliance with paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this 
subsection may be useful and desirable.
    (6)(i) The maximum per diem rates referenced in paragraph (a)(2) of 
this subsection generally would not constitute a reasonable daily 
charge--
    (A) When no lodging costs are incurred; and/or
    (B) On partial travel days (e.g., day of departure and return).
    (ii) Appropriate downward adjustments from the maximum per diem 
rates would normally be required under these circumstances. While these 
adjustments need not be calculated in accordance with the Federal Travel 
Regulation or Joint Travel Regulations, they must result in a reasonable 
charge.
    (7) Costs shall be allowable only if the following information is 
documented:
    (i) Date and place (city, town, or other similar designation) of the 
expenses;
    (ii) Purpose of the trip; and
    (iii) Name of person on trip and that person's title or relationship 
to the contractor.
    (b) Travel costs incurred in the normal course of overall 
administration of the business are allowable and shall be treated as 
indirect costs.
    (c) Travel costs directly attributable to specific contract 
performance are allowable and may be charged to the contract under 48 
CFR 31.202.
    (d) Airfare costs in excess of the lowest customary standard, coach, 
or

[[Page 442]]

equivalent airfare offered during normal business hours are unallowable 
except when such accommodations require circuitous routing, require 
travel during unreasonable hours, excessively prolong travel, result in 
increased cost that would offset transportation savings, are not 
reasonably adequate for the physical or medical needs of the traveler, 
or are not reasonably available to meet mission requirements. However, 
in order for airfare costs in excess of the standard airfare to be 
allowable, the applicable condition(s) must be documented and justified.
    (e)(1) ``Cost of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered 
aircraft,'' as used in this paragraph, includes the cost of lease, 
charter, operation (including personnel), maintenance, depreciation, 
insurance, and other related costs.
    (2) The costs of travel by contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered 
aircraft are limited to the standard airfare described in paragraph (d) 
of this subsection for the flight destination unless travel by such 
aircraft is specifically required by contract specification, term, or 
condition, or a higher amount is approved by the contracting officer. A 
higher amount may be agreed to when one or more of the circumstances for 
justifying higher than standard airfare listed in paragraph (d) of this 
subsection are applicable, or when an advance agreement under paragraph 
(e)(3) of this subsection has been executed. In all cases, travel by 
contractor-owned, -leased, or -chartered aircraft must be fully 
documented and justified. For each contractor-owned, -leased, or -
chartered aircraft used for any business purpose which is charged or 
allocated, directly or indirectly, to a Government contract, the 
contractor must maintain and make available manifest/logs for all 
flights on such company aircraft. As a minimum, the manifest/log shall 
indicate--
    (i) Date, time, and points of departure;
    (ii) Destination, date, and time of arrival;
    (iii) Name of each passenger and relationship to the contractor;
    (iv) Authorization for trip; and
    (v) Purpose of trip.
    (3) Where an advance agreement is proposed (see 31.109), 
consideration may be given to the following:
    (i) Whether scheduled commercial airlines or other suitable, less 
costly, travel facilities are available at reasonable times, with 
reasonable frequency, and serve the required destinations conveniently;
    (ii) Whether increased flexibility in scheduling results in time 
savings and more effective use of personnel that would outweigh 
additional travel costs.
    (f) Costs of contractor-owned or -leased automobiles, as used in 
this paragraph, include the costs of lease, operation (including 
personnel), maintenance, depreciation, insurance, etc. These costs are 
allowable, if reasonable, to the extent that the automobiles are used 
for company business. That portion of the cost of company-furnished 
automobiles that relates to personal use by employees (including 
transportation to and from work) is compensation for personal services 
and is unallowable as stated in 48 CFR 31.205-6(m)(2).

                 Subpart 970.42_Contract Administration


<R05>
Sec. 970.4207-03-02  Certificate of costs.

    (a) The contracting officer shall require that management and 
operating contractors provide a submission, pursuant to 48 CFR 970.5232-
2-(j), for settlement of costs incurred during the period stipulated on 
the submission and a certification that the costs included in the 
submission are allowable. The contracting officer shall assess a penalty 
pursuant to 48 CFR 970.5242-1 if unallowable costs are included in the 
submission. Unallowable costs are either expressly unallowable or 
determined unallowable.
    (1) An expressly unallowable cost is a particular item or type of 
cost which, under the express provisions of an applicable law, 
regulation, or this contract, is specifically named and stated to be 
unallowable.
    (2) A cost determined unallowable is one which, for that contractor,
    (i) Was subject to a contracting officer's final decision and not 
appealed;
    (ii) The Department's Board of Contract Appeals or a court has 
previously ruled as unallowable; or
    (iii) was mutually agreed to be unallowable.
    (b) If, during the review of the submission, the contracting officer 
determines that the submission contains an expressly unallowable cost or 
a cost determined to be unallowable prior to the submission, the 
contracting officer shall assess a penalty.
    (c) If the contracting officer determines that a cost submitted by 
the contractor in its submission for settlement is:
    (1) Expressly unallowable, then the contracting officer shall assess 
a penalty in an amount equal to the disallowed cost allocated to the 
contract plus interest on the paid portion of the disallowed cost. 
Interest shall be computed from the date of overpayment to the date of 
repayment using the interest rate specified by the Secretary of the 
Treasury pursuant to Public Law 92-41 (85 Stat. 97).
    (2) Determined unallowable, then the contracting officer shall 
assess a penalty in an amount equal to two times the amount of the 
disallowed cost allocated to the contract.
    (d) The contracting officer may waive the penalty provisions when:
    (1) The contractor withdraws the submission before the formal 
initiation of an audit of the submission and submits a revised 
submission;
    (2) The amount of the unallowable costs allocated to covered 
contracts is $10,000 or less; or
    (3) The contractor demonstrates to the contracting officer's 
satisfaction that:
    (i) It has established appropriate policies, personnel training, and 
an internal control and review system that provides assurances that 
unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from the 
contractor's submission for settlement of costs; and
    (ii) The unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently 
incorporated into the submission.
    (e) The Head of the Contracting Activity may waive the certification 
when--
    (1) It determines that it would be in the best interest of the 
United States to waive such certification; and
    (2) It states in writing the reasons for that determination and

      Subpart 970.44_Management and Operating Contractor Purchasing


<R05>
Sec. 970.4400  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes policies and procedures concerning the 
purchasing systems and activities of management and operating 
contractors.


<R05>
Sec. 970.4401  Responsibilities.


<R05>
Sec. 970.4401-1  General.

    (a) In the Department of Energy, overall responsibility for the 
oversight of the performance of management and operating contractors, 
including their purchasing activities, rests with the cognizant DOE 
contracting activity and, in particular, the Head of the Contracting 
Activity (HCA). Contracting officers are responsible for the management 
and operating contractors' conformance with this subpart and the 
applicable terms and conditions of their contracts, and for determining 
whether those purchasing activities provide timely and effective support 
to DOE programs.
    (b) In carrying out their overall responsibilities, HCAs shall:
    (1) Require management and operating contractors to maintain written 
descriptions of their individual purchasing systems and methods and 
further require that, upon award or extension of the contract, the 
entire written description be submitted to the contracting officer for 
review and acceptance;
    (2) Require that any changes to the management and operating 
contractor's written description having any substantive impact upon the 
contractor's purchasing system and methods be submitted to the 
contracting officer for review and acceptance prior to issuance;
    (3) Ensure the review of individual purchasing actions of certain 
types, or above stated dollar levels, by the contracting officer 
pursuant to 48 CFR subpart 44.2 or as set forth in the contractor's 
approved system and methods; and
    (4) Ensure that periodic appraisals of the contractor's management 
of all facets of the purchasing function, including compliance with the 
contractor's approved system and methods, are performed by the 
contracting officer. Such appraisals shall be performed through either 
of the following methodologies:
    (i) Contractor Purchasing System Reviews, conducted in accordance 
with 48 CFR subpart 44.3; or
    (ii) When approved by the contracting officer, contractor 
participation in the conduct of the Balanced Scorecard performance 
measurement and performance management system.
    (c) In performing the reviews required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2), 
and the appraisals required by paragraph (b)(4) of this subsection, HCAs 
shall assure that contracting officers determine that the contractors' 
written systems and methods are consistent with this subpart and the 
applicable terms and conditions of their contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 970.4401-2  Review and approval.

    (a) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall establish 
thresholds, by subcontract type and dollar level, for the review and 
approval of proposed

[[Page 448]]

subcontracting actions by each management and operating contractor under 
their cognizance. Such thresholds may not exceed the authority delegated 
to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior Procurement 
Executive. In establishing these thresholds, the Heads of the 
Contracting Activities should consider such factors as the following:
    (1) The nature of work to be performed under the management and 
operating contract;
    (2) The size, experience, ability, reliability, and organization of 
the management and operating contractor's purchasing function;
    (3) The internal controls, procedures, and organizational stature of 
the management and operating contractor's purchasing function; and
    (4) Policies with respect to such reviews and approvals established 
by the Senior Procurement Executive.
    (b) Prior approval shall be required for the subcontracting of any 
work a contractor is obligated to perform under a contract entered into 
under section 41, entitled Production of Special Nuclear Material, of 
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended.
    (c) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall take such action 
as may be required to insure compliance with the procedure for 
purchasing from contractor-affiliated sources or the purchase of 
specific items, or classes of items, which by the terms of the contract 
may require DOE approval.
    (d) The Heads of the Contracting Activities may raise or lower the 
review and approval thresholds established pursuant to paragraph (a) of 
this subsection at any time. Such action may be considered upon the 
periodic review of the contractor's purchasing system, but in any case 
those adjusted thresholds may not exceed the approval authority 
delegated to the Head of the Contracting Activity by the Senior 
Procurement Executive.
    (e) DOE approvals of specific proposed purchases pursuant to this 
subpart shall communicate that such approval does not relieve the 
management and operating contractor of any obligation under its prime 
contract with DOE; is given without prejudice to any rights or claims of 
the Government thereunder; creates no obligation on the part of the 
Government to the subcontractor, and is not a predetermination of the 
allowability of costs to be incurred under the subcontract.
    (f) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating 
contractors establish and maintain subcontract files which contain those 
documents essential to present an accurate and adequate record of all 
purchasing transactions.
    (g) Contracting officers shall assure that management and operating 
contractors document purchases in writing, setting forth the information 
and data used in determining that the purchases are in the best interest 
of the Government. The scope and detail of this documentation shall be 
consistent with the nature, dollar value, and complexity of the 
purchase.
    (h) The Heads of the Contracting Activities shall assure that the 
contracting activity establishes and maintains files of the documents 
associated with the review and approval of subcontract actions subject 
to DOE review and approval. Those files shall include, among other 
necessary documentation, an appraisal of the proposed action by the 
contracting activity and a copy of the approving or disapproving 
document forwarded to the management and operating contractor, including 
a listing of any deficiencies, a listing of any required corrective 
actions, any suggestions, or other relevant comments.


<R05>
Sec. 970.4401-3  Advance notification.

    (a) Contracting officers shall assure that the written description 
of the management and operating contractor's purchasing system and 
methods provides for advance notice to the DOE contracting officer of 
the proposed award of the following specified types of subcontracts, 
except as stated in paragraph (b) of this subsection:
    (1) Pursuant to section 304(b) of the Federal Property and 
Administrative Service Act of 1949, as amended (41 U.S.C. 254(b)):
    (i) Cost reimbursement-type subcontracts of any award value; and
    (ii) Fixed price-type subcontracts which exceed the simplified 
acquisition

[[Page 449]]

threshold, or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of the prime 
contract.
    (2) Purchases from contractor-affiliated sources over a value 
established by the HCA.
    (b) Pursuant to section 602(d)13 of the Act (40 U.S.C. 474(13)) 
referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the advance notification 
requirement for the types of purchases listed in paragraphs (a) (1) and 
(2) of this subsection shall not apply to subcontracts relating to 
functions derived from the Atomic Energy Commission.
    (c) The advance notice shall contain, at a minimum, a description of 
work, estimated cost, type of contract or reimbursement provisions, and 
extent of competition, or justification for a noncompetitive purchase 
procurement. The contracting officer may at any time request additional 
information that must be furnished promptly and prior to award of the 
subcontract.


<R05>
Sec. 970.4402  Contractor purchasing system.


<R05>
Sec. 970.4402-1  Policy.

    (a) DOE contracts for the management and operation of its 
facilities, the design and production of nuclear weapons, energy 
research and development, and the performance of other services. These 
management and operating (M&O) contractors have been selected for their 
technical and managerial expertise and are expected to bring to bear 
these technical and managerial skills to accomplish the significant 
Federal mission(s) described in their contracts with, and work plans 
approved by, DOE.
    (b) Purchasing done by management and operating contractors is one 
area in which the particular skills of the contractors will be brought 
to bear in order to more readily accomplish the contractors' assigned 
missions. The contracting procedures of the contractor's organization, 
therefore, form the basis for the development of a purchasing system and 
methods that will comply with its contract with DOE and this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 970.4402-2  General requirements.

    The following shall apply to the purchasing systems of management 
and operating contractors:
    (a) The objective of a management and operating contractor's 
purchasing system is to deliver to its customers on a timely basis those 
best value products and services necessary to accomplish the purposes of 
the Government's contract. To achieve this objective, contractors are 
expected to use their experience, expertise and initiative consistent 
with this subpart.
    (b) The purchasing systems and methods used by management and 
operating contractors shall be well-defined, consistently applied, and 
shall follow purchasing practices appropriate for the requirement and 
dollar value of the purchase. It is anticipated that purchasing 
practices and procedures will vary among contractors and according to 
the type and kinds of purchases to be made.
    (c) Contractor purchases are not Federal procurements, and are not 
directly subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations in 48 CFR. 
Nonetheless, certain Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations may 
affect contractor purchasing, as required by statute, regulation, or 
contract terms and conditions.
    (d) Contractor purchasing systems shall identify and apply the best 
in commercial purchasing practices and procedures (although nothing 
precludes the adoption of Federal procurement practices and procedures) 
to achieve system objectives. Where specific requirements do not 
otherwise apply, the contractor purchasing system shall provide for 
appropriate measures to ensure the:
    (1) Acquisition of quality products and services at fair and 
reasonable prices;
    (2) Use of capable and reliable subcontractors who either:
    (i) Have track records of successful past performance, or
    (ii) Can demonstrate a current superior ability to perform;
    (3) Minimization of acquisition lead-time and administrative costs 
of purchasing;

[[Page 450]]

    (4) Use of effective competitive techniques;
    (5) Reduction of performance risks associated with subcontractors, 
and facilitation of quality relationships which can include techniques 
such as partnering agreements, ombudsmen, and alternative disputes 
procedures;
    (6) Use of self-assessment and benchmarking techniques to support 
continuous improvement in purchasing;
    (7) Maintenance of the highest professional and ethical standards;
    (8) Maintenance of file documentation appropriate to the value of 
the purchase and which is adequate to establish the propriety of the 
transaction and the price paid; and
    (9) Maximization of opportunities for small business, HUBZone small 
business, small disadvantaged business, and woman-owned small business 
concerns to participate in contract performance.


<R05>
Sec. 970.4402-3  Purchasing from contractor-affiliated sources.

    (a) A management and operating contractor may purchase from sources 
affiliated with the contractor (any division, subsidiary, or affiliate 
of the contractor or its parent company) in the same manner as from 
other sources, provided:
    (1) The management and operating contractor's purchasing function is 
independent of the proposed contractor-affiliated source;
    (2) The same terms and conditions would apply if the purchase were 
from a third party;
    (3) Award is made in accordance with policies and procedures 
designed to permit effective competition which have been approved by the 
contracting officer. (This requirement for competition shall not 
preclude acquisition of technical services from contractor-affiliated 
entities where those entities have a special expertise, and the basis 
therefor is documented.); and
    (4) The award is legally enforceable where the entities are 
separately incorporated.
    (b) Subcontracts for performance of contract work itself (as 
distinguished from the purchase of supplies and services needed in 
connection with the performance of work) require DOE authorization and 
may involve an adjustment of the contractor's fee, if any. If the 
management and operating contractor seeks authorization to have some 
part of the contract work performed by a contractor-affiliated source, 
and that contractor's performance of that work was a factor in the 
negotiated fee, DOE approval would normally require:
    (1) That the contractor-affiliated source perform such work without 
fee or profit, or
    (2) An equitable downward adjustment to the management and operating 
contractor's fee, if any.
    (c) Determination on cost of money allowance as prescribed at 48 CFR 
31.205-10 shall be treated as follows:
    (1) When a purchase from a contractor-affiliated source results from 
competition and is in accord with provisions and conditions of 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this subsection, the contractor-
affiliated source may include cost of money as an allowable element of 
the costs of its goods or services supplied to the contractor; provided:
    (i) The purchase is based on cost as set forth in 48 CFR 970.3102-3-
21 and
    (ii) The cost of money amount is computed in accordance with 48 CFR 
31.205-10 and related procedures (see 48 CFR 970.30).
    (2) When a purchase from a contractor-affiliated source is made non-
competitively, cost of money shall not be considered an allowable 
element of the cost of the contractor-affiliated source purchase.


<R05>
Sec. 970.4402-4  Nuclear material transfers.

    (a) Management and operating contractors, in preparing subcontracts 
or other agreements in which monetary payments or credits depend on the 
quantity and quality of nuclear material, shall be required to assure 
that each such subcontract or agreement contains a:
    (1) Description of the material to be transferred;
    (2) Provision specifying the method by which the quantities are to 
be measured and reported;
    (3) Provision specifying the procedures to be used in resolving any 
differences arising as a result of such measurements;

[[Page 451]]

    (4) Provision for the use of an independent third party as an umpire 
to settle unresolved differences in the analytical samples; and
    (5) Provision specifying in detail which party shall bear the costs 
of resolving a difference and what constitutes such costs.
    (b) The provisions providing for resolution of measurement 
differences must be such that resolution is always accomplished, while 
at the same time minimizing any advantage one party may have over the 
other.


<R05>
Sec. 970.4403  Contract clause.

    The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 970.5244-1,

specifically provided in the individual contract. Specific managerial 
personnel may be listed in paragraph (j), provided their listing is 
consistent with the clause and the DEAR.
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the basic clause with its 
Alternate I in contracts with nonprofit contractors.

paragraph (b) of this subsection, in all cost-reimbursement management 
and operating contracts, regardless of whether the contract is for 
production, or research and development with an educational or nonprofit 
institution.
    (b) The contracting officer shall modify paragraph (i) of the clause 
to insert ``as supplemented in subpart 970.31 of the Department of 
Energy Acquisition Regulation,'' after the phrase, ``part 31 of the

<R05>
Sec. 970.5070  Indemnification.


<R05>
Sec. 970.5070-1  Scope and applicability.

    (a) Section 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 
requires DOE to enter into agreements of indemnity with contractors 
whose work involves the risk of public liability for the occurrence of a 
nuclear incident or precautionary evacuation.
    (b) Details of such indemnification are discussed at 48 CFR 950.70.


<R05>
Sec. 970.5070-2  General.

    DOE contractors with whom statutory nuclear hazards indemnity 
agreements under the authority of section 170d. of the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, as amended, are executed will not normally be required or 
permitted to furnish financial protection by purchase of insurance to 
cover public liability for nuclear incidents. However, if authorized by 
the DOE Headquarters office having responsibility for contractor 
casualty insurance programs, DOE contractors may be
    (a) Permitted to furnish financial protection to themselves, or
    (b) Permitted to continue to carry such insurance at cost to the 
Government if they currently maintain insurance for such liability.

[[Page 452]]


<R05>
Sec. 970.5070-3  Contract clauses.

    (a) The clause at 48 CFR 952.250-70, Nuclear Hazards Indemnity 
Agreement, shall be included in all management and operating contracts 
involving the risk of public liability for the occurrence of a nuclear 
incident or precautionary evacuation arising out of or in connection 
with the contract work, including such events caused by a product 
delivered to a DOE-owned, facility for use by DOE or its contractors. 
The clause at 48 CFR 952.250-70 also shall be included in any management 
and operating contract for the design of a DOE facility, the 
construction or operation of which may involve the risk of public 
liability for a nuclear incident or a precautionary evacuation.
    (b) The clause at 48 CFR 952.250-70 shall not be included in 
contracts in which the contractor is subject to Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission (NRC) financial protection requirements under section 170b. 
of the Act or NRC agreements of indemnification under section 170 c. or 
k. of the Act for activities to be performed under the contract.

    Subpart 970.52_Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses for 
                   Management and Operating Contracts


<R05>
Sec. 970.5200  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart prescribes some of the solicitation provisions and 
contract clauses for use in management and operating contracts. The 
provisions and clauses contained in this subpart supplement the 
provisions and clauses prescribed in the FAR and in other parts of the 
DEAR (48 CFR 901 through 48 CFR 952), and, pursuant to the individual 
provision or clause prescription, are to be used in addition to or in 
place of such clauses. Management and operating contracts are hybrid 
contracts, in some cases including aspects of several FAR contract 
types, for example, supplies and construction. For some FAR solicitation 
provisions and contract clauses, this subpart prescribes their use 
despite the hybrid nature of the work required. To assist Departmental 
contracting personnel in determining the applicability of FAR and DEAR 
clauses to management and operating contracts, additional guidance is 
published and made available by the Office of Procurement and Assistance 
Policy, within the Headquarters procurement organization.

Sec. 970.5203-1  Management controls.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.0370-2(a) and 48 CFR 970.3270(a)(4), 
insert the following clause:

                     Management Controls (DEC 2000)

    (a)(1) The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining, as an 
integral part of its organization, effective systems of management 
controls for both administrative and programmatic functions. Management 
controls comprise the plan of organization, methods, and procedures 
adopted by management to reasonably ensure that: the mission and 
functions assigned to the contractor are properly executed; efficient 
and effective operations are promoted; resources are safeguarded against 
waste, loss, mismanagement, unauthorized use, or misappropriation; all 
encumbrances and costs that are incurred under the contract and fees 
that are earned are in compliance with applicable clauses and other 
current terms, conditions, and intended purposes; all collections 
accruing to the contractor in connection with the work under this 
contract, expenditures, and all other transactions and assets are 
properly recorded, managed, and reported; and financial, statistical, 
and other reports necessary to maintain accountability and managerial 
control are accurate, reliable, and timely.
    (2) The systems of controls employed by the contractor shall be 
documented and satisfactory to DOE.
    (3) Such systems shall be an integral part of the contractor's 
management functions, including defining specific roles and 
responsibilities for each level of management, and holding employees 
accountable for the adequacy of the management systems and controls in 
their areas of assigned responsibility.
    (4) The contractor shall, as part of the internal audit program 
required elsewhere in this contract, periodically review the management 
systems and controls employed in programs and administrative areas to 
ensure that they are adequate to provide reasonable assurance that the 
objectives of the systems are being accomplished and that these systems 
and controls are working effectively.
    (b) The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining, as a part 
of its operational responsibilities, a baseline quality assurance

[[Page 453]]

program that implements documented performance, quality standards, and 
control and assessment techniques.

                             (End of Clause)


<R05>
Sec. 970.5203-2  Performance improvement and collaboration.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.0370-2(b), insert the following clause:

          Performance Improvement and Collaboration (DEC 2000)

    (a) The contractor agrees that it shall affirmatively identify, 
evaluate, and institute practices, where appropriate, that will improve 
performance in the areas of environmental and health, safety, scientific 
and technical, security, business and administrative, and any other 
areas of performance in the management and operation of the contract. 
This may entail the alteration of existing practices or the institution 
of new procedures to more effectively or efficiently perform any aspect 
of contract performance or reduce overall cost of operation under the 
contract. Such improvements may result from changes in organization, 
simplification of systems while retaining necessary controls, or any 
other approaches consistent with the statement of work and performance 
measures of this contract.
    (b) The contractor agrees to work collaboratively with the 
Department, all other management and operating, DOE major facilities 
management contractors and affiliated contractors which manage or 
operate DOE sites or facilities for the following purposes: (i) to 
exchange information generally, (ii) to evaluate concepts that may be of 
benefit in resolving common issues, in confronting common problems, or 
in reducing costs of operations, and (iii) to otherwise identify and 
implement DOE-complex-wide management improvements discussed in 
paragraph (a). In doing so, it shall also affirmatively provide 
information relating to its management improvements to such contractors, 
including lessons learned, subject to security considerations and the 
protection of data proprietary to third parties.
    (c) The contractor may consult with the contracting officer in those 
instances in which improvements being considered pursuant to paragraph 
(a) involve the cooperation of the DOE. The contractor may request the 
assistance of the contracting officer in the communication of the 
success of improvements to other management and operating contractors in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause.
    (d) The contractor shall notify the contracting officer and seek 
approval where necessary to fulfill its obligations under the contract. 
Compliance with this clause in no way alters the obligations of the 
Contractor under any other provision of this contract.

                             (End of Clause)


<R05>
Sec. 970.5203-3  Contractor's organization.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.0371-9, insert the following clause:

                  Contractor's Organization (DEC 2000)

    (a) Organization chart. As promptly as possible after the execution 
of this contract, the contractor shall furnish to the contracting 
officer a chart showing the names, duties, and organization of key 
personnel (see 48 CFR 952.215-70) to be employed in connection with the 
work, and shall furnish supplemental information to reflect any changes 
as they occur.
    (b) Supervisory representative of contractor. Unless otherwise 
directed by the contracting officer, a competent full-time resident 
supervisory representative of the contractor satisfactory to the 
contracting officer shall be in charge of the work at the site, and any 
work off-site, at all times.
    (c) Control of employees. The contractor shall be responsible for 
maintaining satisfactory standards of employee competency, conduct, and 
integrity and shall be responsible for taking such disciplinary action 
with respect to its employees as may be necessary. In the event the 
contractor fails to remove any employee from the contract work whom DOE 
deems incompetent, careless, or insubordinate, or whose continued 
employment on the work is deemed by DOE to be inimical to the 
Department's mission, the contracting officer may require, with the 
approval of the Secretary of Energy, the contractor to remove the 
employee from work under the contract. This includes the right to direct 
the contractor to remove its most senior key person from work under the 
contract for serious contract performance deficiencies.
    (d) Standards and procedures. The contractor shall establish such 
standards and procedures as are necessary to implement the requirements 
set forth in 48 CFR 970.0371. Such standards and procedures shall be 
subject to the approval of the contracting officer.

                             (End of Clause)

Sec. 970.5204-1  Counterintelligence.

    (a) As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.0404-4(a), insert the following 
clause in contracts containing the clauses at 48 CFR 952.204-2, 
Security, and 48 CFR 952.204-70, Classification/Declassification:

[[Page 454]]

                     Counterintelligence (DEC 2000)

    (a) The contractor shall take all reasonable precautions in the work 
under this contract to protect DOE programs, facilities, technology, 
personnel, unclassified sensitive information and classified matter from 
foreign intelligence threats and activities conducted for governmental 
or industrial purposes, in accordance with DOE Order 5670.3, 
Counterintelligence Program; Executive Order 12333, U.S. Intelligence 
Activities; and other pertinent national and Departmental 
Counterintelligence requirements.
    (b) The contractor shall appoint a qualified employee(s) to function 
as the Contractor Counterintelligence Officer. The Contractor 
Counterintelligence Officer will be responsible for conducting defensive 
Counterintelligence briefings and debriefings of employees traveling to 
foreign countries or interacting with foreign nationals; providing 
thoroughly documented written reports relative to targeting, suspicious 
activity and other matters of Counterintelligence interest; immediately 
reporting targeting, suspicious activity and other Counterintelligence 
concerns to the DOE Headquarters Counterintelligence Division; and 
providing assistance to other elements of the U.S. Intelligence

Sec. 970.5204-2  Laws, regulations, and DOE directives.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.0470-2, insert the following clause:

            Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives (DEC 2000)

    (a) In performing work under this contract, the contractor shall 
comply with the requirements of applicable Federal, State, and local 
laws and regulations (including DOE regulations), unless relief has been 
granted in writing by the appropriate regulatory agency. A List of 
Applicable Laws and regulations (List A) may be appended to this 
contract for information purposes. Omission of any applicable law or 
regulation from List A does not affect the obligation of the contractor 
to comply with such law or regulation pursuant to this paragraph.
    (b) In performing work under this contract, the contractor shall 
comply with the requirements of those Department of Energy directives, 
or parts thereof, identified in the List of Applicable Directives (List 
B) appended to this contract. Except as otherwise provided for in 
paragraph (d) of this clause, the contracting officer may, from time to 
time and at any time, revise List B by unilateral modification to the 
contract to add, modify, or delete specific requirements. Prior to 
revising List B, the contracting officer shall notify the contractor in 
writing of the Department's intent to revise List B and provide the 
contractor with the opportunity to assess the effect of the contractor's 
compliance with the revised list on contract cost and funding, technical 
performance, and schedule; and identify any potential inconsistencies 
between the revised list and the other terms and conditions of the 
contract. Within 30 days after receipt of the contracting officer's 
notice, the contractor shall advise the contracting officer in writing 
of the potential impact of the contractor's compliance with the revised 
list. Based on the information provided by the contractor and any other 
information available, the contracting officer shall decide whether to 
revise List B and so advise the contractor not later than 30 days prior 
to the effective date of the revision of List B. The contractor and the 
contracting officer shall identify and, if appropriate, agree to any 
changes to other contract terms and conditions, including cost and 
schedule, associated with the revision of List B pursuant to the clause 
of this contract entitled, ``Changes.''
    (c) Environmental, safety, and health (ES&H) requirements 
appropriate for work conducted under this contract may be determined by 
a DOE approved process to evaluate the work and the associated hazards 
and identify an appropriately tailored set of standards, practices, and 
controls, such as a tailoring process included in a DOE approved Safety 
Management System implemented under the clause entitled ``Integration of 
Environment, Safety, and Health into Work Planning and Execution.'' When 
such a process is used, the set of tailored (ES&H) requirements, as 
approved by DOE pursuant to the process, shall be incorporated into List 
B as contract requirements with full force and effect. These 
requirements shall supersede, in whole or in part, the contractual 
environmental, safety, and health requirements previously made 
applicable to the contract by List B. If the tailored set of 
requirements identifies an alternative requirement varying from an ES&H 
requirement of an applicable law or regulation, the contractor shall 
request an exemption or other appropriate regulatory relief specified in 
the regulation.
    (d) Except as otherwise directed by the contracting officer, the 
contractor shall procure all necessary permits or licenses required for 
the performance of work under this contract.
    (e) Regardless of the performer of the work, the contractor is 
responsible for compliance with the requirements of this clause. The 
contractor is responsible for flowing down the requirements of this 
clause to subcontracts at any tier to the extent necessary

[[Page 455]]

to ensure the contractor's compliance with the requirements.

direct during the progress of the work or, in any event, as the 
contracting officer shall direct upon completion or termination of the 
contract.
    (b) Contractor-owned records. The following records are considered 
the property of the contractor and are not within the scope of paragraph 
(a) of this clause. [The contracting officer shall identify which of the

permission to assert rights and has not relinquished such rights or 
turned such rights over to the Government.
    (c) Contract completion or termination. In the event of completion 
or termination of this contract, copies of any of the contractor-owned 
records identified in paragraph (b) of this clause, upon the request of 
the Government, shall be delivered to DOE or its designees, including 
successor contractors. Upon delivery, title to such records shall vest 
in DOE or its designees, and such records shall be protected in 
accordance with applicable federal laws (including the Privacy Act), as 
appropriate.
    (d) Inspection, copying, and audit of records. All records acquired 
or generated by the contractor under this contract in the possession of 
the contractor, including those described at paragraph (b) of this

inspection, copying, and audit. The Government or its designees shall 
use such records in accordance with applicable federal laws (including 
the Privacy Act), as appropriate.
    (e) Applicability. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this clause apply 
to all records without regard to the date or origination of such

standards, described at DOE Order 200.1, Information Management Program 
(version in effect on effective date of contract), are applicable for 
the classes of records described therein, whether or not the records are 
owned by the Government or the contractor. In addition, the contractor 
shall retain individual radiation exposure records generated in the 
performance of work under this contract until DOE authorizes disposal. 
The Government may waive application of these record retention 
schedules, if, upon termination or completion of the contract, the 
Government exercises its right under paragraph (c) of this clause to 
obtain copies

[[Page 456]]

and delivery of records described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
clause.

Sec. 970.5208-1  Printing.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.0808-3, insert the following clause:

                           Printing (DEC 2000)

    (a) To the extent that duplicating or printing services may be 
required in the performance of this contract, the Contractor shall 
provide or secure such services in accordance with the Government

Directives relative thereto.
    (b) The term ``Printing'' includes the following processes: 
Composition, platemaking, presswork, binding, microform publishing, or 
the end items produced by such processes. Provided, however, that 
performance of a requirement under this contract involving the 
duplication of less than 5,000 copies of a single page, or no more than 
25,000 units in the aggregate of multiple pages, will not be deemed to 
be printing.
    (c) Printing services not obtained in compliance with this guidance 
shall result in the cost of such printing being disallowed.
    (d) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in all 
subcontracts hereunder which require printing (as that term is defined 
in Title I of the U.S. Government Printing and Binding Regulations).

<R05>
Sec. 970.5215-1  Total available fee: Base fee amount and performance 
          fee amount.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.1504-5(a), insert the following clause. 
The clause should be tailored to reflect the contract's actual inclusion 
of base fee amount and performance fee amount.

  Total Available Fee: Base Fee Amount and Performance Fee Amount (DEC 
                                  2000)

    (a) Total available fee. Total available fee, consisting of a base 
fee amount ( which may be zero) and a performance fee amount (consisting 
of an incentive fee component for objective performance requirements, an 
award fee component for subjective performance requirements, or both) 
determined in accordance with the provisions of this clause, is 
available for payment in accordance with the clause of this contract 
entitled, ``Payments and advances.''
    (b) Fee Negotiations. Prior to the beginning of each fiscal year 
under this contract, or other appropriate period as mutually agreed upon 
and, if exceeding one year, approved by the Senior Procurement 
Executive, or designee, the contracting officer and Contractor shall 
enter into negotiation of the requirements for the year or appropriate 
period, including the evaluation areas and individual requirements 
subject to incentives, the total available fee, and the allocation of 
fee. The contracting officer shall modify this contract at the 
conclusion of each negotiation to reflect the negotiated requirements, 
evaluation areas and individual requirements subject to incentives, the 
total available fee, and the allocation of fee. In the event the parties 
fail to agree on the requirements, the evaluation areas and individual 
requirements subject to incentives, the total available fee, or the 
allocation of fee, a unilateral determination will be made by the 
contracting officer. The total available fee amount shall be allocated 
to a twelve month cycle composed of one or more evaluation periods, or 
such longer period as may be mutually agreed to between the parties and 
approved by the Senior Procurement Executive, or designee.
    (c) Determination of Total Available Fee Amount Earned. (1) The 
Government shall, at

[[Page 457]]

the conclusion of each specified evaluation period, evaluate the 
contractor's performance of all requirements, including performance 
based incentives completed during the period, and determine the total 
available fee amount earned. At the contracting officer's discretion, 
evaluation of incentivized performance may occur at the scheduled 
completion of specific incentivized requirements.
    (2) The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, will be 
(insert title of DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee). The 
contractor agrees that the determination as to the total available fee 
earned is a unilateral determination made by the DOE Operations/Field 
Office Manager, or designee.
    (3) The evaluation of contractor performance shall be in accordance 
with the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) described in 
subparagraph (d) of this clause unless otherwise set forth in the 
contract. The Contractor shall be promptly advised in writing of the fee 
determination, and the basis of the fee determination. In the event that 
the contractor's performance is considered to be less than the level of 
performance set forth in the Statement of Work, as amended to include 
the current Work Authorization Directive or similar document, for any 
contract requirement, it will be considered by the DOE Operations/Field 
Office Manager, or designee, who may at his/her discretion adjust the 
fee determination to reflect such performance. Any such adjustment shall 
be in accordance with the clause entitled, ``Conditional Payment of Fee, 
Profit, or Incentives'' if contained in the contract.
    (d) Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s). To the extent 
not set forth elsewhere in the contract:
    (1) The Government shall establish a Performance Evaluation and 
Measurement Plan(s) upon which the determination of the total available 
fee amount earned shall be based. The Performance Evaluation and 
Measurement Plan(s) will address all of the requirements of contract 
performance specified in the contract directly or by reference. A copy 
of the Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) shall be provided 
to the Contractor:
    (i) prior to the start of an evaluation period if the requirements, 
evaluation areas, specific incentives, amount of fee, and allocation of 
fee to such evaluation areas and specific incentives have been mutually 
agreed to by the parties; or
    (ii) not later than thirty days prior to the scheduled start date of 
the evaluation period, if the requirements, evaluation areas, specific 
incentives, amount of fee, and allocation of fee to such evaluation 
areas and specific incentives have been unilaterally established by the 
contracting officer.
    (2) The Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) will set 
forth the criteria upon which the Contractor will be evaluated relating 
to any technical, schedule, management, and/or cost objectives selected 
for evaluation. Such criteria should be objective, but may also include 
subjective criteria. The Plan(s) shall also set forth the method by 
which the total available fee amount will be allocated and the amount 
earned determined.
    (3) The Performance Evaluation and Measurement Plan(s) may, 
consistent with the contract statement of work, be revised during the 
period of performance. The contracting officer shall notify the 
contractor:
    (i) of such unilateral changes at least ninety calendar days prior 
to the end of the affected evaluation period and at least thirty 
calendar days prior to the effective date of the change;
    (ii) of such bilateral changes at least sixty calendar days prior to 
the end of the affected evaluation period; or
    (iii) if such change, whether unilateral or bilateral, is urgent and 
high priority, at least thirty calendar days prior to the end of the 
evaluation period.
    (e) Schedule for total available fee amount earned determinations. 
The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, shall issue the 
final total available fee amount earned determination in accordance 
with: the schedule set forth in the Performance Evaluation and 
Measurement Plan(s); or as otherwise set forth in this contract . 
However, a determination must be made within sixty calendar days after 
the receipt by the contracting officer of the Contractor's self-
assessment, if one is required or permitted by paragraph (f) of this 
clause, or seventy calendar days after the end of the evaluation period, 
whichever is later, or a longer period if the Contractor and contracting 
officer agree. If the contracting officer evaluates the Contractor's 
performance of specific requirements on their completion, the payment of 
any earned fee amount must be made within seventy calendar days (or such 
other time period as mutually agreed to between the contracting officer 
and the Contractor) after such completion. If the determination is 
delayed beyond that date, the Contractor shall be entitled to interest 
on the determined total available fee amount earned at the rate 
established by the Secretary of the Treasury under section 12 of the 
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the 
payment date. This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board 
Interest Rate,'' and is published in the Federal Register semiannually 
on or about January 1 and July 1. The interest on any late total 
available fee amount earned determination will accrue daily and be 
compounded in 30-day increments inclusive from

[[Page 458]]

the first day after the schedule determination date through the actual 
date the determination is issued. That is, interest accrued at the end 
of any 30-day period will be added to the determined amount of fee 
earned and be subject to interest if not paid in the succeeding 30-day 
period.

                             (End of Clause)

    Alternate I (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.1504-5(a)(1), 
when the award fee cycle consists of two or more evaluation periods, add 
the following to paragraph (c):
    (4) At the sole discretion of the Government, unearned total 
available fee amounts may be carried over from one evaluation period to 
the next, so long as the periods are within the same award fee cycle.
    Alternate II (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.1504-5(a)(2), 
when the award fee cycle consists of one evaluation period, add the 
following to paragraph (c):
    (4) Award fee not earned during the evaluation period shall not be 
allocated to future evaluation periods.
    Alternate III (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.1504-5(a)(3), 
when the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, requires the 
contractor to submit a self-assessment, add the following as paragraph 
(f):
    (f) Contractor self-assessment. Following each evaluation period, 
the Contractor shall submit a self-assessment within (Insert Number) 
calendar days after the end of the period. This self-assessment shall 
address both the strengths and weaknesses of the Contractor's 
performance during the evaluation period. Where deficiencies in 
performance are noted, the Contractor shall describe the actions planned 
or taken to correct such deficiencies and avoid their recurrence. The 
DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, will review the 
Contractor's self-assessment, if submitted, as part of its independent 
evaluation of the contractor's management during the period. A self-
assessment, in and of itself may not be the only basis for the award fee 
determination.
    Alternate IV (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.1504-5(a)(4), 
when the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, permits the 
contractor to submit a self-assessment at the contractor's option, add 
the following text as paragraph (f):
    (f) Contractor self-assessment. Following each evaluation period, 
the Contractor may submit a self-assessment, provided such assessment is 
submitted within (Insert Number) calendar days after the end of the 
period. This self-assessment shall address both the strengths and 
weaknesses of the Contractor's performance during the evaluation period. 
Where deficiencies in performance are noted, the Contractor shall 
describe the actions planned or taken to correct such deficiencies and 
avoid their recurrence. The DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or 
designee, will review the Contractor's self-assessment, if submitted, as 
part of its independent evaluation of the Contractor's management during 
the period. A self-assessment, in and of itself may not be the only 
basis for the award fee determination.

Sec. 970.5215-2  Make-or-buy plan.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.1504-5(b), insert the following clause:

                       Make-or-Buy Plan (DEC 2000)

    (a) Definitions.
    Buy item means a work activity, supply, or service to be produced or 
performed by an outside source, including a subcontractor or an 
affiliate, subsidiary, or division of the contractor.
    Make item means a work activity, supply, or service to be produced 
or performed by the contractor using its personnel and other resources 
at the Department of Energy facility or site.
    Make-or-buy plan means a contractor's written program for the 
contract that identifies work efforts or requirements that either are 
``make items'' or ``buy items.''
    (b) Make-or-buy plan. The contractor shall develop and implement a 
make-or-buy plan that establishes a preference for providing supplies 
and services on a least-cost basis, subject to any specific make or buy 
criteria identified in the contract or otherwise provided by the 
contracting officer. In developing and implementing its make-or-buy 
plan, the contractor agrees to assess subcontracting opportunities and 
implement subcontracting decisions in accordance with the following:
    (1) The contractor shall conduct internal productivity improvement 
and cost-reduction programs so that in-house performance options can be 
made more efficient and cost-effective.
    (2) The contractor shall consider subcontracting opportunities with 
the maximum practicable regard for open communications with potentially 
affected employees and their representatives. Similarly, a contractor 
shall communicate its plans, activities, cost-benefit analyses, and 
decisions to those stakeholders, including representatives of the 
community and local businesses, likely to be affected by such actions.
    (c) Submission and approval. For new contract awards, the contractor 
shall submit an initial make-or-buy plan, for approval, within 180 days 
after contract award. If the existing contract is to be extended, the 
contractor shall submit a make-or-buy plan for review and approval at 
least 90 days prior to the commencement of the negotiations for the 
extension. The following documentation shall be prepared and submitted:
    (1) A description of the each work item, and if appropriate, the 
identification of the

[[Page 459]]

associated Work Authorization or Work Breakdown Structure element;
    (2) The categorization of each work item as ``must make,'' ``must 
buy,'' or ``can make or buy,'' with the reasons for such categorization 
in consideration of the program specific make or buy criteria (including 
least cost considerations). For non-core capabilities categorized as 
``must make,'' a cost/benefit analysis must be performed for each item 
if:
    (i) The contractor is not the least-cost performer, and
    (ii) A program specific make-or-buy criterion does not otherwise 
justify a ``must make'' categorization;
    (3) A decision to either ``make'' or ``buy'' in consideration of the 
program specific make or buy criteria (including least cost 
considerations) for work effort categorized as ``can make or buy'';
    (4) Identification of potential suppliers and subcontractors, if 
known, and their location and size status;
    (5) A recommendation to defer a make or buy decision where 
categorization of an identifiable work effort is impracticable at the 
time of initial development of the plan and a schedule for future re-
evaluation;
    (6) A description of the impact of a change in current practice of 
making or buying on the existing work force; and
    (7) Any additional information appropriate to support and explain 
the plan.
    (d) Conduct of operations. Once a make-or-buy plan is approved, the 
contractor shall perform in accordance with the plan.
    (e) Changes to the make-or-buy plan. The make-or-buy plan 
established in accordance with paragraph (b) of this clause shall remain 
in effect for the term of the contract, unless:
    (1) A lesser period is provided either for the total plan or for 
individual items or work effort;
    (2) The circumstances supporting the make-or-buy decisions change, 
or
    (3) New work is identified.
    At least annually, the contractor shall review its approved make-or-
buy plan to ensure that it reflects current conditions. Changes to the 
approved make-or-buy plan shall be submitted in advance of the effective 
date of the proposed change in sufficient time to permit evaluation and 
review. Changes shall be submitted in accordance with the instructions 
provided by the contracting officer. Modification of the make-or-buy 
plan to incorporate proposed changes or additions shall be effective 
upon the contractor's receipt of the contracting officer's written 
approval.

Sec. 970.5215-3  Conditional payment of fee, profit, or incentives.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.1504-5(c), insert the following clause:

      Conditional Payment of Fee, Profit, or Incentives (DEC 2000)

    In order for the Contractor to receive all otherwise earned fee, 
fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings under the contract in an 
evaluation period, the Contractor must meet the minimum requirements in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause, and if Alternate I is applicable, 
(a) through (d) of this clause. If the Contractor does not meet the 
minimum requirements, the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager or 
designee may make a unilateral determination to reduce the evaluation 
period's otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit or share of cost 
savings as described in the following paragraphs of this clause.
    (a) Minimum requirements for Environment, Safety & Health (ES&H) 
Program. The Contractor shall develop, obtain DOE approval of, and 
implement a Safety Management System in accordance with the provisions 
of the clause entitled, ``Integration of Environment, Safety and Health 
into Work Planning and Execution,'' if included in the contract, or as 
otherwise agreed to with the contracting officer. The minimum 
performance requirements of the system will be set forth in the approved 
Safety Management System, or similar document. If the Contractor fails 
to obtain approval of the Safety Management System or fails to achieve 
the minimum performance requirements of the system during the evaluation 
period, the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager or designee, at his/her 
sole discretion, may reduce any otherwise earned fees, fixed fee, profit 
or share of cost savings for the evaluation period by an amount up to 
the amount earned.
    (b) Minimum requirements for catastrophic event. If, in the 
performance of this contract, there is a catastrophic event (such as a 
fatality, or a serious workplace-related injury or illness to one or 
more Federal, contractor, or subcontractor employees or the general 
public, loss of control over classified or special nuclear material, or 
significant damage to the environment), the DOE Operations/Field Office 
Manager or designee may reduce any otherwise earned fee for the 
evaluation period by an amount up to the amount earned. In determining 
any diminution of fee, fixed fee, profit, or share of cost savings 
resulting from a catastrophic event, the DOE Operations/Field Office 
Manager or designee will consider whether willful misconduct and/or 
negligence contributed to the occurrence and

[[Page 460]]

will take into consideration any mitigating circumstances presented by 
the contractor or other sources.

                             (End of Clause)

    Alternate I (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.1504-5(c), for 
contracts awarded on a cost-plus-award-fee, incentive fee or multiple 
fee basis, add the following paragraphs (c) and (d):
    (c) Minimum requirements for specified level of performance. (1) At 
a minimum the Contractor must perform the following:
    (i) the requirements with specific incentives at the level of 
performance set forth in the Statement of Work, Work Authorization 
Directive, or similar document unless an otherwise minimal level of 
performance has been established in the specific incentive;
    (ii) all of the performance requirements directly related to 
requirements specifically incentivized at a level of performance such 
that the overall performance of these related requirements is at an 
acceptable level; and
    (iii) all other requirements at a level of performance such that the 
total performance of the contract is not jeopardized.
    (2) The evaluation of the Contractor's achievement of the level of 
performance shall be unilaterally determined by the contracting officer. 
To the extent that the Contractor fails to achieve the minimum 
performance levels specified in the Statement of Work, Work 
Authorization Directive, or similar document, during the evaluation 
period, the DOE Operations/Field Office Manager, or designee, may reduce 
any otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or shared net savings for 
the evaluation period. Such reduction shall not result in the total of 
earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or shared net savings being less than 25% 
of the total available fee amount. Such 25% shall include base fee, if 
any.
    (d) Minimum requirements for cost performance. (1) Requirements 
incentivized by other than cost incentives must be performed within 
their specified cost constraint and must not adversely impact the costs 
of performing unrelated activities.
    (2) The performance of requirements with a specific cost incentive 
must not adversely impact the costs of performing unrelated 
requirements.
    (3) The Contractor's performance within the stipulated cost 
performance levels for the evaluation period shall be determined by the 
contracting officer. To the extent the Contractor fails to achieve the 
stipulated cost performance levels, the DOE Operations/Field Office 
Manager, or designee, at his/her sole discretion, may reduce in whole or 
in part any otherwise earned fee, fixed fee, profit, or shared net 
savings for the evaluation period. Such reduction shall not result in 
the total of earned fee, fixed fee, profit or shared net savings being 
less than 25% of the total available fee amount. Such 25% shall include 
base fee, if any.

Sec. 970.5215-4  Cost reduction.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.1504-5(d), insert the following clause:

                        Cost Reduction (DEC 2000)

    (a) General. It is the Department of Energy's (DOE's) intent to have 
its facilities and laboratories operated in an efficient and effective 
manner. To this end, the Contractor shall assess its operations and 
identify areas where cost reductions would bring cost efficiency to 
operations without adversely affecting the level of performance required 
by the contract. The Contractor, to the maximum extent practical, shall 
identify areas where cost reductions may be effected, and develop and 
submit Cost Reduction Proposals (CRPs) to the contracting officer. If 
accepted, the Contractor may share in any shared net savings from 
accepted CRPs in accordance with paragraph (g) of this clause.
    (b) Definitions. Administrative cost is the contractor cost of 
developing and administering the CRP.
    Design, process, or method change is a change to a design, process, 
or method which has established cost, technical and schedule baseline, 
is defined, and is subject to a formal control procedure. Such a change 
must be innovative, initiated by the contractor, and applied to a 
specific project or program.
    Development cost is the Contractor cost of up-front planning, 
engineering, prototyping, and testing of a design, process, or method.
    DOE cost is the Government cost incurred implementing and validating 
the CRP.
    Implementation cost is the Contractor cost of tooling, facilities, 
documentation, etc., required to effect a design, process, or method 
change once it has been tested and approved.
    Net Savings means a reduction in the total amount (to include all 
related costs and fee) of performing the effort where the savings revert 
to DOE control and may be available for deobligation. Such savings may 
result from a specific cost reduction effort which is negotiated on a 
cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, or firm-fixed-price 
basis, or may result directly from a design, process, or method change. 
They may also be savings resulting from formal or informal direction 
given by DOE or from changes in the mission, work scope, or routine 
reorganization of the Contractor due to changes in the budget.
    Shared Net Savings are those net savings which result from:
    (1) a specific cost reduction effort which is negotiated on a cost-
plus-incentive-fee or fixed-price incentive basis, and is the difference 
between the negotiated target cost of performing an effort as negotiated 
and the

[[Page 461]]

actual allowable cost of performing that effort; or
    (2) a design, process, or method change, which occurs in the fiscal 
year in which the change is accepted and the subsequent fiscal year, and 
is the difference between the estimated cost of performing an effort as 
originally planned and the actual allowable cost of performing that same 
effort utilizing a revised plan intended to reduce costs along with any 
Contractor development costs, implementation costs, administrative 
costs, and DOE costs associated with the revised plan. Administrative 
costs and DOE costs are only included at the discretion of the 
contracting officer. Savings resulting from formal or informal direction 
given by the DOE or changes in the mission, work scope, or routine 
reorganization of the Contractor due to changes in the budget are not to 
be considered as shared net savings for purposes of this clause and do 
not qualify for incentive sharing.
    (c) Procedure for submission of CRPs. (1) CRPs for the establishment 
of cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive, or firm-fixed-price 
efforts or for design, process, or methods changes submitted by the 
Contractor shall contain, at a minimum, the following:
    (i) Current Method (Baseline)--A verifiable description of the 
current scope of work, cost, and schedule to be impacted by the 
initiative, and supporting documentation.
    (ii) New Method (New Proposed Baseline)--A verifiable description of 
the new scope of work, cost, and schedule, how the initiative will be 
accomplished, and supporting documentation.
    (iii) Feasibility Assessment--A description and evaluation of the 
proposed initiative and benefits, risks, and impacts of implementation. 
This evaluation shall include an assessment of the difference between 
the current method (baseline) and proposed new method including all 
related costs.
    (2) In addition, CRPs for the establishment of cost-plus-incentive-
fee, fixed-price incentive, or firm-fixed-price efforts shall contain, 
at a minimum, the following:
    (i) The proposed contractual arrangement and the justification for 
its use; and
    (ii) A detailed cost/price estimate and supporting rationale. If the 
approach is proposed on an incentive basis, minimum and maximum cost 
estimates should be included along with any proposed sharing 
arrangements.
    (d) Evaluation and Decision. All CRPs must be submitted to and 
approved by the contracting officer. Included in the information 
provided by the CRP must be a discussion of the extent the proposed cost 
reduction effort may:
    (1) Pose a risk to the health and safety of workers, the community, 
or to the environment;
    (2) Result in a waiver or deviation from DOE requirements, such as 
DOE Orders and joint oversight agreements;
    (3) Require a change in other contractual agreements;
    (4) Result in significant organizational and personnel impacts;
    (5) Create a negative impact on the cost, schedule, or scope of work 
in another area;
    (6) Pose a potential negative impact on the credibility of the 
Contractor or the DOE; and
    (7) Impact successful and timely completion of any of the work in 
the cost, technical, and schedule baseline.
    (e) Acceptance or Rejection of CRPs. Acceptance or rejection of a 
CRP is a unilateral determination made by the contracting officer. The 
contracting officer will notify the Contractor that a CRP has been 
accepted, rejected, or deferred within (Insert Number) days of receipt. 
The only CRPs that will be considered for acceptance are those which the 
Contractor can demonstrate, at a minimum, will:
    (1) Result in net savings (in the sharing period if a design, 
process, or method change);
    (2) Not reappear as costs in subsequent periods; and
    (3) Not result in any impairment of essential functions.
    (f) The failure of the contracting officer to notify the Contractor 
of the acceptance, rejection, or deferral of a CRP within the specified 
time shall not be construed as approval.
    (g) Adjustment to Original Estimated Cost and Fee. If a CRP is 
established on a cost-plus-incentive-fee, fixed-price incentive or firm-
fixed-price basis, the originally estimated cost and fee for the total 
effort shall be adjusted to remove the estimated cost and fee amount 
associated with the CRP effort.
    (h) Sharing Arrangement. If a CRP is accepted, the Contractor may 
share in the shared net savings. For a CRP negotiated on a cost-plus-
incentive-fee or fixed-price incentive basis, with the specific 
incentive arrangement (negotiated target costs, target fees, share 
lines, ceilings, profit, etc.) set forth in the contractual document 
authorizing the effort, the Contractor's share shall be the actual fee 
or profit resulting from such an arrangement. For a CRP negotiated as a 
cost savings incentive resulting from a design, process, or method 
change, the Contractor's share shall be a percentage, not to exceed 25% 
of the shared net savings. The specific percentage and sharing period 
shall be set forth in the contractual document.
    (i) Validation of Shared Net Savings. The contracting officer shall 
validate actual shared net savings. If actual shared net savings cannot 
be validated, the contractor will not be entitled to a share of the net 
shared savings.

[[Page 462]]

    (j) Relationship to Other Incentives. Only those benefits of an 
accepted CRP not rewardable under other clauses of this contract shall 
be rewarded under this clause.
    (k) Subcontracts. The Contractor may include a clause similar to 
this clause in any subcontract. In calculating any estimated shared net 
savings in a CRP under this contract, the Contractor's administration, 
development, and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor's 
allowable costs, and any CRP incentive payments to a subcontractor 
resulting from the acceptance of such CRP. The Contractor may choose any 
arrangement for subcontractor CRP incentive payments, provided that the 
payments not reduce the DOE's share of shared net savings.

                      Limitation on Fee (DEC 2000)

    (a) For the purpose of this solicitation, fee amounts shall not 
exceed the total available fee allowed by the fee policy at 48 CFR 
970.1504-1-1, or as specifically stated elsewhere in the solicitation.
    (b) The Government reserves the unilateral right, in the event an 
offeror's proposal is selected for award, to limit: fixed fee to not 
exceed an amount established pursuant to 48 CFR 970.1504-1-5; and total 
available fee to not exceed an amount established pursuant to 48 CFR 
970.1504-1-9; or fixed fee or total available fee to an amount as 
specifically stated elsewhere in the solicitation.

Sec. 970.5222-1  Collective Bargaining Agreements Management and 
          Operating Contracts.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.2201-1-3, insert the following clause:

  Collective Bargaining Agreements--Management and Operating Contracts 
                               (DEC 2000)

    When negotiating collective bargaining agreements applicable to the 
work force under this contract, the Contractor shall use its best 
efforts to ensure such agreements contain provisions designed to assure 
continuity of services. All such agreements entered into during the 
contract period of performance should provide that grievances and 
disputes involving the interpretation or application of the agreement 
will be settled without resorting to strike, lockout, or other 
interruption of normal operations. For this purpose, each collective 
bargaining agreement should provide an effective grievance procedure 
with arbitration as its final step, unless the parties mutually agree 
upon some other method of assuring continuity of operations. As part of 
such agreements, management and labor should agree to cooperate fully 
with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The contractor 
shall include the substance of this clause in any subcontracts for 
protective services or other services performed on the DOE-owned site 
which will affect the continuity of operation of the facility.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.2201-2-2, insert the following clause:

                     Overtime Management (DEC 2000)

    (a) The contractor shall maintain adequate internal controls to 
ensure that employee overtime is authorized only if cost effective and 
necessary to ensure performance of work under this contract.
    (b) The contractor shall notify the contracting officer when in any 
given year it is likely that overtime usage as a percentage of payroll 
may exceed 4%.
    (c) The contracting officer may require the submission, for 
approval, of a formal annual overtime control plan whenever contractor 
overtime usage as a percentage of payroll has exceeded, or is likely to 
exceed, 4%, or if the contracting officer otherwise deems overtime 
expenditures excessive. The plan shall include, at a minimum:
    (1) An overtime premium fund (maximum dollar amount);
    (2) Specific controls for casual overtime for non-exempt employees;
    (3) Specific parameters for allowability of exempt overtime;
    (4) An evaluation of alternatives to the use of overtime; and
    (5) Submission of a semi-annual report that includes for exempt and 
non-exempt employees:
    (i) Total cost of overtime;
    (ii) Total cost of straight time;
    (iii) Overtime cost as a percentage of straight-time cost;
    (iv) Total overtime hours;
    (v) Total straight-time hours; and
    (vi) Overtime hours as a percentage of straight-time hours.

Sec. 970.5223-1  Integration of environment, safety, and health into 
          work planning and execution.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.2303-2(a), insert the following clause:

[[Page 463]]

 Integration of Environment, Safety, and Health Into Work Planning and 
                          Execution (DEC 2000)

    (a) For the purposes of this clause,
    (1) Safety encompasses environment, safety and health, including 
pollution prevention and waste minimization; and
    (2) Employees include subcontractor employees.
    (b) In performing work under this contract, the contractor shall 
perform work safely, in a manner that ensures adequate protection for 
employees, the public, and the environment, and shall be accountable for 
the safe performance of work. The contractor shall exercise a degree of 
care commensurate with the work and the associated hazards. The 
contractor shall ensure that management of environment, safety and 
health (ES&H) functions and activities becomes an integral but visible 
part of the contractor's work planning and execution processes. The 
contractor shall, in the performance of work, ensure that:
    (1) Line management is responsible for the protection of employees, 
the public, and the environment. Line management includes those 
contractor and subcontractor employees managing or supervising employees 
performing work.
    (2) Clear and unambiguous lines of authority and responsibility for 
ensuring (ES&H) are established and maintained at all organizational 
levels.
    (3) Personnel possess the experience, knowledge, skills, and 
abilities that are necessary to discharge their responsibilities.
    (4) Resources are effectively allocated to address ES&H, 
programmatic, and operational considerations. Protecting employees, the 
public, and the environment is a priority whenever activities are 
planned and performed.
    (5) Before work is performed, the associated hazards are evaluated 
and an agreed-upon set of ES&H standards and requirements are 
established which, if properly implemented, provide adequate assurance 
that employees, the public, and the environment are protected from 
adverse consequences.
    (6) Administrative and engineering controls to prevent and mitigate 
hazards are tailored to the work being performed and associated hazards. 
Emphasis should be on designing the work and/or controls to reduce or 
eliminate the hazards and to prevent accidents and unplanned releases 
and exposures.
    (7) The conditions and requirements to be satisfied for operations 
to be initiated and conducted are established and agreed-upon by DOE and 
the contractor. These agreed-upon conditions and requirements are 
requirements of the contract and binding upon the contractor. The extent 
of documentation and level of authority for agreement shall be tailored 
to the complexity and hazards associated with the work and shall be 
established in a Safety Management System.
    (c) The contractor shall manage and perform work in accordance with 
a documented Safety Management System (System) that fulfills all 
conditions in paragraph (b) of this clause at a minimum. Documentation 
of the System shall describe how the contractor will:
    (1) Define the scope of work;
    (2) Identify and analyze hazards associated with the work;
    (3) Develop and implement hazard controls;
    (4) Perform work within controls; and
    (5) Provide feedback on adequacy of controls and continue to improve 
safety management.
    (d) The System shall describe how the contractor will establish, 
document, and implement safety performance objectives, performance 
measures, and commitments in response to DOE program and budget 
execution guidance while maintaining the integrity of the System. The 
System shall also describe how the contractor will measure system 
effectiveness.
    (e) The contractor shall submit to the contracting officer 
documentation of its System for review and approval. Dates for 
submittal, discussions, and revisions to the System will be established 
by the contracting officer. Guidance on the preparation, content, 
review, and approval of the System will be provided by the contracting 
officer. On an annual basis, the contractor shall review and update, for 
DOE approval, its safety performance objectives, performance measures, 
and commitments consistent with and in response to DOE's program and 
budget execution guidance and direction. Resources shall be identified 
and allocated to meet the safety objectives and performance commitments 
as well as maintain the integrity of the entire System. Accordingly, the 
System shall be integrated with the contractor's business processes for 
work planning, budgeting, authorization, execution, and change control.
    (f) The contractor shall comply with, and assist the Department of 
Energy in complying with, ES&H requirements of all applicable laws and 
regulations, and applicable directives identified in the clause of this 
contract entitled ``Laws, Regulations, and DOE Directives.'' The 
contractor shall cooperate with Federal and non-Federal agencies having 
jurisdiction over ES&H matters under this contract.
    (g) The contractor shall promptly evaluate and resolve any 
noncompliance with applicable ES&H requirements and the System. If the 
contractor fails to provide resolution or if, at any time, the 
contractor's acts or failure to act causes substantial harm or an 
imminent danger to the environment or health and safety of employees or 
the public, the contracting officer may issue an order stopping work in 
whole or in part. Any stop work

[[Page 464]]

order issued by a contracting officer under this clause (or issued by 
the contractor to a subcontractor in accordance with paragraph (i) of 
this clause) shall be without prejudice to any other legal or 
contractual rights of the Government. In the event that the contracting 
officer issues a stop work order, an order authorizing the resumption of 
the work may be issued at the discretion of the contracting officer. The 
contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time or additional 
fee or damages by reason of, or in connection with, any work stoppage 
ordered in accordance with this clause.
    (h) Regardless of the performer of the work, the contractor is 
responsible for compliance with the ES&H requirements applicable to this 
contract. The contractor is responsible for flowing down the ES&H 
requirements applicable to this contract to subcontracts at any tier to 
the extent necessary to ensure the contractor's compliance with the 
requirements.
    (i) The contractor shall include a clause substantially the same as 
this clause in subcontracts involving complex or hazardous work on site 
at a DOE-owned or -leased facility. Such subcontracts shall provide for 
the right to stop work under the conditions described in paragraph (g) 
of this clause. Depending on the complexity and hazards associated with 
the work, the contractor may choose not to require the subcontractor to 
submit a Safety Management System for the contractor's review and 
approval.

    (2) Computer software, as used in this clause, means (i) computer 
programs which are data comprising a series of instructions, rules, 
routines, or statements, regardless of the media in which recorded, that 
allow or cause a computer to perform a specific operation or series of 
operations and (ii) data comprising source code listings, design 
details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae, and related 
material that would enable the computer program to be produced, created, 
or compiled. The term does not include computer data bases.
    (3) Data, as used in this clause, means recorded information, 
regardless of form or the media on which it may be recorded. The term 
includes technical data and computer software. The term ``data'' does 
not include data incidental to the administration of this contract, such 
as financial, administrative, cost and pricing, or management 
information.
    (4) Limited rights data, as used in this clause, means data, other 
than computer software, developed at private expense that embody trade 
secrets or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged.

the progress of the work or in any event as the contracting officer 
shall direct upon completion or termination of this Contract. The 
Contractor agrees to leave a copy of such data at the facility or plant 
to which such data relate, and to make available for access or to 
deliver to the Government such data upon request by the contracting 
officer. If such data are limited rights data or restricted computer 
software, the rights of the Government in such data shall be governed 
solely by the provisions of paragraph (e) of this clause (``Rights in 
Limited Rights Data'') or paragraph (f) of this clause (``Rights in 
Restricted Computer Software''); and
    (v) The right to remove, cancel, correct, or ignore any markings not

if, in response to a written inquiry by DOE concerning the propriety of 
the markings, the Contractor fails to respond thereto within 60 days or 
fails to substantiate the propriety of the markings. In either case DOE 
will notify the Contractor of the action taken.
    (2) The Contractor shall have:
    (i) The right to withhold limited rights data and restricted 
computer software unless otherwise provided in accordance with the 
provisions of this clause; and

security or other provisions of this Contract, data it first produces in 
the performance of this Contract, except for data in DOE's Uranium 
Enrichment Technology, including diffusion, centrifuge, and atomic vapor 
laser isotope separation, provided the data requirements of this 
Contract have been met as of the date of the private use of such data.
    (3) The Contractor agrees that for limited rights data or restricted 
computer software or other technical, business or financial data in the 
form of recorded information which it receives from, or is given access 
to by, DOE or a third party, including a DOE Contractor

[[Page 467]]

or subcontractor, and for technical data or computer software it first 
produces under this Contract which is authorized to be marked by DOE, 
the Contractor shall treat such data in accordance with any restrictive 
legend contained thereon.
    (c) Copyrighted Material. (1) The Contractor shall not, without 
prior written authorization of the Patent Counsel, assert copyright in 
any technical data or computer software first produced in the 
performance of this contract. To the extent such authorization is 
granted, the Government reserves for itself and others acting on its 
behalf, a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable, world-wide license for 
Governmental purposes to publish, distribute, translate, duplicate, 
exhibit, and perform any such data copyrighted by the Contractor.
    (2) The Contractor agrees not to include in the technical data or

in paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. If the Contractor believes that such 
copyrighted material for which the license cannot be obtained must be 
included in the technical data or computer software to be delivered, 
rather than merely incorporated therein by reference, the Contractor 
shall obtain the written authorization of the contracting officer to 
include such material in the technical data or computer software prior 
to its delivery.
    (d) Subcontracting. (1) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting 
officer, the Contractor agrees to use in subcontracts in which technical 
data or computer software is expected to be produced or in subcontracts 
for supplies that contain a requirement for production or delivery of 
data in accordance with the policy and procedures of 48 CFR Subpart 27.4 
as supplemented by 48 CFR 927.401 through 927.409, the clause entitled, 
``Rights in Data-General'' at 48 CFR 52.227-14 modified in accordance 
with 927.409(a) and including Alternate V. Alternates II through IV of 
that clause may be included as appropriate with the prior approval of 
DOE Patent Counsel, and the Contractor shall not acquire rights in a 
subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software, 
except through the use of Alternates II or III, respectively, without 
the prior approval of DOE Patent Counsel. The clause at 48 CFR 52.227-
16, Additional Data Requirements, shall be included in subcontracts in 
accordance with DEAR 927.409(h). The contractor shall use instead the 
Rights in Data-Facilities clause at 48 CFR 970.5227-1 in subcontracts, 
including subcontracts for related support services, involving the 
design or operation of any plants or facilities or specially designed 
equipment for such plants or facilities that are managed or operated 
under its contract with DOE.
    (2) It is the responsibility of the Contractor to obtain from its 
subcontractors technical data and computer software and rights therein, 
on behalf of the Government, necessary to fulfill the Contractor's 
obligations to the Government with respect to such data. In the event of 
refusal by a subcontractor to accept a clause affording the Government 
such rights, the Contractor shall:
    (i) Promptly submit written notice to the contracting officer 
setting forth reasons or the subcontractor's refusal and other pertinent 
information which may expedite disposition of the matter, and
    (ii) Not proceed with the subcontract without the written 
authorization of the contracting officer.
    (3) Neither the Contractor nor higher-tier subcontractors shall use 
their power to award subcontracts as economic leverage to acquire rights 
in a subcontractor's limited rights data or restricted computer software 
for their private use.
    (e) Rights in Limited Rights Data. Except as may be otherwise 
specified in this Contract as data which are not subject to this 
paragraph, the Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the 
Government an irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license by or for the 
Government, in any limited rights data of the Contractor specifically 
used in the performance of this Contract, provided, however, that to the 
extent that any limited rights data when furnished or delivered is 
specifically identified by the Contractor at the time of initial 
delivery to the Government or a representative of the Government, such 
data shall not be used within or outside the Government except as 
provided in the ``Limited Rights Notice'' set forth. All such limited 
rights data shall be marked with the following ``Limited Rights 
Notice'':

                          Limited Rights Notice

    These data contain ``limited rights data,'' furnished under Contract 
No. ________ with the United States Department of Energy which may be 
duplicated and used by the Government with the express limitations that 
the ``limited rights data'' may not be disclosed outside the Government 
or be used for purposes of manufacture without prior permission of the 
Contractor, except that further disclosure or use may be made solely for 
the following purposes:
    (a) Use (except for manufacture) by support services contractors 
within the scope of their contracts;
    (b) This ``limited rights data'' may be disclosed for evaluation 
purposes under the restriction that the ``limited rights data'' be 
retained in confidence and not be further disclosed;

[[Page 468]]

    (c) This ``limited rights data'' may be disclosed to other 
contractors participating in the Government's program of which this 
Contract is a part for information or use (except for manufacture) in 
connection with the work performed under their contracts and under the

notice of 17 U.S.C. 401, the software will be presumed to be published 
copyrighted computer software licensed to the Government without 
disclosure prohibitions and with unlimited rights, unless the Contractor 
includes the following statement with such copyright notice 
``Unpublished-rights reserved under the Copyright Laws of the United 
States.''
    (g) Relationship to patents. Nothing contained in this clause 
creates or is intended to imply a license to the Government in any 
patent or is intended to be construed as affecting the scope of any 
licenses or other rights otherwise granted to the Government under any 
patent.

[[Page 471]]

a CRADA). The Contractor may obtain permission to assert copyright 
subsisting in technical data and computer software first produced by the 
Contractor in performance of this Contract, where the Contractor can 
show that commercialization would be enhanced by such copyright 
protection, subject to the following:
    (1) Contractor Request to Assert Copyright.
    (i) For data other than scientific and technical articles and data 
produced under a CRADA, the Contractor shall submit in writing to Patent 
Counsel its request to assert copyright in data first produced in the 
performance of this Contract pursuant to this clause. The right of the 
Contractor to copyright data first produced under a CRADA is as 
described in the individual CRADA. Each request by the Contractor must 
include:
    (A) The identity of the data (including any computer program) for 
which the Contractor requests permission to assert copyright, as well as 
an abstract which is descriptive of the data and is suitable for 
dissemination purposes, (B) The program under which it was funded, (C) 
Whether, to the best knowledge of the Contractor, the data is subject to 
an international treaty or agreement, (D) Whether the data is subject to 
export control, (E) A statement that the Contractor plans to 
commercialize the data in compliance with the clause of this contract 
entitled, ``Technology Transfer Mission,'' within five (5) years after 
obtaining permission to assert copyright or, on a case-by-case basis, a 
specified longer period where the Contractor can demonstrate that the 
ability to commercialize effectively is dependent upon such longer 
period, and (F) For data other than computer software, a statement 
explaining why the assertion of copyright is necessary to enhance 
commercialization and is consistent with DOE's dissemination 
responsibilities.
    (ii) For data that is developed using other funding sources in 
addition to DOE funding, the permission to assert copyright in 
accordance with this clause must also be obtained by the Contractor from 
all other funding sources prior to the Contractor's request to Patent 
Counsel. The request shall include the Contractor's certification or 
other documentation acceptable to Patent Counsel demonstrating such 
permission has been obtained.
    (iii) Permission for the Contractor to assert copyright in excepted 
categories of data as determined by DOE will be expressly withheld. Such 
excepted categories include data whose release (A) would be detrimental 
to national security, i.e., involve classified information or data or 
sensitive information under Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended, or are subject to export control for nonproliferation 
and other nuclear-related national security purposes, (B) would not 
enhance the appropriate transfer or dissemination and commercialization 
of such data, (C) would have a negative impact on U.S. industrial 
competitiveness, (D) would prevent DOE from meeting its obligations 
under treaties and international agreements, or (E) would be detrimental 
to one or more of DOE's programs. Additional excepted categories may be 
added by the Assistant General Counsel for Technology Transfer and 
Intellectual Property. Where data are determined to be under export 
control restriction, the Contractor may obtain permission to assert 
copyright subject to the provisions of this clause for purposes of 
limited commercialization in a manner that complies with export control 
statutes and applicable regulations. In addition, notwithstanding any 
other provision of this Contract, all data developed with Naval 
Reactors' funding and those data that are classified fall within 
excepted categories. The rights of the Contractor in data are subject to 
the disposition of data rights in the treaties and international 
agreements identified under this Contract as well as those additional 
treaties and international agreements which DOE may from time to time 
identify by unilateral amendment to the Contract; such amendment listing 
added treaties and international agreements is effective only for data 
which is developed after the date such treaty or international agreement 
is added to this Contract. Also, the Contractor will not be permitted to 
assert copyright in data in the form of various technical reports 
generated by the Contractor under the Contract without first obtaining 
the advanced written permission of the contracting officer.
    (2) DOE Review and Response to Contractor's Request. The Patent 
Counsel shall use its best efforts to respond in writing within 90 days 
of receipt of a complete request by the Contractor to assert copyright 
in technical data and computer software pursuant to this clause. Such 
response shall either give or withhold DOE's permission for the 
Contractor to assert copyright or advise the Contractor that DOE needs 
additional time to respond, and the reasons therefor.
    (3) Permission for Contractor to Assert Copyright.
    (i) For computer software, the Contractor shall furnish to the DOE 
designated, centralized software distribution and control point, the 
Energy Science and Technology Software Center, at the time permission to 
assert copyright is given under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause: (A) An 
abstract describing the software suitable for publication, (B) the 
source code for each software program, and (C) the object code and at 
least the minimum support documentation needed by a technically 
competent user to understand and use the software. The Patent Counsel, 
for good cause shown by the Contractor, may

[[Page 472]]

allow the minimum support documentation to be delivered within 60 days 
after permission to assert copyright is given or at such time the 
minimum support documentation becomes available. The Contractor 
acknowledges that the DOE designated software distribution and control 
point may provide a technical description of the software in an 
announcement identifying its availability from the copyright holder.
    (ii) Unless otherwise directed by the contracting officer, for data 
other than computer software to which the Contractor has received 
permission to assert copyright under paragraph (e)(2) of this clause 
above, the Contractor shall within sixty (60) days of obtaining such 
permission furnish to DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical 
Information (OSTI) a copy of such data as well as an abstract of the 
data suitable for dissemination purposes. The Contractor acknowledges 
that OSTI may provide an abstract of the data in an announcement to DOE, 
its contractors and to the public identifying its availability from the 
copyright holder.
    (iii) For a five year period or such other specified period as 
specifically approved by Patent Counsel beginning on the date the 
Contractor is given permission to assert copyright in data, the 
Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a 
paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted 
data to reproduce, prepare derivative works and perform publicly and 
display publicly, by or on behalf of the Government. Upon request, the 
initial period may be extended after DOE approval. The DOE approval will 
be based on the standard that the work is still commercially available 
and the market demand is being met.
    (iv) After the period approved by Patent Counsel for application of 
the limited Government license described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of 
this clause, or if, prior to the end of such period(s), the Contractor 
abandons commercialization activities pertaining to the data to which 
the Contractor has been given permission to assert copyright, the 
Contractor grants to the Government, and others acting on its behalf, a 
paid-up, nonexclusive, irrevocable worldwide license in such copyrighted 
data to reproduce, distribute copies to the public, prepare derivative 
works, perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do 
so.
    (v) Whenever the Contractor asserts copyright in data pursuant to 
this paragraph (e), the Contractor shall affix the applicable copyright 
notice of 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402 on the copyrighted data and also an 
acknowledgment of the Government sponsorship and license rights of 
paragraphs (e)(3) (iii) and (iv) of this clause. Such action shall be 
taken when the data are delivered to the Government, published, licensed 
or deposited for registration as a published work in the U.S. Copyright 
Office. The acknowledgment of Government sponsorship and license rights 
shall be as follows: Notice: These data were produced by (insert name of 
Contractor) under Contract No. _______ with the Department of Energy. 
For (period approved by DOE Patent Counsel) from (date permission to 
assert copyright was obtained), the Government is granted for itself and 
others acting on its behalf a nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable 
worldwide license in this data to reproduce, prepare derivative works, 
and perform publicly and display publicly, by or on behalf of the 
Government. There is provision for the possible extension of the term of 
this license. Subsequent to that period or any extension granted, the 
Government is granted for itself and others acting on its behalf a 
nonexclusive, paid-up, irrevocable worldwide license in this data to 
reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies to the public, 
perform publicly and display publicly, and to permit others to do so. 
The specific term of the license can be identified by inquiry made to 
Contractor or DOE. Neither the United States nor the United States 
Department of Energy, nor any of their employees, makes any warranty, 
express or implied, or assumes any legal liability or responsibility for 
the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any data , apparatus, 
product, or process disclosed, or represents that its use would not 
infringe privately owned rights.

                             (End of Notice)

    (vi) With respect to any data to which the Contractor has received 
permission to assert copyright, the DOE has the right, during the five 
(5) year or specified longer period approved by Patent Counsel as 
provided for in paragraph (e) of this clause, to request the Contractor 
to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license in any 
field of use to a responsible applicant(s) upon terms that are 
reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Contractor refuses such 
request, to grant such license itself, if the DOE determines that the 
Contractor has not made a satisfactory demonstration that either it or 
its licensee(s) is actively pursuing commercialization of the data as 
set forth in subparagraph (e)(1)(A) of this clause. Before licensing 
under this subparagraph (vi), DOE shall furnish the Contractor a written 
request for the Contractor to grant the stated license, and the 
Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days (or such longer period as 
may be authorized by the contracting officer for good cause shown in 
writing by the Contractor) after such notice to show cause why the 
license should not be granted. The Contractor shall have the right to 
appeal the decision of the DOE to grant the stated license to the 
Invention Licensing Appeal Board as set forth in 10 CFR 781.65--
''Appeals.''

[[Page 473]]

    (vii) No costs shall be allowable for maintenance of copyrighted 
data, primarily for the benefit of the Contractor and/or a licensee 
which exceeds DOE Program needs, except as expressly provided in writing 
by the contracting officer. The Contractor may use its net royalty 
income to effect such maintenance costs.
    (viii) At any time the Contractor abandons commercialization 
activities for data for which the Contractor has received permission to 
assert copyright in accordance with this clause, it shall advise OSTI 
and Patent Counsel and upon request assign the copyright to the 
Government so that the Government can distribute the data to the public.
    (4) The following notice may be placed on computer software prior to 
any publication and prior to the Contractor's obtaining permission from 
the Department of Energy to assert copyright in the computer software 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    Notice: This computer software was prepared by [insert the 
Contractor's name and the individual author], hereinafter the 
Contractor, under Contract [insert the Contract Number] with the

require specific changes to such procedures. Such implementing 
procedures shall include procedures to:
    (1) Inform employees of and require conformance with standards of 
conduct and integrity in connection with the CRADA activity in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (n)(5) of this clause;
    (2) Review and approve employee activities so as to avoid conflicts 
of interest arising from commercial utilization activities relating to 
Contractor-developed Intellectual Property;
    (3) Conduct work performed using royalties so as to avoid 
interference with or adverse effects on ongoing DOE projects and 
programs;
    (4) Conduct activities relating to commercial utilization of 
Contractor-developed Intellectual Property so as to avoid interference 
with or adverse effects on user facility or WFO activities of the 
Contractor;
    (5) Conduct DOE-funded projects and programs so as to avoid the 
appearance of conflicts of interest or actual conflicts of interest with 
non-Government funded work;
    (6) Notify the contracting officer with respect to any new work to 
be performed or proposed to be performed under the Contract for DOE or 
other Federal agencies where the new work or proposal involves 
Intellectual Property in which the Contractor has obtained or intends to 
request or elect title;
    (7) Except as provided elsewhere in this Contract, obtain the 
approval of the contracting officer for any licensing of or assignment 
of title to Intellectual Property rights by the Contractor to any 
business or corporate affiliate of the Contractor;
    (8) Obtain the approval of the contracting officer prior to any 
assignment, exclusive licensing, or option for exclusive licensing, of 
Intellectual Property to any individual who has been a Laboratory 
employee within the previous two years or to the company in which the 
individual is a principal; and
    (9) Notify non-Federal sponsors of WFO activities, or non-Federal 
users of user facilities, of any relevant Intellectual Property interest 
of the Contractor prior to execution of WFOs or user agreements.

[[Page 477]]

    (10) Notify DOE prior to evaluating a proposal by a third party or 
DOE, when the subject matter of the proposal involves an elected or 
waived subject invention under this contract or one in which the 
Contractor intends to elect to retain title under this contract.
    (e) Fairness of Opportunity. In conducting its technology transfer 
activities, the Contractor shall prepare procedures and take all 
reasonable measures to ensure widespread notice of availability of 
technologies suited for transfer and opportunities for exclusive 
licensing and joint research arrangements. The requirement to widely 
disseminate the availability of technology transfer opportunities does 
not apply to a specific application originated outside of the Laboratory 
and by entities other than the Contractor.
    (f) U.S. Industrial Competitiveness. (1) In the interest of 
enhancing U.S. Industrial Competitiveness, the Contractor shall, in its 
licensing and assignments of Intellectual Property, give preference in 
such a manner as to enhance the accrual of economic and technological 
benefits to the U.S. domestic economy. The Contractor shall consider the 
following factors in all of its licensing and assignment decisions 
involving Laboratory intellectual property where the Laboratory obtains 
rights during the course of the Contractor's operation of the Laboratory 
under this contract:
    (i) whether any resulting design and development will be performed 
in the United States and whether resulting products, embodying parts, 
including components thereof, will be substantially manufactured in the 
United States; or
    (ii) (A) whether the proposed licensee or assignee has a business 
unit located in the United States and whether significant economic and 
technical benefits will flow to the United States as a result of the 
license or assignment agreement; and
    (B) in licensing any entity subject to the control of a foreign 
company or government, whether such foreign government permits United 
States agencies, organizations or other persons to enter into 
cooperative research and development agreements and licensing 
agreements, and has policies to protect United States Intellectual 
Property rights.
    (2) If the Contractor determines that neither of the conditions in 
paragraphs (f)(1)(i) or (ii) of this clause are likely to be fulfilled, 
the Contractor, prior to entering into such an agreement, must obtain 
the approval of the contracting officer. The contracting officer shall 
act on any such requests for approval within thirty (30) days.
    (3) The Contractor agrees to be bound by the provisions of 35 U.S.C. 
204 (Preference for United States industry).
    (g) Indemnity--Product Liability. In entering into written 
technology transfer agreements, including but not limited to, research 
and development agreements, licenses, assignments and CRADAs, the 
Contractor agrees to include in such agreements a requirement that the 
U.S. Government and the Contractor, except for any negligent acts or 
omissions of the Contractor, be indemnified for all damages, costs, and 
expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising from personal injury or 
property damage occurring as a result of the making, using or selling of 
a product, process or service by or on behalf of the Participant, its 
assignees or licensees which was derived from the work performed under 
the agreement. The Contractor shall identify and obtain the approval of 
the contracting officer for any proposed exceptions to this requirement 
such as where State or local law expressly prohibit the Participant from 
providing indemnification or where the research results will be placed 
in the public domain.
    (h) Disposition of Income. (1) Royalties or other income earned or 
retained by the Contractor as a result of performance of authorized 
technology transfer activities herein shall be used by the Contractor 
for scientific research, development, technology transfer, and education 
at the Laboratory, consistent with the research and development mission 
and objectives of the Laboratory and subject to Section 12(b)(5) of the 
Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 
U.S.C. 3710a(b)(5)) and Chapter 38 of the Patent Laws (35 U.S.C. 200 et 
seq.) as amended through the effective date of this contract award or 
modification. If the net amounts of such royalties and income received 
from patent licensing after payment of patenting costs, licensing costs, 
payments to inventors and other expenses incidental to the 
administration of Subject Inventions during any fiscal year exceed 5 
percent of the Laboratory's budget for that fiscal year, 75 percent of 
such excess amounts shall be paid to the Treasury of the United States, 
and the remaining amount of such excess shall be used by the Contractor 
for the purposes as described above in this paragraph. Any inventions 
arising out of such scientific research and development activities shall 
be deemed to be Subject Inventions under the Contract.
    (2) The Contractor shall include as a part of its annual Laboratory 
Institutional Plan or other such annual document a plan setting out 
those uses to which royalties and other income received as a result of 
performance of authorized technology transfer activities herein will be 
applied at the Laboratory, and at the end of the year, provide a 
separate accounting for how the funds were actually used. Under no 
circumstances shall these royalties and income be used for an illegal 
augmentation of funds furnished by the U.S. Government.
    (3) The Contractor shall establish subject to the approval of the 
contracting officer a

[[Page 478]]

policy for making awards or sharing of royalties with Contractor 
employees, other coinventors and coauthors, including Federal employee 
coinventors when deemed appropriate by the contracting officer.
    (i) Transfer to Successor Contractor. In the event of termination or 
upon the expiration of this Contract, any unexpended balance of income 
received for use at the Laboratory shall be transferred, at the 
contracting officer's request, to a successor contractor, or in the 
absence of a successor contractor, to such other entity as designated by 
the contracting officer. The Contractor shall transfer title, as one 
package, to the extent the Contractor retains title, in all patents and 
patent applications, licenses, accounts containing royalty revenues from 
such license agreements, including equity positions in third party 
entities, and other Intellectual Property rights which arose at the 
Laboratory, to the successor contractor or to the Government as directed 
by the contracting officer.
    (j) Technology Transfer Affecting the National Security. (1) The 
Contractor shall notify and obtain the approval of the contracting 
officer, prior to entering into any technology transfer arrangement, 
when such technology or any part of such technology is classified or 
sensitive under Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2168). 
Such notification shall include sufficient information to enable DOE to 
determine the extent that commercialization of such technology would 
enhance or diminish security interests of the United States, or diminish 
communications within DOE's nuclear weapon production complex. DOE shall 
use its best efforts to complete its determination within sixty (60) 
days of the Contractor's notification, and provision of any supporting 
information, and DOE shall promptly notify the Contractor as to whether 
the technology is transferable.
    (2) The Contractor shall include in all of its technology transfer 
agreements with third parties, including, but not limited to, CRADAs, 
licensing agreements and assignments, notice to such third parties that 
the export of goods and/or Technical Data from the United States may 
require some form of export control license or other authority from the 
U.S. Government and that failure to obtain such export control license 
may result in criminal liability under U.S. laws.
    (3) For other than fundamental research as defined in National 
Security Decision Directive 189, the Contractor is responsible to 
conduct internal export control reviews and assure that technology is 
transferred in accordance with applicable law.
    (k) Records. The Contractor shall maintain records of its technology 
transfer activities in a manner and to the extent satisfactory to the 
DOE and specifically including, but not limited to, the licensing 
agreements, assignments and the records required to implement the 
requirements of paragraphs (e), (f), and (h) of this clause and shall 
provide reports to the contracting officer to enable DOE to maintain the 
reporting requirements of Section 12(c)(6) of the Stevenson-Wydler 
Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3710a(c)(6)). 
Such reports shall be made annually in a format to be agreed upon 
between the Contractor and DOE and in such a format which will serve to 
adequately inform DOE of the Contractor's technology transfer activities 
while protecting any data not subject to disclosure under the Rights in 
Technical Data clause and paragraph (n) of this clause. Such records 
shall be made available in accordance with the clauses of this Contract 
pertaining to inspection, audit and examination of records.
    (l) Reports to Congress. To facilitate DOE's reporting to Congress, 
the Contractor is required to submit annually to DOE a technology 
transfer plan for conducting its technology transfer function for the 
upcoming year, including plans for securing Intellectual Property rights 
in Laboratory innovations with commercial promise and plans for managing 
such innovations so as to benefit the competitiveness of United States 
industry. This plan shall be provided to the contracting officer on or 
before October 1st of each year.
    (m) Oversight and Appraisal. The Contractor is responsible for 
developing and implementing effective internal controls for all 
technology transfer activities consistent with the audit and record 
requirements of this Contract. Laboratory Contractor performance in 
implementing the technology transfer mission and the effectiveness of 
the Contractor's procedures will be evaluated by the contracting officer 
as part of the annual appraisal process, with input from the cognizant 
Secretarial Officer or program office.
    (n) Technology Transfer Through Cooperative Research and Development 
Agreements. Upon approval of the contracting officer and as provided in 
a DOE approved Joint Work Statement (JWS), the Laboratory Director, or 
designee, may enter into CRADAs on behalf of the DOE subject to the 
requirements set forth in this paragraph.
    (1) Review and Approval of CRADAs. (i) Except as otherwise directed 
in writing by the contracting officer, each JWS shall be submitted to 
the contracting officer for approval. The Contractor's Laboratory 
Director or designee shall provide a program mission impact statement 
and shall include an impact statement regarding related Intellectual 
Property rights known by the Contractor to be owned by the Government to 
assist the contracting officer in the approval determination.
    (ii) The Contractor shall also include (specific to the proposed 
CRADA), a statement of

[[Page 479]]

compliance with the Fairness of Opportunity requirements of paragraph 
(e) of this clause.
    (iii) Within ninety (90) days after submission of a JWS, the 
contracting officer shall approve, disapprove or request modification to 
the JWS. If a modification is required, the contracting officer shall 
approve or disapprove any resubmission of the JWS within thirty (30) 
days of its resubmission, or ninety (90) days from the date of the 
original submission, whichever is later. The contracting officer shall 
provide a written explanation to the Contractor's Laboratory Director or 
designee of any disapproval or requirement for modification of a JWS.
    (iv) Upon approval of a JWS, the Contractor's Laboratory Director or 
designee may submit a CRADA, based upon the approved JWS, to the 
contracting officer. The contracting officer, within thirty (30) days of 
receipt of the CRADA, shall approve or request modification of the 
CRADA. If the contracting officer requests a modification of the CRADA, 
an explanation of such request shall be provided to the Laboratory 
Director or designee.
    (v) Except as otherwise directed in writing by the contracting 
officer, the Contractor shall not enter into, or begin work under, a 
CRADA until approval of the CRADA has been granted by the contracting 
officer. The Contractor may submit its proposed CRADA to the contracting 
officer at the time of submitting its proposed JWS or any time 
thereafter. However, the contracting officer is not obligated to respond 
under paragraph (n)(1)(iv) of this clause until within thirty (30) days 
after approval of the JWS or thirty (30) days after submittal of the 
CRADA, whichever is later.
    (2) Selection of Participants. The Contractor's Laboratory Director 
or designee in deciding what CRADA to enter into shall:
    (i) Give special consideration to small business firms, and 
consortia involving small business firms;
    (ii) Give preference to business units located in the United States 
which agree that products or processes embodying Intellectual Property 
will be substantially manufactured or practiced in the United States 
and, in the case of any industrial organization or other person subject 
to the control of a foreign company or government, take into 
consideration whether or not such foreign government permits United 
States agencies, organizations, or other persons to enter into 
cooperative research and development agreements and licensing 
agreements;
    (iii) Provide Fairness of Opportunity in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (e) of this clause; and
    (iv) Give consideration to the Conflicts of Interest requirements of 
paragraph (d) of this clause.
    (3) Withholding of Data. (i) Data that is first produced as a result 
of research and development activities conducted under a CRADA and that 
would be a trade secret or commercial or financial data that would be 
privileged or confidential, if such data had been obtained from a non-
Federal third party, may be protected from disclosure under the Freedom 
of Information Act as provided in the Stevenson-Wydler Technology 
Innovation Act of 1980, as amended (15 U.S.C. 3710a(c)(7)) for a period 
as agreed in the CRADA of up to five (5)years from the time the data is 
first produced. The DOE shall cooperate with the Contractor in 
protecting such data.
    (ii) Unless otherwise expressly approved by the contracting officer 
in advance for a specific CRADA, the Contractor agrees, at the request 
of the contracting officer, to transmit such data to other DOE 
facilities for use by DOE or its Contractors by or on behalf of the 
Government. When data protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this 
clause is so transferred, the Contractor shall clearly mark the data 
with a legend setting out the restrictions against private use and 
further dissemination, along with the expiration date of such 
restrictions.
    (iii) In addition to its authority to license Intellectual Property, 
the Contractor may enter into licensing agreements with third parties 
for data developed by the Contractor under a CRADA subject to other 
provisions of this Contract. However, the Contractor shall neither use 
the protection against dissemination nor the licensing of data as an 
alternative to the submittal of invention disclosures which include data 
protected pursuant to paragraph (n)(3)(i) of this clause.
    (4) Work For Others and User Facility Programs. (i) WFO and User 
Facility Agreements (UFAs) are not CRADAs and will be available for use 
by the Contractor in addition to CRADAs for achieving utilization of 
employee expertise and unique facilities for maximizing technology 
transfer. The Contractor agrees form prospective CRADA participants, 
which are intending to substantially pay full cost recovery for the 
effort under a proposed CRADA, of the availability of alternative forms 
of agreements, i.e., WFO and UFA, and of the Class Patent Waiver 
provisions associated therewith.
    (ii) Where the Contractor believes that the transfer of technology 
to the U.S. domestic economy will benefit from, or other equity 
considerations dictate, an arrangement other than the Class Waiver of 
patent rights to the sponsor in WFO and UFAs, a request may be made to 
the contracting officer for an exception to the Class Waivers.
    (iii) Rights to inventions made under agreements other than funding 
agreements with third parties shall be governed by the appropriate 
provisions incorporated, with DOE approval, in such agreements, and the

[[Page 480]]

provisions in such agreements take precedence over any disposition of 
rights contained in this Contract. Disposition of rights under any such 
agreement shall be in accordance with any DOE class waiver (including 
Work for Others and User Class Waivers) or individually negotiated 
waiver which applies to the agreement.
    (5) Conflicts of Interest. (i) Except as provided in paragraph 
(n)(5)(iii) of this clause, the Contractor shall assure that no employee 
of the Contractor shall have a substantial role (including an advisory 
role) in the preparation, negotiation, or approval of a CRADA, if, to 
such employee's knowledge:
    (A) Such employee, or the spouse, child, parent, sibling, or partner 
of such employee, or an organization (other than the Contractor) in 
which such employee serves as an officer, director, trustee, partner, or 
employee--
    (1) holds financial interest in any entity, other than the 
Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the preparation, 
negotiation, or approval of the CRADA;
    (2) receives a gift or gratuity from any entity, other than the 
Contractor, that has a substantial interest in the preparation, 
negotiation, or approval of the CRADA; or
    (B) A financial interest in any entity, other than the Contractor, 
that has a substantial interest in the preparation, negotiation, or 
approval of the CRADA, is held by any person or organization with whom 
such employee is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning 
prospective employment.
    (ii) The Contractor shall require that each employee of the 
Contractor who has a substantial role (including an advisory role) in 
the preparation, negotiation, or approval of a CRADA certify through the 
Contractor to the contracting officer that the circumstances described 
in paragraph (n)(5)(i) of this clause do not apply to that employee.
    (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (n)(5)(i) and (n)(5)(ii) of 
this clause shall not apply in a case where the contracting officer is 
advised by the Contractor in advance of the participation of an employee 
described in those paragraphs in the preparation, negotiation or 
approval of a CRADA of the nature of and extent of any financial 
interest described in paragraph (n)(5)(i) of this clause, and the 
contracting officer determines that such financial interest is not so 
substantial as to be considered likely to affect the integrity of the 
Contractor employee's participation in the process of preparing, 
negotiating, or approving the CRADA.
    (o) Technology Transfer in Other Cost-Sharing Agreements. In 
conducting research and development activities in cost-shared agreements 
not covered by paragraph (n) of this clause, the Contractor, with prior 
written permission of the contracting officer, may provide for the 
withholding of data produced thereunder in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of paragraph (n)(3) of this clause.

                             (End of clause)

    Alternate I (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.2770-4(b), add

    (i) Inventions within or relating to the following fields of 
technology are exceptional circumstance subject inventions:
    (A) uranium enrichment technology;
    (B) storage and disposal of civilian high-level nuclear waste and 
spent fuel technology; and
    (C) national security technologies classified or sensitive under 
Section 148 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2168).
    (ii) Inventions made under any agreement, contract or subcontract 
related to the following are exceptional circumstance subject 
inventions:
    (A) DOE Steel Initiative and Metals Initiative;
    (B) U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium; and
    (C) any funding agreement which is funded in part by the Electric 
Power Research Institute (EPRI) or the Gas Research Institute (GRI).
    (iii) DOE reserves the right to unilaterally amend this contract to 
modify, by deletion or insertion, technical fields, tasks, or other 
classifications for the purpose of determining DOE exceptional 
circumstance subject inventions.
    (3) Treaties and international agreements. Any rights acquired by 
the Contractor in subject inventions are subject to any disposition of 
right, title, or interest in or to subject inventions provided for in 
treaties or international agreements identified at Appendix [Insert 
Reference] to this contract. DOE reserves the right to unilaterally 
amend this contract to identify specific treaties or international 
agreements entered into or to be entered into by the Government after 
the effective date of this contract and to effectuate those license or 
other rights which are necessary for the Government to meet its 
obligations to foreign governments, their nationals and international 
organizations under such treaties or international agreements with 
respect to subject inventions made after the date of the amendment.
    (4) Contractor request for greater rights in exceptional 
circumstance subject inventions. The Contractor may request rights 
greater than allowed by the exceptional circumstance determination in an 
exceptional circumstance subject invention by submitting such a request 
in writing to Patent Counsel at the time the exceptional circumstance 
subject invention is disclosed to DOE or within eight (8) months after 
conception or first actual

[[Page 484]]

reduction to practice of the exceptional circumstance subject invention, 
whichever occurs first, unless a longer period is authorized in writing 
by the Patent Counsel for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor. 
DOE may, in its discretion, grant or refuse to grant such a request by 
the Contractor.
    (5) Contractor employee-inventor rights. If the Contractor does not 
elect to retain title to a subject invention or does not request greater 
rights in an exceptional circumstance subject invention, a Contractor 
employee-inventor, after consultation with the Contractor and with 
written authorization from the Contractor in accordance with 10 CFR 
784.9(b)(4), may request greater rights, including title, in the subject 
invention or the exceptional circumstance invention from DOE, and DOE 
may, in its discretion, grant or refuse to grant such a request by the 
Contractor employee-inventor.
    (6) Government assignment of rights in Government employees' subject 
inventions. If a Government employee is a joint inventor of a subject 
invention or of an exceptional circumstance subject invention to which 
the Contractor has rights, the Government may assign or refuse to assign 
to the Contractor any rights in the subject invention or exceptional 
circumstance subject invention acquired by the Government from the 
Government employee, in accordance with 48 CFR 27.304-1(d). The rights 
assigned to the Contractor are subject to any provision of this clause 
that is applicable to subject inventions in which the Contractor retains 
title, including reservation by the Government of a nonexclusive, 
nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license, except that the 
Contractor shall file its initial patent application claiming the 
subject invention or exceptional circumstance invention within one (1) 
year after the assignment of such rights. The Contractor shall share 
royalties collected for the manufacture, use or sale of the subject 
invention with the Government employee, as DOE deems appropriate.
    (c) Subject Invention Disclosure, Election of Title and Filing of 
Patent Application by Contractor.
    (1) Subject invention disclosure. The contractor will disclose each 
subject invention to the Patent Counsel within two months after the 
inventor discloses it in writing to contractor personnel responsible for 
patent matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a 
written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention 
was made and the inventor(s) and all sources of funding by B&R code for 
the invention. It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to 
convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the 
disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, 
chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The 
disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of 
the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been 
submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for 
publication at the time of disclosure. The disclosure shall include a 
written statement as to whether the invention falls within an 
exceptional circumstance field. DOE will make a determination and advise 
the Contractor within 30 days of receipt of an invention disclosure as 
to whether the invention is an exceptional circumstance subject 
invention. In addition, after disclosure to the Patent Counsel, the 
Contractor will promptly notify the agency of the acceptance of any 
manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or 
public use planned by the contractor. The Contractor shall obtain 
approval from Patent Counsel prior to any release or publication of 
information concerning any nonelectable subject invention such as an 
exceptional circumstance subject invention or any subject invention 
related to a treaty or international agreement.
    (2) Election by the Contractor. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this clause, the Contractor will elect in writing whether or 
not to retain title to any such invention by notifying the Federal 
agency within two years of disclosure to the Federal agency. However, in 
any case where publication, on sale or public use has initiated the one 
year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be 
obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be 
shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to 
the end of the statutory period.
    (3) Filing of patent applications by the Contractor. The Contractor 
will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which 
it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if 
earlier, or prior to the end of any 1-year statutory period wherein 
valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a 
publication, on sale, or public use. The Contractor will file patent 
applications in additional countries or international patent offices 
within either ten months of the corresponding initial patent application 
or six months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of 
Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such 
filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.
    (4) Contractor's request for an extension of time. Requests for an 
extension of the time for disclosure, election, and filing under 
subparagraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3) may, at the discretion of Patent 
Counsel, be granted.

[[Page 485]]

    (5) Publication Approval. During the course of the work under this 
contract, the Contractor or its employees may desire to release or 
publish information regarding scientific or technical developments 
conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or 
under this contract. In order that public disclosure of such information 
will not adversely affect the patent interest of DOE or the Contractor, 
approval for release or publication shall be secured from the Contractor 
personnel responsible for patent matters prior to any such release or 
publication. Where DOE's approval of publication is requested, DOE's 
response to such requests for approval shall normally be provided within 
90 days except in circumstances in which a domestic patent application 
must be filed in order to protect foreign rights. In the case involving 
foreign patent rights, DOE shall be granted an additional 180 days with 
which to respond to the request for approval, unless extended by mutual 
agreement.
    (d) Conditions When the Government May Obtain Title.
    The Contractor will convey to the DOE, upon written request, title 
to any subject invention--
    (1) If the Contractor fails to disclose or elect title to the 
subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this 
clause, or elects not to retain title; provided, that DOE may only 
request title within sixty (60) days after learning of the failure of 
the Contractor to disclose or to elect within the specified times.
    (2) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file a 
patent application within the times specified in subparagraph (c) of 
this clause; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a 
patent application in a country after the times specified in 
subparagraph (c) above, but prior to its receipt of the written request 
of the DOE, the Contractor shall continue to retain title in that 
country.
    (3) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue 
the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, 
or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a 
subject invention.
    (4) If the Contractor requests that DOE acquire title or rights from 
the Contractor in a subject invention to which the Contractor had 
initially retained title or rights, or in an exceptional circumstance 
subject invention to which the Contractor was granted greater rights, 
DOE may acquire such title or rights from the Contractor, or DOE may 
decide against acquiring such title or rights from the Contractor, at 
DOE's sole discretion.
    (e) Minimum Rights of the Contractor and Protection of the 
Contractor's Right to File.
    (1) Request for a Contractor license. The Contractor may request the 
right to reserve a revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license 
throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government 
obtains title, except if the Contractor fails to disclose the invention 
within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. DOE may 
grant or refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor. When DOE 
approves such reservation, the Contractor's license will normally extend 
to its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the 
corporate structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the 
right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the 
Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was 
awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of DOE, 
except when transferred to the successor of that part of the 
contractor's business to which the invention pertains.
    (2) Revocation or modification of a Contractor license. The 
Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by DOE to the 
extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the 
subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license 
submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR Part 404 
and DOE licensing regulations at 10 CFR Part 781. This license will not 
be revoked in the field of use or the geographical areas in which the 
Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the 
benefits of the subject invention reasonably accessible to the public. 
The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the 
discretion of DOE to the extent the Contractor, its licensees, or the 
domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical 
application of the subject invention in that foreign country.
    (3) Notice of revocation of modification of a Contractor license. 
Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE will furnish the 
Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the 
license, and the Contractor will be allowed thirty days (or such other 
time as may be authorized by DOE for good cause shown by the Contractor) 
after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or 
modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal, in accordance with 
applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and DOE licensing regulations 
at 10 CFR part 781 concerning the licensing of Government owned 
inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of 
the license.
    (f) Contractor Action to Protect the Government's Interest.
    (1) Execution of delivery of title or license instruments. The 
Contractor agrees to execute or to have executed, and promptly deliver 
to the Patent Counsel all instruments necessary to accomplish the 
following actions:
    (i) establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout 
the world in those

[[Page 486]]

subject inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain title, and
    (ii) convey title to DOE when requested under subparagraphs (b) or 
paragraph (d) of this clause and to enable the Government to obtain 
patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.
    (2) Contractor employee agreements. The Contractor agrees to 
require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and 
nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to Contractor 
personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent 
matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor, each subject 
invention made under this contract in order that the Contractor can 
comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, 
and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on 
subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the 
subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, 
the information required by subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The 
Contractor shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or 
other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting 
inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent 
applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.
    (3) Notification of discontinuation of patent protection. The 
contractor will notify the Patent Counsel of any decision not to 
continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, 
or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in 
any country, not less than thirty days before the expiration of the 
response period required by the relevant patent office.
    (4) Notification of Government rights. The contractor agrees to 
include, within the specification of any United States patent 
applications and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject 
invention, the following statement, ``This invention was made with 
government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify 
the Federal agency). The government has certain rights in the 
invention.''
    (5) Invention Identification Procedures. The Contractor shall 
establish and maintain active and effective procedures to ensure that 
subject inventions are promptly identified and timely disclosed and 
shall submit a written description of such procedures to the Contracting 
Officer so that the Contracting Officer may evaluate and determine their 
effectiveness.
    (6) Invention Filing Documentation. If the Contractor files a 
domestic or foreign patent application claiming a subject invention, the 
Contractor shall promptly submit to Patent Counsel, upon request, the 
following information and documents:
    (i) the filing date, serial number, title, and a copy of the patent 
application (including an English-language version if filed in a 
language other than English);
    (ii) an executed and approved instrument fully confirmatory of all 
Government rights in the subject invention; and
    (iii) the patent number, issue date, and a copy of any issued patent 
claiming the subject invention.
    (7) Duplication and disclosure of documents. The Government may 
duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other 
reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to 
this clause; provided, however, that any such duplication or disclosure 
by the Government is subject to the confidentiality provision at 35 
U.S.C. 205 and 37 CFR Part 40.
    (g) Subcontracts.
    (1) Subcontractor subject inventions. The Contractor shall not 
obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions as part of the 
consideration for awarding a subcontract.
    (2) Inclusion of patent rights clause--non-profit organization or 
small business firm subcontractors. Unless otherwise authorized or 
directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall include the 
patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-11, suitably modified to identify 
the parties, in all subcontracts, at any tier, for experimental, 
developmental, demonstration or research work to be performed by a small 
business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except subcontracts 
which are subject to exceptional circumstances in accordance with 35 
U.S.C. 202 and subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause. The subcontractor 
retains all rights provided for the contractor in the patent rights 
clause at 48 CFR 952.227-11.
    (3) Inclusion of patent rights clause--subcontractors other than 
non-profit organizations and small business firms. Except for the 
subcontracts described in subparagraph (g)(2) of this clause, the 
Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-13, 
suitably modified to identify the parties, in any contract for 
experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work. For 
subcontracts subject to exceptional circumstances, the contractor must 
consult with DOE patent counsel with respect to the appropriate patent 
clause.
    (4) DOE and subcontractor contract. With respect to subcontracts at 
any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the 
mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a 
contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to the matters 
covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph 
is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act 
in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.
    (5) Subcontractor refusal to accept terms of patent clause. If a 
prospective subcontractor

[[Page 487]]

refuses to accept the terms of a patent rights clause, the Contractor 
shall promptly submit a written notice to the Contracting Officer 
stating the subcontractor's reasons for such a refusal, including any 
relevant information for expediting disposition of the matter, and the 
Contractor shall not proceed with the subcontract without the written 
authorization of the Contracting Officer.
    (6) Notification of award of subcontract. Upon the award of any 
subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause, the 
Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing and 
identify the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the 
work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and 
estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the 
Contractor shall furnish a copy of a subcontract.
    (7) Identification of subcontractor subject inventions. If the 
Contractor in the performance of this contract becomes aware of a 
subject invention made under a subcontract, the Contractor shall 
promptly notify Patent Counsel and identify the subject invention.
    (h) Reporting on Utilization of Subject Inventions. The Contractor 
agrees to submit to DOE on request, periodic reports, no more frequently 
than annually, on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts 
at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Contractor or 
its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information 
regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or 
use, gross royalties received by the Contractor, and such other data and 
information as DOE may reasonably specify. The Contractor also agrees to 
provide additional reports as may be requested by DOE in connection with 
any march-in proceeding undertaken by DOE in accordance with paragraph 
(j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), DOE agrees it 
will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government 
without permission of the Contractor.
    (i) Preference for United States Industry. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither it nor any 
assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any 
subject invention in the United States unless such person agrees that 
any product embodying the subject invention or produced through the use 
of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the 
United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an 
agreement may be waived by DOE upon a showing by the Contractor or its 
assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to 
grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be 
likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under 
the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
    (j) March-in Rights. The Contractor agrees that, with respect to any 
subject invention in which it has acquired title, DOE has the right in 
accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any DOE supplemental 
regulations to require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee 
of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or 
exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or 
applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and, 
if the Contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee refuses such a 
request, DOE has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE 
determines that--
    (1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has 
not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, 
effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject 
invention in such field of use;
    (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs 
which are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their 
licensees;
    (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use 
specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not 
reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
    (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by 
paragraph (i) of this clause has not been obtained or waived, or because 
a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention 
in the United States is in breach of such agreement.
    (k) Special Provisions for Contracts With Nonprofit Organizations. 
If the Contractor is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that--
    (1) DOE approval of assignment of rights. Rights to a subject 
invention in the United States may not be assigned by the Contractor 
without the approval of DOE, except where such assignment is made to an 
organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of 
inventions; provided, that such assignee will be subject to the same 
provisions of this clause as the Contractor.
    (2) Small business firm licensees. It will make efforts that are 
reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject 
inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a 
preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention 
if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or 
proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as 
likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or 
proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, 
that the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has 
the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The 
decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be

[[Page 488]]

at the discretion of the Contractor. However, the Contractor agrees that 
the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program 
and decisions regarding small business firm applicants, and the 
Contractor will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, 
or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when that Secretary's review 
discloses that the Contractor could take reasonable steps to more 
effectively implement the requirements of this subparagraph (k)(2).
    (3) Contractor licensing of subject inventions. To the extent that 
it provides the most effective technology transfer, licensing of subject 
inventions shall be administered by Contractor employees on location at 
the facility.
    (l) Communications. The Contractor shall direct any notification, 
disclosure or request provided for in this clause to the Patent Counsel 
assisting the DOE contracting activity.
    (m) Reports.
    (1) Interim reports. Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit 
to DOE, no more frequently than annually, a list of subject inventions 
disclosed to DOE during a specified period, or a statement that no 
subject inventions were made during the specified period; and a list of 
subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the Contractor 
during a specified period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were 
awarded during the specified period.
    (2) Final reports. Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit 
to DOE, prior to closeout of the contract, a list of all subject 
inventions disclosed during the performance period of the contract, or a 
statement that no subject inventions were made during the contract 
performance period; and a list of all subcontracts containing a patent 
clause and awarded by the Contractor during the contract performance 
period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were awarded during the 
contract performance period.
    (n) Examination of Records Relating to Subject Inventions. (1) 
Contractor compliance. Until the expiration of three (3) years after 
final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer or any 
authorized representative may examine any books (including laboratory 
notebooks), records, documents, and other supporting data of the 
Contractor, which the Contracting Officer or authorized representative 
deems reasonably pertinent to the discovery or identification of subject 
inventions, including exceptional circumstance subject inventions, or to 
determine Contractor compliance with any requirement of this clause.
    (2) Unreported inventions. If the Contracting Officer is aware of an 
invention that is not disclosed by the Contractor to DOE, and the 
Contracting Officer believes the unreported invention may be a subject 
invention, including exceptional circumstance subject inventions, DOE 
may require the Contractor to submit to DOE a disclosure of the 
invention for a determination of ownership rights.
    (3) Confidentiality. Any examination of records under this paragraph 
is subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of 
the information involved.
    (4) Power of inspection. With respect to a subject invention for 
which the Contractor has responsibility for patent prosecution, the 
Contractor shall furnish the Government, upon request by DOE, an 
irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of a prosecution file for 
any patent application claiming the subject invention.
    (o) Facilities License. In addition to the rights of the parties 
with respect to inventions or discoveries conceived or first actually 
reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, the 
Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an 
irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in and to any inventions or 
discoveries regardless of when conceived or actually reduced to practice 
or acquired by the Contractor at any time through completion of this 
contract and which are incorporated or embodied in the construction of 
the facility or which are utilized in the operation of the facility or 
which cover articles, materials, or product manufactured at the facility 
(1) to practice or have practiced by or for the Government at the 
facility, and (2) to transfer such license with the transfer of that 
facility. Notwithstanding the acceptance or exercise by the Government 
of these rights, the Government may contest at any time the 
enforceability, validity or scope of, or title to, any rights or patents 
herein licensed.
    (p) Atomic Energy.
    (1) Pecuniary awards. No claim for pecuniary award of compensation 
under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, may 
be asserted with respect to any invention or discovery made or conceived 
in the course of or under this contract.
    (2) Patent agreements. Except as otherwise authorized in writing by 
the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall obtain patent agreements 
to effectuate the provisions of subparagraph (p)(1) of this clause from 
all persons who perform any part of the work under this contract, except 
nontechnical personnel, such as clerical employees and manual laborers.
    (q) Classified Inventions. (1) Approval for filing a foreign patent 
application. The Contractor shall not file or cause to be filed an 
application or registration for a patent disclosing a subject invention 
related to classified subject matter in any country other than the 
United States without first obtaining the written approval of the 
Contracting Officer.

[[Page 489]]

    (2) Transmission of classified subject matter. If in accordance with 
this clause the Contractor files a patent application in the United 
States disclosing a subject invention that is classified for reasons of 
security, the Contractor shall observe all applicable security 
regulations covering the transmission of classified subject matter. If 
the Contractor transmits a patent application disclosing a classified 
subject invention to the United States Patent and Trademark Office 
(USPTO), the Contractor shall submit a separate letter to the USPTO 
identifying the contract or contracts by agency and agreement number 
that require security classification markings to be placed on the patent 
application.
    (3) Inclusion of clause in subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to 
include the substance of this clause in subcontracts at any tier that 
cover or are likely to cover subject matter classified for reasons of 
security.
    (r) Patent Functions. Upon the written request of the Contracting 
Officer or Patent Counsel, the Contractor agrees to make reasonable 
efforts to support DOE in accomplishing patent-related functions for 
work arising out of the contract, including, but not limited to, the 
prosecution of patent applications, and the determination of questions 
of novelty, patentability, and inventorship.
    (s) Educational Awards Subject to 35 U.S.C. 212. The Contractor 
shall notify the Contracting Officer prior to the placement of any 
person subject to 35 U.S.C. 212 in an area of technology or task (1) 
related to exceptional circumstance technology or (2) which is subject 
to treaties or international agreements as set forth in paragraph (b)(3) 
of this clause or agreements other than funding agreements. The 
Contracting Officer may disapprove of any such placement.
    (t) Annual Appraisal by Patent Counsel. Patent Counsel may conduct 
an annual appraisal to evaluate the Contractor's effectiveness in 
identifying and protecting subject inventions in accordance with DOE 
policy.

                             (End of clause)

of the effectiveness of such procedures by the Contracting Officer.
    (6) Duplication and disclosure of documents. The Government may 
duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other 
reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to 
this clause; provided, however, that any such duplication or disclosure 
by the Government is subject to 35 U.S.C. 205 and 37 CFR 401.13.
    (d) Minimum Rights of the Contractor. (1) Contractor License. (i) 
Request for a Contractor license. Except for subject inventions that the 
Contractor fails to disclose within the time periods specified at 
subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Contractor may request a 
revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application 
filed in any country claiming a subject invention and any resulting 
patent in which the Government obtains title, and DOE may grant or 
refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor. If DOE grants the 
Contractor's request for a license, the Contractor's license extends to 
its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate 
structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to 
grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was 
legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded.
    (ii) Transfer of a Contractor license. DOE shall approve any 
transfer of the Contractor's license in a subject invention, and DOE may 
determine the Contractor's license is non-transferrable, on a case-by-
case basis.
    (iii) Revocation or modification of a Contractor license. DOE may 
revoke or modify the Contractor's domestic license to the extent 
necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject 
invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted 
in accordance with applicable provisions in 37 CFR Part 404 and DOE 
licensing regulations. DOE may not revoke the Contractor's domestic 
license in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the 
Contractor, its licensee, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates 
achieved practical applications and continues to make the benefits of 
the invention reasonably accessible to the public. DOE may revoke or 
modify the Contractor's license in any foreign country to the extent the 
Contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates 
failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
    (iv) Notice of revocation or modification of a Contractor license. 
Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE shall furnish the 
Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the 
license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days from the 
date of the notice (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for 
good cause shown by the Contractor) to show cause why the license should 
not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal any 
decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license, in 
accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR Part 404 and DOE 
licensing regulations.
    (2) Contractor's right to request foreign patent rights. If the 
Government has title to a subject invention and the Government decides 
against securing patent rights in a foreign country for the subject 
invention, the Contractor may request such foreign patent rights from 
DOE, and DOE may grant the Contractor's request, subject to a 
nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to the 
Government to practice or have practiced the subject invention in the 
foreign country, and any reservations and conditions deemed appropriate 
by the Secretary of Energy or designee. Such a request shall be 
submitted in writing to the Patent Counsel as part of the disclosure 
required by subparagraph (c)(2) of this clause, with a copy to the DOE 
Contracting Officer, unless a longer period is authorized in writing by 
the Contracting Officer for good cause shown in writing by the 
Contractor. DOE may grant or refuse to grant such a request, and may 
consider whether granting the Contractor's request best serves the 
interests of the United States.
    (e) Examination of Records Relating to Inventions. (1) Contractor 
compliance. Until the expiration of three (3) years after final payment 
under this contract, the Contracting Officer or any authorized 
representative may examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), 
records, and documents and other supporting data of the Contractor, 
which the Contracting Officer or authorized representative deems 
reasonably pertinent to the discovery or identification of subject 
inventions, or to determine Contractor (and inventor) compliance with 
the requirements of this clause, including proper identification and 
disclosure of subject inventions, and

[[Page 492]]

establishment and maintenance of invention disclosure procedures.
    (2) Unreported inventions. If the Contracting Officer is aware of an 
invention that is not disclosed by the Contractor to DOE, and the 
Contracting Officer believes the unreported invention may be a subject 
invention, DOE may require the Contractor to submit to DOE a disclosure 
of the invention for a determination of ownership rights.
    (3) Confidentiality. Any examination of records under this paragraph 
is subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of 
the information involved.

the parties in all subcontracts, at any tier, for experimental, 
developmental, demonstration or research work to be performed by a small 
business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except subcontracts 
which are subject to exceptional circumstances in accordance with 35 
U.S.C. 202(a)(ii).
    (3) Inclusion of patent rights clause--subcontractors other than 
non-profit organizations and small business firms. Except for the 
subcontracts described in subparagraph (f)(2) of this clause, the 
Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-13, 
suitably modified to identify the parties, in any contract for 
experimental, developmental, demonstration or research work.
    (4) DOE and subcontractor contract. With respect to subcontracts at 
any tier, DOE, the subcontractor, and the Contractor agree that the 
mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a 
contract between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to those matters 
covered by this clause.
    (5) Subcontractor refusal to accept terms of patent rights clause. 
If a prospective subcontractor refuses to accept the terms of a patent 
rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly submit a written notice to 
the Contracting Officer stating the subcontractor's reasons for such a 
refusal, including any relevant information for expediting disposition 
of the matter, and the Contractor shall not proceed with the subcontract 
without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.
    (6) Notification of award of subcontract. Upon the award of any 
subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause, the 
Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing and 
identify the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the

    (3) Election by the Contractor under an advance class waiver. If the 
Contractor has the right to elect to retain title to subject inventions 
under an advance class waiver granted in accordance with subparagraph 
(b)(2) of this clause, and unless otherwise provided for by the terms of 
the advance class waiver, the Contractor shall elect in writing whether 
or not to retain title to any subject invention by notifying DOE within 
two (2) years of the date of the disclosure of the subject invention to 
DOE, in accordance with subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The 
notification shall identify the advance class waiver, state the 
countries, including the United States, in which rights are retained, 
and certify that the subject invention is not an exceptional

[[Page 496]]

circumstance subject invention or subject to a treaty or international 
agreement. If a publication, on sale or public use of the subject 
invention has initiated the 1-year statutory period under 35 U.S.C. 
102(b), the period for election may be shortened by DOE to a date that 
is no more than sixty (60) days prior to the end of the 1-year statutory 
period.
    (4) Filing of patent applications by the Contractor under an advance 
class waiver. If the Contractor has the right to retain title to a 
subject invention in accordance with an advance class waiver pursuant to 
subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause or a determination of greater rights 
pursuant to paragraph (b)(7) of this clause, and unless otherwise 
provided for by the terms of the advance class waiver or greater rights 
determination, the Contractor shall file an initial patent application 
claiming the subject invention to which it retains title either within 
one (1) year after the Contractor's election to retain or grant of title 
to the subject invention or prior to the end of any 1-year statutory 
period under 35 U.S.C. 102(b), whichever occurs first. Any patent 
applications filed by the Contractor in foreign countries or 
international patent offices shall be filed within either ten (10) 
months of the corresponding initial patent application or, if such 
filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order, within six (6) months 
from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and 
Trademarks to file foreign patent applications.
    (5) Submission of patent information and documents. If the 
Contractor files a domestic or foreign patent application claiming a 
subject invention, the Contractor shall promptly submit to Patent 
Counsel the following information and documents:
    (i) The filing date, serial number, title, and a copy of the patent 
application (including an English-language version if filed in a 
language other than English);
    (ii) An executed and approved instrument fully confirmatory of all 
Government rights in the subject invention; and
    (iii) The patent number, issue date, and a copy of any issued patent 
claiming the subject invention.
    (6) Contractor's request for an extension of time. Requests for an 
extension of the time to disclose a subject invention, to elect to 
retain title to a subject invention, or to file a patent application 
under subparagraphs (c)(1), (3), and (4) of this clause may be granted 
at the discretion of Patent Counsel or DOE.
    (7) Duplication and disclosure of documents. The Government may 
duplicate and disclose subject invention disclosures and all other 
reports and papers furnished or required to be furnished pursuant to 
this clause; provided, however, that any such duplication or disclosure 
by the Government is subject to 35 U.S.C. 205 and 37 CFR Part 40.
    (d) Conditions When the Government May Obtain Title Notwithstanding 
an Advance Class Waiver. (1) Return of title to a subject invention. If 
the Contractor requests that DOE acquire title or rights from the 
Contractor in a subject invention, including an exceptional circumstance 
subject invention, to which the Contractor retained title or rights 
under subparagraph (b)(2) or subparagraph (b)(7) of this clause, DOE may 
acquire such title or rights from the Contractor, or DOE may decide 
against acquiring such title or rights from the Contractor, at DOE's 
sole discretion.
    (2) Failure to disclose or elect to retain title. Title vests in DOE 
and DOE may request, in writing, a formal assignment of title to a 
subject invention from the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey 
title to the subject invention to DOE, if the Contractor elects not to 
retain title to the subject invention under an advance class waiver, or 
the Contractor fails to disclose or fails to elect to retain title to 
the subject invention within the times specified in subparagraphs (c)(1) 
and (c)(3) of this clause.
    (3) Failure to file domestic or foreign patent applications. In 
those countries in which the Contractor fails to file a patent 
application within the times specified in subparagraph (c)(4) of this 
clause, DOE may request, in writing, title to the subject invention from 
the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey title to the subject 
invention to DOE; provided, however, that if the Contractor has filed a 
patent application in any country after the times specified in 
subparagraph (c)(4) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of DOE's 
written request for title, the Contractor continues to retain title in 
that country.
    (4) Discontinuation of patent protection by the Contractor. If the 
Contractor decides to discontinue the prosecution of a patent 
application, the payment of maintenance fees, or the defense of a 
subject invention in a reexamination or opposition proceeding, in any 
country, DOE may request, in writing, title to the subject invention 
from the Contractor, and the Contractor shall convey title to the 
subject invention to DOE.
    (5) Termination of advance class waiver. DOE may request, in 
writing, title to any subject inventions from the Contractor, and the 
Contractor shall convey title to the subject inventions to DOE, if the 
advance class waiver granted under subparagraph (b)(2) of this clause is 
terminated under paragraph (u) of this clause.
    (e) Minimum Rights of the Contractor. (1) Request for a Contractor 
license. Except for subject inventions that the Contractor fails to 
disclose within the time periods specified at

[[Page 497]]

subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause, the Contractor may request a 
revocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license in each patent application 
filed in any country claiming a subject invention and any resulting 
patent in which the Government obtains title, and DOE may grant or 
refuse to grant such a request by the Contractor. If DOE grants the 
Contractor's request for a license, the Contractor's license extends to 
its domestic subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, within the corporate 
structure of which the Contractor is a party and includes the right to 
grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Contractor was 
legally obligated to do so at the time the contract was awarded.
    (2) Transfer of a Contractor license. DOE shall approve any transfer 
of the Contractor's license in a subject invention, and DOE may 
determine that the Contractor's license is non-transferrable, on a case-
by-case basis.
    (3) Revocation or modification of a Contractor license. DOE may 
revoke or modify the Contractor's domestic license to the extent 
necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject 
invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted 
in accordance with applicable provisions in 37 CFR Part 404 and DOE 
licensing regulations. DOE may not revoke the Contractor's domestic 
license in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the 
Contractor, its licensees or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates 
have achieved practical applications and continues to make the benefits 
of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. DOE may revoke or 
modify the Contractor's license in any foreign country to the extent the 
Contractor, its licensees, or its domestic subsidiaries or affiliates 
failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.
    (4) Notice of revocation or modification of a Contractor license. 
Before revocation or modification of the license, DOE shall furnish the 
Contractor a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the 
license, and the Contractor shall be allowed thirty (30) days from the 
date of the notice (or such other time as may be authorized by DOE for 
good cause shown by the Contractor) to show cause why the license should 
not be revoked or modified. The Contractor has the right to appeal any 
decision concerning the revocation or modification of its license, in 
accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR Part 404 and DOE 
licensing regulations.
    (f) Contractor Action to Protect the Government's Interest. (1) 
Execution and delivery of title or license instruments. The Contractor 
agrees to execute or have executed, and to deliver promptly to DOE all 
instruments necessary to accomplish the following actions:
    (i) establish or confirm the Government's rights throughout the 
world in subject inventions to which the Contractor elects to retain 
title;
    (ii) convey title in a subject invention to DOE pursuant to 
subparagraph (b)(5) and paragraph (d) of this clause; or
    (iii) enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout 
the world in a subject invention to which the Government has title.
    (2) Contractor employee agreements. The Contractor agrees to 
require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and 
nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to Contractor 
personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent 
matters and in a format suggested by the Contractor, each subject 
invention made under this contract, and to execute all papers necessary 
to file patent applications claiming subject inventions or to establish 
the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure 
format shall at a minimum include the information required by 
subparagraph (c)(1) of this clause. The Contractor shall instruct such 
employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational 
programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time 
to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign 
statutory bars.
    (3) Contractor procedures for reporting subject inventions to DOE. 
The Contractor agrees to establish and maintain effective procedures for 
ensuring the prompt identification and timely disclosure of subject 
inventions to DOE. The Contractor shall submit a written description of 
such procedures to the Contracting Officer, upon request, for evaluation 
and approval of the effectiveness of such procedures by the Contracting 
Officer.
    (4) Notification of discontinuation of patent protection. With 
respect to any subject invention for which the Contractor has 
responsibility for patent prosecution, the Contractor shall notify 
Patent Counsel of any decision to discontinue the prosecution of a 
patent application, payment of maintenance fees, or defense of a subject 
invention in a reexamination or opposition proceeding, in any country, 
not less than thirty (30) days before the expiration of the response 
period for any action required by the corresponding patent office.
    (5) Notification of Government rights. With respect to any subject 
invention to which the Contractor has title, the Contractor agrees to 
include, within the specification of any United States patent 
application and within any patent issuing thereon claiming a subject 
invention, the following statement, ``This invention was made with 
Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by the United 
States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the 
invention.''

[[Page 498]]

    (6) Avoidance of Royalty Charges. If the Contractor licenses a 
subject invention, the Contractor agrees to avoid royalty charges on 
acquisitions involving Government funds, including funds derived through 
a Military Assistance Program of the Government or otherwise derived 
through the Government, to refund any amounts received as royalty 
charges on a subject invention in acquisitions for, or on behalf of, the 
Government, and to provide for such refund in any instrument 
transferring rights in the subject invention to any party.
    (7) DOE approval of assignment of rights. Rights in a subject 
invention in the United States may not be assigned by the Contractor 
without the approval of DOE.
    (8) Small business firm licensees. The Contractor shall make efforts 
that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of 
subject inventions that are small business firms, and may give a 
preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention 
if the Contractor determines that the small business firm has a plan or 
proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as 
likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or 
proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, 
the Contractor is also satisfied that the small business firm has the 
capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision 
as to whether to give a preference in any specific case is at the 
discretion of the Contractor.
    (9) Contractor licensing of subject inventions. To the extent that 
it provides the most effective technology transfer, licensing of subject 
inventions shall be administered by Contractor employees on location at 
the facility.
    (g) Subcontracts. (1) Subcontractor subject inventions. The 
Contractor shall not obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject 
inventions as part of the consideration for awarding a subcontract.
    (2) Inclusion of patent rights clause--non-profit organization or 
small business firm subcontractors. Unless otherwise authorized or 
directed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall include the 
patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-11, suitably modified to identify 
the parties, in all subcontracts, at any tier, for experimental, 
developmental, demonstration or research work to be performed by a small 
business firm or domestic nonprofit organization, except subcontracts 
which are subject to exceptional circumstances in accordance with 35 
U.S.C. 202 and subparagraph (b)(5) of this clause.
    (3) Inclusion of patent rights clause--subcontractors other than 
non-profit organizations or small business firms. Except for the 
subcontracts described in subparagraph (g)(2) of this clause, the 
Contractor shall include the patent rights clause at 48 CFR 952.227-13, 
suitably modified to identify the parties and any applicable exceptional 
circumstance, in any contract for experimental, developmental, 
demonstration or research work.
    (4) DOE and subcontractor contract. With respect to subcontracts at 
any tier, DOE, the subcontractor and Contractor agree that the mutual 
obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract 
between the subcontractor and DOE with respect to those matters covered 
by this clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is 
intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in 
connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.
    (5) Subcontractor refusal to accept terms of patent rights clause. 
If a prospective subcontractor refuses to accept the terms of a patent 
rights clause, the Contractor shall promptly submit a written notice to 
the Contracting Officer stating the subcontractor's reasons for such 
refusal and including relevant information for expediting disposition of 
the matter; and the Contractor shall not proceed with the subcontract 
without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer.
    (6) Notification of award of subcontract. Upon the award of any 
subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause, the 
Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing and 
identify the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the 
work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and 
estimated completion. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the 
Contractor shall furnish a copy of a subcontract.
    (7) Identification of subcontractor subject inventions. If the 
Contractor in the performance of this contract becomes aware of a 
subject invention made under a subcontract, the Contractor shall 
promptly notify Patent Counsel and identify the subject invention, with 
a copy of the notification and identification to the Contracting 
Officer.
    (h) Reporting on Utilization of Subject Inventions. Upon request by 
DOE, the Contractor agrees to submit periodic reports, no more 
frequently than annually, describing the utilization of a subject 
invention or efforts made by the Contractor or its licensees or 
assignees to obtain utilization of the subject invention. The reports 
shall include information regarding the status of development, date of 
first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the 
Contractor, and other data and information reasonably specified by DOE. 
Upon request by DOE, the Contractor also agrees to provide reports in 
connection with any march-in proceedings undertaken by DOE, in 
accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. If any data or information 
reported by the Contractor in accordance with this provision is 
considered privileged and confidential by the Contractor, its

[[Page 499]]

licensee, or assignee and the Contractor properly marks the data or 
information privileged or confidential, DOE agrees not to disclose such 
information to persons outside the Government, to the extent permitted 
by law.
    (i) Preference for United States Industry. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this clause the Contractor agrees that with respect to any 
subject invention in which it retains title, neither it nor any assignee 
may grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject 
invention in the United States unless such person agrees that any 
products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of 
the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United 
States. However, in individual cases, DOE may waive the requirement for 
such an agreement upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that 
reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on 
similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture 
substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances 
domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.
    (j) March-In Rights. With respect to any subject invention to which 
the Contractor has elected to retain or is granted title, DOE may, in 
accordance with the procedures in the DOE patent waiver regulations, 
require the Contractor, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject 
invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive 
license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, 
upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances. If the 
Contractor, assignee or exclusive licensee refuses such a request, DOE 
has the right to grant such a license itself if DOE determines that--
    (1) Such action is necessary because the Contractor or assignee has 
not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, 
effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject 
invention in such field of use;
    (2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs 
that are not reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or their 
licensees;
    (3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use 
specified by government regulations and such requirements are not 
reasonably satisfied by the Contractor, assignee, or licensees; or
    (4) Such action is necessary because the agreement to substantially 
manufacture in the United States and required by paragraph (i) of this 
clause has neither been obtained nor waived or because a licensee of the 
exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United 
States is in breach of such agreement.
    (k) Communications. The Contractor shall direct any notification, 
disclosure, or request provided for in this clause to the Patent Counsel 
identified in the contract.
    (l) Reports. (1) Interim reports. Upon DOE's request, the Contractor 
shall submit to DOE, no more frequently than annually, a list of subject 
inventions disclosed to DOE during a specified period, or a statement 
that no subject inventions were made during the specified period; and/or 
a list of subcontracts containing a patent clause and awarded by the 
Contractor during a specified period, or a statement that no such 
subcontracts were awarded during the specified period. The interim 
report shall state whether the Contractor's invention disclosures were 
submitted to DOE in accordance with the requirements of subparagraphs 
(f)(3) and (f)(4) of this clause.
    (2) Final reports. Upon DOE's request, the Contractor shall submit 
to DOE, prior to closeout of the contract or within three (3) months of 
the date of completion of the contracted work, a list of all subject 
inventions disclosed during the performance period of the contract, or a 
statement that no subject inventions were made during the contract 
performance period; and/or a list of all subcontracts containing a 
patent clause and awarded by the Contractor during the contract 
performance period, or a statement that no such subcontracts were 
awarded during the contract performance period.
    (m) Facilities License. In addition to the rights of the parties 
with respect to inventions or discoveries conceived or first actually 
reduced to practice in the course of or under this contract, the 
Contractor agrees to and does hereby grant to the Government an 
irrevocable, nonexclusive, paid-up license in and to any inventions or 
discoveries regardless of when conceived or actually reduced to practice 
or acquired by the contractor at any time through completion of this 
contract and which are incorporated or embodied in the construction of 
the facility or which are utilized in the operation of the facility or 
which cover articles, materials, or products manufactured at the 
facility (1) to practice or have practiced by or for the Government at 
the facility, and (2) to transfer such license with the transfer of that 
facility. Notwithstanding the acceptance or exercise by the Government 
of these rights, the Government may contest at any time the 
enforceability, validity or scope of, or title to, any rights or patents 
herein licensed.
    (n) Atomic Energy. (1) Pecuniary awards. No claim for pecuniary 
award of compensation under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 
1954, as amended, may be asserted with respect to any invention or 
discovery made or conceived in the course of or under this contract.

[[Page 500]]

    (2) Patent Agreements. Except as otherwise authorized in writing by 
the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall obtain patent agreements 
to effectuate the provisions of subparagraph (o)(1) of this clause from 
all persons who perform any part of the work under this contract, except 
nontechnical personnel, such as clerical employees and manual laborers.
    (o) Classified Inventions. (1) Approval for filing a foreign patent 
application. The Contractor shall not file or cause to be filed an 
application or registration for a patent disclosing a subject invention 
related to classified subject matter in any country other than the 
United States without first obtaining the written approval of the 
Contracting Officer.
    (2) Transmission of classified subject matter. If in accordance with 
this clause the Contractor files a patent application in the United 
States disclosing a subject invention that is classified for reasons of 
security, the Contractor shall observe all applicable security 
regulations covering the transmission of classified subject matter. If 
the Contractor transmits a patent application disclosing a classified 
subject invention to the United States Patent and Trademark Office 
(USPTO), the Contractor shall submit a separate letter to the USPTO 
identifying the contract or contracts by agency and agreement number 
that require security classification markings to be placed on the patent 
application.
    (3) Inclusion of clause in subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to 
include the substance of this clause in subcontracts at any tier that 
cover or are likely to cover subject matter classified for reasons of 
security.
    (p) Examination of Records Relating to Inventions. (1) Contractor 
compliance. Until the expiration of three (3) years after final payment 
under this contract, the Contracting Officer or any authorized 
representative may examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), 
records, and documents and other supporting data of the Contractor, 
which the Contracting Officer or authorized representative deems 
reasonably pertinent to the discovery or identification of subject 
inventions, including exceptional circumstance subject inventions, or to 
determine Contractor (and inventor) compliance with the requirements of 
this clause, including proper identification and disclosure of subject 
inventions, and establishment and maintenance of invention disclosure 
procedures.
    (2) Unreported inventions. If the Contracting Officer is aware of an 
invention that is not disclosed by the Contractor to DOE, and the 
Contracting Officer believes the unreported invention may be a subject 
invention, DOE may require the Contractor to submit to DOE a disclosure 
of the invention for a determination of ownership rights.
    (3) Confidentiality. Any examination of records under this paragraph 
is subject to appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of 
the information involved.
    (4) Power of inspection. With respect to a subject invention for 
which the Contractor has responsibility for patent prosecution, the 
Contractor shall furnish the Government, upon request by DOE, an 
irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of a prosecution file for 
any patent application claiming the subject invention.
    (q) Patent Functions. Upon the written request of the Contracting 
Officer or Patent Counsel, the Contractor agrees to make reasonable 
efforts to support DOE in accomplishing patent-related functions for 
work arising out of the contract, including, but not limited to, the 
prosecution of patent applications, and the determination of questions 
of novelty, patentability, and inventorship.
    (r) Educational Awards Subject to 35 U.S.C. 212. The Contractor 
shall notify the Contracting Officer prior to the placement of any 
person subject to 35 U.S.C. 212 in an area of technology or task (1) 
related to exceptional circumstance technology or (2) any person who is 
subject to treaties or international agreements as set forth in 
paragraph (b)(6) of this clause or to agreements other than funding 
agreements. The Contracting Officer may disapprove of any such 
placement.
    (s) Annual Appraisal by Patent Counsel. Patent Counsel may conduct 
an annual appraisal to evaluate the Contractor's effectiveness in 
identifying and protecting subject inventions in accordance with DOE 
policy.
    (t) Publication. The Contractor shall receive approval from Patent 
Counsel prior to releasing or publishing information regarding 
scientific or technical developments conceived or first actually reduced 
to practice in the course of or under this contract, to ensure such 
release or publication does not adversely affect the patent rights of 
DOE or the Contractor.
    (u) Termination of Contractor's Advance Class Waiver. If a request 
by the Contractor for an advance class waiver pursuant to subparagraph 
(b)(2) of this clause or a determination of greater rights pursuant to 
paragraph (c) of this clause contains false material statements or fails 
to disclose material facts, and DOE relies on the false statements or 
omissions in granting the Contractor's request, the waiver or grant of 
any Government rights (in whole or in part) to the subject invention(s) 
may be terminated at the discretion of the Secretary of Energy or 
designee. Prior to termination, DOE shall provide the Contractor with 
written notification of the termination, including a statement of facts 
in support of the termination, and the Contractor shall be allowed 
thirty

[[Page 501]]

(30) days, or a longer period authorized by the Secretary of Energy or 
designee for good cause shown in writing by the Contractor, to show 
cause for not terminating the waiver or grant. Any termination of an 
advance class waiver or a determination of greater rights is subject to 
the Contractor's license as provided for in paragraph (f) of this 
clause.

                             (End of Clause)

<R05>
Sec. 970.5228-1  Insurance-litigation and claims.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.2803-2, insert the following clause:

               Insurance--Litigation and Claims (DEC 2000)

    (a) The contractor may, with the prior written authorization of the 
contracting officer, and shall, upon the request of the Government, 
initiate litigation against third parties, including proceedings before 
administrative agencies, in connection with this contract. The 
contractor shall proceed with such litigation in good faith and as 
directed from time to time by the contracting officer.
    (b) The contractor shall give the contracting officer immediate 
notice in writing of any legal proceeding, including any proceeding 
before an administrative agency, filed against the contractor arising 
out of the performance of this contract. Except as otherwise directed by 
the contracting officer, in writing, the contractor shall furnish 
immediately to the contracting officer copies of all pertinent papers 
received by the contractor with respect to such action. The contractor, 
with the prior written authorization of the contracting officer, shall 
proceed with such litigation in good faith and as directed from time to 
time by the contracting officer.
    (c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the 
contractor shall procure and maintain such bonds and insurance as 
required by law or approved in writing by the contracting officer.
    (2) The contractor may, with the approval of the contracting 
officer, maintain a self-insurance program; provided that, with respect 
to workers' compensation, the contractor is qualified pursuant to 
statutory authority.
    (3) All bonds and insurance required by this clause shall be in a 
form and amount and for those periods as the contracting officer may 
require or approve and with sureties and insurers approved by the 
contracting officer.
    (d) The contractor agrees to submit for the contracting officer's 
approval, to the extent and in the manner required by the contracting 
officer, any other bonds and insurance that are maintained by the 
contractor in connection with the performance of this contract and for 
which the contractor seeks reimbursement. If an insurance cost (whether 
a premium for commercial insurance or related to self-insurance) 
includes a portion covering costs made unallowable elsewhere in the 
contract, and the share of the cost for coverage for the unallowable 
cost is determinable, the portion of the cost that is otherwise an 
allowable cost under this contract is reimbursable to the extent 
determined by the contracting officer.
    (e) Except as provided in subparagraphs (g) and (h) of this clause, 
or specifically disallowed elsewhere in this contract, the contractor 
shall be reimbursed--
    (1) For that portion of the reasonable cost of bonds and insurance 
allocable to this contract required in accordance with contract terms or 
approved under this clause, and
    (2) For liabilities (and reasonable expenses incidental to such 
liabilities, including litigation costs) to third persons not 
compensated by insurance or otherwise without regard to and as an 
exception to the limitation of cost or limitation of funds clause of 
this contract.
    (f) The Government's liability under paragraph (e) of this clause is 
subject to the availability of appropriated funds. Nothing in this 
contract shall be construed as implying that the Congress will, at a 
later date, appropriate funds sufficient to meet deficiencies.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, the 
contractor shall not be reimbursed for liabilities (and expenses 
incidental to such liabilities, including litigation costs, counsel 
fees, judgment and settlements)--
    (1) Which are otherwise unallowable by law or the provisions of this 
contract; or
    (2) For which the contractor has failed to insure or to maintain 
insurance as required by law, this contract, or by the written direction 
of the contracting officer.

[[Page 502]]

    (h) In addition to the cost reimbursement limitations contained in 
the cost principles at FAR part 31, as supplemented in the DEAR, and 
notwithstanding any other provision of this contract, the contractor's 
liabilities to third persons, including employees but excluding costs 
incidental to workers' compensation actions (and any expenses incidental 
to such liabilities, including litigation costs, counsel fees, judgments 
and settlements), shall not be reimbursed if such liabilities were 
caused by contractor managerial personnel's
    (1) Willful misconduct,
    (2) Lack of good faith, or
    (3) Failure to exercise prudent business judgment, which means 
failure to act in the same manner as a prudent person in the conduct of 
competitive business; or, in the case of a non-profit educational 
institution, failure to act in the manner that a prudent person would 
under the circumstances prevailing at the time the decision to incur the 
cost is made.
    (i) The burden of proof shall be upon the contractor to establish 
that costs covered by paragraph (h) of this clause are allowable and 
reasonable if, after an initial review of the facts, the contracting 
officer challenges a specific cost or informs the contractor that there 
is reason to believe that the cost results from willful misconduct, lack 
of good faith, or failure to exercise prudent business judgment by 
contractor managerial personnel.
    (j)(1) All litigation costs, including counsel fees, judgments and 
settlements shall be differentiated and accounted for by the contractor 
so as to be separately identifiable. If the contracting officer 
provisionally disallows such costs, then the contractor may not use 
funds advanced by DOE under the contract to finance the litigation.
    (2) Punitive damages are not allowable unless the act or failure to 
act which gave rise to the liability resulted from compliance with 
specific terms and conditions of the contract or written instructions 
from the contracting officer.
    (3) The portion of the cost of insurance obtained by the contractor 
that is allocable to coverage of liabilities referred to in paragraph 
(g)(1) of this clause is not allowable.
    (4) The term ``contractor's managerial personnel'' is defined in the 
Property clause in this contract.
    (k) The contractor may at its own expense and not as an allowable 
cost procure for its own protection insurance to compensate the 
contractor for any unallowable or unreimbursable costs incurred in 
connection with contract performance.
    (l) If any suit or action is filed or any claim is made against the 
contractor, the cost and expense of which may be reimbursable to the 
contractor under this contract, and the risk of which is then uninsured 
or is insured for less than the amount claimed, the contractor shall--
    (1) Immediately notify the contracting officer and promptly furnish 
copies of all pertinent papers received;
    (2) Authorize Department representatives to collaborate with: in-
house or DOE-approved outside counsel in settling or defending the 
claim; or counsel for the insurance carrier in settling or defending the 
claim if the amount of the liability claimed exceeds the amount of 
coverage, unless precluded by the terms of the insurance contract; and
    (3) Authorize Department representatives to settle the claim or to 
defend or represent the contractor in and/or to take charge of any 
litigation, if required by the Department, if the liability is not 
insured or covered by bond. In any action against more than one 
Department contractor, the Department may require the contractor to be 
represented by common counsel. Counsel for the contractor may, at the 
contractor's own expense, be associated with the Department 
representatives in any such claim or litigation.

Sec. 970.5229-1  State and local taxes.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.2904-1(b), insert the following clause 
in management and operating contracts. The requirement for the notice 
prescribed in paragraph (a) of the clause may be broadened to include 
all State and local taxes which may be claimed as allowable costs when 
considered to be appropriate.

                    State and Local Taxes (DEC 2000)

    (a) The contractor agrees to notify the contracting officer of any 
State or local tax, fee, or charge levied or purported to be levied on 
or collected from the contractor with respect to the contract work, any 
transaction thereunder, or property in the custody or control of the 
contractor and constituting an allowable item of cost if due and 
payable, but which the contractor has reason to believe, or the 
contracting officer has advised the contractor, is or may be 
inapplicable or invalid; and the contractor further agrees to refrain 
from paying any such tax, fee, or charge unless authorized in writing by 
the contracting officer. Any State or local tax, fee, or charge paid 
with the approval of the contracting officer or on the basis of advice 
from the contracting officer that such tax, fee, or charge is applicable 
and valid, and which would otherwise be an allowable item of cost, shall 
not be disallowed as an

[[Page 503]]

item of cost by reason of any subsequent ruling or determination that 
such tax, fee, or charge was in fact inapplicable or invalid.
    (b) The contractor agrees to take such action as may be required or 
approved by the contracting officer to cause any State or local tax, 
fee, or charge which would be an allowable cost to be paid under 
protest; and to take such action as may be required or approved by the 
contracting officer to seek recovery of any payments made, including 
assignment to the Government or its designee of all rights to an 
abatement or refund thereof, and granting permission for the Government 
to join with the contractor in any proceedings for the recovery thereof 
or to sue for recovery in the name of the contractor. If the contracting 
officer directs the contractor to institute litigation to enjoin the 
collection of or to recover payment of any such tax, fee, or charge 
referred to above, or if a claim or suit is filed against the contractor 
for a tax, fee, or charge it has refrained from paying in accordance 
with this clause, the procedures and requirements of the clause entitled 
``Insurance-Litigation and Claims'' shall apply and the costs and 
expenses incurred by the contractor shall be allowable items of costs, 
as provided in this contract, together with the amount of any judgment 
rendered against the contractor.
    (c) The Government shall hold the contractor harmless from penalties 
and interest incurred through compliance with this clause. All 
recoveries or credits in respect of the foregoing taxes, fees, and 
charges (including interest) shall inure to and be for the sole benefit 
of the Government.

                             (End of Clause)


<R05>
Sec. 970.5231-4  Preexisting conditions.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3170, insert the following clause:

                    Preexisting Conditions (DEC 2000)

    (a) The Department of Energy agrees to reimburse the contractor, and 
the contractor shall not be held responsible, for any liability 
(including without limitation, a claim involving strict or absolute 
liability and any civil fine or penalty), expense, or remediation cost, 
but limited to those of a civil nature, which may be incurred by, 
imposed on, or asserted against the contractor arising out of any 
condition, act, or failure to act which occurred before the contractor 
assumed responsibility on [Insert date contract began]. To the extent 
the acts or omissions of the contractor cause or add to any liability, 
expense or remediation cost resulting from conditions in existence prior 
to [Insert date contract began], the contractor shall be responsible in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of this contract.
    (b) The obligations of the Department of Energy under this clause 
are subject to the availability of appropriated funds.

                             (End of Clause)

    Alternate I (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3170 (a), in 
contracts with incumbent management and operating contractors, 
substitute the following for paragraph (a) of the basic clause:
    (a) Any liability, obligation, loss, damage, claim (including 
without limitation, a claim involving strict or absolute liability), 
action, suit, civil fine or penalty, cost, expense or disbursement, 
which may be incurred or imposed, or asserted by any party and arising 
out of any condition, act or failure to act which occurred before 
[Insert date this clause was included in contract], in conjunction with 
the management and operation of [Insert name of facility], shall be 
deemed incurred under Contract No. [Insert number of prior contract].
    Alternate II (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3170 (b), add 
the following paragraph (c) to the basic clause in contracts with 
management and operating contractors not previously working at that 
particular site or facility:
    (c) The contractor has the duty to inspect the facilities and sites 
and timely identify to the contracting officer those conditions which it 
believes could give rise to a liability, obligation, loss, damage, 
penalty, fine, claim, action, suit, cost, expense, or disbursement or 
areas of actual or potential noncompliance with the terms and conditions 
of this contract or applicable law or regulation. The contractor has the 
responsibility to take corrective action, as directed by the contracting 
officer and as required elsewhere in this contract.

Sec. 970.5232-1  Reduction or suspension of advance, partial, or 
          progress payments upon finding of substantial evidence of 
          fraud.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3200-1-1, insert the following clause:

 Reduction or Suspension of Advance, Partial, or Progress Payments (DEC 
                                  2000)

    (a) The contracting officer may reduce or suspend further advance, 
partial, or progress payments to the contractor upon a written 
determination by the Senior Procurement Executive that substantial 
evidence exists that the contractor's request for advance, partial, or 
progress payment is based on fraud.
    (b) The contractor shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to 
respond in writing.

<R05>
Sec. 970.5232-2  Payments and advances.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3270(a)(1), insert the following clause:

                    Payments and Advances (DEC 2000)

    (a) Installments of fixed-fee. The fixed-fee payable under this 
contract shall become due and payable in periodic installments in 
accordance with a schedule determined by the contracting officer. Fixed-
fee payments shall be made by direct payment or withdrawn from funds 
advanced or available under this contract, as determined by the 
contracting officer. The contracting officer may offset against any such 
fee payment the amounts owed to the Government by the contractor, 
including any amounts owed for disallowed costs under this contract. No 
fixed-fee payment may be withdrawn against the payments cleared 
financing arrangement without prior written approval of the contracting 
officer.
    (b) Payments on Account of Allowable Costs. The contracting officer 
and the contractor shall agree as to the extent to which payment for 
allowable costs or payments for other items specifically approved in 
writing by the contracting officer (for example, negotiated fixed 
amounts) shall be made from advances of Government funds. When pension 
contributions are paid by the contractor to the retirement fund less 
frequently than quarterly, accrued costs therefor shall be excluded from 
costs for payment purposes until such costs are paid. If pension 
contribution are paid on a quarterly or more frequent basis, accrual 
therefor may be included in costs for payment purposes, provided that 
they are paid to the fund within 30 days after the close of the period 
covered. If payments are not made to the fund within such 30-day period, 
pension contribution costs shall be excluded from cost for payment 
purposes until payment has been made.
    (c) Special financial institution account--use. All advances of 
Government funds shall be withdrawn pursuant to a payments cleared 
financing arrangement prescribed by DOE in favor of the financial 
institution or, at the option of the Government, shall be made by direct 
payment or other payment mechanism to the contractor, and shall be 
deposited only in the special financial institution account referred to 
in the Special Financial Institution Account Agreement, which is 
incorporated into this contract as Appendix--. No part of the funds in 
the special financial institution account shall be commingled with any 
funds of the contractor or used for a purpose other than that of making 
payments for costs allowable and, if applicable, fees earned under this 
contract, negotiated fixed amounts, or payments for other items 
specifically approved in writing by the contracting officer. If the 
contracting officer determines that the balance of such special 
financial institution account exceeds the contractor's current needs, 
the contractor shall promptly make such disposition of the excess as the 
contracting officer may direct.
    (d) Title to funds advanced. Title to the unexpended balance of any 
funds advanced and of any special financial institution account 
established pursuant to this clause shall remain in the Government and 
be superior to any claim or lien of the financial institution of deposit 
or others. It is understood that an advance to the contractor hereunder 
is not a loan to the contractor, and will not require the payment of 
interest by the contractor, and that the contractor acquires no right, 
title or interest in or to such advance other than the right to make 
expenditures therefrom, as provided in this clause.
    (e) Financial settlement. The Government shall promptly pay to the 
contractor the unpaid balance of allowable costs (or other items 
specifically approved in writing by the contracting officer) and fee 
upon termination of the work, expiration of the term of the contract, or 
completion of the work and its acceptance by the Government after:
    (1) Compliance by the contractor with DOE's patent clearance 
requirements, and
    (2) The furnishing by the contractor of:
    (i) An assignment of the contractor's rights to any refunds, 
rebates, allowances, accounts receivable, collections accruing to the 
contractor in connection with the work under this contract, or other 
credits applicable to allowable costs under the contract;
    (ii) A closing financial statement;
    (iii) The accounting for Government-owned property required by the 
clause entitled ``Property''; and
    (iv) A release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and 
employees from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of 
or under this contract subject only to the following exceptions:
    (A) Specified claims in stated amounts or in estimated amounts where 
the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the contractor;
    (B) Claims, together with reasonable expenses incidental thereto, 
based upon liabilities of the contractor to third parties arising out of 
the performance of this contract; provided that such claims are not 
known to the contractor on the date of the execution of the release; and 
provided further that the contractor gives notice of such claims in 
writing to the contracting officer promptly, but not more than one (1) 
year after the contractor's right of action first accrues. In addition, 
the contractor shall provide prompt notice to the contracting officer of 
all potential claims under this clause, whether in litigation or not 
(see also Contract Clause__, DEAR 970.5228-1, ``Insurance--Litigation 
and Claims'');

[[Page 505]]

    (C) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the 
contractor by reason of any indemnification of the Government against 
patent liability), including reasonable expenses incidental thereto, 
incurred by the contractor under the provisions of this contract 
relating to patents; and
    (D) Claims recognizable under the clause entitled, Nuclear Hazards 
Indemnity Agreement.
    (3) In arriving at the amount due the contractor under this clause, 
there shall be deducted,
    (i) Any claim which the Government may have against the contractor 
in connection with this contract, and
    (ii) Deductions due under the terms of this contract, and not 
otherwise recovered by or credited to the Government. The unliquidated 
balance of the special financial institution account may be applied to 
the amount due and any balance shall be returned to the Government 
forthwith.
    (f) Claims. Claims for credit against funds advanced for payment 
shall be accompanied by such supporting documents and justification as 
the contracting officer shall prescribe.
    (g) Discounts. The contractor shall take and afford the Government 
the advantage of all known and available cash and trade discounts, 
rebates, allowances, credits, salvage, and commissions unless the 
contracting officer finds that action is not in the best interest of the 
Government.
    (h) Collections. All collections accruing to the contractor in 
connection with the work under this contract, except for the 
contractor's fee and royalties or other income accruing to the 
contractor from technology transfer activities in accordance with this 
contract, shall be Government property and shall be processed and 
accounted for in accordance with applicable requirements imposed by the 
contracting officer pursuant to the Laws, regulations, and DOE 
directives clause of this contract and, to the extent consistent with 
those requirements, shall be deposited in the special financial 
institution account or otherwise made available for payment of allowable 
costs under this contract, unless otherwise directed by the contracting 
officer.
    (i) Direct payment of charges. The Government reserves the right, 
upon ten days written notice from the contracting officer to the 
contractor, to pay directly to the persons concerned, all amounts due 
which otherwise would be allowable under this contract. Any payment so 
made shall discharge the Government of all liability to the contractor 
therefor.
    (j) Determining allowable costs. The contracting officer shall 
determine allowable costs in accordance with the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation subpart 31.2 and the Department of Energy Acquisition 
Regulation subpart 48 CFR 970.31 in effect on the date of this contract 
and other provisions of this contract.
    Alternate I (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3270(a)(1)(i), 
if a separate fixed-fee is provided for a separate item of work, 
paragraph (a) of the basic clause should be modified to permit payment 
of the entire fixed-fee upon completion of that item.
    Alternate II (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3270(a)(1)(ii), 
when total available fee provisions are used, replace paragraph (a) of 
the basic clause with the following paragraph (a):
    (a) Payment of Total available fee: Base Fee and Performance Fee. 
The base fee amount, if any, is payable in equal monthly installments. 
Total available fee amount earned is payable following the Government's 
Determination of Total Available Fee Amount Earned in accordance with 
the clause of this contract entitled ``Total Available Fee: Base Fee 
Amount and Performance Fee Amount.'' Base fee amount and total available 
fee amount earned payments shall be made by direct payment or withdrawn 
from funds advanced or available under this contract, as determined by 
the contracting officer. The contracting officer may offset against any 
such fee payment the amounts owed to the Government by the contractor, 
including any amounts owed for disallowed costs under this contract. No 
base fee amount or total available fee amount earned payment may be 
withdrawn against the payments cleared financing arrangement without the 
prior written approval of the contracting officer.
    Alternate III (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 
970.3270(a)(1)(iii), the following paragraph (k) shall be included in 
management and operating contracts with integrated accounting systems:
    (k) Review and approval of costs incurred. The contractor shall 
prepare and submit annually as of September 30, a ``Statement of Costs 
Incurred and Claimed'' (Cost Statement) for the total of net 
expenditures accrued (i.e., net costs incurred) for the period covered 
by the Cost Statement. The contractor shall certify the Cost Statement 
subject to the penalty provisions for unallowable costs as stated in 
sections 306(b) and (i) of the Federal Property and Administrative 
Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 256), as amended. DOE, after audit and 
appropriate adjustment, will approve such Cost Statement. This approval 
by DOE will constitute an acknowledgment by DOE that the net costs 
incurred are allowable under the contract and that they have been 
recorded in the accounts maintained by the contractor in accordance with 
DOE accounting policies, but will not relieve the contractor of 
responsibility for DOE's assets in its care, for appropriate subsequent 
adjustments, or for errors later becoming known to DOE.

[[Page 506]]

    Alternate IV (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3270(a)(1)(iv), 
the following paragraph (k) shall be included in management and 
operating contracts without integrated accounting systems:
    (k) Certification and penalties. The contractor shall prepare and 
submit a ``Statement of Costs Incurred and Claimed'' (Cost Statement) 
for the total of net expenditures incurred for the period covered by the 
Cost Statement. It is anticipated that this will be an annual submission 
unless otherwise agreed to by the contracting officer. The contractor 
shall certify the Cost Statement subject to the penalty provisions for 
unallowable costs as stated in sections 306(b) and (i) of the Federal 
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 256), as 
amended.

reasonable times, before and during the period of retention provided for 
in paragraph (d) of this clause, and the contractor shall afford DOE 
proper facilities for such inspection and audit.
    (c) Audit of subcontractors' records. The contractor also agrees, 
with respect to any subcontracts (including fixed-price or unit-price 
subcontracts or purchase orders) where, under the terms of the 
subcontract, costs incurred are a factor in determining the amount 
payable to the subcontractor of any tier, to either conduct an audit of 
the subcontractor's costs or arrange for such an audit to be performed 
by the cognizant government audit agency through the contracting 
officer.
    (d) Disposition of records. Except as agreed upon by the Government 
and the contractor, all financial and cost reports, books of account and 
supporting documents, system files, data bases, and other data 
evidencing costs allowable, collections accruing to the contractor in 
connection with the work under this contract, other applicable credits, 
and fee accruals under this contract, shall be the property of the 
Government, and shall be delivered to the Government or otherwise 
disposed of by the contractor either as the contracting officer may from 
time to time direct during the progress of the work or, in any event, as 
the contracting officer shall direct upon completion or termination of 
this contract and final audit of accounts hereunder. Except as otherwise 
provided in this contract, including provisions of Clause__, Access to 
and ownership of records, all other records in the possession of the 
contractor relating to this contract shall be preserved by the 
contractor for a period of three years after final payment under this 
contract or otherwise disposed of in such manner as may be agreed upon 
by the Government and the contractor.
    (e) Reports. The contractor shall furnish such progress reports and

    (f) Inspections. The DOE shall have the right to inspect the work 
and activities of the contractor under this contract at such time and in 
such manner as it shall deem appropriate.
    (g) Subcontracts. The contractor further agrees to require the 
inclusion of provisions similar to those in paragraphs (a) through (g) 
and paragraph (h) of this clause in all subcontracts (including fixed-
price or unit-price subcontracts or purchase orders) of any tier entered 
into hereunder where, under the terms of the subcontract, costs incurred 
are a factor in determining the amount payable to the subcontractor.
    (h) Comptroller General. (1) The Comptroller General of the United 
States, or an authorized representative, shall have access to and the 
right to examine any of the contractor's directly pertinent records 
involving transactions related to this contract or a subcontract 
hereunder.
    (2) This paragraph may not be construed to require the contractor or 
subcontractor to create or maintain any record that the contractor or 
subcontractor does not maintain in the ordinary course of business or 
pursuant to a provision of law.
    (3) Nothing in this contract shall be deemed to preclude an audit by 
the General Accounting Office of any transaction under this contract.

the following:
    The contractor further agrees to include an ``Audit'' clause, the 
substance of which is the ``Audit'' clause set forth at 48 CFR 52.215-2, 
in each subcontract which does not include provisions similar to those 
in paragraph (a) through paragraph (g) and paragraph (h) of this clause, 
but which contains a ``defective cost or pricing data'' clause.

mutually agreed upon. The results of such audit, including the working 
papers, shall be submitted or made available to the contracting officer. 
The contractor shall include this paragraph (i) in all cost-
reimbursement subcontracts with an estimated cost exceeding $5 million 
and expected to run for more than 2 years, and any other cost-
reimbursement subcontract determined by the Head of the Contracting

<R05>
Sec. 970.5232-4  Obligation of funds.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3270(a)(3), insert the following clause:

                     Obligation of Funds (DEC 2000)

    (a) Obligation of funds. The amount presently obligated by the 
Government with respect to this contract is __ dollars ($__). Such 
amount may be increased unilaterally by DOE by written notice to the 
contractor and may be increased or decreased by written agreement of the 
parties (whether or not by formal modification of this contract). 
Estimated collections from others for work and services to be performed 
under this contract are not included in the amount presently obligated. 
Such collections, to the extent actually received by the contractor, 
shall be processed and accounted for in accordance with applicable 
requirements imposed by the contracting officer pursuant to the Laws, 
regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract. Nothing in this 
paragraph is to be construed as authorizing the contractor to exceed 
limitations stated in financial plans established by DOE and furnished 
to the contractor from time to time under this contract.
    (b) Limitation on payment by the Government. Except as otherwise 
provided in this contract and except for costs which may be incurred by 
the contractor pursuant to the Termination clause of this contract or 
costs of claims allowable under the contract occurring after completion 
or termination and not released by the contractor at the time of 
financial settlement of the contract in accordance with the clause 
entitled ``Payments and Advances,'' payment by the Government under this 
contract on account of allowable costs shall not, in the aggregate, 
exceed the amount obligated with respect to this contract, less the 
contractor's fee and any negotiated fixed amount. Unless expressly 
negated in this contract, payment on account of those costs excepted in 
the preceding sentence which are in excess of the amount obligated with 
respect to this contract shall be subject to the availability of:
    (1) collections accruing to the contractor in connection with the 
work under this contract and processed and accounted for in accordance 
with applicable requirements imposed by the contracting officer pursuant 
to the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract, 
and
    (2) other funds which DOE may legally use for such purpose, provided 
DOE will use its best efforts to obtain the appropriation of funds for 
this purpose if not otherwise available.
    (c) Notices--Contractor excused from further performance. The 
contractor shall notify DOE in writing whenever the unexpended balance 
of available funds (including collections available under paragraph (a) 
of this clause), plus the contractor's best estimate of collections to 
be received and available during the __ day period hereinafter 
specified, is in the contractor's best judgment sufficient to continue 
contract operations at the programmed rate for only __ days and to cover 
the contractor's unpaid fee and any negotiated fixed amounts, and 
outstanding encumbrances and liabilities on account of costs allowable 
under the contract at the end of such period. Whenever the unexpended 
balance of available funds (including collections available under 
paragraph (a) of this clause), less the amount of the contractor's fee 
then earned but not paid and any negotiated fixed amounts, is in the 
contractor's best judgment sufficient only to liquidate outstanding 
encumbrances and liabilities on

[[Page 508]]

account of costs allowable under this contract, the contractor shall 
immediately notify DOE and shall make no further encumbrances or 
expenditures (except to liquidate existing encumbrances and 
liabilities), and, unless the parties otherwise agree, the contractor 
shall be excused from further performance (except such performance as 
may become necessary in connection with termination by the Government) 
and the performance of all work hereunder will be deemed to have been 
terminated for the convenience of the Government in accordance with the 
provisions of the Termination clause of this contract.
    (d) Financial plans; cost and encumbrance limitations. In addition 
to the limitations provided for elsewhere in this contract, DOE may, 
through financial plans, such as Approved Funding Programs, or other 
directives issued to the contractor, establish controls on the costs to 
be incurred and encumbrances to be made in the performance of the 
contract work. Such plans and directives may be amended or supplemented 
from time to time by DOE. The contractor agrees
    (1) to comply with the specific limitations (ceilings) on costs and 
encumbrances set forth in such plans and directives,
    (2) to comply with other requirements of such plans and directives, 
and
    (3) to notify DOE promptly, in writing, whenever it has reason to 
believe that any limitation on costs and encumbrances will be exceeded 
or substantially underrun.
    (e) Government's right to terminate not affected. The giving of any 
notice under this clause shall not be construed to waive or impair any 
right of the Government to terminate the contract under the provisions 
of the Termination clause of this contract.

Sec. 970.5232-5  Liability with respect to cost accounting standards.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3270(a)(5), insert the following clause:

     Liability With Respect to Cost Accounting Standards (DEC 2000)

    (a) The contractor is not liable to the Government for increased 
costs or interest resulting from its failure to comply with the clauses 
of this contract entitled, ``Cost Accounting Standards,'' and 
``Administration of Cost Accounting Standards,'' if its failure to 
comply with the clauses is caused by the contractor's compliance with 
published DOE financial management policies and procedures or other 
requirements established by the Department's Chief Financial Officer or 
Procurement Executive.
    (b) The contractor is not liable to the Government for increased 
costs or interest resulting from its subcontractors' failure to comply 
with the clauses at FAR 52.230-2, ``Cost Accounting Standards,'' and FAR 
52.230-6, ``Administration of Cost Accounting Standards,'' if the 
contractor includes in each covered subcontract a clause making the 
subcontractor liable to the Government for increased costs or interest 
resulting from the subcontractor's failure to comply with the clauses; 
and the contractor seeks the subcontract price adjustment and cooperates 
with the Government in the Government's attempts to recover from the 
subcontractor.

Sec. 970.5232-6  Work for others funding authorization.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3270(a)(6), insert the following clause:

            Work for Others Funding Authorization (DEC 2000)

    Any uncollectible receivables resulting from the contractor 
utilizing contractor corporate funding for reimbursable work shall be 
the responsibility of the contractor, and the United States Government 
shall have no liability to the contractor for the contractor's 
uncollected receivables. The contractor is permitted to provide advance 
payment utilizing contractor corporate funds for reimbursable work to be 
performed by the contractor for a non-Federal entity in instances where 
advance payment from that entity is required under the Laws, 
regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract and such advance 
cannot be obtained. The contractor is also permitted to provide advance 
payment utilizing contractor corporate funds to continue reimbursable 
work to be performed by the contractor for a Federal entity when the 
term or the funds on a Federal interagency agreement required under the 
Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract have 
elapsed. The contractor's utilization of contractor corporate funds does 
not relieve the contractor of its responsibility to comply with all 
requirements for Work for Others applicable to this contract.

    The contractor shall maintain and administer a financial management 
system that is suitable to provide proper accounting in accordance with 
DOE requirements for assets,

[[Page 509]]

liabilities, collections accruing to the contractor in connection with 
the work under this contract, expenditures, costs, and encumbrances; 
permits the preparation of accounts and accurate, reliable financial and 
statistical reports; and assures that accountability for the assets can 
be maintained. The contractor shall submit to DOE for written approval 
an annual plan for new financial management systems and/or subsystems 
and major enhancements and/or upgrades to the currently existing 
financial systems and/or subsystems. The contractor shall notify DOE 
thirty (30) days in advance of any planned implementation of any 
substantial deviation from this plan and, as requested by the 
contracting officer, shall submit any such deviation to DOE for written 
approval before implementation.

                    Integrated Accounting (DEC 2000)

    Integrated accounting procedures are required for use under this 
contract. The contractor's financial management system shall include an 
integrated accounting system that is linked to DOE's accounts through 
the use of reciprocal accounts and that has electronic capability to 
transmit monthly and year-end self-balancing trial balances to the 
Department's Primary Accounting System for reporting financial activity 
under this contract in accordance with requirements imposed by the 
contracting officer pursuant to the Laws, regulations, and DOE 
directives clause of this contract.

Sec. 970.5235-1  Federally funded research and development center 
          sponsoring agreement.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3501-4, the contracting officer shall 
insert the following clause:

 Federally Funded Research and Development Center Sponsoring Agreement 
                               (DEC 2000)

    (a) Pursuant to 48 CFR 35.017-1, this contract constitutes the 
sponsoring agreement between the Department of Energy and the 
contractor, which establishes the relationship for the operation of a 
Department of Energy sponsored Federally Funded Research and Development 
Center (FFRDC).
    (b) In the operation of this FFRDC, the contractor may be provided 
access beyond that which is common to the normal contractual 
relationship, to Government and supplier data, including sensitive and 
proprietary data, and to Government employees and facilities needed to 
discharge its responsibilities efficiently and effectively. Because of 
this special relationship, it is essential that the FFRDC be operated in 
the public interest with objectivity and independence, be free from 
organizational conflicts of interest, and have full disclosure of its 
affairs to the Department of Energy.
    (c) Unless otherwise provided by the contract, the contractor may 
accept work from a nonsponsor (as defined in 48 CFR 35.017) in 
accordance with the requirements and limitations of DOE Order 481.1, 
Work for Others (Non-Department of Energy Funded Work) (see current 
version).
    (d) As an FFRDC, the contractor shall not use its privileged 
information or access to government facilities to compete with the 
private sector. Specific guidance on restricted activities is contained 
in DOE Order 481.1.

           Government Facility Subcontract Approval (DEC 2000)

    Upon request of the contracting officer and acceptance thereof by 
the contractor, the contractor shall procure, by subcontract, the 
construction of new facilities or the alteration or repair of 
Government-owned facilities at the plant. Any subcontract entered into 
under this paragraph shall be subject to the written approval of the 
contracting officer and shall contain the provisions relative to labor 
and wages required by law to be included in contracts for the 
construction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting and 
decorating, of a public building or public work.

Sec. 970.5237-2  Facilities management.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.3770-2, insert the following clause:

                    Facilities Management (DEC 2000)

    Copies of DOE Directives referenced herein are available from the 
contracting officer.
    (a) Site development planning. The Government shall provide to the 
contractor site development guidance for the facilities and lands for 
which the contractor is responsible under the terms and conditions of 
this contract. Based upon this guidance, the contractor shall prepare, 
and maintain through annual updates, a Long-Range Site Development Plan 
(Plan) to reflect those actions necessary to keep the development of 
these facilities current with the needs of the Government and allow the 
contractor to successfully accomplish the work required under this 
contract. In developing this Plan, the

[[Page 510]]

contractor shall follow the procedural guidance set forth in the 
applicable DOE Directives in the Life Cycle Facility Operations Series 
listed elsewhere in this contract. The contractor shall use the Plan to 
manage and control the development of facilities and lands. All plans 
and revisions shall be approved by the Government.
    (b) General design criteria. The general design criteria which shall 
be utilized by the contractor in managing the site for which it is 
responsible under this contract are those specified in the applicable 
DOE Directives in the 6430, Design Criteria, series listed elsewhere in 
this contract. The contractor shall comply with these mandatory, 
minimally acceptable requirements for all facility designs with regard 
to any building acquisition, new facility, facility addition or 
alteration or facility lease undertaken as part of the site development 
activities of paragraph (a) of this clause. This includes on-site 
constructed buildings, pre-engineered buildings, plan-fabricated modular 
buildings, and temporary facilities. For existing facilities, original 
design criteria apply to the structure in general; however, additions or 
modifications shall comply with this directive and the associated latest 
editions of the references therein. An exception may be granted for off-
site office space being leased by the contractor on a temporary basis.
    (c) Energy management. The contractor shall manage the facilities 
for which it is responsible under the terms and conditions of this 
contract in an energy efficient manner in accordance with the applicable 
DOE Directives in the Life Cycle Facility Operations Series listed 
elsewhere in this contract. The contractor shall develop a 10-year 
energy management plan for each site with annual reviews and revisions. 
The contractor shall submit an annual report on progress toward 
achieving the goals of the 10-year plan for each individual site, and an 
energy conservation analysis report for each new building or building 
addition project. Any acquisition of utility services by the contractor 
shall be conducted in accordance with 48 CFR 970.41.
    (d) Subcontract Requirements. To the extent the contractor 
subcontracts performance of any of the responsibilities discussed in 
this clause, the subcontract shall contain the requirements of this 
clause relative to the subcontracted responsibilities.

Sec. 970.5242-1  Penalties for unallowable costs.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.4207-03-70, insert the following clause:

               Penalties for Unallowable Costs (DEC 2000)

    (a) Contractors which include unallowable cost in a submission for 
settlement for cost incurred, may be subject to penalties.
    (b) If, during the review of a submission for settlement of cost 
incurred, the contracting officer determines that the submission 
contains an expressly unallowable cost or a cost determined to be 
unallowable prior to the submission, the contracting officer shall 
assess a penalty.
    (c) Unallowable costs are either expressly unallowable or determined 
unallowable.
    (1) An expressly unallowable cost is a particular item or type of 
cost which, under the express provisions of an applicable law, 
regulation, or this contract, is specifically named and stated to be 
unallowable.
    (2) A cost determined unallowable is one which, for that contractor,
    (i) was subject to a contracting officer's final decision and not 
appealed;
    (ii) the Department's Board of Contract Appeals or a court has 
previously ruled as unallowable; or
    (iii) was mutually agreed to be unallowable.
    (d) If the contracting officer determines that a cost submitted by 
the contractor in its submission for settlement of cost incurred is:
    (1) expressly unallowable, then the contracting officer shall assess 
a penalty in an amount equal to the disallowed cost allocated to this 
contract plus interest on the paid portion of the disallowed cost. 
Interest shall be computed from the date of overpayment to the date of 
repayment using the interest rate specified by the Secretary of the 
Treasury pursuant to Pub. L. 92-41 (85 Stat. 97); or
    (2) determined unallowable, then the contracting officer shall 
assess a penalty in an amount equal to two times the amount of the 
disallowed cost allocated to this contract.
    (e) The contracting officer may waive the penalty provisions when
    (1) the contractor withdraws the submission before the formal 
initiation of an audit of the submission and submits a revised 
submission;
    (2) the amount of the unallowable costs allocated to covered 
contracts is $10,000 or less; or
    (3) the contractor demonstrates to the contracting officer's 
satisfaction that:
    (i) it has established appropriate policies, personnel training, and 
an internal control and review system that provides assurances that 
unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from the 
contractor's submission for settlement of costs; and
    (ii) the unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently 
incorporated into the submission.

Sec. 970.5243-1  Changes.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.4302-1, the contracting officer shall 
insert the following clause in all management and operating contracts:

                           Changes (DEC 2000)

    (a) Changes and adjustment of fee. The contracting officer may at 
any time and without notice to the sureties, if any, issue written 
directions within the general scope of this contract requiring 
additional work or directing the omission of, or variation in, work 
covered by this contract. If any such direction results in a material 
change in the amount or character of the work described in the 
``Statement of Work,'' an equitable adjustment of the fee, if any, shall 
be made in accordance with the agreement of the parties and the contract 
shall be modified in writing accordingly. Any claim by the contractor 
for an adjustment under this clause must be asserted in writing within 
30 days from the date of receipt by the contractor of the notification 
of change; provided, however, that the contracting officer, if it is 
determined that the facts justify such action, may receive and act upon 
any such claim asserted at any time prior to final payment under this 
contract. A failure to agree on an equitable adjustment under this 
clause shall be deemed to be a dispute within the meaning of the clause 
entitled ``Disputes.''
    (b) Work to continue. Nothing contained in this clause shall excuse 
the contractor from proceeding with the prosecution of the work in 
accordance with the requirements of any direction hereunder.

                             (End of Clause)


<R05>
Sec. 970.5244-1  Contractor purchasing system.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.4402-5, insert the following clause:

                 Contractor Purchasing System (DEC 2000)

    (a) General. The contractor shall develop, implement, and maintain 
formal policies, practices, and procedures to be used in the award of 
subcontracts consistent with this clause and 48 CFR 970.44. The 
contractor's purchasing system and methods shall be fully documented, 
consistently applied, and acceptable to DOE in accordance with 48 CFR 
970.4401-1. The contractor shall maintain file documentation which is 
appropriate to the value of the purchase and is adequate to establish 
the propriety of the transaction and the price paid. The contractor's 
purchasing performance will be evaluated against such performance 
criteria and measures as may be set forth elsewhere in this contract. 
DOE reserves the right at any time to require that the contractor submit 
for approval any or all purchases under this contract. The contractor 
shall not purchase any item or service the purchase of which is 
expressly prohibited by the written direction of DOE and shall use such 
special and directed sources as may be expressly required by the DOE 
contracting officer. DOE will conduct periodic appraisals of the 
contractor's management of all facets of the purchasing function, 
including the contractor's compliance with its approved system and 
methods. Such appraisals will be performed through the conduct of 
Contractor Purchasing System Reviews in accordance with 48 CFR subpart 
44.3, or, when approved by the contracting officer, through the 
contractor's participation in the conduct of the Balanced Scorecard 
performance measurement and performance management system. The 
contractor's approved purchasing system and methods shall include the 
requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (y) of this clause.
    (b) Acquisition of utility services. Utility services shall be 
acquired in accordance with the requirements of 48 CFR 970.41.
    (c) Acquisition of Real Property. Real property shall be acquired in 
accordance with 48 CFR Subpart 917.74.
    (d) Advance Notice of Proposed Subcontract Awards. Advance notice 
shall be provided in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4401-3.
    (e) Audit of Subcontractors. (1) The contractor shall provide for:
    (i) periodic post-award audit of cost-reimbursement subcontractors 
at all tiers, and
    (ii) audits, where necessary, to provide a valid basis for pre-award 
or cost or price analysis.
    (2) Responsibility for determining the costs allowable under each 
cost-reimbursement subcontract remains with the contractor or next 
higher-tier subcontractor. The contractor shall provide, in appropriate 
cases, for the timely involvement of the contractor and the DOE 
contracting officer in resolution of subcontract cost allowability.
    (3) Where audits of subcontractors at any tier are required, 
arrangements may be made to have the cognizant Federal agency perform 
the audit of the subcontract. These arrangements shall be made 
administratively between DOE and the other agency involved and shall 
provide for the cognizant agency to audit in an appropriate manner in 
light of the magnitude and nature of the subcontract. In no case, 
however, shall these arrangements preclude determination by the DOE 
contracting officer of the allowability or unallowability of 
subcontractor costs claimed for reimbursement by the contractor.
    (4) Allowable costs for cost reimbursable subcontracts are to be 
determined in accordance with the cost principles of 48 CFR Part 31, 
appropriate for the type of organization

[[Page 512]]

to which the subcontract is to be awarded, as supplemented by 48 CFR 
Part 931. Allowable costs in the purchase or transfer from contractor-
affiliated sources shall be determined in accordance with 48 CFR 
970.4402-3 and 48 CFR 970.3102-3-21(b).
    (f) Bonds and Insurance. (1) The contractor shall require 
performance bonds in penal amounts as set forth in 48 CFR 28.102-2(a) 
for all fixed priced and unit-priced construction subcontracts in excess 
of $100,000. The contractor shall consider the use of performance bonds 
in fixed price nonconstruction subcontracts, where appropriate.
    (2) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost reimbursement construction 
subcontracts in excess of $100,000 a payment bond shall be obtained on 
Standard Form 25A modified to name the contractor as well as the United 
States of America as obligees. The penal amounts shall be determined in 
accordance with 48 CFR 28.102-2(b).
    (3) For fixed-price, unit-priced and cost-reimbursement construction 
subcontracts, greater than $25,000, but not greater than $100,000, the 
contractor shall select two or more of the payment protections at 48 CFR 
28.102-1(b), giving particular consideration to the inclusion of an 
irrevocable letter of credit as one of the selected alternatives.
    (4) A subcontractor may have more than one acceptable surety in both 
construction and other subcontracts, provided that in no case will the 
liability of any one surety exceed the maximum penal sum for which it is 
qualified for any one obligation. For subcontracts other than 
construction, a co-surety (two or more sureties together) may reinsure 
amounts in excess of their individual capacity, with each surety having 
the required underwriting capacity that appears on the list of 
acceptable corporate sureties.
    (g) Buy American. The contractor shall comply with the provisions of 
the Buy American Act as reflected in 48 CFR 52.225-3 and 48 CFR 52.225-
5. The contractor shall forward determinations of nonavailability of 
individual items to the DOE contracting officer for approval. Items in 
excess of $100,000 require the prior concurrence of the Head of 
Contracting Activity. If, however, the contractor has an approved 
purchasing system, the Head of the Contracting Activity may authorize 
the contractor to make determinations of nonavailability for individual 
items valued at $100,000 or less.
    (h) Construction and Architect-Engineer Subcontracts. (1) 
Independent Estimates. A detailed, independent estimate of costs shall 
be prepared for all construction work to be subcontracted.
    (2) Specifications. Specifications for construction shall be 
prepared in accordance with the DOE publication entitled ``General 
Design Criteria Manual.''
    (3) Prevention of Conflict of Interest. (i) The contractor shall not 
award a subcontract for construction to the architect-engineer firm or 
an affiliate that prepared the design. This prohibition does not 
preclude the award of a ``turnkey'' subcontract so long as the 
subcontractor assumes all liability for defects in design and 
construction and consequential damages.
    (ii) The contractor shall not award both a cost-reimbursement 
subcontract and a fixed-price subcontract for construction or architect-
engineer services or any combination thereof to the same firm where 
those subcontracts will be performed at the same site.
    (iii) The contractor shall not employ the construction subcontractor 
or an affiliate to inspect the firm's work. The contractor shall assure 
that the working relationships of the construction subcontractor and the 
subcontractor inspecting its work and the authority of the inspector are 
clearly defined.
    (i) Contractor-Affiliated Sources. Equipment, materials, supplies, 
or services from a contractor-affiliated source shall be purchased or 
transferred in accordance with 48 CFR 970.4402-3.
    (j) Contractor-Subcontractor Relationship. The obligations of the 
contractor under paragraph (a) of this clause, including the development 
of the purchasing system and methods, and purchases made pursuant 
thereto, shall not relieve the contractor of any obligation under this 
contract (including, among other things, the obligation to properly 
supervise, administer, and coordinate the work of subcontractors). 
Subcontracts shall be in the name of the contractor, and shall not bind 
or purport to bind the Government.
    (k) Government Property. Identification, inspection, maintenance, 
protection, and disposition of Government property shall conform with 
the policies and principles of 48 CFR Part 45, 48 CFR 945, the Federal 
Property Management Regulations 41 CFR Chapter 101, the DOE Property 
Management Regulations 41 CFR Chapter 109, and their contracts.
    (l) Indemnification. Except for Price-Anderson Nuclear Hazards 
Indemnity, no subcontractor may be indemnified except with the prior 
approval of the Senior Procurement Executive.
    (m) Leasing of Motor Vehicles. Contractors shall comply with 48 CFR 
8.11 and 48 CFR 908.11.
    (n) Make-or-Buy Plans. Acquisition of property and services shall be 
obtained on a least-cost basis, consistent with the requirements of the 
``Make-or-Buy Plan'' clause of this contract and the contractor's 
approved make-or-buy plan.
    (o) Management, Acquisition and Use of Information Resources. 
Requirements for automatic data processing resources and 
telecommunications facilities, services, and equipment, shall be 
reviewed and approved in accordance with applicable DOE Orders

[[Page 513]]

and regulations regarding information resources.
    (p) Priorities, Allocations and Allotments. Priorities, allocations 
and allotments shall be extended to appropriate subcontracts in 
accordance with the clause or clauses of this contract dealing with 
priorities and allocations.
    (q) Purchase of Special Items. Purchase of the following items shall 
be in accordance with the following provisions of 48 CFR 908.71 and the 
Federal Property Management Regulations, 41 CFR Chapter 101:
    (1) Motor vehicles--48 CFR 908.7101

    (12) Products and services of the blind and severely handicapped--41 
CFR 101-26.701
    (13) Products made in Federal penal and correctional institutions--

    (r) Purchase vs. Lease Determinations. Contractors shall determine 
whether required equipment and property should be purchased or leased, 
and establish appropriate thresholds for application of lease vs. 
purchase determinations. Such determinations shall be made:
    (1) at time of original acquisition;
    (2) when lease renewals are being considered; and
    (3) at other times as circumstances warrant.
    (s) Quality Assurance. Contractors shall provide no less protection 
for the Government in its subcontracts than is provided in the prime 
contract.
    (t) Setoff of Assigned Subcontractor Proceeds. Where a subcontractor 
has been permitted to assign payments to a financial institution, the 
assignment shall treat any right of setoff in accordance with 48 CFR 
932.803.
    (u) Strategic and Critical Materials. The contractor may use 
strategic and critical materials in the National Defense Stockpile.
    (v) Termination. When subcontracts are terminated as a result of the 
termination of all or a portion of this contract, the contractor shall 
settle with subcontractors in conformity with the policies and 
principles relating to settlement of prime contracts in 48 CFR Subparts 
49.1, 49.2 and 49.3. When subcontracts are terminated for reasons other 
than termination of this contract, the contractor shall settle such 
subcontracts in general conformity with the policies and principles in 
48 CFR Subparts 49.1, 49.2, 49.3 and 49.4. Each such termination shall 
be documented and consistent with the terms of this contract. 
Terminations which require approval by the Government shall be supported 
by accounting data and other information as may be directed by the 
contracting officer.
    (w) Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information. Subcontracts 
involving unclassified uncontrolled nuclear information shall be treated 
in accordance with 10 CFR part 1017.

<R05>
Sec. 970.5245-1  Property.

    As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.4501-1(a), insert the following clause:

                           Property (DEC 2000)

    (a) Furnishing of Government property. The Government reserves the 
right to furnish any property or services required for the performance 
of the work under this contract.
    (b) Title to property. Except as otherwise provided by the 
contracting officer, title to all materials, equipment, supplies, and 
tangible personal property of every kind and description purchased by 
the contractor, for the cost of which the contractor is entitled to be 
reimbursed as a direct item of cost under this contract, shall pass 
directly from the vendor to the Government. The Government reserves the 
right to inspect, and to accept or reject, any item of such property. 
The contractor shall make such disposition of rejected items as the 
contracting officer shall direct. Title to other property, the cost of 
which is reimbursable to the contractor under this contract, shall pass 
to and vest in the Government upon (1) issuance for use of such property 
in the performance of this contract, or (2) commencement of processing 
or use of such property in the performance of

[[Page 514]]

this contract, or (3) reimbursement of the cost thereof by the 
Government, whichever first occurs. Property furnished by the Government 
and property purchased or furnished by the contractor, title to which 
vests in the Government, under this paragraph are hereinafter referred 
to as Government property. Title to Government property shall not be 
affected by the incorporation of the property into or the attachment of 
it to any property not owned by the Government, nor shall such 
Government property or any part thereof, be or become a fixture or lose 
its identity as personality by reason of affixation to any realty.
    (c) Identification. To the extent directed by the contracting 
officer, the contractor shall identify Government property coming into 
the contractor's possession or custody, by marking and segregating in 
such a way, satisfactory to the contracting officer, as shall indicate 
its ownership by the Government.
    (d) Disposition. The contractor shall make such disposition of 
Government property which has come into the possession or custody of the 
contractor under this contract as the contracting officer may direct 
during the progress of the work or upon completion or termination of 
this contract. The contractor may, upon such terms and conditions as the 
contracting officer may approve, sell, or exchange such property, or 
acquire such property at a price agreed upon by the contracting officer 
and the contractor as the fair value thereof. The amount received by the 
contractor as the result of any disposition, or the agreed fair value of 
any such property acquired by the contractor, shall be applied in 
reduction of costs allowable under this contract or shall be otherwise 
credited to account to the Government, as the contracting officer may 
direct. Upon completion of the work or the termination of this contract, 
the contractor shall render an accounting, as prescribed by the 
contracting officer, of all government property which had come into the 
possession or custody of the contractor under this contract.
    (e) Protection of government property--management of high-risk 
property and classified materials. (1) The contractor shall take all 
reasonable precautions, and such other actions as may be directed by the 
contracting officer, or in the absence of such direction, in accordance 
with sound business practice, to safeguard and protect government 
property in the contractor's possession or custody.
    (2) In addition, the contractor shall ensure that adequate 
safeguards are in place, and adhered to, for the handling, control and 
disposition of high-risk property and classified materials throughout 
the life cycle of the property and materials consistent with the 
policies, practices and procedures for property management contained in 
the Federal Property Management regulations (41 CFR chapter 101), the 
Department of Energy Property Management regulations (41 CFR chapter 
109), and other applicable regulations.
    (3) High-risk property is property, the loss, destruction, damage 
to, or the unintended or premature transfer of which could pose risks to 
the public, the environment, or the national security interests of the 
United States. High-risk property includes proliferation sensitive, 
nuclear related dual use, export controlled, chemically or radioactively 
contaminated, hazardous, and specially designed and prepared property, 
including property on the militarily critical technologies list.
    (f) Risk of loss of Government property. (1)(i) The contractor shall 
not be liable for the loss or destruction of, or damage to, Government 
property unless such loss, destruction, or damage was caused by any of 
the following:
    (A) Willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the 
contractor's managerial personnel;
    (B) Failure of the contractor's managerial personnel to take all 
reasonable steps to comply with any appropriate written direction of the 
contracting officer to safeguard such property under paragraph (e) of 
this clause; or
    (C) Failure of contractor managerial personnel to establish, 
administer, or properly maintain an approved property management system 
in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this clause.
    (ii) If, after an initial review of the facts, the contracting 
officer informs the contractor that there is reason to believe that the 
loss, destruction of, or damage to the government property results from 
conduct falling within one of the categories set forth above, the burden 
of proof shall be upon the contractor to show that the contractor should 
not be required to compensate the government for the loss, destruction, 
or damage.
    (2) In the event that the contractor is determined liable for the 
loss, destruction or damage to Government property in accordance with 
(f)(1) of this clause, the contractor's compensation to the Government 
shall be determined as follows:
    (i) For damaged property, the compensation shall be the cost of 
repairing such damaged property, plus any costs incurred for temporary 
replacement of the damaged property. However, the value of repair costs 
shall not exceed the fair market value of the damaged property. If a 
fair market value of the property does not exist, the contracting 
officer shall determine the value of such property, consistent with all 
relevant facts and circumstances.
    (ii) For destroyed or lost property, the compensation shall be the 
fair market value of such property at the time of such loss or

[[Page 515]]

destruction, plus any costs incurred for temporary replacement and costs 
associated with the disposition of destroyed property. If a fair market 
value of the property does not exist, the contracting officer shall 
determine the value of such property, consistent with all relevant facts 
and circumstances.
    (3) The portion of the cost of insurance obtained by the contractor 
that is allocable to coverage of risks of loss referred to in paragraph 
(f)(1) of this clause is not allowable.
    (g) Steps to be taken in event of loss. In the event of any damage, 
destruction, or loss to Government property in the possession or custody 
of the contractor with a value above the threshold set out in the 
contractor's approved property management system, the contractor:
    (1) Shall immediately inform the contracting officer of the occasion 
and extent thereof,
    (2) Shall take all reasonable steps to protect the property 
remaining, and
    (3) Shall repair or replace the damaged, destroyed, or lost property 
in accordance with the written direction of the contracting officer. The 
contractor shall take no action prejudicial to the right of the 
Government to recover therefore, and shall furnish to the Government, on 
request, all reasonable assistance in obtaining recovery.
    (h) Government property for Government use only. Government property 
shall be used only for the performance of this contract.
    (i) Property Management. (1) Property Management System. (i) The 
contractor shall establish, administer, and properly maintain an 
approved property management system of accounting for and control, 
utilization, maintenance, repair, protection, preservation, and 
disposition of Government property in its possession under the contract. 
The contractor's property management system shall be submitted to the 
contracting officer for approval and shall be maintained and 
administered in accordance with sound business practice, applicable 
Federal Property Management regulations and Department of Energy 
Property Management regulations, and such directives or instructions 
which the contracting officer may from time to time prescribe.
    (ii) In order for a property management system to be approved, it 
must provide for:
    (A) Comprehensive coverage of property from the requirement 
identification, through its life cycle, to final disposition;
    (B) Employee personal responsibility and accountability for 
Government-owned property;
    (C) Full integration with the contractor's other administrative and 
financial systems; and
    (D) A method for continuously improving property management 
practices through the identification of best practices established by 
``best in class'' performers.
    (iii) Approval of the contractor's property management system shall 
be contingent upon the completion of the baseline inventory as provided 
in subparagraph (i)(2) of this clause.
    (2) Property Inventory. (i) Unless otherwise directed by the 
contracting officer, the contractor shall within six months after 
execution of the contract provide a baseline inventory covering all 
items of Government property.
    (ii) If the contractor is succeeding another contractor in the 
performance of this contract, the contractor shall conduct a joint 
reconciliation of the property inventory with the predecessor 
contractor. The contractor agrees to participate in a joint 
reconciliation of the property inventory at the completion of this 
contract. This information will be used to provide a baseline for the 
succeeding contract as well as information for closeout of the 
predecessor contract.
    (j) The term ``contractor's managerial personnel'' as used in this 
clause means the contractor's directors, officers and any of its 
managers, superintendents, or other equivalent representatives who have 
supervision or direction of:
    (1) All or substantially all of the contractor's business; or
    (2) All or substantially all of the contractor's operations at any 
one facility or separate location to which this contract is being 
performed; or
    (3) A separate and complete major industrial operation in connection 
with the performance of this contract; or
    (4) A separate and complete major construction, alteration, or 
repair operation in connection with performance of this contract; or
    (5) A separate and discrete major task or operation in connection 
with the performance of this contract.
    (k) The contractor shall include this clause in all cost 
reimbursable subcontracts.

                             (End of Clause)

    Alternate I (DEC 2000). As prescribed in 48 CFR 970.4501-1(b), when 
the award is to a nonprofit contractor, replace paragraph (j) of the 
basic clause with the following paragraph (j):
    (j) The term ``contractor's managerial personnel'' as used in this 
clause means the contractor's directors, officers and any of its 
managers, superintendents, or other equivalent representatives who have 
supervision or direction of all or substantially all of:
    (1) The contractor's business; or

[[Page 516]]

    (2) The contractor's operations at any one facility or separate 
location at which this contract is being performed; or
    (3) The contractor's Government property system and/or a Major 
System Acquisition or Major Project as defined in DOE Order 4700.1 
(Version in effect on effective date of contract).

    Authority: 41 U.S.C. 418b (a) and (b), as delegated by Department of 
the Treasury Order 101-30 and Treasury Directive 12-11.

                         Subpart 1033.1_Protests


<R05>
Sec. 1033.103  Protests to the Agency.

    (a) Policy. It is the Department's policy to resolve protests in an 
informal manner whenever possible. Protesters are strongly encouraged to 
address their concerns to the contracting officer prior to resorting to 
litigation or other formal, external means of resolution. The objectives 
of the following procedures are to resolve agency protests effectively, 
to help build confidence in the Department's procurement system, to 
reduce the need to file protests at GAO or GSBCA, and to provide both 
the Department and the protester maximum information regarding their 
respective positions.
    (b) Procedures. (1) Agency protest may be submitted by interested 
parties to the contracting officer, who will normally be designated in 
FAR provision 52.233-2 of the solicitation.
    (2) Protests based on alleged improprieties in a solicitation which 
are apparent prior to bid opening or the closing date for receipt of 
initial proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the closing 
date for receipt of initial proposals. In negotiated acquisitions, 
alleged improprieties which do not exist in the initial solicitation but 
which are subsequently incorporated into the solicitation must be 
protested not later than the next closing date for receipt of proposals 
following the incorporation.
    (3) In cases other than those covered in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, protests shall be filed not later than 10 working days after 
the basis of protest is known or should have been known, whichever is 
earlier.
    (4) Protests shall be in writing and shall include, as a minimum, 
the following information:
    (i) Name, address, and telephone number of the protestor;
    (ii) Solicitation or contract number;
    (iii) Detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for the 
protest, including copies of relevant documents;
    (iv) Request for a ruling by the contracting officer to whom the 
protest is submitted;
    (v) Statement as to the form of relief requested.
    (5) Protest submissions shall be concise, logically arranged, and 
state sufficient grounds of protest. Failure to comply with any of the 
above requirements may be grounds for dismissal of the protest. A 
protester may request an informal conference with the contracting 
officer, which may be granted at the latter's sole discretion.
    (6) Upon receipt of an agency protest, the contracting officer 
shall:
    (i) Immediately notify legal counsel and the Departmental Office of 
Procurement (MMK) and provide each with a copy of the protest;
    (ii) Prepare a report as prescribed in FAR 33.104(a)(2), except 
that, if the contract action or contract performance continues after 
receipt of the protest, the report shall include any determination 
prescribed in FAR 33.103(a) or 1033.103(b)(9);
    (iii) Obtain review of the protest response by legal counsel and 
forward the protest response for MMK review and approval at least three 
working days prior to the due date; and
    (iv) Ensure that the protest response is received by the protester 
no later than 25 working days after receipt of the protest.
    (7) If the contracting officer and the protester agree on corrective 
action, a report is not required; however, in addition to amending the 
solicitation or taking other corrective action, the contracting officer 
shall inform the protester in writing of the proposed corrective action 
and shall obtain from

[[Page 520]]

the protester a written notice withdrawing the protest. A copy of this 
notice and any amendment shall be provided to MMK.
    (8) If a written protest before award has been lodged with the 
contracting officer, only the bureau chief procurement officer may make 
the determination described in FAR 33.103(a). Prior to making an award 
of a contract under the circumstances in FAR 33.103(a), the advice of 
legal counsel shall be obtained.
    (9) If a written protest after award has been lodged with the 
contracting officer, the bureau chief procurement officer may authorize 
contract performance notwithstanding the pending protest if he or she 
makes a written determination that (i) performance of the contract is in 
the Government's best interest, or (ii) urgent and compelling 
circumstances significantly affecting interests of the United States do 
not permit waiting for the protest decision. A copy of this 
determination shall be forwarded to MMK.

appeals of decisions of contracting officers filed by contractors 
pursuant to Subpart 33.2 of the FAR (other than contracts of the 
Comptroller of the Currency). Where ``agency Board of Contract Appeal''

contains the operating administration acronym directly preceding the 
cite/page number.

[[Page 524]]

The following acronyms apply when regulatory coverage is written:

FAA--Federal Aviation Administration
FHWA--Federal Highway Administration
FRA--Federal Railroad Administration
FTA--Federal Transit Administration
MARAD--Maritime Administration
NHTSA--National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
RSPA--Research and Special Programs Administration
SLSDC--Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation
TASC--Transportation Administrative Service Center
USCG--United States Coast Guard

    (b) Numbering--(1) Departmentwide guidance.
    (i) The numbering illustrations at (FAR) 48 CFR 1.105-2 apply to the 
TAR.
    (ii) Coverage within (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 is identified by the 
prefix ``12'' followed by the complete FAR cite which may be down to the 
subparagraph level (e.g., (TAR) 48 CFR 1201.201-1).
    (iii) Coverage in this chapter 12 that supplements the FAR will use 
part, subpart, section and subsection numbers ending in ``70'' through 
``89''. A series of numbers beginning with ``70'' is used for provisions 
and clauses (e.g., (TAR) 48 CFR 1201.301-70).
    (iv) Coverage in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12, other than that identified 
with a ``70'' or higher number, that implements the FAR uses the 
identical number sequence and caption of the FAR segment being 
implemented which may be down to the subparagraph level. Subparagraph 
numbers/letters may not be shown as sequential, but may be shown by the 
specific paragraph/subparagraph implemented from the FAR (e.g., (TAR) 48 
CFR 1201.201-1 contains subparagraphs (b) and (d) because only these 
subparagraphs, correlating to FAR, are being supplemented by (TAR) 48 
CFR chapter 12).
    (2) Operating administration-unique guidance. Supplementary material 
for which there is no counterpart in the FAR or TAR shall be identified 
using chapter, part, subpart, section, or subsection numbers of ``90'' 
and up (e.g., the U.S. Coast Guard's acronym is ``USCG''; a USCG-unique 
clause pertaining to ``Inspection and/or Acceptance'' would be 
designated ``USCG 1252.246-90'').
    (c) References and citations. (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 may be 
referred to as the Department of Transportation Acquisition Regulation 
or the TAR. Cross references to the FAR in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 will 
be cited by ``FAR'' followed by the FAR numbered cite, and cross 
reference to the TAM in (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 will be cited by ``TAM'' 
followed by the TAM numbered cite. References to specific cites within 
(TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12 will be by the numbered cite only.

regulations. The authority of the agency head under (FAR) 48 CFR 
1.301(a)(1) is delegated to the Assistant Secretary for Administration.
    (ii) Operating administration acquisition regulations. Operating 
administration acquisition regulations, and any changes thereto, shall 
be reviewed and approved by the SPE for insertion into the TAR as a TAR 
supplemental regulation before the SPE submits the proposed coverage for 
publication in the Federal Register in accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR 
1.501. Operating administration regulations may be more restrictive or 
require higher approval levels than those permitted by (TAR) 48 CFR 
chapter 12 unless specified otherwise.
    (2) Acquisition procedures. The authority of the agency head under 
(FAR) 48 CFR 1.301(a)(2) to issue or authorize the issuance of internal 
agency guidance at any organizational level has been delegated to the 
SPE.
    (i) Departmentwide acquisition procedures. DOT internal operating 
procedures are contained in the Transportation Acquisition Manual (TAM).
    (ii) OA acquisition procedures. Procedures necessary to implement or 
supplement the FAR, TAR, or TAM may be issued by the HCA, who may 
delegate this authority to any organizational level deemed appropriate. 
OA procedures may be more restrictive or require higher approval levels 
than those permitted by the TAM unless specified otherwise.
    (b) The authority of the agency head under (FAR) 48 CFR 1.301(b) to

<R05>
Sec. 1201.301-70  Amendment of (TAR) 48 CFR chapter 12.

    (a) Changes to the regulation may be the result of recommendations 
from internal DOT personnel, other Government agencies, or the public. 
These changes are to be submitted in the following format to the Office 
of Acquisition and Grant Management, 400 7th Street, S.W., Washington, 
DC 20590:
    (1) Problem: Succinctly state the problems created by current TAR 
language and describe the factual and/or legal reasons necessitating 
regulatory change.
    (2) Recommendation: Identify the recommended change by using the 
current language and lining through the words being deleted and 
inserting proposed language in brackets. If the change is extensive, 
deleted language may be displayed by forming a box with diagonal lines 
connecting the corners.
    (3) Discussion: Explain why the change is necessary and how the 
change will solve the problem. Address any cost or administrative impact 
on Government activities, offerors, and contractors. Provide any other 
helpful information and documents such as statutes, legal decisions, 
regulations, reports, etc.
    (4) Point of contact: Provide a point of contact for answering 
questions regarding the recommendation.
    (b) The TAR will be maintained by the SPE through the TAR/TAM change

[[Page 526]]

process (i.e., representatives from DOT operating administrations 
specifically designated to formulate Departmental acquisition policies 
and procedures).
    (1) Transportation Acquisition Circular (TAC). TACs containing 
loose-leaf replacement pages which revise parts, subparts, or paragraphs 
(also see (TAR) 48 CFR 1201.301-72 below) will be used to amend (TAR) 48 
CFR chapter 12. Each replacement page will bear at the top the TAC 
number and date. A vertical bar next to the coverage indicates that a 
change has been made.
    (2) TAR Notice (TN). (i) TNs shall be issued when interim guidance 
is necessary and as often as may be necessary, under any of the 
following circumstances:
    (A) To promulgate, as rapidly as possible, selected material in a 
general or narrative manner, in advance of a TAC issuance;
    (B) To disseminate other acquisition related information; or
    (C) To issue guidance which is expected to be effective for a period 
of 1 year or less.
    (ii) Each TN will terminate upon its specified expiration date.

<R05>
Sec. 1201.301-71  Effective date.

    Unless otherwise stated, the following applies--
    (a) Statements in TACs or TNs to the effect that the material 
therein is ``effective upon receipt,'' ``upon a specified date,'' or 
that changes set forth in the document are ``to be used upon receipt,'' 
mean that any new or revised provisions, clauses, procedures, or forms 
must be included in solicitations, contracts or modifications issued 
thereafter; and
    (b) Unless expressly directed by statute or regulation, if 
solicitations are already in process or negotiations complete when the 
TAC or TN is received, the new information (e.g., forms and clauses) 
need not be included if it is determined by the chief of the contracting 
office that its inclusion would not be in the best interest of the 
Government.


<R05>
Sec. 1201.301-72  TAC or TN numbering.

    TACs and TNs will be numbered consecutively on a fiscal year basis 
beginning with number ``01'' prefixed by the last two digits of the 
fiscal year (e.g., TNs 94-01 and 94-02 indicate the first two TNs issued 
in fiscal year 1994).


<R05>
Sec. 1201.304  Agency control and compliance procedures.

    (a) DOT shall control the proliferation of acquisition regulations 
and any revisions thereto (except as noted in paragraph (b) of this 
section) by using an internal TAR change process that involves input 
from many DOT elements including operating administration 
representatives on the Procurement Management Council. The operating 
administration member shall represent their operating administration's 
viewpoint along with Departmentwide considerations in reaching a 
decision on TAR changes.
    (b) Operating administration-unique regulations will not be 
processed through the TAR Council System, but shall be reviewed by 
operating administration legal counsel and submitted to M-60 for review 
and approval. (See (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.101 for additional instructions 
pertaining to provisions and clauses.)

    (b) Policy. It is the policy of DOT that all procurements are to be 
made only by Government officials having authority to make such 
acquisitions. Procurements made by other than authorized personnel are

          administrative remedies.

    (a) The COCO is the reviewing official for processing violations.
    (1) When the contracting officer receives information of a violation 
or possible violation, and concludes that the reported violation or 
possible violation of the statutory prohibitions has no impact on the 
pending procurement, the contracting officer shall forward the 
information required by (FAR) 48 CFR 3.104-11(a)(1) to the COCO for 
concurrence with the contracting officer's conclusion. If the COCO 
concurs with the conclusion, the contracting officer shall proceed with 
the award, and the COCO shall submit the information and conclusion to 
the HCA.

[[Page 529]]

    (2) When the COCO does not concur with the conclusion of the 
contracting officer, the COCO shall advise the contracting officer to 
withhold award, and the COCO shall promptly forward the information and 
documentation to the HCA.

with subparagraph (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section and take 
appropriate action, as required by (FAR) 48 CFR 3.104-11(b).
    (c) If the HCA believes that a violation has occurred and the 
information should be disclosed to a criminal investigative agency (e.g, 
the Department of Justice) or that there may be a possible violation, 
and an investigation should be conducted, the HCA shall obtain guidance 
from legal counsel and the OIG prior to taking any action. If the HCA, 
pursuant to (FAR) 48 CFR 3.104-11(f), determines that award is justified 
by urgent and compelling circumstances, or is otherwise in the interests 
of the Government, a memorandum of the facts and circumstances shall be

if the contracting officer is suspected of the violation). The 
contracting officer (or COCO) shall obtain from the person reporting the 
violation, and any witnesses to the violation, the following 
information:
    (1) The date, time, and place of the suspected violation;
    (2) The name and title (if known) of the individual(s) involved in 
the violation; and
    (3) The details of the violation (e.g., the gratuity offered or 
intended) to obtain a contract or favorable treatment under a contract.
    (b) The person reporting the violation and witnesses (if any) should 
be requested to sign and date the information certifying that the 
information furnished is true and correct.
    (c) The COCO shall report suspected violations to the Office of the 
Inspector General (OIG) (J-1), 400 7th Street, S.W., Washington, DC, 
20590, with a copy to General Counsel (C-1) and the OA's Chief Counsel.


<R05>
Sec. 1203.204  Treatment of violations.

    (a) The authority of the agency head established in (FAR) 48 CFR 
3.204(a), to determine whether a gratuities clause violation has 
occurred, has been delegated to the HCA. If the decision maker pursuant 
to this delegation has been personally and substantially involved in the 
procurement, the advice of Government legal counsel should be sought to 
determine whether an alternate decision maker should be designated.
    (b) The COCO shall ensure that the hearing procedures required by 
FAR 3.204 are afforded to the contractor. Government legal counsel 
should be consulted regarding the appropriateness of the hearing 
procedures that are established.
    (c) If the alleged gratuities violation occurs during the ``conduct 
of an agency procurement'' as defined by (FAR) 48 CFR 3.104-4(c)(1), the 
COCO shall consult with Government legal counsel regarding the approach 
for appropriate processing of either the Procurement Integrity Act 
violation and/or the Gratuities violation.

    Source: 61 FR 391, Jan. 5, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1213.7100  Applicability.

    (a) DOT policy at (TAR) 48 CFR 1237.7000 also applies to the 
Standard Form (SF) 182, Request, Authorization, Agreement and 
Certification of Training, which may be used to acquire training 
services; however, the policy does not apply to training services 
acquired by the Government purchase/credit card. The Government 
purchase/credit card can only be used to acquire training services 
valued at $2,500 or less.
    (b) As reflected in (TAR) 48 CFR 1237.7002, this policy does not 
apply to training attended by DOT employees which is scheduled and 
conducted by Government sources of supply, educational institutions, or 
private entities where DOT does not control or sponsor the training. 
Examples of when the policy does and does not apply include:
    (1) When SF 182s are issued for three DOT employees to attend a one 
week course at a university or other private entity, the policy does not 
apply. DOT does not control this course because the university or 
private entity has a contract in place with the training provider and 
DOT is placing an order under an existing contract; and
    (2) When DOT awards a contract to a university or other private 
entity to provide training for DOT and/or other Government personnel, 
the policy applies. DOT controls this course; therefore, no soliciting 
or advertising of private, non-Government training while conducting the 
contracted-for training is permitted.

for quotations, and the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.237-72, Prohibition 
on Advertising, in solicitations, requests for quotations, and all 
contracts (e.g., purchase orders, SF 182s) for training services when 
the content and/or presentation of the training is controlled by DOT.
    (b) Contracting officers shall incorporate the successful offeror's 
certified data into any resultant contract(s). Certified data may be 
incorporated by reference, if the contracting officer determines it 
contains sufficient descriptive information (i.e., dated material such 
as resumes, company and/or personnel qualifications) to reliably 
describe the certified data submitted.

Application, constitutes the notification required under (FAR) 48 CFR

reasonable time after receipt of the SF 129 or if an applicant does not 
meet the criteria for placement on the list, the contracting officer 
shall provide a written notification of acceptance or non-acceptance to 
the applicant within 45 days of application receipt.

                  Subpart 1215.6_Unsolicited Proposals


<R05>
Sec. 1215.602  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Department of Transportation (DOT) to 
encourage the submission of new and innovative ideas which will support 
DOT's mission. Through the various Operating Administrations (OA), DOT 
is responsible for transportation safety improvements and endorsement, 
international transportation agreements and the continuity of 
transportation services in the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 1215.603  General.

    DOT will accept for review and consideration, unsolicited proposals 
from any entity. However, DOT will not pay any costs associated with the 
preparation of these proposals. Proposals which do not meet the 
definition and applicable content and marking requirements of (FAR) 48 
CFR 15.6 will not be considered under any circumstances and will be 
returned to the submitter.

[[Page 537]]


<R05>
Sec. 1215.604  Agency points of contact.

    (a) The DOT does not have a centralized location to receive 
unsolicited proposals. The effort submitted in the proposal determines 
which DOT OA should receive and evaluate the proposal.
    (b) Proposers should submit proposals to the cognizant OA 
contracting office for appropriate handling. Specific information 
concerning each DOT OA and the type of commodities which they normally 
procure are available on the worldwide web at http://www.dot.gov. 
Proposers are urged to contact these contracting/procurement offices 
prior to submitting a proposal to ensure that the proposal is being 
submitted to the appropriate contracting office for action. This action 
will serve to reduce paperwork and time for the Government and the 
proposer.


<R05>
Sec. 1215.606  Agency procedures.

    (a) The OA contracting office is designated as the point of contact 
for receipt of unsolicited proposals. Persons within DOT (e.g., 
technical personnel) who receive unsolicited proposals shall forward the 
document to their cognizant contracting office.
    (b) Within ten working days after receipt of an unsolicited 
proposal, the contracting office shall review the proposal and determine 
whether the proposal meets the content and marking requirements of (FAR) 
48 CFR 15.6. If the proposal does not meet these requirements, it shall 
be returned to the submitter giving the reasons for noncompliance.


<R05>
Sec. 1215.606-2  Evaluation.

    (a) If the proposal is in compliance, the contracting office shall 
acknowledge receipt of the proposal to the proposer and give the date 
the proposal evaluation is expected to be completed. The proposal shall 
be marked as required by (FAR) 48 CFR 15.609 and forwarded to the 
appropriate technical office for evaluation. The evaluating office shall 
be given reasonable time to complete the evaluation. However, in no 
event should an evaluation take more than sixty calendar days after 
receipt of the proposal except under extenuating circumstances. 
Contracting offices shall establish a system to ensure that this 
timeframe is met. If the date can not be met, the proposer shall be 
advised accordingly and be given a revised evaluation completion date.
    (b) The evaluating office shall neither reproduce nor disseminate 
the proposal to other offices without the consent of the contracting 
office from which the proposal was received for evaluation. If 
additional information from the proposer is required by the evaluating 
office, the evaluator shall convey this request to the contracting 
office in lieu of the proposer. The evaluator shall not communicate 
directly with the originator of the proposal.
    (c) If the evaluator recommends acceptance of the proposal, the 
cognizant contracting officer shall ensure compliance with all of the 
requirements of (FAR) 48 CFR 15.607.

48 CFR 1252.217-74 and (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-76 through (TAR) 48 CFR

[[Page 539]]

of defects and deficiencies, no guarantee clause for that purpose shall 
be included in the contract.
    (2) The customary guarantee period, to be inserted in the first 
sentence of the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-81, Guarantee, is 60

longer guarantee period will not involve increased costs, a longer 
guarantee period may be substituted by the contracting officer for the 
usual 60 days; or
    (ii) Where the full inquiry discloses that such longer guarantee 
period will involve, or is reasonably expected to involve, increased 
costs, such facts and the reasons for the need for such longer period 
shall be set forth in letter form to the COCO, requesting approval for 
use of guarantee period in excess of 60 days. Upon approval, the longer 
period may be inserted by the contracting officer in the first sentence 
of the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.217-81, Guarantee.

    (c) SF 25, Performance Bond, prescribed at (FAR) 48 CFR 28.106-1(c), 
must provide coverage for taxes imposed by the United States which are 
collected, deducted, or withheld from wages paid by the contractor. 
Forms other than the SF 25 (e.g., a commercial form) shall not be used 
by contractors when a performance bond is required.


<R05>
Sec. 1228.106-6  Furnishing of information.

    (b) The contracting officer shall, upon request, furnish the name 
and address of the prime contractor's surety or sureties to employees, 
suppliers, and subcontractors having a contractual or employment 
relationship with prime contractors, subcontractors or suppliers. When 
furnishing surety information, the inquirer may also be informed that:
    (1) Persons believing that they have legal remedies under the Miller 
Act are cautioned to consult their own legal advisor regarding the 
proper steps to take to obtain remedies.
    (2) On construction contracts exceeding $2,000, if the contracting 
officer is informed (through routine compliance checking, a complaint, 
or a request for information) that a laborer, mechanic, apprentice, 
trainee, watchman, or guard employed by the contractor or subcontractor 
at any tier may have been paid wages less than those required by the 
applicable labor standards provisions of the contract, the contracting 
officer shall promptly initiate an investigation in accordance with 
(FAR) 48 CFR subpart 22.4, irrespective of the employee's rights under

[[Page 544]]

the Miller Act. When an employee's request for information is involved, 
the contracting officer shall inform the inquirer that such 
investigation will be made. Such investigation is required pursuant to 
the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act, Contract Work Hours and Safety 
Standards Act, and Copeland (Anti-Kickback) Act for assuring proper 
payment to such employees.
    (c) When furnishing a copy of a payment bond and contract in 
accordance with (FAR) 48 CFR 28.106-6(c), the requirement for a copy of 
the contract may be satisfied by furnishing a machine-duplicate copy of 
the contractor's first pages which show the contract number and date, 
the contractor's name and signature, the contracting officer's 
signature, and the description of the contract work. The contracting 
officer furnishing the copies shall place the statement ``Certified to 
be a true and correct copy'' followed by his/her signature, title and 
name of the OA. The fee for furnishing the requested certified copies 
shall be determined in accordance with the DOT Freedom of Information 
Act regulation, 49 CFR part 7, ((TAR) 48 CFR 1224.202).


<R05>
Sec. 1228.106-70  Execution and administration of bonds.

    (a) The surety shall be notified, as soon as feasible, of the 
contractor's failure to perform in accordance with the terms of the 
contract.
    (b) When a partnership is a principal on a bond, the names of all 
the members of the firm shall be listed in the bond following the name 
of the firm, and the phrase ``a partnership composed of.'' If a 
principal is a corporation, the state of incorporation must also appear 
on the bond.
    (c) Performance or payment bond other than an annual bond shall not 
antedate the contract to which it pertains.
    (d) Bonds shall be filed with the original contract to which they 
apply, or all bonds shall be separately maintained and reviewed 
quarterly for validity. If separately maintained, each contract file 
shall cross-reference the applicable bonds.


<R05>
Sec. 1228.106-490  Contract clause. (USCG)

    The contracting officer shall insert the USCG clause at (TAR) 48 CFR

Sec. 1228.306-70  Contracts for lease of aircraft.

    (a) The contracting officer shall insert the clauses at (TAR) 48 CFR 
1252.228-70 through 1252.228-72, unless otherwise indicated by the 
specific instructions for their use, in any contract for the lease of 
aircraft (including aircraft used in out-service flight training).
    (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 
1252.228-70, Loss of or Damage to Leased Aircraft, in any contract for 
the lease of aircraft, except in the following circumstances:
    (1) When the hourly rental rate does not exceed $250 and the total 
rental cost for any single transaction is not in excess of $2,500;
    (2) When the cost of hull insurance does not exceed 10 percent of 
the contract rate; or
    (3) When the lessor's insurer does not grant a credit for uninsured 
hours, thereby preventing the lessor from granting the same to the 
Government.
    (c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 
1252.228-71, Fair Market Value of Aircraft, when fair market value of 
the aircraft can be determined.
    (d) Section 504 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, 
provides that no lessor of an aircraft under a bona fide lease of 30 
days or more shall be liable by reason of his interest as lessor or 
title-holder of the aircraft for any injury to or death of persons, or 
damage to or loss of property, unless such aircraft is in the actual 
possession or control of such person at the time of such injury, death, 
damage or loss. On short-term or intermittent-use leases,

[[Page 545]]

however, the owner may be liable for damage caused by operation of the 
aircraft. It is usual for the aircraft owner to retain insurance 
covering this liability during the term of such lease. Such insurance 
can, often for little or no increase in premium, be made to cover the 
Government's exposure to liability as well. In order to take advantage 
of this coverage, the Risks and Indemnities clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 
1252.228-72 prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be 
used.
    (1) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 
1252.228-72, Risk and Indemnities, in any contract for out-service 
flight training or for the lease of aircraft when the Government will 
have exclusive use of the aircraft for a period of less than thirty 
days.
    (2) Any contract for out-service flight training shall include a 
clause in the contract schedule stating substantially that the 
contractor's personnel shall at all times during the course of the 
training be in command of the aircraft, and that at no time shall other 
personnel be permitted to take command of the aircraft.

    (a) The decision to incur precontract costs is that of the 
contractor. No DOT employee can authorize, demand, or require a 
contractor to incur precontract costs. The contracting officer may 
advise the prospective contractor that any costs incurred before 
contract award are at the contractor's sole risk and that if 
negotiations fail to result in a binding contract, payment of these 
costs may not be made by the Government.
    (b) When the contracting officer determines that incurring 
precontract costs was necessary to meet the proposed contract delivery 
schedule of a cost-reimbursement contract, the clause at (TAR) 48 CFR 
1252.231-70, Date of Incurrence of Costs, may be inserted in the 
resultant contract.

Personal (Continuation Sheet), shall be completed in accordance with the 
below instructions.
    1. Use the same basic instructions for the SF 1035 as used for the 
SF 1034. Ensure that the contract and, if applicable, order number, are 
shown on information required by the contract, contracting officer, or 
cognizant audit agency; however, if more than one sheet of SF 1035 is 
used, each sheet shall be in numerical sequence.
    2. The following items are generally entered below the line with 
Number and Date of Order; Date of Delivery or Service; Articles or 
Services; Quantity; Unit Price; and Amount (but do not necessarily tie 
to these captions).
    3. Description of data to be inserted as it applies to the contract 
or order number.
    a. Show, as applicable, the target or estimated costs, target or 
fixed-fee, and total contract value, as adjusted by any modifications to 
the contract or order. The FAR permits the contracting officer to 
withhold a percentage of fixed fee until a reserve is set aside in an 
amount that is considered necessary to protect the Government's 
interest.
    b. Show the following costs and supporting data (as applicable) to 
the contract or order:
    (1) Direct Labor. List each labor category, rate per labor hour, 
hours worked, and extended total labor dollars per labor category.
    (2) Premium Pay/Overtime. List each labor category, rate per labor 
hour, hours worked, and the extended total labor dollars per labor 
category. Note: Advance written authorization must be received from the 
contracting officer to work overtime or to pay premium rates; therefore, 
identify the contracting officer's written authorization to the 
contractor.
    (3) Fringe Benefits. If fringe benefits are included in the overhead 
pool, no entry is required. If the contract allows for a separate fringe 
benefit pool, cite the formula (rate and base) in effect during the time 
the costs were incurred. If the contract allows for billing fringe 
benefits as a direct expense, show the actual fringe benefit costs.
    (4) Materials, Supplies, Equipment. Show those items normally 
treated as direct costs. Expendable items need not be itemized and may 
be grouped into major classifications such as office supplies. However, 
items valued at $5,000 or more must be itemized. See (FAR) 48 CFR part 
45, Government Property, for reporting of property.
    (5) Travel. List the name and title of traveller, place of travel, 
and travel dates. If the

[[Page 547]]

travel claim is based on the actual costs expended, show the amount for 
the mode of travel (i.e., airline, private auto, taxi, etc.), lodging, 
meals, and other incidental expenses separately, on a daily basis. These 
actual costs must be supported with receipts to substantiate the costs 
paid. Travel costs for consultants must be shown separately and also 
supported.
    (6) Other Direct Costs. Itemize those costs that cannot be placed in 
categories (1) through (5) above. Categorize these costs to the extent 
possible.
    (7) Total Direct Costs. Cite the sum of categories (1) through (6) 
above.
    (8) Overhead. Cite the rate, base, and extended amount.
    (9) G&A Expense. Cite the rate, base, and extended amount.
    (10) Total Costs. Cite the sum of categories (7) through (9) above.
    (11) Fee. Cite the rate, base, and extended amount.
    (12) Total Cost and Fee Claimed. Enter this amount on the SF 1034.

                           Completion Voucher

    The completion (final) voucher is the last voucher to be submitted 
for incurred, allocable, and allowable costs expended to perform the 
contract or order. This voucher should include all contract reserves, 
allowable cost withholdings, balance of fixed fee, etc. However, the 
amount of the completion voucher when added to the total amount 
previously paid cannot exceed the total amount of the contract.

<R05>
Sec. 1237.104-91  Personal services contracts with individuals under the 
          authority of 10 U.S.C. 1091. (USCG)

    (a) Personal services contracts for health care services are 
authorized by 10 U.S.C. 1091 for the Coast Guard. Sources for contracts 
for health care services under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1091 shall be 
selected through procedures established in this section. These 
procedures do not apply to contracts awarded to business entities other 
than individuals. Selections made using the procedures in this section 
are exempt by statute from (TAR) 48 CFR part 1206 competition 
requirements (see (TAR) 48 CFR part 1206.9000 (USCG)) and from (FAR) 48 
CFR part 6 competition requirements.
    (b) The contracting officer must provide adequate advance notice of 
contracting opportunities to individuals residing in the area of the 
facility. The notice should include the qualification criteria against 
which individuals responding shall be evaluated. Contracting officers 
shall solicit offerors through the most effective means of seeking 
competition, such as a local publication which serves the area of the 
facility. Acquisitions for health care services using personal services 
contracts are exempt from posting and synopsis requirements of (FAR) 48 
CFR part 5.
    (c) The contracting officer shall provide the qualifications of 
individuals responding to the notice to the representative(s) 
responsible for evaluation and ranking in accordance with the evaluation 
procedures. Individuals must be considered solely on the professional 
qualifications established for the particular health care services being 
acquired and the Government's estimate of reasonable rates, fees, or 
costs. The representative(s) responsible for the evaluation and ranking 
shall provide the contracting officer with rationale for the ranking of 
the individuals consistent with the required qualifications.
    (d) Upon receipt of the ranked listing of offerors, the contracting 
officer shall either:
    (1) Enter into negotiations with the highest ranked offeror. If a 
mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, the contracting 
officer shall terminate negotiations with the highest ranked offeror and 
enter into negotiations with the next highest, or;
    (2) Enter into negotiations with all qualified offerors and select 
on the basis of qualifications and rates, fees, or other costs.
    (e) In the event only one individual responds to an advertised 
requirement, the contracting officer is authorized to negotiate the 
contract award. In this case, the individual must still meet the minimum 
qualifications of the requirement and the contracting officer must be 
able to make a determination that the price is fair and reasonable.
    (f) If a fair and reasonable price cannot be obtained from a 
qualified individual, the requirement should be canceled and acquired 
using procedures other than those set forth in this section.
    (g) The total amount paid to an individual in any year for health 
care services under a personal services contract shall not exceed the 
paycap in COMDTINST M4200.19 (series), Coast Guard Acquisition 
Procedures.
    (h) The contract may provide for the same per diem and travel 
expenses authorized for a Government employee,

[[Page 550]]

including actual transportation and per diem in lieu of subsistence for 
travel between home or place of business and official duty station and 
only for travel outside the local area in support of the statement of 
work.
    (i) Coordinate benefits, taxes and maintenance of records with the 
appropriate office(s).
    (j) The contracting officer shall insure that contract funds are 
sufficient to cover all contingency items that may be cited in the 
statement of work for health care services.

complete; and
    (b) Agree to not solicit or advertise private, non-Government 
training while conducting a training course.


<R05>
Sec. 1237.7001  Certification of data.

    Towards fulfilling DOT's policy at (TAR) 48 CFR 1237.7000(a), 
contracting officers shall request information from prospective 
contractors for certification purposes. The type of information 
requested is dependent upon the criticality of the service and/or any

    The policy at (TAR) 48 CFR 1237.7000 applies to all DOT contracts as 
defined in FAR 2.101 for training services when DOT controls the content 
and/or presentation of the course. This policy does not apply to courses 
attended by DOT employees which are offered and sponsored by Government 
sources of supply, educational institutions, or private entities where 
DOT does not control the course content or presentation. (See (TAR) 48 
CFR 1213.7100 for examples.)

at (TAR) 48 CFR 1252.237-72, Prohibition on Advertising, in 
solicitations and contracts for training services when the content and/
or presentation of the course is controlled by DOT.
    (b) Contracting officers shall incorporate the successful offeror's 
certified data into any resultant contract(s). Certified data may be 
incorporated by reference, if the contracting officer determines it 
contains sufficient descriptive information (i.e., dated material such 
as resumes, company and/or personnel qualifications) to reliably 
describe the certified data submitted.

to: (i) an identified revision of a top-level drawing; and/or (ii) an 
identified specification or revision thereof;
    (3) Require that the system conform to the specified Government 
performance requirements;
    (4) Require that all systems and components delivered under the 
contract will be free from defects in materials and workmanship;
    (5) State that in the event of failure due to nonconformance with 
specification and/or defects in material and workmanship, the contractor 
will bear the cost of all work necessary to achieve the specified 
performance requirements, including repair and/or replacement of all 
parts;
    (6) Require the timely replacement/repair of warranted items and 
specify lead times for replacement/repair where possible;
    (7) Identify the specific paragraphs containing Government 
performance requirements which must be met;
    (8) Ensure that any performance requirements identified as goals or 
objectives in excess of specification requirements are excluded from the 
warranty provision;
    (9) Define what constitutes the start of the warranty period (e.g., 
delivery, acceptance, in-service date), the ending of the warranty 
(e.g., passing a test or demonstration, or operation without failure for 
a specified time period), and circumstances requiring an extension of 
warranty duration (e.g., extending the warranty period as a result of 
mass defect correction during warranty period);
    (10) Identify what transportation costs will be paid by the 
contractor in conjunction with warranty coverage;
    (11) Identify any conditions which will not be covered by the 
warranty, other than the exclusion of combat damage; and
    (12) Identify any limitation on the total dollar amount of the 
contractor's warranty exposure, or agreement to share costs after a 
certain dollar threshold to avoid unnecessary warranty returns.
    (b) Any contract that contains a warranty clause must contain 
warranty implementation procedures, including warranty notification 
content and procedures, and identify the individuals responsible for 
implementation of warranty provisions. The contract may also permit the 
contractor's participation in investigation of system failures, 
providing that the contractor is reimbursed at established rates for 
fault isolation work, and that the Government receive credit for any 
payments where equipment failure is covered by warranty provisions.

46.710(b)(2).
    (b) For systems or components provided in accordance with either 
design and manufacturing or performance requirements as specified in the 
contract or any modification to that contract, a warranty of compliance 
with the stated requirements shall be obtained.
    (c) The warranty provided under paragraph (b) of this section shall 
provide that in the event the major system or any component thereof 
fails to meet the terms of the warranty provided, the contracting 
officer may:
    (1) Require the contractor to promptly take such corrective action 
as the contracting officer determines to be necessary at no additional 
cost to the Government, including repairing or replacing all parts 
necessary to achieve the requirements set forth in the contract;
    (2) Require the contractor to pay costs reasonably incurred by the 
United States in taking necessary corrective action; or
    (3) Equitably reduce the contract price.
    (d) Any warranty shall specifically exclude coverage of combat 
damage.


<R05>
Sec. 1246.790-2  Tailoring warranty terms and conditions. (USCG)

    (a) As the objectives and circumstances vary considerably among 
major systems acquisition programs, contracting officers shall 
appropriately tailor the warranty on a case-by-case basis, including 
remedies, exclusions, limitations and durations, provided the tailoring 
is consistent with the specific requirements of this subpart and (FAR) 
48 CFR 46.706.
    (b) Contracting officers of major systems acquisitions may exclude 
from the terms of the warranty certain defects for specified supplies 
(exclusions) and may limit the contractor's liability under the terms of 
the warranty (limitations), as appropriate, if necessary to derive a 
cost-effective warranty in light of the technical risk, contractor 
financial risk, or other program uncertainties.
    (c) Contracting officers are encouraged to structure a broader and 
more comprehensive warranty where such is advantageous. Likewise, the 
contracting officer may narrow the scope of a warranty when appropriate 
(e.g., where it would be inequitable to require a warranty of all 
performance requirements because a contractor had not designed the 
system).
    (d) Contracting officers shall not include in a warranty clause any 
terms that require the contractor to incur liability for loss, damage, 
or injury to third parties.


<R05>
Sec. 1246.790-3  Warranties on Government-furnished property. (USCG)

    A contractor for a major systems acquisition shall not be required 
to provide the warranties specified in (TAR) 48 CFR 1246.790-1 on any 
property furnished to that contractor by the Government except for:
    (a) Defects in installation; and
    (b) Installation or modification in such a manner that invalidates a 
warranty provided by the manufacturer of the property.


<R05>
Sec. 1246.791  Cost benefit analysis. (USCG)

    Warranties shall be obtained for a major systems acquisition only 
when it is cost beneficial in accordance with TAM (Copies of the 
Transportation Acquisition Manual may be obtained from the Government 
Printing Office) 1246.703. If a specific warranty is considered not to 
be cost beneficial by the contracting officer, a waiver request shall be 
initiated in accordance with USCG guidance at 48 CFR 1246.792.


<R05>
Sec. 1246.792  Waiver and notification procedures. (USCG)

    (a) The Secretary of Transportation, without delegation, may waive 
the requirement for a warranty for USCG

[[Page 556]]

major system acquisitions when the waiver is in the interest of national 
defense or if the warranty obtained would not be cost beneficial. A 
waiver may be granted provided that the Committees on Appropriations of 
the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Committee on Commerce, 
Science and Transportation of the Senate, and the Committee on Merchant 
Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives are notified, in 
writing, of the Secretary's intention to waive the warranty requirements 
and the reasons supporting such a determination prior to granting the 
waiver. The request for Secretarial waiver shall include, at a minimum:
    (1) A brief description of the major system and its stage of 
production (e.g., the number of units delivered and anticipated to be 
delivered during the life of the program);
    (2) The specific waiver requested, the duration of the waiver if it 
is to involve more than one contract, and the rationale for the waiver; 
and
    (3) All documentation supporting the request for waiver, such as a 
cost-benefit analysis.
    (b) The waiver request shall be forwarded to the Secretary, via the 
Office of Acquisition and Grant Management (M-60). The USCG shall 
maintain a written record of each waiver granted and the Congressional 
notification and report made, together with supporting documentation.

<R05>
Sec. 1252.209-70  Disclosure of conflicts of interest.

    As prescribed in 1209.507, insert the following provision:

             Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest (OCT 1994)

    It is the Department of Transportation's (DOT) policy to award 
contracts to only those offerors whose objectivity is not impaired 
because of any related past, present, or planned interest, financial or 
otherwise, in organizations regulated by DOT or in organizations whose 
interests may be substantially affected by Departmental activities. 
Based on this policy:
    (a) The offeror shall provide a statement in its proposal which 
describes in a concise manner all past, present or planned 
organizational, financial, contractual or other interest(s) with an 
organization regulated by DOT, or with an organization whose interests 
may be substantially affected by Depart-mental activities, and which is 
related to the work under this solicitation. The interest(s) described 
shall include those of the proposer, its affiliates, proposed 
consultants, proposed subcontractors and key personnel of any of the 
entities. Past interest shall be limited to within one year of the date 
of the offeror's technical proposal. Key personnel shall include any 
person owning more than 20% interest in the offeror, and the offeror's 
corporate officers, its senior managers and any employee who is 
responsible for making a decision or taking an action on this contract 
where the decision or action can have an economic or other impact on the 
interests of a regulated or affected organization.
    (b) The offeror shall describe in detail why it believes, in light 
of the interest(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this section, that 
performance of the proposed contract can be accomplished in an impartial 
and objective manner.
    (c) In the absence of any relevant interest identified in paragraph 
(a) of this section, the offeror shall submit in its proposal a 
statement certifying that to its best knowledge and belief no 
affiliation exists relevant to possible conflicts of interest. The 
offeror must obtain the same information from potential subcontractors 
prior to award of a subcontract.
    (d) The Contracting Officer will review the statement submitted and 
may require additional relevant information from the offeror. All such 
information, and any other relevant information known to DOT, will be 
used to determine whether an award to the offeror may create a conflict 
of interest. If any such conflict of interest is found to exist, the 
Contracting Officer may (1) disqualify the offeror, or (2) determine 
that it is otherwise in the best interest of the United States to 
contract with the offeror and include appropriate provisions to mitigate 
or avoid such conflict in the contract awarded.
    (e) The refusal to provide the disclosure or representation, or any 
additional information required, may result in disqualification of the 
offeror for award. If nondisclosure or misrepresentation is discovered 
after award, the resulting contract may be terminated. If after award 
the Contractor discovers a conflict of interest with respect to the 
contract awarded as a result of this solicitation, which could not 
reasonably have been know prior to award, an immediate and full 
disclosure shall be made in writing to the Contracting Officer. The 
disclosure shall include a full description of the conflict, a 
description of the action the contractor has taken, or proposes to take, 
to avoid or mitigate such conflict. The Contracting Officer may, 
however, terminate the contract for convenience if he or she deems that 
termination is in the best interest of the Government.

[[Page 559]]

                   Bar Coding Requirements (OCT 1994)

    Item markings shall include bar coding in accordance with MIL-STD-
1189 as follows:
    (a) The stock number shall be bar coded with no prefixes, dashes, 
spaces, or suffixes encoded. The contract number, the delivery order, or 
call order number, when used, shall be bar coded with no spaces or 
dashes encoded.
    (b) Prefixes and suffixes to the stock number may be included in the 
OCR-A in-the-clear markings, but not in the bar code.
    (c) Preferred Bar Code Density (characters per inch as defined in 
MIL-STD-1189) is ``standard,'' but densities from ``standard'' to 
``low'' are acceptable.
    (d) OCR-A characters do not have to be machine readable.
    (e) Bar coding shall be machine readable.
    (f) Unless otherwise specified herein, minimum bar code height shall 
be 0.25 inch (6.4 mm) or 15 percent of the bar code length, whichever is 
greater.
    (g) The preferred position of the OCR-A characters is beneath the 
bar codes, but the OCR-A characters may be over the bar codes.
    (h) On outer containers contractors shall either:
    (1) Encode the stock numbers and contract number in one line of bar 
code with the stock number appearing first; or
    (2) Encode the item stock number and contract number on two labels, 
with the top label containing the stock number and the lower label 
containing the contract number.
    (i) On unit and intermediate containers, the item stock number in 
bar code with OCR-A below may be on the same label as the other data 
(identification markings) required by MIL-STD-129H. However, the bar 
code stock number shall appear on the top line with OCR-A characters on 
the second line; the OCR-A characters may include the stock number 
prefix and suffix, or alternatively, the complete stock number including 
any prefix and suffix, shall be repeated as part of the identification 
markings.
    (j) Exclusions from bar code markings are:
    (1) Multi-packs/consolidation containers (containers with two or 
more different stock numbers within).
    (2) Reusable shipping containers used for multiple/ different stock 
number applications.
    (3) Items consigned to a prime contractor's plant for installation 
in production.

provision:

                     Brand Name or Equal (OCT 1994)

    (As used in this provision, the term ``brand name'' includes 
identification of products by make and model.)
    (a) If items called for by this solicitation have been identified in 
the schedule by a ``brand name or equal'' description, such 
identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and 
is intended to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that 
will be satisfactory. Offers offering ``equal'' products (including 
products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by 
brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly 
identified in the offers and are determined by the Government to meet 
fully the salient characteristic requirements listed in the 
solicitation.
    (b) Unless the offeror clearly indicates in its offer that it is 
offering an ``equal'' product, its offer shall be considered as offering 
the brand name product referenced in the solicitation.
    (c) If the offeror proposed to furnish an ``equal'' product, the 
brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in 
the space provided in the solicitation, or such product shall be 
otherwise clearly identified in the offer. The evaluation of offers and 
the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the 
responsibility of the Government and will be based on information 
furnished by the offeror or identified in its offer as well as other 
information reasonably available to the contracting office. CAUTION TO 
OFFERORS: The contracting office is not responsible for locating or 
securing any information which is not identified in the offer and 
reasonably available to the contracting office. Accordingly, to insure 
that sufficient information is available, the offeror must furnish as a 
part of its offer all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, 
drawings, or other information) necessary for the contracting office to: 
(1) determine whether the product offered meets the salient 
characteristic requirements of the solicitation; and (2) establish 
exactly what the offeror proposes to furnish and what the Government 
would be binding itself to acquire by making an award. The information 
furnished may include specific reference to information previously 
furnished or to information otherwise available to the contracting 
office.
    (d) If the offeror proposes to modify a product so as to make it 
conform to the requirements of the solicitation, it shall: (1) include 
in its offer a clear description of such proposed modifications; and (2) 
clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed 
modifications.
    (e) Modifications to make a product conform to a brand name product 
referenced in

[[Page 560]]

the solicitation and proposed after the time for receipt of offers, will 
not be considered.

flight operations. Such operations will take precedence over 
construction convenience. Any operations of the Contractor which would 
otherwise interfere with or endanger the operations of aircraft shall be

Officer. The Government will make every effort to reduce the disruption 
of the Contractor's operation.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified by local regulations, all areas in

flags during daylight hours and by red lights at other times. The red 
lights along the edge of the construction areas within the existing 
aprons shall be the electric type of not less than 100 watts intensity

shall not be greater than 25 feet. The Contractor shall provide adequate 
watch to maintain the lights in working condition at all times other 
than daylight hours. The hour of beginning and the hour of ending of 
daylight will be determined by the Contracting Officer.

moved outside the construction area shall be marked with airport safety 
flags during the day and when directed by the Contracting Officer, with 
red obstruction lights at nights. All equipment operating on the apron, 
taxiway, runway, and intermediate areas after darkness hours shall have 
clearance lights in conformance with instructions from the Contracting 
Officer. No construction equipment shall operate within 50 feet of 
aircraft undergoing fuel operations. Open flames are not allowed on the 
ramp except at times authorized by the Contracting Officer.
    (d) Trucks and other motorized equipment entering the airport or 
construction area shall do so only over routes determined by the 
Contracting Officer. Use of runways, aprons, taxiways, or parking areas 
as truck or equipment routes will not be permitted unless specifically 
authorized for such use. Flag personnel shall be furnished by the 
Contractor at points on apron and taxiway for safe guidance of its 
equipment over these areas to assure right of way to aircraft. Areas and 
routes used during the contract must be returned to their original 
condition by the Contractor. The maximum speed allowed at the airport

               Subpart 1301.1_Purpose, Authority, Issuance


<R05>
Sec. 1301.100  Scope of subpart.

    This subpart states the relationship of the Commerce Acquisition 
Regulation (CAR) to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This 
subpart also explains the purpose, authority and issuance of the CAR.


<R05>
Sec. 1301.101  Purpose.

    (a) Chapter 13 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations shall 
be known as the Commerce Acquisition Regulation (CAR).
    (b) The purpose of the CAR is to implement and supplement the FAR 
within the Department of Commerce. Since the CAR is intended to 
supplement and implement the FAR without paraphrasing or duplicating FAR 
language, the CAR should be read in relation to the FAR.

[49 FR 12956, Mar. 30, 1984, as amended at 51 FR 15329, Apr. 23, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1301.102  Authority.

    The CAR is prescribed by the Department Procurement Executive 
pursuant to a delegation initiating from the Secretary of Commerce in 
accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 
1949, as amended, and other applicable law and regulation.


<R05>
Sec. 1301.103  Applicability.

    The FAR and CAR apply to all acquisitions within the Department of 
Commerce.


<R05>
Sec. 1301.104  Issuance.


<R05>
Sec. 1301.104-1  Publication and code arrangement.

    (a) The CAR is published in (1) daily issues of the Federal 
Register, (2) cumulative form in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), 
and (3) a separate loose-leaf edition.
    (b) The CAR is issued as chapter 13 of title 48 of the CFR.


<R05>
Sec. 1301.104-2  Arrangement of regulations.

    (a) General. The CAR is divided into the same parts, subparts, 
sections, subsections and paragraphs as the FAR. When FAR coverage is 
adequate by itself, there will be no corresponding CAR coverage.
    (b) Numbering. Where the CAR implements the FAR, the CAR part, 
subpart, section or further subdivision will be numbered the same as the 
corresponding FAR part, subpart, section, or further subdivision except 
that the CAR implementation will be preceded by a 13 or 130 so that 
there are four numbers to the left of the first decimal. Where the CAR 
supplements the FAR, supplementing material will be assigned the number 
70 and above. The placement of the sequence of 70 numbers in relation to 
the decimal point will depend on what division of the FAR is 
supplemented.

[[Page 594]]

    (c) References and citations. (2) This regulation may be referred to 
as the Commerce Acquisition Regulation (CAR).
    (3) References to FAR materials will include FAR and the identifying 
number, for example, FAR 1.402. Reference to CAR materials will consist 
of the identifying number, for example 1301.402.


<R05>
Sec. 1301.104-3  Copies.

    (a) Copies of the CAR in Federal Register or CFR form may be 
purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing 
Office (GPO), Washington, DC 20402. Requests should reference the CAR as 
chapter 13 of title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
    (b) Loose-leaf copies of the CAR are distributed within the 
Department by the Procurement Executive.

Sec. 1301.603-70  Ratification of unauthorized contract awards.

    (a) The Department is not bound by any formal or informal type of 
agreement or contractual commitment which is made by persons who are not 
delegated contracting authority. When these unauthorized acts are 
discovered they shall be immediately reported to the Head of the 
Contracting Activity concerned. The Head of the Contracting Activity 
shall:
    (1) Immediately inform any person who is performing work as a result 
of an unauthorized commitment that the work is being performed at that 
person's risk;

[51 FR 15330, Apr. 23, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1309.106-70  Preaward surveys for ship construction, ship 
          alteration, and ship repair.

    (a) General. The contracting officer shall request a preaward survey 
of a prospective contractor for contracts involving ship construction, 
ship alteration, or ship repair, where the cost or price of the contract 
is anticipated to be in excess of $100,000, and the information on hand 
is not sufficient to make a determination regarding responsibility. The 
contracting officer may request a preaward survey of a prospective 
contractor for contracts involving ship construction, ship alteration, 
or ship repair, where the cost or price of the contract is anticipated 
to be $100,000 or less, if the circumstances justify the cost of the 
survey.
    (b) Extent of preaward survey. The contracting officer shall 
determine the manner and extent of the preaward survey based upon the 
specific requirements of the contract. At a minimum, the contracting 
officer shall request a preaward survey for contracts involving ship 
construction, ship alteration, and ship repair where the contracting 
officer cannot affirmatively determine that the prospective contractor's 
facility is adequate for the work to be performed. For the purpose of 
this section, the prospective contractor's facility includes the land, 
buildings, shop spaces, dock facilities, drydock or marine railways, and 
plant security and safety.
    (c) Examples of specific concern. The contracting officer shall 
coordinate efforts with technical and requirements personnel to identify 
areas of specific concern for the preaward survey. The following 
examples illustrate areas which may be of specific concern to the 
preaward survey team, depending on the nature of the work to be 
performed:
    (1) Acceptable facilities and equipment for special production 
techniques (e.g., unique welding procedures, special test fixtures, or 
production equipment);
    (2) Adequate size and lift capacity for the drydock or marine 
railway;
    (3) Well maintained drydock and lifting equipment and acceptable 
preventative maintenance of these items;
    (4) Acceptable dock master and crew who are experienced in operating 
the equipment and lifting a vessel of comparable size and weight;
    (5) Adequate drydock or pier utilities to support the vessel,

    (a) Promptly after receipt of an unsolicited proposal which conforms 
to this regulation, the head of the contracting office shall forward a 
copy of the proposal along with instructions for technical evaluation of 
unsolicited proposals to the appropriate program office for technical 
evaluation. If more than one Department activity has an interest in a 
proposal, copies of the proposal shall be circulated to each interested 
office.
    (b) Program offices receiving unsolicited proposals for evaluation 
shall conduct the evaluation in accordance with this subpart 1315.5, FAR 
Subpart 15.5, and any additional guidance provided by the Office of

<R05>
Sec. 1315.805-70  Audit as an aid in proposal analysis.

    (a) Preaward audits should not be routinely requested for actions 
below the dollar threshold specified in FAR 15.805-5. Before requesting 
audits below the dollar threshold, the contracting office should 
consider using price or cost analysis techniques, recent audit reports, 
price negotiation memoranda, and other relevant information regarding 
the offer to establish the reasonableness of price. However, audits 
should be considered for proposals below the specified dollar thresholds 
in the following circumstances:
    (1) The contracting officer has reason to doubt the adequacy of the 
contractor's accounting policies or cost systems;
    (2) The contractor has substantially changed its methods or levels 
of operation;
    (3) Previous unfavorable experience indicates that the contractor's 
estimating, accounting, or purchasing methods may be unreliable; or
    (4) The proposal concerns a new product for which cost experience is 
lacking.

                          Subpart 1315.9_Profit


<R05>
Sec. 1315.902  Policy.

    (a) Except as provided in (b) and (c) of this section, a structured 
approach for determining profit or fee prenegotiation objectives shall 
be used in the negotiation of all contracts, subcontracts, and contract 
modifications above $100,000 where adequate price competition does not 
exist. A structured approach for determining profit or fee 
prenegotiation objectives may be used at lower dollar thresholds.
    (b) Regardless of whether price competition exists, the structured 
approach for determining profit or fee prenegotiation objectives is not 
required for negotiation of contracts, subcontracts, and contract 
modifications for the following:
    (1) Architect--engineering contracts;
    (2) Management contracts for operation or maintenance of Government 
facilities;
    (3) Construction contracts;
    (4) Contracts primarily requiring delivery of material supplied by 
subcontractors;
    (5) Termination settlements;
    (6) Cost-plus-award-fee contracts; and
    (7) Unusual pricing situations where the structured approach has 
been determined to be unsuitable. This exception must be justified in 
writing and signed by the head of the contracting office.

[[Page 600]]

    (c) In many circumstances, an examination of cost and profits is not 
required. Where adequate price competition exists and in other 
situations where cost analysis is not required (e.g., established 
catalog or market prices of commercial items sold in substantial 
quantities to the general public or prices set by law or regulation), 
contracts may be awarded without regard to the amount of profit 
involved.
    (d) Additional internal instruction on the use of the structured 
approach can be found in Procurement Letters or policy manuals issued by 
the Office of Procurement and Federal Assistance.

<R05>
Sec. 1333.102  General.

    (a) Protests must be received within ten work days after the basis 
for protest is known or should have been known unless good cause is 
shown to extend the time limit. However, protests based upon alleged 
improprieties in any type of solicitation which are apparent prior to 
bid opening or the closing time for receipt of initial proposals shall 
be filed prior to bid opening or the closing time for receipt of initial 
proposals. Unless the time limit for receiving the protest is extended 
for good cause, a protest to the contracting activity which is received 
after the time limit will not be considered. When a timely protest is 
filed only with the contracting activity, the contracting officer shall 
take prompt action toward resolution after consulting with the AGC, and 
notify the protestor in writing of the action taken.
    (b) When a protest is filed only with the contracting activity 
before award, an award shall not be made until the matter is resolved, 
unless the head of the contracting office makes the determination 
prescribed in FAR 33.103(f).
    (c) When a protest is filed only with the contracting activity after 
award, the Contracting Officer need not notify the contractor, if the 
protest can be promptly resolved. If it appears likely that a protest 
will be filed with the General Accounting Office (GAO), or other 
administrative forum, the Contracting Officer should promptly notify the 
contractor in writing and consider suspending contract performance.

Sec. 1333.103  Protests to the agency.

    (a) When a protester decides to file a protest at the agency level 
with the Protest Decision Authority, the guidelines set forth in these 
established agency level protest procedures above the Contracting 
Officer apply. These procedures are in addition to the existing protest 
procedures contained in the FAR Part 33.102 and 1333.102 of this 
subpart.
    (1) For purposes of this subpart, a day is a calendar day. In 
computing a period of time for the purpose of these procedures, the day 
from which the period begins to run is not counted. When the last day of 
the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period extends 
to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. 
Similarly, when the Washington, DC offices of the Department of Commerce 
are closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the 
next day on which the Department is open.
    (2) Protesters using these procedures may protest to the Protest 
Decision Authority who will make the final decision for the Department. 
Protests shall be addressed to: (Name, title of the person and address 
to be inserted by the Contracting Officer in the solicitation). The 
outside of the envelope or beginning of the FAX transmission must be 
marked ``Agency-level Protest''. The protester shall also provide a copy 
of the protest within 1 day to the responsible Contracting Officer and a 
copy to: Contract Law Division, Office of the Assistant General Counsel 
for Finance and Litigation, Department of Commerce, Room H5882, 14th 
Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230, (FAX Number 
202-482-5858).
    (3) While a protest is pending at the agency level with the Protest 
Decision Authority, the protester agrees not to protest to the GAO or 
any other external fora. If the protester has already filed with the GAO 
or other external fora, the procedures described here may not be used.
    (i) Protests based upon alleged improprieties in a solicitation 
which are apparent prior to bid opening or time set for receipt of 
proposals shall be filed prior to bid opening or the time set for 
receipt of proposals. If the contract has been awarded, protests must be 
filed within 10 days after contract award or 5 days after the date the 
protester was given the opportunity to be debriefed, whichever date is 
later. In cases other than those covered in the preceding two sentences, 
protests shall be filed not later than 14 days after the basis of the 
protest is known or should have been known, whichever is earlier.
    (ii) To be filed on a given day, protests must be received by 4:30 
PM current local time. Any protests received after that time will be 
considered to be

[[Page 605]]

filed on the next day. Incomplete submissions will not be considered 
filed until all information is provided.
    (iii) To be complete, protests must contain the following 
information:
    (A) The protester's name, address, telephone number, and fax number.
    (B) The solicitation or contract number, name of contracting office 
and the Contracting Officer.
    (C) A detailed statement of all factual and legal grounds for 
protests, and an explanation of how the protester was prejudiced.
    (D) Copies of relevant documents supporting protester's statement.
    (E) A request for ruling by the agency.
    (F) Statement as to form of relief requested.
    (G) All information establishing that the protester is an interested 
party for the purpose of filing a protest.
    (H) All information establishing the timeliness of the protest.
    (iv) All protests must be signed by an authorized representative of 
the protestor.
    (b) Within 14 days after the protest is filed, the Contracting 
Officer will prepare an administrative report that responds to the 
issues raised by the protester and addresses any other issues, which, 
even if not raised by the protester, that may have been identified by 
agency officials as being relevant to the fairness of the procurement 
process. The Contracting Officer shall forward this administrative 
report to the Contract Law Division, Office of the Assistant General 
Counsel for Finance and Litigation.
    (1) For good cause shown, the Protest Decision Authority may grant 
an extension of time for filing the administrative report and for 
issuing the written decision. When an extension is granted, the Protest 
Decision Authority will notify the protester and all interested parties 
within 1 day of the decision to grant the extension.
    (2) Unless an extension is granted, the Protest Decision Authority 
will issue a decision within 35 days of the protest. The protest 
decision authority's final decision will be binding on the Department of 
Commerce and not subject to further appeals.
    (3) The Protest Decision Authority shall send a written ruling and a 
summary of the reasons supporting the ruling to the protester, by 
``Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested,'' and shall forward 
information copies to the applicable contracting office and the 
Procurement Executive, Office of Acquisition Management.
    (c) Effect of protest on award and performance.
    (1) When a protest is filed prior to award, a contract may not be 
awarded unless authorized by the Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) 
based on a written finding that:
    (i) The supplies or services are urgently required.
    (ii) Delivery or performance would be unduly delayed by failure to 
make the award promptly.
    (iii) A prompt award will be in the best interest of the Government.
    (2) When a protest is filed within 10 days after contract award, or 
5 days after a debriefing date was offered to the protester under a 
timely debriefing request in accordance with FAR 15.1004, whichever is 
later, the Contracting Officer shall immediately suspend performance 
pending the resolution of the protest within the agency, including any 
review by an independent higher official, unless continued performance 
is justified. The HCA may authorize continued contract performance, 
notwithstanding the protest, based on a written finding that:
    (i) Contract performance would be in the best interest of the United 
States; or
    (ii) Urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect 
the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a 
decision.
    (d) The Protest Decision Authority may grant one or more of the 
following remedies:
    (1) Terminate the contract.
    (2) Re-compete the requirement.
    (3) Issue a new solicitation.
    (4) Refrain from exercising options under the contract.
    (5) Award a contract consistent with statutes and regulations.
    (6) Amend the solicitation provisions which gave rise to the protest 
and continue with the procurement.

[[Page 606]]

    (7) Such other remedies as the decision-maker may determine are 
necessary to correct a defect.

other than excess costs, incurred by the Government as a result of the 
contractor's default. Administrative costs include but are not limited 
to:
    (1) Salaries and fringe benefits paid to Government employees who 
are assigned to a work activity (e.g., reprocurement activities) as a 
result of the default;
    (2) Preaward survey expenses incurred in qualifying reprocurement 
contractors; and
    (3) Costs incurred in printing and distributing the reprocurement 
solicitation.
    (b) Excess costs, as used in this part, means any costs, other than 
administrative costs, incurred by the Government in reprocuring similar 
supplies or services or performing similar services as a result of the 
contractor's default.

                 Subpart 1349.4_Termination for Default


<R05>
Sec. 1349.402-7  Other damages.

    (a) The contracting officer may recover administrative costs under 
the default clause when it is in the best interest of the Government. A 
contracting officer's decision to recover administrative costs must 
balance the expected cost to the Government of documenting and 
supporting the assessment with the expected recovery amount.

[[Page 610]]

    (b) Documents used to support an assessment of administrative costs 
must clearly demonstrate that the added costs incurred by the Government 
were a direct result of the default.
    (1) To support administrative labor costs, the contracting officer 
should keep a record of:
    (i) Name, position, and organization of each employee performing 
work activities as a consequence of the default;
    (ii) Dates of work and time spent by each employee on the 
repurchase;
    (iii) Specific tasks performed (e.g., solicitation preparation, 
clerical);
    (iv) Hourly rates of pay (straight time or overtime); and
    (v) Applicable fringe benefits.
    (2) Travel vouchers, invoices, printing requisitions, and other 
appropriate evidence of expenditures may be used to support other 
administrative costs (e.g., travel, per diem, printing and distribution 
of the repurchase contract).
    (c) If assessment of administrative costs is considered appropriate 
after review by the AGC, the contracting officer shall make a written 
demand on the contractor for administrative costs. The written demand 
shall describe the basis for the assessment and the cost computations. 
The same demand letter may be used to assess administrative costs and 
any excess costs. If the contractor fails to make payment after 
receiving a contracting officer's final decision, the contracting 
officer shall follow the procedures in subpart 1332.6 and FAR Subpart 
32.6 to collect the amount owed the Government.
    (d) The recovery of excess or administrative costs does not preclude 
the Government from exercising other rights or remedies which it may 
have by law or under the terminated contract.

<R05>
Sec. 1352.000  Scope of part.

    This part implements and supplements FAR Part 52 by prescribing 
specific modifications, alterations, and deviations to FAR solicitation 
provisions and contract clauses for Department-wide use.


<R05>
Sec. 1352.001  General policy.

    The Department's policy is to use the FAR and CAR prescribed 
solicitation provisions and contract clauses unless specific authority 
for deviations has been obtained. (See 1301.4 for authority to deviate.) 
The use of uniform solicitation provisions and contract clauses should: 
provide a less burdensome way for potential contractors to respond to 
the Government's request for information concerning the evaluation of 
bids and proposals; expedite solicitation and contract preparation; and 
facilitate contract negotiation, administration and review. Each 
solicitation which incorporates contract clauses or solicitation 
provisions which deviate from those prescribed by the FAR and the CAR 
must be submitted to the Office of Procurement and Federal Assistance 
for prior review. The Office of Procurement and Federal Assistance will 
coordinate requests for approval of these solicitations by the Office of 
Management and Budget, in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1980 and 5 CFR part 1320.

      Subpart 1352.1_Instructions for Using Provisions and Clauses


<R05>
Sec. 1352.100  Incorporation by reference.

    Contracting officers within the Department shall incorporate 
solicitation provisions and contract clauses by reference in 
solicitations and contracts to the maximum extent provided by applicable 
law and regulation. Incorporation by reference is the listing only by 
title, regulatory citation, and date of the provision or clause rather 
than the full text. The full text of the referenced solicitation 
provision or contract clause is contained in the Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR); chapter 1 of title 48 for FAR provisions and clauses; 
and chapter 13 of title 48 for CAR provisions and clauses.

<R05>
Sec. 1352.217-90  Inspection and manner of doing work.

    As prescribed in 1317.7001(a), insert the following clause:

    Inspection and Manner of Doing Work (CAR 1352.217-90) (JAN 1987)

    (a) All work and material shall be subject to the approval of the 
Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative. Work shall be 
performed in accordance with the plans and specifications of this 
contract as modified by any contract modification.
    (b) Unless otherwise specifically provided for in the contract, all 
operational practices of the Contractor and all workmanship and 
material, equipment and articles used in the performance of work shall 
be in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping Rules for Building and 
Classing Steel Vessels, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Engineering Regulations 
and Material Specifications (Subchapter F 46 CFR), U.S. Coast Guard 
Electrical Engineering Regulations (Subchapter J 46 CFR) (APR 1982), and 
U.S.P.H.S., Handbook on Sanitation in Vessel Construction, in effect at 
the time of the Contractor's submission of bid (or acceptance of the 
contract, if negotiated), and the best commercial maritime practices, 
except where military specifications are specified, in which case such 
standards of material and workmanship shall be followed.
    (c) All material and workmanship shall be subject to inspection and 
test at all times during the Contractor's performance of the work to 
determine their quality and suitability for the purpose intended and 
compliance with the contract. In case any material or workmanship 
furnished by the Contractor is found to be defective prior to redelivery 
of the vessel, or not in accordanoe with the requirements of the 
contract, the Government shall have the right prior to redelivery of the 
vessel to reject such material or workmanship, and to require its 
correction or replacement by the Contractor at the Contractor's cost and 
expense. This Government right is in addition to its rights under any 
Guarantee clause in this contract. If the Contractor fails to proceed 
promptly with the replacement or correction of such material or 
workmanship, as required by the Contracting Officer, the Government may, 
by contract or otherwise, replace or correct such material or 
workmanship and charge to the Contractor the excess cost to the 
Government. The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection 
system acceptable to the Government covering the work specified in the 
contract. Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept 
complete and available to the Government during the performance of the 
contract and for a period of 2 years after delivery of the vessel to the 
Government.
    (d) No welding, including tack welding and brazing, shall be 
permitted in connection with repairs, completions, alterations, or 
addition to hulls, machinery or components of vessels unless the welder 
is at the time, qualified to the standards established by the United 
States Coast Guard, the American Bureau of Shipping, or the Department 
of the Navy. The welder's qualifications shall be appropriate for the 
particular service application, filler material type, position of 
welding, and welding process involved in the work being undertaken. A 
welder may be required to requalify if the Contracting Officer believes 
there is a reasonable doubt concerning the welder's ability. Welder's 
qualifications for this purpose shall be outlined in ``Marine 
Engineering Regulations'' of the United States Coast Guard. When a 
welding process other than manual shielded arc is proposed or required, 
the contractor or fabricator shall submit procedure qualification tests 
for approval prior to production welding. Procedure qualification tests 
shall be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the ``Marine 
Engineering Regulations'' of the United States Coast Guard.
    (e) The Contractor shall exercise reasonable care to protect the 
vessel from fire, and the Contractor shall maintain a reasonable system 
of inspection over the activities of welders, burners, riveters, 
painters, plumbers and similar workers, particularly where such 
activities are undertaken in the vicinity of the vessel's magazine, fuel 
oil tanks, or storerooms containing flammable material. A reasonable 
number of hose lines shall be maintained by the Contractor ready for 
immediate use on the vessel at all times while the vessel is berthed 
alongside the Contractor's pier or in drydock or on a marine railway. 
All tanks or bilge areas under alteration or repair shall be cleaned, 
washed, and steamed out or otherwise made safe by the Contractor if and 
to the extent necessary as required by good marine practice or by 
current OSHA Regulations. The Contracting Officer's Technical 
Representative (COTR) shall be furnished with a ``gas free'' or ``safe 
for hot work'' or ``safe for men'' certificate before any hot work or 
entry is done. Unless otherwise provided in this contract, the 
Contractor shall at all times maintain a reasonable fire watch about the 
vessel, including a fire watch on the vessel while work is being 
performed thereon.
    (f) The Contractor shall place proper safeguards and/or effect such 
safety precautions

[[Page 613]]

as necessary, including suitable and sufficient lighting, for the 
prevention of accidents or injury to persons or property during the 
prosecution of work under this contract and/or from time of receipt of 
the vessel until acceptance by the Government of the work performed.
    (g) Except as otherwise provided in this contract, when the vessel 
is in the custody of the contractor or in drydock or on a marine railway 
and the temperature becomes as low as 35 degrees Fahrenheit, the 
Contractor shall keep all pipelines, fixtures, traps, tanks, and other 
receptacles on the vessel drained to avoid damage from freezing, or if 
this is not practicable, the vessel shall be kept heated to prevent such 
damage. The vessel's stern tube and propeller hubs shall be protected 
from frost damage by applied heat through the use of a salamander or 
other proper means, as approved by the COTR.
    (h) Whenever practicable, the work shall be performed in a manner 
which does not interfere with the berthing and messing of personnel 
attached to the vessel. The Contractor shall ensure that assigned 
personnel have access to the vessel at all times. It is understood that 
such personnel will not interfere with the work or the Contractor's 
workers.
    (i) The Government does not guarantee the correctness of the 
dimensions, sizes, and shapes given in any sketches, drawings, plans or 
specifications prepared or furnished by the Government. The Contractor 
shall be responsible for the correctness of the shape, sizes and 
dimensions of parts to be furnished hereunder, other than those 
furnished by the Government.
    (j) The Contractor shall at all times keep the site of the work on 
the vessel free from accumulation of waste material or rubbish caused by 
Contractor employees or the work, and at the completion of the work 
shall remove all rubbish from and about the site of the work and shall 
leave the work and its immediate vicinity ``broom clean'' unless more 
exactly specified in this contract.
    (k) While in drydock or on a marine railway, the Contractor shall be 
responsible for the closing before the end of working hours, of all 
valves and openings upon which work is being done by its workers when 
such closing is practicable. The Contractor shall keep the COTR 
cognizant of the closure status of all valves and openings upon which 
the Contractor's workers have been working.
    (l) Without additional expense to the Government, the Contractor 
shall employ specialty subcontractors where required by the 
specifications or when necessary for satisfactory performance of the 
work.
    (m) When requested by the COTR, the Contractor shall notify the COTR 
in advance:
    (i) Prior to starting inspections or tests; and

of work due to embarking or debarking passengers and loading or 
discharging cargo, and the Contractor is not given sufficient advance

Sec. 1352.217-94  Minimization of delay due to Government furnished 
          property.

    As prescribed in 1317.7001(a), insert the following clause:

    Minimization of Delay Due to Government Furnished Property (CAR 
                         1352.217-94) (JAN 1987)

    (a) In order to assure timely delivery of the vessel under this 
contract, it is imperative that delay in delivery of such vessel 
resulting from late, damaged, or unsuitable Government furnished 
property be held to an absolute minimum. In order to achieve 
minimization of delay it is agreed that:
    (1) Subject to adjustment as provided in paragraph (b) of this 
clause, the Government shall deliver each item of Government furnished 
property to the Contractor on or before the date specified in the 
contract or, if later, in sufficient time for the contractor to deliver 
the vessel in accordance with the delivery schedule specified elsewhere.
    (2) The Government may forego furnishing any item of Government 
property to the Contractor. In that event, the Contractor shall prepare 
the vessel in terms of piping, wiring, structure, foundation, 
ventilation, and any other preinstallation requirements of the item, so 
that the work on the vessel may continue without delay and disruption 
resulting from the absence of the item. If the Government does not 
furnish an item designated as Government furnished property, the parties 
may be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the contract price, in 
accordance with the Changes clause for eliminating the requirement to 
install the Government property item. But, notwithstanding any other 
clause of this contract, an adjustment shall not be made in the delivery 
schedule of any vessel if the Government chooses not to furnish the item 
on or before the delivery date of the item. If the Government 
subsequently desires the Contractor to install the item prior to 
delivery of the vessel, a contract modification shall be executed which 
takes into account any increase in cost or performance time resulting 
from the installation.
    (b) If the delivery date for the vessel is extended for any reason, 
the latest date for which the Government must deliver items of 
Government property shall be deemed to be extended by an equal number of 
days unless

[[Page 615]]

(i) the Contracting Officer agrees in writing that earlier delivery of 
the items is required, in which case some or all of the Government 
property shall be extended as agreed rather than on a day-for-day basis, 
or (ii) a Government property item was the exclusive cause for the 
extension of the delivery date of the vessel in which case the latest 
date by which the Government must deliver the item shall not be deemed 
to be extended unless the parties agree otherwise.
    (c) The delivery or performance dates for the supplies or services 
to be furnished by the Contractor under this contract are based upon the 
expectation that Government furnished property suitable for use (except 
for such property furnished ``as is'') will be delivered to the 
Contractor at the time stated in the specification or, if not so stated, 
in sufficient time to enable the Contractor to meet such delivery or 
performance dates. If the Government furnished property is not delivered 
to the Contractor by such time and the Contractor makes a timely written 
request, the Contracting Officer shall determine if an equitable 
adjustment is appropriate. If determined appropriate, the Contracting 
Officer shall equitably adjust the delivery or performance date, the 
specifications, the price, or any other contractual provision affected 
by any such delay, in accordance with the Changes clause.
    (d) The Government Property and Minimization of Delay Due to 
Government Furnished Property clauses contain exclusive remedies. The 
Government shall not be liable to suit for breach of contract by reason 
of any delay in delivery of Government furnished property or delivery of 
such property in a condition not suitable for its intended use.

Additional Provisions Relating to Government Property (CAR 1352.217-95) 
                               (JAN 1987)

    (a) Notwithstanding any requirements to the contrary for the 
furnishing of material by the Government which may appear in plans, 
drawings, or other data, the Government shall furnish only the material 
specifically listed in the specifications as Government furnished 
property. Any material required for the performance of the contract 
which does not appear in the specifications as Government furnished 
shall be furnished by the Contractor.
    (b) The Contracting Officer may increase the amount of material to 
be furnished by the Government and the contract shall be equitably 
adjusted in accordance with the Government Property clause.
    (c) Unless otherwise specifically directed by the Contracting 
Officer, nonreusable crates and other nonreusable packaging in which 
Government material is delivered to the Contractor shall become the 
property of the Contractor upon removal of the packaged or crated 
material.
    (d) Any packaging in preparation for delivery or for other disposal 
of Government property by the Contractor at the direction or 
authorization of the Contracting Officer pursuant to paragraph (i) of 
the Government Property clause shall be provided for by change order and 
an appropriate adjustment shall be made in the contract price in 
accordance with the Changes clause.
    (e) The vessel, its equipment, movable stores, cargo and other 
ship's material are not designated Government furnished property under 
the Government Property clause.

Sec. 1352.217-96  Liability and insurance.

    As prescribed in 1317.7001(a), insert the following clause:

          Liability and Insurance (CAR 1352.217-96) (JAN 1987)

    (a) The Contractor shall exercise reasonable care and use its best 
efforts to prevent accidents, injury or damage to all employees, persons 
and property, in and about the work, and to the vessel or part thereof 
upon which work is done.
    (b) The Contractor shall be responsible for and make good at its own 
cost and expense any and all loss of or damage of whatsoever nature to 
the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo, 
and Government owned material and equipment for the repair, completion, 
alteration of or addition to the vessel in the possession of the 
Contractor, whether at the plant or elsewhere, arising or growing out of 
the performance of the work, except where the Contractor can 
affirmatively show that such loss or damage was due to causes beyond the 
Contractor's control, was proximately caused by the fault or negligence 
of agents or employees of the Government, or which loss or damage the 
Contractor by exercise of reasonable care was unable to prevent. 
However, the Contractor shall not be responsible for any such loss or 
damage discovered after redelivery of the vessel unless (i) the loss or 
damage is discovered within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel and 
(ii) loss or damage is affirmatively shown to be the result of the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor. To induce the Contractor to perform the 
work for the compensation provided, it is specifically agreed that the 
Contractor's aggregate liability on account of loss of or damage to

[[Page 616]]

the vessel (or part thereof), its equipment, movable stores and cargo 
and Government owned materials and equipment shall in no event exceed 
the sum of $300,000. As to the Contractor, the Government assumes the 
risk of loss or damage to the Government-owned vessel (or part thereof), 
its equipment, movable stores and cargo and said Government-owned 
materials and equipment in excess of $300,000. This assumption of risk 
includes but is not limited to loss or damage from negligence of 
whatsoever degree of the Contractor's servants, employees, agents or 
subcontractors but specifically excludes loss or damage from willful 
misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the Contractor's 
directors, officers and any of its managers, superintendents or other 
equivalent representatives who have supervision or direction of (i) all 
or substantially all of the Contractor's business, or (ii) all or 
substantially all of the Contractor's operation at any one plant. 
However, as to such risk assumed and borne by the Government, the 
Government shall be subrogated to any claim, demand or cause of action 
against third persons which exists in favor of the Contractor, and the 
contractor shall, if required, execute a formal assignment or transfer 
of claims, demands or causes of action. Nothing contained in this 
paragraph shall create or give rise to any right, privilege or power in 
any person except the Contractor, nor shall any person (except the 
Contractor) be or become entitled thereby to proceed directly against 
the Government, or join the Government as a co-defendent in any action 
against the Contractor brought to determine the Contractor's liability, 
or for any other purpose.
    (c) The Contractor indemnifies and holds harmless the Government, 
its agencies and instrumentalities, and the vessel against all suits, 
actions, claims, costs or demands (including without limitation, suits, 
actions, claims, costs or demands resulting from death, personal injury 
and property damage) to which the Government, its agencies and 
instrumentalities, or the vessel may be subject or put by reason of 
damage or injury (including death) to the property or person of any one 
other than the Government, its agencies, instrumentalities and 
personnel, or the vessel arising or resulting in whole or in part from 
the fault, negligence, wrongful act or wrongful omission of the 
Contractor, or any subcontractor, its or their servants, agents or 
employees; provided that the Contractor's obligation to indemnify under 
this paragraph (c) shall not exceed the sum of $300,000 on account of 
any one accident or occurrence in respect of any one vessel. Such 
indemnity shall include, without limitation, suits, actions, claims, 
costs or demands of any kind whatsoever, resulting from death, personal 
injury or property damage occurring during the period of performance of 
work on the vessel or within 90 days after redelivery of the vessel. 
With respect to any such suits, actions, claims, costs or demands 
resulting from death, personal injury or property damage occurring after 
the expiration of such period, the rights and liabilities of the 
Government and the Contractor shall be as determined by other provisions 
of this contract and by law; provided that such indemnity shall apply to 
death occurring after such period which results from any personal injury 
received during the period covered by the Contractor's indemnity as 
provided herein.
    (d) The Contractor shall, at its own expense, procure, and 
thereafter maintain such casualty, accident and liability insurance, in 
such forms and amounts as may be approved by the Contracting Officer, 
insuring the performance of its obligations under paragraph (c) of this 
clause. In addition, the Contractor shall at its own expense procure and 
thereafter maintain such ship repairer's legal liability insurance as 
may be necessary to insure the Contractor against its liability as ship 
repairer in the amount of $300,000, or the value of the vessel as 
determined by the Contracting Officer, whichever is the lesser, with 
respect to each vessel on which work is performed. The Contractor shall 
cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and 
all liability insurance policies. However, at the discretion of the 
Contracting Officer, such insurance need not be procured whenever the 
job order requires work on parts of a vessel only and the work is to be 
performed at a plant other than the site of the vessel. Further, the 
Contractor shall procure and maintain in force Workmen's Compensation 
Insurance (or its equivalent) covering its employees engaged in the work 
and shall insure the procurement and maintenance of such insurance by 
all subcontractors engaged in the work. The Contractor shall provide 
evidence of insurance as required by the Government.
    (e) The Contractor shall receive no allowance in the contract price 
for inclusion of any premium expense or charge for any reserve made on 
account of self-insurance for coverage against any risk assumed by the 
Government under this clause.
    (f) As soon as practicable after the occurrence of any loss or 
damage the risk of which the Government has assumed, written notice of 
the damage shall be given by the Contractor to the Contracting Officer. 
The notice shall contain full particulars of the loss or damage. If 
claim is made or suit is brought thereafter against the Contractor as 
the result or because of such event, the Contractor shall immediately 
deliver to the Government every demand, notice, summons or other process 
received by it or its representatives. The Contractor shall cooperate

[[Page 617]]

with the Government and, upon the Government's request, shall assist in 
effecting settlements, securing and giving evidence; obtaining the 
attendance of witnesses and in the conduct of suits. The Government 
shall pay to the Contractor the expense, other than the cost of 
maintaining the Contractor's usual organization, incurred in this 
assistance. Except at its own cost, the Contractor shall not voluntarily 
make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense not 
imperative for the protection of the vessel or vessels at the time of 
the event.

furnished materials and equipment or the restoration of any damaged 
work. It is expressly understood and agreed that the Contractor shall

equipment until such time as all work is completed and accepted by the 
Government and the vessel is redelivered to the Government. Upon 
completion of the contract, or with the approval of the Contracting 
Officer at any time during the performance of the contract, all such 
Contractor furnished materials and equipment not incorporated in any 
vessel or part thereof, or not placed upon any vessel or part thereof, 
in accordance with the requirements of the contract, shall become the 
property of the Contractor, except those materials and equipment the 
cost of which has been reimbursed by the Government to the Contractor.

Government, which at any time exists or arises in connection with work 
done or materials furnished under any contract hereunder with respect to

states how the work has been, or will be, disrupted;
    (ii) The calendar time period when disruption occurred, or will 
occur;
    (iii) The area(s) aboard ship where disruption occurred, or will 
occur;
    (iv) The trade(s) disrupted, with a breakdown of man-hours for each 
trade;
    (v) The scheduling of trades before, during, and after the period of 
disruption;
    (vi) A description of measures taken to lessen the disruptive effect 
of the change.
    (6) The delay in delivery attributable solely to the change;
    (7) A description of other work attributed to the change;
    (8) A narrative statement of the direct causal relationship between 
any alleged Government act or omission and the claimed result, cross-
referenced to the detailed information required above.
    (9) A statement setting forth a comparative enumeration of the 
amounts ``budgeted'' for the cost elements, including the materials 
cost, labor hours, and indirect costs pertinent to the change estimated 
by the Contractor in preparing his initial and ultimate proposal(s) for 
this contract, and the amounts claimed to have been incurred, or 
projected to be incurred, corresponding to each such ``budgeted cost'' 
element.
    (d) In addition to the information required by paragraph (b), each 
proposal submitted in support of a claim for equitable adjustment in the 
amount of $100,000 or more under any provision of this contract shall 
contain a duly executed Standard Form 1411 (Contract Pricing Proposal)

equitable adjustment. In any event, the information furnished hereunder 
shall be in sufficient detail to permit the Contracting Officer to 
correlate the claimed increased costs or delay in delivery set forth in

on the ship affected by the proposed change. The proposed scope of work 
and estimate of the cost shall be in such form and supported by such 
reasonably detailed information as the Contracting Officer may require.
    (2) The Contractor's estimate shall be a firm offer for 30 days from 
receipt thereof by the cognizant Contracting Officer, unless extended by 
mutual consent. Within the time limit, the Contractor agrees to either 
(i) enter into a supplemental agreement covering the estimate as 
submitted or (ii) begin good faith negotiations at the request of the 
Contracting Officer, leading to the execution of a bilateral 
supplemental agreement, if the estimate as submitted is not satisfactory 
to the Contracting Officer. In either case, the supplemental agreement 
shall include an equitable adjustment for the preparatory work set forth 
above.
    (b) Pending execution of a bilateral agreement or the direction of 
the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes clause, the Contractor 
shall proceed diligently with contract performance without regard to the 
effect of any such proposed change.
    (c) Concurrently with the submission of any Change Proposal under 
this contract in which the proposed aggregate cost is $100,000 or 
greater, the Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a 
completed Standard Form 1411. At the time of agreement upon the price of 
the Change Proposal, the Contractor shall submit a signed Certificate of 
Current Cost or Pricing Data.

Government change that involves work in addition to that required under 
the basic contract.
    (b) No amount for lay day time shall be paid until all accepted 
items of the basic contract for which a price was established by the 
Contractor and for which docking of the vessel was required have been 
satisfactorily completed.
    (c) Days of hauling out and floating, whatever the hour, shall not 
be paid as lay day time, and days when no work is performed by the 
Contractor shall not be paid as lay day time.

Sec. 1352.217-107  Changes--ship repair.

    As prescribed in 1317.7001(a), insert the following clause:

           Changes--Ship Repair (CAR 1352.217-107) (JAN 1987)

    (a) The Contracting Officer may at any time, by written order, and 
without notice to the sureties, if any, make changes within the general 
scope of this contract, in any one or more of the following:
    (1) Drawings, designs, or specifications, when the supplies to be 
furnished are to be specially manufactured for the Government in 
accordance with the drawings, designs, or specifications;
    (2) Method of shipment or packing;
    (3) Place of performance of the work;
    (4) Time of commencement or completion of the work; and
    (5) Other requirements within the general scope of the contract.
    (b) If any such change causes an increase or decrease in the cost 
of, or the time requried for, performance of any part of the work under 
this contract, whether changed or not changed by the order, the 
Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the contract 
price, the delivery schedule, or both, and shall modify the contract.
    (c) The Contractor must submit any proposal for adjustment 
(hereafter referred to as proposal) under this clause within 10 days 
from the date of receipt of the written order. However, if the 
Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting 
Officer may receive and act upon a proposal submitted before final 
payment of the contract.
    (d) If the Contractor's proposal includes the cost of property made 
obsolete or excess by the change, the Contracting Officer shall have the 
right to prescribe the manner of the disposition of the property.
    (e) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the 
Disputes clause. However, nothing in this clause shall excuse the 
Contractor from proceeding with the contract as changed.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
Sec. 1352.217-108  Default--ship repair.

    As prescribed in 1317.7001(a), insert the following clause:

[[Page 621]]

           Default--Ship Repair (CAR 1352.217-108) (JAN 1987)

    (a) The Government may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
clause, by written notice of default to the Contractor, terminate this 
contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to--
    (1) Deliver the supplies or to perform the services within the time 
specified in this contract or any extension;
    (2) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract; 
or
    (3) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract.
    (b) If the Government terminates this contract in whole or in part, 
it may arrange for completion of the work in the manner the Contracting 
Officer considers appropriate. The Contracting Officer may designate any 
plant or plants for completion of the work, including the Contractor's 
plant or plants. If the work is to be completed at the Contractor's 
plant, the Government may use all tools, machinery, facilities and 
equipment of the Contractor which the Contracting Officer determines to 
be necessary. The Contractor will be liable to the Government for any 
excess costs, other than those costs attributable to changes in the 
plans or specifications made after the termination date. However, the 
Contractor shall continue the work not terminated.
    (c) Except for defaults of subcontractors at any tier, the 
Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to 
perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without 
the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes 
include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the 
Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, 
(4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) 
freight embargoes, and (9) unusually severe weather. In each instance 
the failure to perform must be beyond the control and without the fault 
or negligence of the Contractor.
    (d) If the failure to perform is caused by the default of a 
subcontractor at any tier, and if the cause of the default is beyond the 
control of both the Contractor and subcontractor, and without the fault 
or negligence of either, the Contractor shall not be liable for any 
excess costs for failure to perform, unless the subcontracted supplies 
or services were obtainable from other sources in sufficient time for 
the Contractor to meet the required delivery schedule.
    (e) If this contract is terminated for default, the Government may 
require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the Government, 
as directed by the Contracting Officer, any (1) completed supplies, and 
(2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tools, dies, 
jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights 
(collectively referred to as ``manufacturing materials'' in this clause) 
that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the 
terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting 
Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its 
possession in which the Government has an interest.
    (f) The Government shall pay contract price for completed supplies 
delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall 
agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and 
accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. 
Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes clause. The 
Government may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting 
Officer determines to be necessary to protect the Government against 
loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.
    (g) If, after termination, it is determined that the Contractor was 
not in default, or that the default was excusable, the rights and 
obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had 
been issued for the convenience of the Government.
    (h) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in 
addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this 
contract.

    As prescribed in 1317.7001(b), insert the following clause:

          Insurance Requirements (CAR 1352.217-109) (JAN 1987)

    (a) The Contractor shall procure and thereafter maintain the 
following insurance:
    (1) Ship repairer's legal liability insurance to insure the risks 
described in paragraph (b) of the Liability and Insurance clause. This 
insurance shall be for $300,000.
    (2) Comprehensive general liability insurance and automobile 
insurance to insure the risks described in paragraph (c) of the 
Liability and Insurance clause. This insurance shall be for $300,000 on 
account of any one accident or occurrence with respect to each vessel, 
boat, and/or barge upon which work is performed. The Contractor shall 
cause the Government to be named as an additional insured under any and 
all liability insurance policies.
    (3) Full coverage in accordance with the State Workmen's 
Compensation law; and
    (4) Full coverage in accordance with the United States 
Longshoremen's and Harbor Worker's Act.
    (b) As evidence that it has obtained the insurance specified in (a) 
above, the Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer with a 
certificate or certificates executed by

[[Page 622]]

an agent of the insurer authorized to execute such certificates. Such 
certificates shall be furnished prior to commencement of the work. Each 
certificate shall state that (name of insurer) has insured (name of 
Contractor) awarded contract number _____ for repair/alteration of (name 
of vessel) in accordance with the Liability and Insurance clause and the 
Insurance Requirements clause contained herein. Each certificate shall 
set forth that each policy of insurance represented thereby will expire 
on (date) and that each such policy contains the following clause:
    ``It is agreed that in the event of cancellation, or any material 
change in the policy adversely affecting the interest of the Government 
in this insurance 30 days prior written notice will be given to the 
Contracting Officer.''

<R05>
Sec. 1352.217-110  Guarantees.

    As prescribed in 1317.7001(c), insert the following clause:

           Guarantees (CAR 1352.217-110) (JAN<ls-thn-eq> 1987)

    In case any work done or materials furnished by the Contractor under 
this contract on or for any vessel or the equipment thereof shall, 
within 90 days from the date of redelivery of the vessel by the 
Contractor, prove defective or deficient, such defects or deficiencies 
shall, as required by the Government in writing, be corrected and 
repaired by the Contractor or at Contractor expense to the satisfaction 
of the Contracting Officer. However, the Government shall be entitled to 
rely upon any guarantee secured by the Contractor or any subcontractor 
covering work done on materials furnished which exceeds the 90-day 
period until the expiration. Also, with respect to any individual work 
item identified and listed as incomplete at the redelivery of the 
vessel, the guarantee period shall run from the date of completion of 
such item. If and when practicable, the Government shall afford the 
Contractor an opportunity to effect such corrections and repairs itself. 
But, when it is impracticable or undesirable to return it to the 
Contractor, or the Contractor fails to proceed promptly with any such 
repairs as directed by the Contracting Officer, the corrections and 
repairs shall be made at Contractor expense at other Government 
designated locations. Where corrections and repairs are to be made by 
other than the Contractor, due to non-return of the vessel to the 
Contractor, the Contractor's liability may be discharged by an equitable 
deduction in the price of the contract. The Contractor's liability shall 
only extend for an additional 90-day guarantee period on those defects 
or deficiencies which it corrected and in no event to those for which 
payment was made. However, this clause does not limit the responsibility 
or relieve the liability of the Contractor under the Liability and 
Insurance clause. At the Contracting Officer's option, defects and 
deficiencies may be left in their uncorrected condition. In that event, 
the Contractor and the Contracting Officer shall agree on an equitable 
deduction from the contract price. If the Contractor and the Contracting 
Officer fail to agree upon an equitable deduction from the contract 
price, the dispute shall be determined in accordance with the Disputes 
clause.

                             (End of clause)


<R05>
Sec. 1352.217-111  Temporary services.

    As prescribed in 1317.7001(d), insert the following clause:

            Temporary Services (CAR 1352.217-111) (JAN 1987)

    (a) Temporary services are services incidental to the performance of 
work which are required in the schedule or specifications to be provided 
by the contractor. Temporary services may include the furnishing of 
water, electricity, telephone service, toilet facilities, garbage 
removal, office space, parking places, or similar facilities as 
specified in the schedule or specifications.
    (b) If performance time is extended due to Government caused delay 
or causes beyond the control of both the contractor and subcontractor, 
and without the fault or negligence of either, the contractor shall have 
the right to request an equitable adjustment for providing temporary 
services in excess of the number of estimated days contained in the 
schedule. Any such equitable adjustment shall not exceed the amount 
obtained by multiplying the number of excess days by the contractor's 
unit price contained in the schedule for this item.

                             (End of clause)

Sec. 1352.217-112  Self-insurance information.

    As prescribed in 1317.7001(e), insert the following provision:

        Self-Insurance Information (CAR 1352.217-112) (JAN 1987)

    An offeror who proposes to self-insure for any or all of the risks 
set forth in the Liability and Insurance clause and the Insurance 
Requirements clause shall submit satisfactory evidence to permit the 
Contracting Officer to determine that the offeror's assets are 
sufficient for the risks set forth in such clauses. The offeror shall 
submit with its offer 2 certified copies of documents listing

[[Page 623]]

its assets and liabilities and other information deemed necessary by the 
offeror or required by the Contracting Officer. For approval of self-
insurance under the State Workmen's Compensation Law and the United 
States Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act, evidence of 
qualifications as a self-insurer under the applicable compensation 
statute must be furnished to the Contracting Officer.

                           (End of provision)

    Protests, as defined in 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition 
Regulation, shall be served on the Contracting Officer and the Contract

<R05>
Sec. 1403.570-1  Policy.

    Award of a contract does not signify endorsement of the supplies or 
services purchased, nor does it signify agreement with any views 
espoused by officials of the awards. It is vital to the integrity of the 
procurement system to avoid even the appearance of an improper 
preference toward a particular vendor. Therefore, contractors shall not 
be permitted to publicize, or otherwise circulate, promotional materials 
which state or imply Governmental endorsement of a product, service or 
position which the contractor represents.


<R05>
Sec. 1403.570-3  Contract clause.

    CO's shall include the clause at 48 CFR 1452.203-70, Restriction on 
Endorsements, in all solicitations, contracts and agreements which are 
not executed in accordance with SAT procedures.

<R05>
Sec. 1426.7003  Applicability and contract clause.

    (a) The Contracting Officer (CO) shall insert the clause at 
1452.226-70, Indian Preference--Department of the Interior, in 
solicitations issued and contracts awarded by
    (1) The Bureau of Indian Affairs,
    (2) A contracting activity other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
when the contract is entered into pursuant to an act specifically 
authorizing contracts with Indian organizations and
    (3) A contracting activity other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
where the work to be performed is specifically for the benefit of 
Indians and is in addition to any incidental benefits which might 
otherwise accrue to the general public.
    (b) The CO shall insert the clause at 1452.226-71, Indian Preference 
Program--Department of the Interior, in all solicitations issued and 
contracts awarded by a contracting activity which may exceed $50,000, 
which contain the clause required by paragraph (a) of this section and 
where it is determined by the CO, prior to solicitation, that the work 
under the contract will be performed in whole or in part on or near an 
Indian reservation(s). The Indian Preference Program clause may also be 
included in solicitations issued and contracts awarded by a contracting 
activity which may not exceed $50,000, but which contain the clause 
required by paragraph (a) of this section and which, in the opinion of 
the CO, offer substantial opportunities for Indian employment, training 
or subcontracting.


<R05>
Sec. 1426.7004  Compliance enforcement.

    (a) The CO is responsible for conducting periodic reviews of the 
contractor to ensure compliance with the requirements of the clauses 
prescribed in 1426.7003. These reviews may be conducted with the 
assistance of the Indian Tribe(s) concerned.
    (b) Complaints of noncompliance with the requirements of the clauses 
prescribed under 1426.7003 which are received in writing by the 
contracting activity shall be promptly investigated by the CO and a 
written disposition of the complaint shall be prepared.


<R05>
Sec. 1426.7005  Tribal preference requirements.

    (a) Where the work under a contract is to be performed on an Indian 
reservation, the CO may supplement the clause at 1452.226-71, Indian 
Preference Program--Department of the Interior, by adding specific 
Indian preference requirements of the Tribe on whose reservation the 
work is to be performed. The supplemental requirements shall be jointly 
developed for the contract by the CO and the Tribe. Supplemental 
preference requirements must represent a further implementation of the 
requirements of section 7(b) of Public Law 93-638 and must be approved 
by the SOL for legal sufficiency before being added to a solicitation 
and resultant contract. Any supplemental preference requirements to be 
added to the clause at 1452.226-71 shall be included in the solicitation 
and clearly identified in order to ensure uniform understanding of the 
additional requirements by all prospective bidders or offerors.
    (b) Nothing in this subpart shall be interpreted to preclude Tribes 
from independently developing and enforcing their own tribal preference 
requirements. Such independently developed tribal preference 
requirements shall not, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this 
section, become a requirement in contracts covered under this subpart 
1426.70 and must not hinder the Government's right to award contracts 
and to administer their provisions.

[[Page 635]]

 Use and Disclosure of Proposal Information--Department of the Interior 
                               (APR 1984)

    (a) Definitions. For the purposes of this provision and the Freedom 
of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the following terms shall have the 
meaning set forth below:
    (1) Trade Secret means an unpatented, secret, commercially valuable 
plan, appliance, formula, or process, which is used for making, 
preparing, compounding, treating or processing articles or materials, 
which are trade commodities.
    (2) Confidential commercial or financial information means any 
business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the 
mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 
U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable 
to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), 
which covers ``commercial and financial information obtained from a 
person and privileged or confidential,'' and exemption (9), which covers 
``geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning 
wells.''
    (b) If the offeror, or its subcontactor(s), believes that the 
proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial 
information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 
(5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be 
marked with the following legend:
    ``The information specifically identified on pages __ of this 
proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and 
financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from 
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests 
that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be 
required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be 
used in whole or part by the Government for any purpose other than to 
evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the 
offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the 
proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to 
the extent provided in the contract.''
    (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret 
information and confidential commerical and financial information on the 
pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page 
with the following legend:
    ``This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and 
financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from 
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to 
the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.''
    (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade 
secret information or confidential commercial and financial information 
shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the 
proposal, except that: (i) If a contract is awarded to the offeror as a 
result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the 
Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in 
the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another 
source without restriction it may be used without restriction.
    (e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access 
to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or 
confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration 
will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes 
trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The 
offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an 
opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of 
its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is 
determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret 
information or confidential commercial or financial information is not 
exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror 
will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the 
information.
    (f) The Government assumes no liability for the disclosure or use of 
information contained in a proposal if not marked in accordance with 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision. If a request under the Freedom 
of Information Act is made for information in a proposal not marked in 
accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this provision, the offeror 
concerned shall be promptly notified of the request and given an 
opportunity to provide its position to the Government. However, failure 
of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade 
secret information or confidential commercial or financial information 
will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is 
not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent 
a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating 
circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, 
but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to 
clerical error.

<R05>
Sec. 1452.226-70  Indian preference.

solicitations issued and contracts awarded (a) by the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs except those pursuant to Title I and to Indian Tribes and Indian 
Organizations under

[[Page 636]]

Title II of Pub. L. 93-638 (25 U.S.C. 450 et seq. and 25 U.S.C. 455 et 
seq., respectively); (b) a contracting activity other than the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs when the contract is entered into pursuant to an act 
specifically authorizing contracts with Indian organizations, and (c) a 
contracting activity other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs when the 
work to be performed is specifically for the benefit of Indians and is 
in addition to any incidental benefits which might otherwise accrue to 
the general public.

        Indian Preference--Department of the Interior (APR 1984)

    (a) The Contractor agrees to give preferences to Indians who can 
perform the work required regardless of age (subject to existing laws 
and regulations), sex, religion, or tribal affiliation for training and 
employment opportunities under this contract and, to the extent feasible 
consistent with the efficient performance of this contract, training and 
employment preferences and opportunities shall be provided to Indians 
regardless of age (subject to existing laws and regulations), sex, 
religion, or tribal affiliation who are not fully qualified to perform 
under this contract. The Contractor also agrees to give preference to 
Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises in the 
awarding of any subcontracts consistent with the efficient performance 
of this contract. The Contractor shall maintain such records as are 
necessary to indicate compliance with this paragraph.
    (b) In connection with the Indian employment preference requirements 
of this clause, the Contractor shall also provide opportunities for 
training incident to such employment. Such training shall include on-
the-job, classroom, or apprenticeship training which is designed to 
increase the vocational effectiveness of an Indian employee.

and which, in the opinion of the contracting officer, offer substantial 
opportunities for Indian employment, training, and subcontracting.

    Indian Preference Program--Department of the Interior (APR 1984)

    (a) In addition to the requirements of the clause of this contract 
entitled ``Indian Preference--Department of the Interior'', the 
Contractor agrees to establish and conduct an Indian preference program 
which will expand the opportunities for Indian organizations and Indian-
owned economic enterprises to receive a preference in the awarding of 
subcontracts and which will expand opportunities for Indians to receive 
preference for training and employment in connection with the work to be 
performed under this contract. In this connection, the contractor shall:
    (1) Designate a liaison officer who will: (i) Maintain liaison with 
the Government and Tribe(s) on Indian preference matters; (ii) supervise 
compliance with the provisions of this clause; and (iii) administer the 
Contractor's Indian preference program.
    (2) Advise its recruitment sources in writing and include a 
statement in all advertisements for employment that Indian applicants 
will be given preference in employment and training incident to such 
employment.
    (3) Not less than twenty (20) calendar days prior to commencement of 
work under this contract, post a written notice in the Tribal office of 
any reservations on which or near where the work under this contract is 
to be performed, which sets forth the Contractor's employment needs and 
related training opportunities. The notice shall include the approximate 
number and types of employees needed, the approximate dates of 
employment; the experience or special skills required for employment, if 
any; training opportunities available; and all other pertinent 
information necessary to advise prospective employees of any other 
employment requirements. The Contractor shall also request the Tribe(s) 
on or near whose reservation(s) the work is to be performed to provide 
assistance to the Contractor in filling its employment needs and 
training opportunties. The Contracting Officer will advise the 
Contractor of the name, location, and phone number of the Tribal 
officials to contract in regard to the posting of notices and requests 
for Tribal assistance.
    (4) Establish and conduct a subcontracting program which gives 
preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises 
as subcontractors and suppliers under this contract. Consistent with the 
efficient performance of this contract, the Contractor shall give public 
notice of existing subcontracting opportunities by soliciting bids or 
proposals only from Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic 
enterprises. The Contractor shall request assistance and information on 
Indian firms qualified as suppliers or subcontractors from the Tribe(s) 
on or near whose reservation(s) the work under the contract is to be 
performed. The Contracting Officer will advise the Contractor of the 
name, location, and phone number of the Tribal officials to be contacted 
in regard to the request for assistance and information. Public notices 
and solicitations for existing subcontracting opportunities shall 
provide an equitable opportunity for Indian firms to submit bids or 
proposals by including: (i) A clear description of the supplies or 
services required including quantities, specifications, and delivery 
schedules which facilitate the participation of Indian firms; (ii) a 
statement indicating the perference will be given to Indian 
organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises in accordance with 
section 7(b) of Pub. L. 93-638; (88 Stat. 2205; 25 U.S.C. 450e(b)); 
(iii) definitions for the terms Indian organization and Indian-owned 
economic enterprise as prescribed under the ``Indian Preference--
Department of the Interior'' clause of this contract; (iv) a 
representation to be completed by the bidder or offeror that it is an 
Indian organization or Indian-owned economic enterprise; and (v) a 
closing date for receipt of bids or proposals which provides sufficient 
time for preparation and submission of a bid or proposal. If after 
soliciting bids from Indian organizations and Indian owned economic 
enterprises, no responsive bid is received, the Contractor shall comply 
with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the ``Indian Preference--
Department of the Interior'' clause of this contract. If one or more 
responsive bids are received, award shall be made to the low responsible 
bidder if the bid price is determined to be reasonable. If the low 
responsive bid is determined to be unreasonable as to price, the 
Contractor shall attempt to negotiate a reasonable price and award a 
subcontract. If a reasonable price cannot be agreed upon, the Contractor 
shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) of the ``Indian 
Preference--Department of the Interior'' clause of the contract.
    (5) Maintain written records under this contract which indicate: (i) 
The names and addresses of all Indians seeking employment for each 
employment position available under this contract; (ii) the number of 
types of positions filled by (A) Indians and (B) non-Indians, and the 
name, address and position of each Indian employed under this contract; 
(iii) for those positions where there are both Indian and non-Indian 
applicants, and a non-Indian is selected for employment, the reason(s) 
why the Indian applicant was not selected; (iv) actions taken to give 
preference to Indian organizations and Indian-owned

[[Page 638]]

economic enterprises for subcontracting opportunities which exist under 
this contract; (v) reasons why preference was not given to Indian firms 
as subcontractors or suppliers for each requirement where it was 
determined by the Contractor that such preference would not be 
consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, and (vi) the 
names and addresses of all Indian organizations and Indian-owned 
economic enterprises (A) contacted, and (B) receiving subcontract awards 
under this contract.
    (6) The Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer for 
approval a semiannual report which summarizes the Contractor's Indian 
preference program and indicates (i) the number and types of available 
positions filled and dollar amounts of all subcontracts awarded to (a) 
Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises and (b) all 
other firms.
    (7) Records maintained pursuant to this clause will be kept 
available for review by the Government until expiration of one (1) year 
after final payment under this contract, or for such longer period as 
may be required by any other clause of this contract or by applicable 
law or regulation.
    (b) For purposes of this clause, the following definitions of terms 
shall apply:
    (1) The terms Indian, Indian Tribe, Indian Organization, and Indian-
owned economic enterprise are defined in the clause of this contract 
entitled ``Indian Preference.''
    (2) Indian reservation includes Indian reservations, public domain 
Indian allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held 
by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village 
corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act (85 Stat. 688; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).
    (3) On or near an Indian Reservation means on a reservation or 
reservations or within that area surrounding an Indian reservation(s) 
where a person seeking employment could reasonably be expected to 
commute to and from in the course of a workday.
    (c) Nothing in the requirements of this clause shall be interpreted 
to preclude Indian Tribes from independently developing and enforcing 
their own Indian preference requirements. Such requirements must not 
hinder the Government's right to award contracts and to administer their 
provisions.
    (d) The Contractor agrees to include the provisions of this clause 
including this paragraph (d) in each subcontract awarded under this 
contract and to notify the Contracting Officer of such subcontracts.
    (e) In the event of noncompliance with this clause, the Contractor's 
right to proceed may be terminated in whole or in part by the 
Contracting Officer and the work completed in a manner determined by the 
Contracting Officer to be in the best interest of the Government.

Sec. 1452.228-72  Liability for loss or damage.

    As prescribed in 1428.306-70(c)(2), insert the following clause in 
all fixed-price contracts involving the use of aircraft with Government-
furnished pilot where the Government does not have a property interest 
in the aircraft:

   Liability for Loss or Damage--Department of the Interior (APR 1984)

    (a) The Contractor shall indemnify and hold the Government harmless 
from any and all loss or damage to the aircraft furnished under this 
contract except as provided in paragraph (d) of this clause. For the 
purpose of fulfilling its obligation under this clause, the Contractor 
shall procure and maintain during the term of this contract, and any 
extension thereof, hull insurance acceptable to the Contracting Officer. 
The Contractor's insurance coverage shall apply to pilots furnished by 
the Government who operate the aircraft. The contractor may request a 
list of Government pilots by name and qualification who are potential 
pilots.
    (b) Prior to the commencement of work hereunder, the Contractor 
shall furnish to the Contracting Officer a copy of the insurance policy 
or policies or a certificate of insurance issued by the underwriter(s) 
showing that the coverage required by this clause has been obtained.
    (c) Each policy or certificate evidencing the insurance shall 
contain an endorsement which provides that the insurance company will 
notify the Contracting Officer 30 days prior to the effective date of 
any cancellation or termination of any policy or certificate or any 
modification of a policy or certificate which adversely affects the 
interests of the Government in such insurance. The notice shall be sent 
by registered mail and shall identify this contract, the name and 
address of the contracting office, the policy, and the insured.
    (d) If the aircraft is damaged or destroyed while in the custody and 
control of the Government, the Government will reimburse the Contractor 
for the deductible stipulated in the insurance coverage (if any) as 
follows:
    (1) In-Motion Accidents--Up to 5% of the current insured value of 
the aircraft stated in the policy, or $10,000.00, whichever is less.
    (2) Not In-Motion Accidents--Up to $250.00 per accident. Such 
reimbursement shall not be made, however, for loss or damage to the 
aircraft resulting from: (1) Normal wear and tear, (2) negligence or 
fault in maintenance of the aircraft by the Contractor, or (3) a defect 
in construction of the aircraft or a component thereof.
    (e) If damage to the aircraft is established to be the fault of the 
Government, rental payments to the Contractor during the repair period 
will be made as set forth elsewhere in this contract. The Government 
may, at its option, make necessary repairs or return the aircraft to the 
Contractor for repair. In the event the aircraft is lost, destroyed, or 
damaged so extensively as to be beyond repair, no rental payment will be 
made to the Contractor thereafter.
    (f) Any failure to agree as to the responsibility of the Government 
or the Contractor

[[Page 640]]

under this clause shall, after a final finding and determination by the 
Contracting Officer, be considered a dispute within the meaning of the 
``Disputes'' clause of this contract.

Sec. 1452.228-73  Liability for loss or damage (property interest).

    As prescribed in 1428.306-70(c)(3), insert the following clause in 
all fixed-price contracts involving the use of aircraft with Government-
furnished pilot where the Government has a property interest in the 
aircraft (e.g., lease with purchase option):

   Liability for Loss or Damage--Department of the Interior (APR 1984)

    (a) The Government assumes all risk and liability for damage to or 
loss of the aircraft for the term of this contract, while the aircraft 
is in the Government's possession, except for: (1) Normal wear and tear 
to the aircraft, or (2) loss which occurs as a result of negligence or 
fault in maintenance of the aircraft by the contractor, or (3) loss 
resulting from a latent defect in the construction of the aircraft or a 
component thereof.
    (b) In the event of damage to the aircraft, the Government may, at 
its option, make the necessary repairs with its own facilities, or by 
contract, or pay the Contractor the reasonable cost of repair of the 
aircraft. If damage to the aircraft is established to be the fault of 
the Government, rental payments to the Contractor during the repair 
period will be made as set forth elsewhere in this contract.
    (c) In the event the aircraft is lost, destroyed, or damaged so 
extensively as to be beyond repair, no rental payment will be made to 
the Contractor thereafter, but the Government will pay to the Contractor 
a sum equal to the fair market value of the aircraft just prior to such 
loss, destruction, or extensive damage less the salvage value of the 
aircraft.
    (d) The Contractor certifies that the contract price does not 
include any cost attributable to insurance or to any reserve fund it has 
established to protect its interests in or use of the aircraft, 
regardless of whether or not the insurance coverage applies for the 
period during which the Government has possession of the aircraft. If, 
in the event of loss or damage to the aircraft, the Contractor receives 
compensation for such loss or damage, in any form, from any source, the 
amount of such compensation shall be credited to the Government in 
determining the amount of the Government's liability under this clause; 
except that this shall not apply to proceeds of insurance received 
solely as an advance of insurance pending determination of Government 
liability, or for an increment of value of the aircraft beyond the value 
for which the Government is responsible.
    (e) In the event of loss or damage, the Government shall be 
subrogated to all rights of recovery by the Contractor against third 
parties for such loss or damage and such rights shall be immediately 
assigned to the Government. Except as the Contracting Officer may permit 
in writing, the Contractor shall neither release nor discharge any third 
party from liability for such loss or damage nor otherwise compromise or 
adversely affect the Government's subrogation or other rights hereunder. 
The Contractor shall cooperate with the Government in any suit or action 
undertaken by the Government against any such third party.
    (f) Any failure to agree as to the responsibility of the Government 
or the Contractor under this clause shall, after a final finding and 
determination by the Contracting Officer, be considered a dispute within 
the meaning of the ``Disputes'' clause of this contract.
