                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2001), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

<R05>
Sec. 190.5  Service.

    (a) Each order, notice, or other document required to be served 
under this part shall be served personally or by registered or certified 
mail.
    (b) Service upon a person's duly authorized representative or agent 
constitutes service upon that person.
    (c) Service by registered or certified mail is complete upon 
mailing. An official U. S. Postal Service receipt from the registered or 
certified mailing constitutes prima facie evidence of service.


<R05>
Sec. 190.7  Subpoenas; witness fees.

    (a) The Administrator, RSPA, the Chief Counsel, RSPA, or the 
official designated by the Administrator, RSPA, to preside over a 
hearing convened in accordance with this part, may sign and issue 
subpoenas individually on their own initiative or, upon request and 
adequate showing by any person participating in the proceeding that the 
information sought will materially advance the proceeding.
    (b) A subpoena may require the attendance of a witness, or the 
production of documentary or other tangible evidence in the possession 
or under the control of person served, or both.
    (c) A subpoena may be served personally by any person who is not an 
interested person and is not less than 18 years of age, or by certified 
or registered mail.
    (d) Service of a subpoena upon the person named therein shall be 
made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to such person and by 
tendering the fees for one day's attendance and mileage as specified by 
paragraph (g) of this section. When a subpoena is issued at the instance 
of any officer or agency of the United States, fees and mileage need not 
be tendered at the time of service. Delivery of a copy of a subpoena and 
tender of the fees to a natural person may be made by handing them to 
the person, leaving them at the person's office with the person in 
charge thereof, leaving them at the person's dwelling place or usual 
place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then 
residing therein, by mailing them by registered or certified mail to the 
person at the last known address, or by any method whereby actual notice 
is given to the person and the fees are made available prior to the 
return date.
    (e) When the person to be served is not a natural person, delivery 
of a copy of the subpoena and tender of the fees may be effected by 
handing them to a designated agent or representative for service, or to 
any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of the person, 
or by mailing them by registered or certified mail to that agent or 
representative and the fees are made available prior to the return date.
    (f) The original subpoena bearing a certificate of service shall be 
filed with the official having responsibility for the proceeding in 
connection with which the subpoena was issued.
    (g) A subpoenaed witness shall be paid the same fees and mileage as 
would be paid to a witness in a proceeding in the district courts of the 
United States. The witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the person 
at whose instance the subpoena was issued.
    (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section, 
and upon request, the witness fees and mileage may be paid by the RSPA 
if the official who issued the subpoena determines on the basis of good 
cause shown, that:

[[Page 9]]

    (1) The presence of the subpoenaed witness will materially advance 
the proceeding; and
    (2) The person at whose instance the subpoena was issued would 
suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness fees and 
mileage.
    (i) Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, prior to the time 
specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than 10 days 
after the date of service of such subpoena, apply to the official who 
issued the subpoena, or if the person is unavailable, to the 
Administrator, RSPA to quash or modify the subpoena. The application 
shall contain a brief statement of the reasons relied upon in support of 
the action sought therein. The Administrator, RSPA, or this issuing 
official, as the case may be, may:
    (1) Deny the application;
    (2) Quash or modify the subpoena; or
    (3) Condition a grant or denial of the application to quash or 
modify the subpoena upon the satisfaction of certain just and reasonable 
requirements. The denial may be summary.

final action without the material.
    (j) After submission of all materials during and after the hearing, 
the presiding official shall prepare a written recommendation as to 
final action in the case. This recommendation, along with any material

                             Specific Relief


<R05>
Sec. 190.233  Hazardous facility orders.

    (a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, if the 
Associate Administrator, OPS finds, after reasonable notice and 
opportunity for hearing in accord with paragraph (c) of this section, 
and Sec. 190.211(a), a particular pipeline facility to be hazardous to 
life or property, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall issue an order 
pursuant to this section requiring the owner or operator of the facility 
to take corrective action. Corrective action may include suspended or 
restricted use of the facility, physical inspection, testing, repair, 
replacement, or other action, as appropriate.
    (b) The Associate Administrator, OPS may waive the requirement for 
notice and hearing under paragraph (a) of this section before issuing an 
order pursuant to this section when the Associate Administrator, OPS 
determines that the failure to do so would result in

[[Page 16]]

the likelihood of serious harm to life or property. However, the 
Associate Administrator, OPS shall include in the order an opportunity 
for hearing as soon as practicable after issuance of the order. The 
provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply to an owner or 
operator's decision to exercise such an opportunity for hearing. The 
purpose of such a post-order hearing is for the Associate Administrator, 
OPS to determine whether the order should remain in effect or be 
rescinded or suspended in accord with paragraph (g) of this section.
    (c) Notice and hearing:
    (1) Written notice that OPS intends to issue an order under this 
section shall be served in accordance with Sec. 190.5, upon the owner or 
operator of an alleged hazardous facility. The notice shall allege the 
existence of a hazardous facility, stating the facts and circumstances 
supporting the issuance of a ``hazardous facility order'', and providing 
the owner or operator an opportunity for a hearing, identifying the time 
and location of the hearing.
    (2) An owner or operator elects to exercise his opportunity for a 
hearing under this section, by notifying the Associate Administrator, 
OPS of that election in writing within 10 days of service of the notice 
provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or, under paragraph (b) 
of this section when applicable. Absence of such written notification 
waives an owner or operator's opportunity for a hearing and allows the 
Associate Administrator, OPS to proceed to issue a ``hazardous facility 
order'' in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section.
    (3) A hearing under this section shall be presided over by an 
attorney from the Office of Chief Counsel, Research and Special Programs 
Administration, acting as Presiding Official, and conducted without 
strict adherence to rules of evidence. The Presiding Official presents 
the allegations contained in the notice issued under this section. The 
owner or operator of the alleged hazardous facility may submit any 
relevant information or materials, call witnesses and present arguments 
on the issue of whether or not a ``hazardous facility order'' should be 
issued.
    (4) Within 48 hours after conclusion of a hearing under this 
section, the Presiding Official shall submit a recommendation to the 
Associate Administrator, OPS as to whether or not a ``hazardous facility 
order'' is required. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the Associate 
Administrator, OPS shall proceed in accordance with paragraphs (d) 
through (h) of this section. If the Associate Administrator, OPS finds 
the facility to be hazardous to life or property the Associate 
Administrator, OPS shall issue an order in accordance with this section. 
If the Associate Administrator, OPS does not find the facility to be 
hazardous to life or property, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall 
dismiss the allegations contained in the notice, and promptly notify the 
owner or operator in writing by service as prescribed in Sec. 190.5.
    (d) The Associate Administrator, OPS may find a pipeline facility to 
be hazardous under paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) If under the facts and circumstances the Associate 
Administrator, OPS determines the particular facility is hazardous to 
life or property; or
    (2) If the pipeline facility or a component thereof has been 
constructed or operated with any equipment, material, or technique which 
the Associate Administrator, OPS determines is hazardous to life or 
property, unless the operator involved demonstrates to the satisfaction 
of the Associate Administrator, OPS that, under the particular facts and 
circumstances involved, such equipment, material, or technique is not 
hazardous to life or property.
    (e) In making a determination under paragraph (d) of this section, 
the Associate Administrator, OPS shall consider, if relevant:
    (1) The characteristics of the pipe and other equipment used in the 
pipeline facility involved, including its age, manufacturer, physical 
properties (including its resistance to corrosion and deterioration), 
and the method of its manufacture, construction or assembly;
    (2) The nature of the materials transported by such facility 
(including their corrosive and deteriorative qualities), the sequence in 
which such materials

[[Page 17]]

are transported, and the pressure required for such transportation;
    (3) The aspects of the areas in which the pipeline facility is 
located, in particular the climatic and geologic conditions (including 
soil characteristics) associated with such areas, and the population 
density and population and growth patterns of such areas;
    (4) Any recommendation of the National Transportation Safety Board 
issued in connection with any investigation conducted by the Board; and
    (5) Such other factors as the Associate Administrator, OPS may 
consider appropriate.
    (f) The order shall contain the following information:
    (1) A finding that the pipeline facility is hazardous to life or 
property.
    (2) The relevant facts which form the basis for that finding.
    (3) The legal basis for the order.
    (4) The nature and description of particular corrective action 
required of the respondent.
    (5) The date by which the required action must be taken, or 
completed and, where appropriate, the duration of the order.
    (6) If a hearing has been waived pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section, a statement that an opportunity for a hearing is provided at a 
particular location and at a certain time after issuance of the order.
    (g) The Associate Administrator, OPS shall rescind or suspend a 
hazardous facility order whenever the Associate Administrator, OPS 
determines that the facility is no longer hazardous to life or property. 
When appropriate, however, such a rescission or suspension may be 
accompanied by a notice of probable violation issued under Sec. 190.207.
    (h) At any time after an order issued under this section has become 
effective, the Associate Administrator, OPS may request the Attorney 
General to bring an action for appropriate relief in accordance with 
Sec. 190.235.
    (i) Upon petition by the Attorney General, the District Courts of 
the United States shall have jurisdiction, to enforce orders issued 
under this section by appropriate means.

<R05>
Sec. 190.235  Injunctive action.

    Whenever it appears to the Associate Administrator, OPS that a 
person has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in any act or 
practice constituting a violation of any provision of 49 U.S.C. 60101 et 
seq. or any regulations issued thereunder, the Administrator, RSPA, or 
the person to whom the authority has been delegated, may request the 
Attorney General to bring an action in the appropriate U.S. District 
Court for such relief as is necessary or appropriate, including 
mandatory or prohibitive injunctive relief, interim equitable relief, 
and punitive damages as provided under 49 U.S.C. 60120 and 49 U.S.C. 
5123.

<R05>
190.237  Amendment of plans or procedures.

    (a) A Regional Director begins a proceeding to determine whether an 
operator's plans or procedures required under parts 192, 193, 195, and 
199 of this subchapter are inadequate to assure safe operation of a 
pipeline facility by issuing a notice of amendment. The notice shall 
provide an opportunity for a hearing under Sec. 190.211 of this part and 
shall specify the alleged inadequacies and the proposed action for 
revision of the plans or procedures. The notice shall allow the operator 
30 days after receipt of the notice to submit written comments or 
request a hearing. After considering all material presented in writing 
or at the hearing, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall determine 
whether the plans or procedures are inadequate as alleged and order the 
required amendment if they are inadequate, or withdraw the notice if 
they are not. In determining the adequacy of an operator's plans or 
procedures, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall consider:
    (1) Relevant available pipeline safety data;
    (2) Whether the plans or procedures are appropriate for the 
particular type

[[Page 18]]

of pipeline transportation or facility, and for the location of the 
facility;
    (3) The reasonableness of the plans or procedures; and
    (4) The extent to which the plans or procedures contribute to public 
safety.
    (b) The amendment of an operator's plans or procedures prescribed in 
paragraph (a) of this section is in addition to, and may be used in 
conjunction with, the appropriate enforcement actions prescribed in this 
subpart.

persons are invited to participate in the rulemaking proceedings with 
respect to each substantive rule.


<R05>
Sec. 190.313  Initiation of rulemaking.

    The Administrator initiates rulemaking on his or her own motion;

established by statute for that purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 190.315  Contents of notices of proposed rulemaking.

    A petition for extension of the time to submit comments must be 
received not later than 10 days before expiration of the time stated in 
the notice. It is requested, but not required, that three copies be 
submitted. The filing of the petition does not automatically extend the 
time for petitioner's comments. A petition is granted only if the 
petitioner shows good cause for the extension, and if the extension is 
consistent with the public interest. If an extension is granted, it is 
granted to all persons, and it is published in the Federal Register.


<R05>

<R05>
Sec. 190.323  Consideration of comments received.

    All timely comments and the recommendations of any technical

practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 190.325  Additional rulemaking proceedings.

    The Administrator may initiate any further rulemaking proceedings

hearing, any interested person may petition the Administrator for an 
informal hearing. The petition must be received by the Administrator not 
later than 20 days before expiration of the time stated in the notice.

scheduling of a hearing. A petition is granted only if the petitioner 
shows good cause for a hearing. If a petition for a hearing is granted, 
notice of the

[[Page 20]]

hearing is published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Sections 556 and 557 of title 5, United States Code, do not

hearing held under this subpart. The Chief Counsel designates a member 
of his or her staff to serve as legal officer at the hearing.


<R05>

Register, unless all persons subject to it are named and are personally 
served with a copy of it.


<R05>
Sec. 190.331  Petitions for rulemaking.

    (a) Any interested person may petition the Associate Administrator 
for Pipeline Safety to establish, amend, or repeal a substantive 
regulation, or may petition the Chief Counsel to establish, amend, or 
repeal a procedural regulation.
    (b) Each petition filed under this section must--
    (1) Summarize the proposed action and explain its purpose;
    (2) State the text of the proposed rule or amendment, or specify the 
rule proposed to be repealed;
    (3) Explain the petitioner's interest in the proposed action and the

and information and data related to that impact are available to the 
petitioner, the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel may request 
the petitioner to provide--
    (1) The costs and benefits to society and identifiable groups within 
society, quantifiable and otherwise;
    (2) The direct effects (including preemption effects) of the 
proposed action on States, on the relationship between the Federal

Sec. 190.333  Processing of petition.

    (a) General. Unless the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
otherwise specifies, no public hearing, argument, or other proceeding is 
held directly on a petition before its disposition under this section.
    (b) Grants. If the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
determines that the petition contains adequate justification, he or she 
initiates rulemaking action under this subpart.
    (c) Denials. If the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
determines that the petition does not justify rulemaking, the petition 
is denied.
    (d) Notification. The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
will notify a petitioner, in writing, of the decision to grant or deny a 
petition for rulemaking.


<R05>
Sec. 190.335  Petitions for reconsideration.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 190.339(d), any interested person may 
petition the Associate Administrator for reconsideration of any 
regulation issued under

[[Page 21]]

this subpart, or may petition the Chief Counsel for reconsideration of 
any procedural regulation issued under this subpart and contained in 
this subpart. It is requested, but not required, that three copies be 
submitted. The petition must be received not later than 30 days after 
publication of the rule in the Federal Register. Petitions filed after 
that time will be considered as petitions filed under Sec. 190.331. The 
petition must contain a brief statement of the complaint and an 
explanation as to why compliance with the rule is not practicable, is 
unreasonable, or is not in the public interest.
    (b) If the petitioner requests the consideration of additional 
facts, the petitioner must state the reason they were not presented to 
the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel within the prescribed 
time.
    (c) The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel does not 
consider repetitious petitions.
    (d) Unless the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
otherwise provides, the filing of a petition under this section does not 
stay the effectiveness of the rule.


<R05>
Sec. 190.337  Proceedings on petitions for reconsideration.

    (a) The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel may grant or 
deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration without 
further proceedings, except where a grant of the petition would result 
in issuance of a new final rule. In the event that the Associate 
Administrator or the Chief Counsel determines to reconsider any 
regulation, a final decision on reconsideration may be issued without 
further proceedings, or an opportunity to submit comment or information 
and data as deemed appropriate, may be provided. Whenever the Associate 
Administrator or the Chief Counsel determines that a petition should be 
granted or denied, the Office of the Chief Counsel prepares a notice of 
the grant or denial of a petition for reconsideration, for issuance to 
the petitioner, and the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
issues it to the petitioner. The Associate Administrator or the Chief 
Counsel may consolidate petitions relating to the same rules.
    (b) It is the policy of the Associate Administrator or the Chief 
Counsel to issue notice of the action taken on a petition for 
reconsideration within 90 days after the date on which the regulation in 
question is published in the Federal Register, unless it is found 
impracticable to take action within that time. In cases where it is so 
found and the delay beyond that period is expected to be substantial, 
notice of that fact and the date by which it is expected that action 
will be taken is issued to the petitioner and published in the Federal 
Register.


<R05>
Sec. 190.338  Appeals.

    (a) Any interested person may appeal a denial of the Associate 
Administrator or the Chief Counsel, issued under Sec. 190.333 or 
Sec. 190.337, to the Administrator.
    (b) An appeal must be received within 20 days of service of written 
notice to petitioner of the Associate Administrator's or the Chief 
Counsel's decision, or within 20 days from the date of publication of 
the decision in the Federal Register, and should set forth the contested 
aspects of the decision as well as any new arguments or information.
    (c) It is requested, but not required, that three copies of the 
appeal be submitted to the Administrator.
    (d) Unless the Administrator otherwise provides, the filing of an 
appeal under this section does not stay the effectiveness of any rule.


<R05>
Sec. 190.339  Direct final rulemaking.

    (a) Where practicable, the Administrator will use direct final 
rulemaking to issue the following types of rules:
    (1) Minor, substantive changes to regulations;
    (2) Incorporation by reference of the latest edition of technical or 
industry standards;
    (3) Extensions of compliance dates; and
    (4) Other noncontroversial rules where the Administrator determines 
that use of direct final rulemaking is in the public interest, and that 
a regulation is unlikely to result in adverse comment.
    (b) The direct final rule will state an effective date. The direct 
final rule will

[[Page 22]]

also state that unless an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an 
adverse comment is received within the specified comment period, 
generally 60 days after publication of the direct final rule in the 
Federal Register, the Administrator will issue a confirmation document, 
generally within 15 days after the close of the comment period, advising 
the public that the direct final rule will either become effective on 
the date stated in the direct final rule or at least 30 days after the 
publication date of the confirmation document, whichever is later.
    (c) For purposes of this section, an adverse comment is one which 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. Comments that are frivolous or 
insubstantial will not be considered adverse under this procedure. A 
comment recommending a rule change in addition to the rule will not be 
considered an adverse comment, unless the commenter states why the rule 
would be ineffective without the additional change.
    (d) Only parties who filed comments to a direct final rule issued 
under this section may petition under Sec. 190.335 for reconsideration 
of that direct final rule.
    (e) If an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse 
comment is received, a timely document will be published in the Federal 
Register advising the public and withdrawing the direct final rule in 
whole or in part. The Administrator may then incorporate the adverse 
comment into a subsequent direct final rule or may publish a notice of 
proposed rulemaking. A notice of proposed rulemaking will provide an 
opportunity for public comment, generally a minimum of 60 days, and will 
be processed in accordance with Secs. 190.311-190.329.

will have until September 15, 1998 to identify the transfer points. If 
it is not practicable to durably mark a transfer point and the transfer 
point is located above water, the operator must depict the transfer 
point on a schematic located near the transfer point. If a transfer 
point is located subsea, then the operator must identify the transfer 
point on a schematic which must be maintained at the nearest upstream 
facility and provided to RSPA upon request. For those cases in which 
adjoining operators have not agreed on a transfer point by September 15, 
1998 the Regional Director and the MMS Regional Supervisor will make a 
joint determination of the transfer point.

installed with adequate protection, to withstand anticipated external 
pressures and loads that will be imposed on the pipe after installation.


<R05>
Sec. 192.105  Design formula for steel pipe.

    (a) The design pressure for steel pipe is determined in accordance 
with the following formula:

P=(2 St/D)  x F x E x T

P=Design pressure in pounds per square inch (kPa) gauge.
S=Yield strength in pounds per square inch (kPa) determined in 
accordance with Sec. 192.107.
D=Nominal outside diameter of the pipe in inches (millimeters).
t=Nominal wall thickness of the pipe in inches (millimeters). If this is 
unknown, it is determined in accordance with Sec. 192.109. Additional 
wall thickness required for concurrent external loads in accordance with 
Sec. 192.103 may not be included in computing design pressure.
F=Design factor determined in accordance with Sec. 192.111.
E=Longitudinal joint factor determined in accordance with Sec. 192.113.
T=Temperature derating factor determined in accordance with 
Sec. 192.115.

    (b) If steel pipe that has been subjected to cold expansion to meet 
the SMYS is subsequently heated, other than by welding or stress 
relieving as a part of welding, the design pressure is limited to 75 
percent of the pressure determined under paragraph (a) of this section 
if the temperature of the pipe exceeds 900 deg. F (482 deg. C) at any 
time or is held above 600 deg. F (316 deg. C) for more than 1 hour.

    (a) For pipe that is manufactured in accordance with a specification 
listed in section I of appendix B of this part, the yield strength to be 
used in the design formula in Sec. 192.105 is the SMYS stated in the 
listed specification, if that value is known.
    (b) For pipe that is manufactured in accordance with a specification 
not listed in section I of appendix B to this part or whose 
specification or tensile properties are unknown, the yield strength to 
be used in the design formula in Sec. 192.105 is one of the following:
    (1) If the pipe is tensile tested in accordance with section II-D of 
appendix B to this part, the lower of the following:
    (i) 80 percent of the average yield strength determined by the 
tensile tests.
    (ii) The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests.

<R05>
Sec. 192.109  Nominal wall thickness (t) for steel pipe.

    (a) If the nominal wall thickness for steel pipe is not known, it is 
determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter 
points on one end.
    (b) However, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and thickness 
and there are more than 10 lengths, only 10 percent of the individual 
lengths, but not less than 10 lengths, need be measured. The thickness 
of the lengths that are not measured must be verified by applying a 
gauge set to the minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal 
wall thickness to be used in the design formula in Sec. 192.105 is the 
next wall thickness found in commercial specifications that is below the 
average of all the measurements taken. However, the nominal wall 
thickness used may not be more than 1.14 times the smallest measurement 
taken on pipe less than 20 inches (508 millimeters) in outside diameter, 
nor more than 1.11 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe 20 
inches (508 millimeters) or more in outside diameter.

                Subpart D--Design of Pipeline Components


<R05>
Sec. 192.141  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for the design and 
installation of pipeline components and facilities. In addition, it 
prescribes requirements relating to protection against accidental 
overpressuring.


<R05>
Sec. 192.143  General requirements.

    Each component of a pipeline must be able to withstand operating 
pressures and other anticipated loadings without impairment of its 
serviceability with unit stresses equivalent to those allowed for 
comparable material in pipe in the same location and kind of service. 
However, if design based upon unit stresses is impractical for a 
particular component, design may be based upon a pressure rating 
established by the manufacturer by pressure testing that component or a 
prototype of the component.

a metallic component manufactured in accordance with any other edition 
of that document is qualified for use under this part if--
    (a) It can be shown through visual inspection of the cleaned 
component that no defect exists which might impair

[[Page 40]]

the strength or tightness of the component; and
    (b) The edition of the document under which the component was 
manufactured has equal or more stringent requirements for the following

tested with no leakage to a pressure at least 1.5 times the maximum 
service rating.
    (ii) After the shell test, the seat must be tested to a pressure not 
less than 1.5 times the maximum service pressure rating. Except for 
swing check valves, test pressure during the seat test must be applied 
successively on each side of the closed valve with the opposite side 
open. No visible leakage is permitted.
    (iii) After the last pressure test is completed, the valve must be 
operated through its full travel to demonstrate freedom from 
interference.
    (c) Each valve must be able to meet the anticipated operating 
conditions.
    (d) No valve having shell components made of ductile iron may be 
used at pressures exceeding 80 percent of the pressure ratings for

Sec. 192.150  Passage of internal inspection devices.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
each new transmission line and each line section of a transmission line 
where the line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component is replaced 
must be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of 
instrumented internal inspection devices.
    (b) This section does not apply to: (1) Manifolds;
    (2) Station piping such as at compressor stations, meter stations, 
or regulator stations;

Administrator finds in a particular case would be impracticable to 
design and construct to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal 
inspection devices.
    (c) An operator encountering emergencies, construction time 
constraints or other unforeseen construction problems need not construct 
a new or replacement segment of a transmission line to meet paragraph 
(a) of this section, if the operator determines and documents why an 
impracticability prohibits compliance with paragraph (a) of this 
section. Within 30 days after discovering the emergency or construction 
problem the operator must petition, under Sec. 190.9 of this chapter, 
for approval that design and construction to accommodate passage of 
instrumented internal inspection devices would be impracticable. If the 
petition is denied, within 1 year after the date of the notice of the 
denial, the operator must modify that segment to allow passage of 
instrumented internal inspection devices.

    (a) Location of compressor building. Except for a compressor 
building on a platform located offshore or in inland navigable waters, 
each main compressor building of a compressor station must be located on 
property under the control of the operator. It must be far enough away 
from adjacent property, not under control of the operator, to minimize 
the possibility of fire being communicated to the compressor building 
from structures on adjacent property. There must be enough open space 
around the main compressor building to allow the free movement of fire-
fighting equipment.
    (b) Building construction. Each building on a compressor station 
site must be made of noncombustible materials if it contains either--
    (1) Pipe more than 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter that is 
carrying gas under pressure; or
    (2) Gas handling equipment other than gas utilization equipment used 
for domestic purposes.
    (c) Exits. Each operating floor of a main compressor building must 
have at least two separated and unobstructed exits located so as to 
provide a convenient possibility of escape and an unobstructed passage 
to a place of safety. Each door latch on an exit must be of a type which 
can be readily opened from the inside without a key. Each swinging door 
located in an exterior wall must be mounted to swing outward.
    (d) Fenced areas. Each fence around a compressor station must have 
at least two gates located so as to provide a convenient opportunity for 
escape to a place of safety, or have other facilities affording a 
similarly convenient exit from the area. Each gate located within 200 
feet (61 meters) of any compressor plant building must open outward and, 
when occupied, must be openable from the inside without a key.
    (e) Electrical facilities. Electrical equipment and wiring installed 
in compressor stations must conform to the National Electrical Code, 
ANSI/NFPA 70, so far as that code is applicable.

    (a) Except for unattended field compressor stations of 1,000 
horsepower (746 kilowatts) or less, each compressor station must have an 
emergency shutdown system that meets the following:
    (1) It must be able to block gas out of the station and blow down 
the station piping.
    (2) It must discharge gas from the blowdown piping at a location 
where the gas will not create a hazard.
    (3) It must provide means for the shutdown of gas compressing 
equipment, gas fires, and electrical facilities in the vicinity of gas 
headers and in the compressor building, except that:
    (i) Electrical circuits that supply emergency lighting required to 
assist station personnel in evacuating the compressor building and the 
area in the vicinity of the gas headers must remain energized; and

[[Page 44]]

    (ii) Electrical circuits needed to protect equipment from damage may 
remain energized.
    (4) It must be operable from at least two locations, each of which 
is:
    (i) Outside the gas area of the station;
    (ii) Near the exit gates, if the station is fenced, or near 
emergency exits, if not fenced; and
    (iii) Not more than 500 feet (153 meters) from the limits of the 
station.
    (b) If a compressor station supplies gas directly to a distribution 
system with no other adequate source of gas available, the emergency 
shutdown system must be designed so that it will not function at the 
wrong time and cause an unintended outage on the distribution system.
    (c) On a platform located offshore or in inland navigable waters, 
the emergency shutdown system must be designed and installed to actuate 
automatically by each of the following events:
    (1) In the case of an unattended compressor station:
    (i) When the gas pressure equals the maximum allowable operating 
pressure plus 15 percent; or
    (ii) When an uncontrolled fire occurs on the platform; and
    (2) In the case of a compressor station in a building:
    (i) When an uncontrolled fire occurs in the building; or
    (ii) When the concentration of gas in air reaches 50 percent or more 
of the lower explosive limit in a building which has a source of 
ignition.

For the purpose of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, an electrical 
facility which conforms to Class 1, Group D, of the National Electrical 
Code is not a source of ignition.

must be readily accessible and protected from tampering and damage.
    (2) The valve must be supported to prevent settling of the valve or 
movement of the pipe to which it is attached.
    (c) Each section of a transmission line, other than offshore 
segments, between main line valves must have a blowdown valve with 
enough capacity to allow the transmission line to be blown down as 
rapidly as practicable. Each blowdown discharge must be located so the 
gas can be blown to the atmosphere without hazard and, if the 
transmission line is adjacent to an overhead electric line, so that the 
gas is directed away from the electrical conductors.

secondary stresses that might be exerted through the valve or its 
enclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 192.195  Protection against accidental overpressuring.

    (a) General requirements. Except as provided in Sec. 192.197, each 
pipeline that is connected to a gas source so that the maximum allowable 
operating pressure could be exceeded as the result of pressure control 
failure or of some other type of failure, must have pressure relieving 
or pressure limiting devices that meet the requirements of Secs. 192.199 
and 192.201.
    (b) Additional requirements for distribution systems. Each 
distribution system that is supplied from a source of gas that is at a 
higher pressure than the maximum allowable operating pressure for the 
system must--
    (1) Have pressure regulation devices capable of meeting the 
pressure, load, and other service conditions that will be experienced in 
normal operation of the system, and that could be activated in the event 
of failure of some portion of the system; and
    (2) Be designed so as to prevent accidental overpressuring.


<R05>
Sec. 192.197  Control of the pressure of gas delivered from high-pressure distribution systems.

    (a) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution 
system is under 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage and a service regulator having 
the following characteristics is used, no other pressure limiting device 
is required:
    (1) A regulator capable of reducing distribution line pressure to 
pressures recommended for household appliances.
    (2) A single port valve with proper orifice for the maximum gas 
pressure at the regulator inlet.
    (3) A valve seat made of resilient material designed to withstand 
abrasion of the gas, impurities in gas, cutting by the valve, and to 
resist permanent deformation when it is pressed against the valve port.
    (4) Pipe connections to the regulator not exceeding 2 inches (51 
millimeters) in diameter.
    (5) A regulator that, under normal operating conditions, is able to 
regulate the downstream pressure within the necessary limits of accuracy 
and to limit the build-up of pressure under no-flow conditions to 
prevent a pressure that would cause the unsafe operation of any 
connected and properly adjusted gas utilization equipment.
    (6) A self-contained service regulator with no external static or 
control lines.
    (b) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution 
system is 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, or less, and a service regulator 
that does not have all of the characteristics listed in paragraph (a) of 
this section is used, or if the gas contains materials that seriously 
interfere with the operation of

[[Page 48]]

service regulators, there must be suitable protective devices to prevent 
unsafe overpressuring of the customer's appliances if the service 
regulator fails.
    (c) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution 
system exceeds 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, one of the following methods 
must be used to regulate and limit, to the maximum safe value, the 
pressure of gas delivered to the customer:
    (1) A service regulator having the characteristics listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, and another regulator located upstream 
from the service regulator. The upstream regulator may not be set to 
maintain a pressure higher than 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage. A device must 
be installed between the upstream regulator and the service regulator to 
limit the pressure on the inlet of the service regulator to 60 p.s.i. 
(414 kPa) gage or less in case the upstream regulator fails to function 
properly. This device may be either a relief valve or an automatic 
shutoff that shuts, if the pressure on the inlet of the service 
regulator exceeds the set pressure (60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage or less), 
and remains closed until manually reset.
    (2) A service regulator and a monitoring regulator set to limit, to 
a maximum safe value, the pressure of the gas delivered to the customer.
    (3) A service regulator with a relief valve vented to the outside 
atmosphere, with the relief valve set to open so that the pressure of 
gas going to the customer does not exceed a maximum safe value. The 
relief valve may either be built into the service regulator or it may be 
a separate unit installed downstream from the service regulator. This 
combination may be used alone only in those cases where the inlet 
pressure on the service regulator does not exceed the manufacturer's 
safe working pressure rating of the service regulator, and may not be 
used where the inlet pressure on the service regulator exceeds 125 
p.s.i. (862 kPa) gage. For higher inlet pressures, the methods in 
paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section must be used.
    (4) A service regulator and an automatic shutoff device that closes 
upon a rise in pressure downstream from the regulator and remains closed 
until manually reset.

Sec. 192.199  Requirements for design of pressure relief and limiting devices.

    Except for rupture discs, each pressure relief or pressure limiting 
device must:
    (a) Be constructed of materials such that the operation of the 
device will not be impaired by corrosion;
    (b) Have valves and valve seats that are designed not to stick in a 
position that will make the device inoperative;
    (c) Be designed and installed so that it can be readily operated to 
determine if the valve is free, can be tested to determine the pressure 
at which it will operate, and can be tested for leakage when in the 
closed position;
    (d) Have support made of noncombustible material;
    (e) Have discharge stacks, vents, or outlet ports designed to 
prevent accumulation of water, ice, or snow, located where gas can be 
discharged into the atmosphere without undue hazard;
    (f) Be designed and installed so that the size of the openings, 
pipe, and fittings located between the system to be protected and the 
pressure relieving device, and the size of the vent line, are adequate 
to prevent hammering of the valve and to prevent impairment of relief 
capacity;
    (g) Where installed at a district regulator station to protect a 
pipeline system from overpressuring, be designed and installed to 
prevent any single incident such as an explosion in a vault or damage by 
a vehicle from affecting the operation of both the overpressure 
protective device and the district regulator; and
    (h) Except for a valve that will isolate the system under protection 
from its source of pressure, be designed to prevent unauthorized 
operation of any stop valve that will make the pressure relief valve or 
pressure limiting device inoperative.

Sec. 192.201  Required capacity of pressure relieving and limiting stations.

    (a) Each pressure relief station or pressure limiting station or 
group of those stations installed to protect a pipeline must have enough 
capacity, and must be set to operate, to insure the following:
    (1) In a low pressure distribution system, the pressure may not 
cause the unsafe operation of any connected and properly adjusted gas 
utilization equipment.
    (2) In pipelines other than a low pressure distribution system:
    (i) If the maximum allowable operating pressure is 60 p.s.i. (414 
kPa) gage or more, the pressure may not exceed the maximum allowable 
operating pressure plus 10 percent, or the pressure that produces a hoop 
stress of 75 percent of SMYS, whichever is lower;
    (ii) If the maximum allowable operating pressure is 12 p.s.i. (83 
kPa) gage or more, but less than 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, the pressure 
may not exceed the maximum allowable operating pressure plus 6 p.s.i. 
(41 kPa) gage; or
    (iii) If the maximum allowable operating pressure is less than 12 
p.s.i. (83 kPa) gage, the pressure may not exceed the maximum allowable 
operating pressure plus 50 percent.
    (b) When more than one pressure regulating or compressor station 
feeds into a pipeline, relief valves or other protective devices must be 
installed at each station to ensure that the complete failure of the 
largest capacity regulator or compressor, or any single run of lesser 
capacity regulators or compressors in that station, will not impose 
pressures on any part of the pipeline or distribution system in excess 
of those for which it was designed, or against which it was protected, 
whichever is lower.
    (c) Relief valves or other pressure limiting devices must be 
installed at or near each regulator station in a low-pressure 
distribution system, with a capacity to limit the maximum pressure in 
the main to a pressure that will not exceed the safe operating pressure 
for any connected and properly adjusted gas utilization equipment.

control, and sampling pipe and components. It does not apply to 
permanently closed systems, such as fluid-filled temperature-responsive 
devices.
    (b) Materials and design. All materials employed for pipe and 
components must be designed to meet the particular conditions of service 
and the following:
    (1) Each takeoff connection and attaching boss, fitting, or adapter 
must be made of suitable material, be able to withstand the maximum 
service pressure and temperature of the pipe or equipment to which it is 
attached, and be designed to satisfactorily withstand all stresses 
without failure by fatigue.
    (2) Except for takeoff lines that can be isolated from sources of 
pressure by other valving, a shutoff valve must be installed in each 
takeoff line as near as practicable to the point of takeoff. Blowdown 
valves must be installed where necessary.
    (3) Brass or copper material may not be used for metal temperatures 
greater than 400 deg. F (204 deg.C).
    (4) Pipe or components that may contain liquids must be protected by 
heating or other means from damage due to freezing.
    (5) Pipe or components in which liquids may accumulate must have 
drains or drips.
    (6) Pipe or components subject to clogging from solids or deposits 
must have suitable connections for cleaning.
    (7) The arrangement of pipe, components, and supports must provide 
safety under anticipated operating stresses.
    (8) Each joint between sections of pipe, and between pipe and valves 
or fittings, must be made in a manner suitable for the anticipated 
pressure and temperature condition. Slip type expansion joints may not 
be used. Expansion must be allowed for by providing flexibility within 
the system itself.
    (9) Each control line must be protected from anticipated causes of 
damage and must be designed and installed to prevent damage to any one 
control line from making both the regulator

[[Page 50]]

and the over-pressure protective device inoperative.

Sec. 192.283  Plastic pipe: qualifying joining procedures.

    (a) Heat fusion, solvent cement, and adhesive joints. Before any 
written procedure established under Sec. 192.273(b) is used for making 
plastic pipe joints by a heat fusion, solvent cement, or adhesive 
method, the procedure must be qualified by subjecting specimen joints 
made according to the procedure to the following tests:
    (1) The burst test requirements of--
    (i) In the case of thermoplastic pipe, paragraph 6.6 (Sustained 
Pressure Test) or paragraph 6.7 (Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Pressure 
(Quick Burst)) of ASTM D 2513;
    (ii) In the case of thermosetting plastic pipe, paragraph 8.5 
(Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Pressure) or paragraph 8.9 (Sustained Static 
Pressure Test) of ASTM D2517; or
    (iii) In the case of electrofusion fittings for polyethylene pipe 
and tubing, paragraph 9.1 (Minimum Hydraulic Burst Pressure Test), 
paragraph 9.2 (Sustained Pressure Test), paragraph 9.3 (Tensile Strength 
Test), or paragraph 9.4 (Joint Integrity Tests) of ASTM Designation 
F1055.
    (2) For procedures intended for lateral pipe connections, subject a 
specimen joint made from pipe sections joined at right angles according 
to the procedure to a force on the lateral pipe until failure occurs in 
the specimen. If failure initiates outside the joint area, the procedure 
qualifies for use; and
    (3) For procedures intended for nonlateral pipe connections, follow 
the

[[Page 54]]

tensile test requirements of ASTM D638, except that the test may be 
conducted at ambient temperature and humidity. If the specimen elongates 
no less than 25 percent or failure initiates outside the joint area, the 
procedure qualifies for use.
    (b) Mechanical joints. Before any written procedure established 
under Sec. 192.273(b) is used for making mechanical plastic pipe joints 
that are designed to withstand tensile forces, the procedure must be 
qualified by subjecting 5 specimen joints made according to the 
procedure to the following tensile test:
    (1) Use an apparatus for the test as specified in ASTM D 638 (except 
for conditioning).
    (2) The specimen must be of such length that the distance between 
the grips of the apparatus and the end of the stiffener does not affect 
the joint strength.
    (3) The speed of testing is 0.20 in (5.0 mm) per minute, plus or 
minus 25 percent.
    (4) Pipe specimens less than 4 inches (102 mm) in diameter are 
qualified if the pipe yields to an elongation of no less than 25 percent 
or failure initiates outside the joint area.
    (5) Pipe specimens 4 inches (102 mm) and larger in diameter shall be 
pulled until the pipe is subjected to a tensile stress equal to or 
greater than the maximum thermal stress that would be produced by a 
temperature change of 100 deg.F (38 deg.C) or until the pipe is pulled 
from the fitting. If the pipe pulls from the fitting, the lowest value 
of the five test results or the manufacturer's rating, whichever is 
lower must be used in the design calculations for stress.
    (6) Each specimen that fails at the grips must be retested using new 
pipe.
    (7) Results obtained pertain only to the specific outside diameter, 
and material of the pipe tested, except that testing of a heavier wall 
pipe may be used to qualify pipe of the same material but with a lesser 
wall thickness.
    (c) A copy of each written procedure being used for joining plastic 
pipe must be available to the persons making and inspecting joints.
    (d) Pipe or fittings manufactured before July 1, 1980, may be used 
in accordance with procedures that the manufacturer certifies will 
produce a joint as strong as the pipe.

<R05>
Sec. 192.383  Excess flow valve customer notification.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section:
    Costs associated with installation means the costs directly 
connected with installing an excess flow valve, for example, costs of 
parts, labor, inventory and procurement. It does not include maintenance 
and replacement costs until such costs are incurred.
    Replaced service line means a natural gas service line where the 
fitting that connects the service line to the main is replaced or the 
piping connected to this fitting is replaced.
    Service line customer means the person who pays the gas bill, or 
where service has not yet been established, the person requesting 
service.
    (b) Which customers must receive notification. Notification is 
required on each newly installed service line or replaced service line 
that operates continuously throughout the year at a pressure not less 
than 68.9 kPa (10 psig) and that serves a single residence. On these 
lines an operator of a natural gas distribution system must notify the 
service line customer once in writing.
    (c) What to put in the written notice. (1) An explanation for the 
customer that an excess flow valve meeting the performance standards 
prescribed under Sec. 192.381 is available for the operator to install 
if the customer bears the costs associated with installation;
    (2) An explanation for the customer of the potential safety benefits 
that may be derived from installing an excess flow valve. The 
explanation must include that an excess flow valve is designed to shut 
off flow of natural gas automatically if the service line breaks;
    (3) A description of installation, maintenance, and replacement 
costs. The notice must explain that if the customer requests the 
operator to install an EFV, the customer bears all costs associated with 
installation, and what those costs are. The notice must alert the 
customer that the costs for maintaining and replacing an EFV may later 
be incurred, and what those costs will be, to the extent known.
    (d) When notification and installation must be made. (1) After 
February 3, 1999 an operator must notify each service line customer set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section:
    (i) On new service lines when the customer applies for service.
    (ii) On replaced service lines when the operator determines the 
service line will be replaced.
    (2) If a service line customer requests installation an operator 
must install the EFV at a mutually agreeable date.
    (e) What records are required. (1) An operator must make the 
following records available for inspection by the Administrator or a 
State agency participating under 49 U.S.C. 60105 or 60106:
    (i) A copy of the notice currently in use; and
    (ii) Evidence that notice has been sent to the service line 
customers set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, within the 
previous three years.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) When notification is not required. The notification requirements 
do not apply if the operator can demonstrate--
    (1) That the operator will voluntarily install an excess flow valve 
or that the state or local jurisdiction requires installation;
    (2) That excess flow valves meeting the performance standards in 
Sec. 192.381 are not available to the operator;
    (3) That the operator has prior experience with contaminants in the 
gas stream that could interfere with the operation of an excess flow 
valve, cause loss of service to a residence, or interfere with necessary 
operation or maintenance activities, such as blowing liquids from the 
line.
    (4) That an emergency or short time notice replacement situation 
made it impractical for the operator to notify a service line customer 
before replacing a service line. Examples of these situations would be 
where an operator has to replace a service line quickly because of--
    (i) Third party excavation damage;
    (ii) Grade 1 leaks as defined in the Appendix G-192-11 of the Gas 
Piping

[[Page 63]]

Sec. 192.459  External corrosion control: Examination of buried pipeline when exposed.

    Whenever an operator has knowledge that any portion of a buried 
pipeline is exposed, the exposed portion must be examined for evidence 
of external corrosion if the pipe is bare, or if the coating is 
deteriorated. If external corrosion requiring remedial action under 
Secs. 192.483 through 192.489 is found, the operator shall investigate 
circumferentially and longitudinally beyond the exposed portion (by 
visual examination, indirect method, or both) to determine whether 
additional corrosion requiring remedial action exists in the vicinity of 
the exposed portion.

insulating, applied for the purpose of external corrosion control must--
    (1) Be applied on a properly prepared surface;
    (2) Have sufficient adhesion to the metal surface to effectively 
resist underfilm migration of moisture;
    (3) Be sufficiently ductile to resist cracking;

soil stress; and
    (5) Have properties compatible with any supplemental cathodic 
protection.
    (b) Each external protective coating which is an electrically 
insulating type must also have low moisture absorption and high 
electrical resistance.

[[Page 65]]

    (c) Each external protective coating must be inspected just prior to 
lowering the pipe into the ditch and backfilling, and any damage 
detrimental to effective corrosion control must be repaired.
    (d) Each external protective coating must be protected from damage 
resulting from adverse ditch conditions or damage from supporting 
blocks.

the applicable criteria contained in appendix D of this part. If none of 
these criteria is applicable, the cathodic protection system must 
provide a level of cathodic protection at least equal to that provided 
by compliance with one or more of these criteria.
    (b) If amphoteric metals are included in a buried or submerged 
pipeline containing a metal of different anodic potential--
    (1) The amphoteric metals must be electrically isolated from the 
remainder of the pipeline and cathodically protected; or
    (2) The entire buried or submerged pipeline must be cathodically 
protected at a cathodic potential that meets the requirements of 
appendix D of this part for amphoteric metals.
    (c) The amount of cathodic protection must be controlled so as not 
to damage the protective coating or the pipe.

Sec. 192.465  External corrosion control: Monitoring.

    (a) Each pipeline that is under cathodic protection must be tested 
at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 
months, to determine whether the cathodic protection meets the 
requirements of Sec. 192.463. However, if tests at those intervals are 
impractical for separately protected short sections of mains or 
transmission lines, not in excess of 100 feet (30 meters), or separately 
protected service lines, these pipelines may be surveyed on a sampling 
basis. At least 10 percent of these protected structures, distributed 
over the entire system must be surveyed each calendar year, with a 
different 10 percent checked each subsequent year, so that the entire 
system is tested in each 10-year period.
    (b) Each cathodic protection rectifier or other impressed current 
power source must be inspected six times each calendar year, but with 
intervals not exceeding 2\1/2\ months, to insure that it is operating.
    (c) Each reverse current switch, each diode, and each interference 
bond whose failure would jeopardize structure protection must be 
electrically checked for proper performance six times each calendar 
year, but with intervals not exceeding 2\1/2\ months. Each other 
interference bond must be checked at least once each calendar year, but 
with intervals not exceeding 15 months.
    (d) Each operator shall take prompt remedial action to correct any 
deficiencies indicated by the monitoring.
    (e) After the initial evaluation required by paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of Sec. 192.455 and paragraph (b) of Sec. 192.457, each operator shall, 
at intervals not exceeding 3 years, reevaluate its unprotected pipelines 
and cathodically protect them in accordance with this subpart in areas 
in which active corrosion is found. The operator shall determine the 
areas of active corrosion by electrical survey, or where electrical 
survey is impractical, by the study of corrosion and leak history 
records, by leak detection survey, or by other means.

    (b) One or more insulating devices must be installed where 
electrical isolation of a portion of a pipeline is necessary to 
facilitate the application of corrosion control.
    (c) Except for unprotected copper inserted in ferrous pipe, each 
pipeline must be electrically isolated from metallic casings that are a 
part of the underground system. However, if isolation is not achieved 
because it is impractical, other measures must be taken to minimize 
corrosion of the pipeline inside the casing.
    (d) Inspection and electrical tests must be made to assure that 
electrical isolation is adequate.
    (e) An insulating device may not be installed in an area where a 
combustible atmosphere is anticipated unless precautions are taken to 
prevent arcing.
    (f) Where a pipeline is located in close proximity to electrical 
transmission tower footings, ground cables or counterpoise, or in other 
areas where fault currents or unusual risk of lightning may be 
anticipated, it must be provided with protection against damage due to 
fault currents or lightning, and protective measures must also be taken 
at insulating devices.

Sec. 192.515  Environmental protection and safety requirements.

    (a) In conducting tests under this subpart, each operator shall 
insure that every reasonable precaution is taken to protect its 
employees and the general public during the testing. Whenever the hoop 
stress of the segment of the pipeline being tested will exceed 50 
percent of SMYS, the operator shall take all practicable steps to keep 
persons not working on the testing operation outside of the testing area 
until the pressure is reduced to or below the proposed maximum allowable 
operating pressure.
    (b) The operator shall insure that the test medium is disposed of in 
a manner that will minimize damage to the environment.


<R05>
Sec. 192.517  Records.

    Each operator shall make, and retain for the useful life of the 
pipeline, a record of each test performed under Secs. 192.505 and 
192.507. The record must contain at least the following information:
    (a) The operator's name, the name of the operator's employee 
responsible for making the test, and the name of any test company used.
    (b) Test medium used.
    (c) Test pressure.
    (d) Test duration.

[[Page 71]]

    (e) Pressure recording charts, or other record of pressure readings.
    (f) Elevation variations, whenever significant for the particular 
test.
    (g) Leaks and failures noted and their disposition.

                           Subpart K--Uprating


<R05>
Sec. 192.551  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for increasing maximum 
allowable operating pressures (uprating) for pipelines.


<R05>
Sec. 192.553  General requirements.

    (a) Pressure increases. Whenever the requirements of this subpart 
require that an increase in operating pressure be made in increments, 
the pressure must be increased gradually, at a rate that can be 
controlled, and in accordance with the following:
    (1) At the end of each incremental increase, the pressure must be 
held constant while the entire segment of pipeline that is affected is 
checked for leaks.
    (2) Each leak detected must be repaired before a further pressure 
increase is made, except that a leak determined not to be potentially 
hazardous need not be repaired, if it is monitored during the pressure 
increase and it does not become potentially hazardous.
    (b) Records. Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall 
retain for the life of the segment a record of each investigation 
required by this subpart, of all work performed, and of each pressure 
test conducted, in connection with the uprating.
    (c) Written plan. Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline 
shall establish a written procedure that will ensure that each 
applicable requirement of this subpart is complied with.
    (d) Limitation on increase in maximum allowable operating pressure. 
Except as provided in Sec. 192.555(c), a new maximum allowable operating 
pressure established under this subpart may not exceed the maximum that 
would be allowed under this part for a new segment of pipeline 
constructed of the same materials in the same location. However, when 
uprating a steel pipeline, if any variable necessary to determine the 
design pressure under the design formula (Sec. 192.105) is unknown, the 
MAOP may be increased as provided in Sec. 192.619(a)(1).

<R05>
Sec. 192.555  Uprating to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of SMYS in steel pipelines.

    (a) Unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person 
may subject any segment of a steel pipeline to an operating pressure 
that will produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of SMYS and that 
is above the established maximum allowable operating pressure.
    (b) Before increasing operating pressure above the previously 
established maximum allowable operating pressure the operator shall:
    (1) Review the design, operating, and maintenance history and 
previous testing of the segment of pipeline and determine whether the 
proposed increase is safe and consistent with the requirements of this 
part; and
    (2) Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of 
pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased 
pressure.
    (c) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator 
may increase the maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of 
pipeline constructed before September 12, 1970, to the highest pressure 
that is permitted under Sec. 192.619, using as test pressure the highest 
pressure to which the segment of pipeline was previously subjected 
(either in a strength test or in actual operation).
    (d) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator 
that does not qualify under paragraph (c) of this section may increase 
the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure if at 
least one of the following requirements is met:
    (1) The segment of pipeline is successfully tested in accordance 
with the requirements of this part for a new line of the same material 
in the same location.
    (2) An increased maximum allowable operating pressure may be 
established for a segment of pipeline in a Class 1

[[Page 72]]

location if the line has not previously been tested, and if:
    (i) It is impractical to test it in accordance with the requirements 
of this part;
    (ii) The new maximum operating pressure does not exceed 80 percent 
of that allowed for a new line of the same design in the same location; 
and
    (iii) The operator determines that the new maximum allowable 
operating pressure is consistent with the condition of the segment of 
pipeline and the design requirements of this part.
    (e) Where a segment of pipeline is uprated in accordance with 
paragraph (c) or (d)(2) of this section, the increase in pressure must 
be made in increments that are equal to:
    (1) 10 percent of the pressure before the uprating; or
    (2) 25 percent of the total pressure increase,

whichever produces the fewer number of increments.


<R05>
Sec. 192.557  Uprating: Steel pipelines to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS: plastic, cast iron, and ductile iron 
          pipelines.

    (a) Unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person 
may subject:
    (1) A segment of steel pipeline to an operating pressure that will 
produce a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS and that is above the 
previously established maximum allowable operating pressure; or
    (2) A plastic, cast iron, or ductile iron pipeline segment to an 
operating pressure that is above the previously established maximum 
allowable operating pressure.
    (b) Before increasing operating pressure above the previously 
established maximum allowable operating pressure, the operator shall:
    (1) Review the design, operating, and maintenance history of the 
segment of pipeline;
    (2) Make a leakage survey (if it has been more than 1 year since the 
last survey) and repair any leaks that are found, except that a leak 
determined not to be potentially hazardous need not be repaired, if it 
is monitored during the pressure increase and it does not become 
potentially hazardous;
    (3) Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of 
pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased 
pressure;
    (4) Reinforce or anchor offsets, bends and dead ends in pipe joined 
by compression couplings or bell and spigot joints to prevent failure of 
the pipe joint, if the offset, bend, or dead end is exposed in an 
excavation;
    (5) Isolate the segment of pipeline in which the pressure is to be 
increased from any adjacent segment that will continue to be operated at 
a lower pressure; and
    (6) If the pressure in mains or service lines, or both, is to be 
higher than the pressure delivered to the customer, install a service 
regulator on each service line and test each regulator to determine that 
it is functioning. Pressure may be increased as necessary to test each 
regulator, after a regulator has been installed on each pipeline subject 
to the increased pressure.
    (c) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, the increase 
in maximum allowable operating pressure must be made in increments that 
are equal to 10 p.s.i. (69 kPa) gage or 25 percent of the total pressure 
increase, whichever produces the fewer number of increments. Whenever 
the requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section apply, there must 
be at least two approximately equal incremental increases.
    (d) If records for cast iron or ductile iron pipeline facilities are 
not complete enough to determine stresses produced by internal pressure, 
trench loading, rolling loads, beam stresses, and other bending loads, 
in evaluating the level of safety of the pipeline when operating at the 
proposed increased pressure, the following procedures must be followed:
    (1) In estimating the stresses, if the original laying conditions 
cannot be ascertained, the operator shall assume that cast iron pipe was 
supported on blocks with tamped backfill and that ductile iron pipe was 
laid without blocks with tamped backfill.
    (2) Unless the actual maximum cover depth is known, the operator 
shall measure the actual cover in at least

[[Page 73]]

three places where the cover is most likely to be greatest and shall use 
the greatest cover measured.
    (3) Unless the actual nominal wall thickness is known, the operator 
shall determine the wall thickness by cutting and measuring coupons from 
at least three separate pipe lengths. The coupons must be cut from pipe 
lengths in areas where the cover depth is most likely to be the 
greatest. The average of all measurements taken must be increased by the 
allowance indicated in the following table:

    (4) For cast iron pipe, unless the pipe manufacturing process is 
known, the operator shall assume that the pipe is pit cast pipe with a 
bursting tensile strength of 11,000 p.s.i. (76 MPa) gage and a modulus 
of rupture of 31,000 p.s.i. (214 MPa) gage.

Sec. 192.607  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 192.609  Change in class location: Required study.

    Whenever an increase in population density indicates a change in 
class location for a segment of an existing steel pipeline operating at 
hoop stress that is more than 40 percent of SMYS, or indicates that the 
hoop stress corresponding to the established maximum allowable operating 
pressure for a segment of existing pipeline is not commensurate with the 
present class location, the operator shall immediately make a study to 
determine:
    (a) The present class location for the segment involved.
    (b) The design, construction, and testing procedures followed in the 
original construction, and a comparison of these procedures with those 
required for the present class location by the applicable provisions of 
this part.
    (c) The physical condition of the segment to the extent it can be 
ascertained from available records;
    (d) The operating and maintenance history of the segment;
    (e) The maximum actual operating pressure and the corresponding 
operating hoop stress, taking pressure gradient into account, for the 
segment of pipeline involved; and
    (f) The actual area affected by the population density increase, and 
physical barriers or other factors which may limit further expansion of 
the more densely populated area.


<R05>
Sec. 192.611  Change in class location: Confirmation or revision of maximum allowable operating pressure.

    (a) If the hoop stress corresponding to the established maximum 
allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline is not 
commensurate with the present class location, and the segment is in 
satisfactory physical condition, the maximum allowable operating 
pressure of that segment of pipeline must be confirmed or revised 
according to one of the following requirements:
    (1) If the segment involved has been previously tested in place for 
a period of not less than 8 hours, the maximum allowable operating 
pressure is 0.8 times the test pressure in Class 2 locations, 0.667 
times the test pressure in Class 3 locations, or 0.555 times the test 
pressure in Class 4 locations. The corresponding hoop stress may not 
exceed 72 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations, 60 
percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 
locations.
    (2) The maximum allowable operating pressure of the segment involved 
must be reduced so that the corresponding hoop stress is not more than 
that allowed by this part for new segments of pipelines in the existing 
class location.
    (3) The segment involved must be tested in accordance with the 
applicable requirements of subpart J of this part, and its maximum 
allowable operating pressure must then be established according to the 
following criteria:
    (i) The maximum allowable operating pressure after the 
requalification test is 0.8 times the test pressure for Class 2 
locations, 0.667 times the test pressure for Class 3 locations, and 
0.555 times the test pressure for Class 4 locations.
    (ii) The corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 72 percent of the 
SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations, 60 percent of SMYS in Class 3 
locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 locations.
    (b) The maximum allowable operating pressure confirmed or revised in 
accordance with this section, may not exceed the maximum allowable 
operating pressure established before the confirmation or revision.
    (c) Confirmation or revision of the maximum allowable operating 
pressure of a segment of pipeline in accordance with this section does 
not preclude the application of Secs. 192.553 and 192.555.
    (d) Confirmation or revision of the maximum allowable operating 
pressure that is required as a result of a study under Sec. 192.609 must 
be completed within 18 months of the change in class location. Pressure 
reduction under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section within the 18-
month period does not preclude establishing a maximum allowable 
operating pressure under paragraph (a)(3) of this section at a later 
date.

Sec. 192.612  Underwater inspection and re-burial of pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets.

    (a) Each operator shall, in accordance with this section, conduct an 
underwater inspection of its pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its 
inlets. The inspection must be conducted after October 3, 1989 and 
before November 16, 1992.
    (b) If, as a result of an inspection under paragraph (a) of this 
section, or upon notification by any person, an operator discovers that 
a pipeline it operates is exposed on the seabed or constitutes a hazard 
to navigation, the operator shall--
    (1) Promptly, but not later than 24 hours after discovery, notify 
the National Response Center, telephone: 1-800-424-8802 of the location, 
and, if available, the geographic coordinates of that pipeline;
    (2) Promptly, but not later than 7 days after discovery, mark the 
location of the pipeline in accordance with 33 CFR part 64 at the ends 
of the pipeline segment and at intervals of not over 500 yards (457 
meters) long, except that a pipeline segment less than 200 yards (183 
meters) long need only be marked at the center; and
    (3) Within 6 months after discovery, or not later than November 1 of 
the following year if the 6 month period is later than November 1 of the 
year the discovery is made, place the pipeline so that the top of the 
pipe is 36 inches (914 millimeters) below the seabed for normal 
excavation or 18 inches (457 millimeters) for rock excavation.

<R05>
Sec. 192.613  Continuing surveillance.

    (a) Each operator shall have a procedure for continuing surveillance 
of its facilities to determine and take appropriate action concerning 
changes in class location, failures, leakage history, corrosion, 
substantial changes in cathodic protection requirements, and other 
unusual operating and maintenance conditions.
    (b) If a segment of pipeline is determined to be in unsatisfactory 
condition but no immediate hazard exists, the operator shall initiate a 
program to recondition or phase out the segment involved, or, if the 
segment cannot be reconditioned or phased out, reduce the maximum 
allowable operating pressure in accordance with Sec. 192.619 (a) and 
(b).


<R05>
Sec. 192.614  Damage prevention program.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, 
each operator of a buried pipeline must carry out, in accordance with 
this section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from 
excavation activities. For the purposes of this section, the term 
``excavation activities'' includes excavation, blasting, boring, 
tunneling, backfilling, the removal of aboveground structures by either 
explosive or mechanical means, and other earthmoving operations.
    (b) An operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section through participation in a public service program, 
such as a one-call system, but such participation does not relieve the 
operator of responsibility for compliance with this section. However, an 
operator must perform the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this section 
through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call system is a 
qualified one-call system. In areas that are covered by more than one 
qualified one-call system, an operator need only join one of the 
qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone number for 
excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call systems 
in those areas communicate with one another. An operator's pipeline 
system must be covered by a qualified one-call system where there is one 
in place. For the purpose of this section, a one-call system is 
considered a ``qualified one-call system'' if it meets the requirements 
of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) The state has adopted a one-call damage prevention program under 
Sec. 198.37 of this chapter; or
    (2) The one-call system:
    (i) Is operated in accordance with Sec. 198.39 of this chapter;
    (ii) Provides a pipeline operator an opportunity similar to a 
voluntary participant to have a part in management responsibilities; and
    (iii) Assesses a participating pipeline operator a fee that is 
proportionate to

[[Page 77]]

the costs of the one-call system's coverage of the operator's pipeline.
    (c) The damage prevention program required by paragraph (a) of this 
section must, at a minimum:
    (1) Include the identity, on a current basis, of persons who 
normally engage in excavation activities in the area in which the 
pipeline is located.
    (2) Provides for notification of the public in the vicinity of the 
pipeline and actual notification of the persons identified in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section of the following as often as needed to make them 
aware of the damage prevention program:
    (i) The program's existence and purpose; and
    (ii) How to learn the location of underground pipelines before 
excavation activities are begun.
    (3) Provide a means of receiving and recording notification of 
planned excavation activities.
    (4) If the operator has buried pipelines in the area of excavation 
activity, provide for actual notification of persons who give notice of

     I. Listed Pipe Specifications (Numbers in Parentheses Indicate 
                          Applicable Editions)

API 5L--Steel pipe (1995).
ASTM A 53--Steel pipe (1995a).
ASTM A 106--Steel pipe (1994a).
ASTM A 333/A 333M--Steel pipe (1994).

ASTM A 691--Steel pipe (1993).
ASTM D 2513--Thermoplastic pipe and tubing (1995c).
ASTM D 2517--Thermosetting plastic pipe and tubing (1994).

    II. Steel pipe of unknown or unlisted specification.
    A. Bending Properties. For pipe 2 inches (51 millimeters) or less in 
diameter, a length of pipe must be cold bent through at least 90 degrees 
around a cylindrical mandrel that has a diameter 12 times the diameter 
of the pipe, without developing cracks at any portion and without 
opening the longitudinal weld.
    For pipe more than 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter, the pipe 
must meet the requirements of the flattening tests set forth in ASTM 
A53, except that the number of tests must be at least equal to the 
minimum required in paragraph II-D of this appendix to determine yield 
strength.
    B. Weldability. A girth weld must be made in the pipe by a welder 
who is qualified under subpart E of this part. The weld must be made 
under the most severe conditions under which welding will be allowed in 
the field and by means of the same procedure that will be used in the 
field. On pipe more than 4 inches (102 millimeters) in diameter, at 
least one test weld must be made for each 100 lengths of pipe. On pipe 4 
inches (102 millimeters) or less in diameter, at least one test weld 
must be made for each 400 lengths of pipe. The weld must be tested in 
accordance with API Standard 1104. If the requirements of API Standard 
1104 cannot be met, weldability may be established by making chemical 
tests for carbon and manganese, and proceeding in accordance with 
section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The same number 
of chemical tests

[[Page 90]]

must be made as are required for testing a girth weld.
    C. Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate 
inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is 
reasonably round and straight and there are no defects which might 
impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.
    D. Tensile Properties. If the tensile properties of the pipe are not 
known, the minimum yield strength may be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165 
MPa) or less, or the tensile properties may be established by performing 
tensile tests as set forth in API Specification 5L. All test specimens 
shall be selected at random and the following number of tests must be 
performed:

                   Number of Tensile Tests--All Sizes
 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
10 lengths or less........................  1 set of tests for each
                                             length.
11 to 100 lengths.........................  1 set of tests for each 5
                                             lengths, but not less than
                                             10 tests.
Over 100 lengths..........................  1 set of tests for each 10
                                             lengths, but not less than
                                             20 tests.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the yield-tensile ratio, based on the properties determined by those 
tests, exceeds 0.85, the pipe may be used only as provided in 
Sec. 192.55(c).
    III. Steel pipe manufactured before November 12, 1970, to earlier 
editions of listed specifications. Steel pipe manufactured before 
November 12, 1970, in accordance with a specification of which a later 
edition is listed in section I of this appendix, is qualified for use 
under this part if the following requirements are met:
    A. Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate 
inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is 
reasonably round and straight and that there are no defects which might 
impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.
    B. Similarity of specification requirements. The edition of the 
listed specification under which the pipe was manufactured must have 
substantially the same requirements with respect to the following 
properties as a later edition of that specification listed in section I 
of this appendix:
    (1) Physical (mechanical) properties of pipe, including yield and 
tensile strength, elongation, and yield to tensile ratio, and testing 
requirements to verify those properties.
    (2) Chemical properties of pipe and testing requirements to verify 
those properties.
    C. Inspection or test of welded pipe. On pipe with welded seams, one 
of the following requirements must be met:
    (1) The edition of the listed specification to which the pipe was 
manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with respect 
to nondestructive inspection of welded seams and the standards for 
acceptance or rejection and repair as a later edition of the 
specification listed in section I of this appendix.
    (2) The pipe must be tested in accordance with subpart J of this 
part to at least 1.25 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if 
it is to be installed in a class 1 location and to at least 1.5 times 
the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a 
class 2, 3, or 4 location. Notwithstanding any shorter time period 
permitted under subpart J of this part, the test pressure must be 
maintained for at least 8 hours.

of part 192, see the List of CFR Sections Affected in the Finding Aids 
section of this volume.

 Appendix C to Part 192--Qualification of Welders for Low Stress Level 
                                  Pipe

    I. Basic test. The test is made on pipe 12 inches (305 millimeters) 
or less in diameter. The test weld must be made with the pipe in a 
horizontal fixed position so that the test weld includes at least one 
section of overhead position welding. The beveling, root opening, and 
other details must conform to the specifications of the procedure under 
which the welder is being qualified. Upon completion, the test weld is 
cut into four coupons and subjected to a root bend test. If, as a result 
of this test, two or more of the four coupons develop a crack in the 
weld material, or between the weld material and base metal, that is more 
than \1/8\-inch (3.2 millimeters) long in any direction, the weld is 
unacceptable. Cracks that occur on the corner of the specimen during 
testing are not considered.
    II. Additional tests for welders of service line connections to 
mains. A service line connection fitting is welded to a pipe section 
with the same diameter as a typical main. The weld is made in the same 
position as it is made in the field. The weld is unacceptable if it 
shows a serious undercutting or if it has rolled edges. The weld is 
tested by attempting to break the fitting off the run pipe. The weld is 
unacceptable if it breaks and shows incomplete fusion, overlap, or poor 
penetration at the junction of the fitting and run pipe.
    III. Periodic tests for welders of small service lines. Two samples 
of the welder's work, each about 8 inches (203 millimeters) long with 
the weld located approximately in the center, are cut from steel service 
line and tested as follows:
    (1) One sample is centered in a guided bend testing machine and bent 
to the contour of

[[Page 91]]

the die for a distance of 2 inches (51 millimeters) on each side of the 
weld. If the sample shows any breaks or cracks after removal from the 
bending machine, it is unacceptable.
    (2) The ends of the second sample are flattened and the entire joint 
subjected to a tensile strength test. If failure occurs adjacent to or 
in the weld metal, the weld is unacceptable. If a tensile strength 
testing machine is not available, this sample must also pass the bending 
test prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

      Appendix D to Part 192--Criteria for Cathodic Protection and 
                      Determination of Measurements

    I. Criteria for cathodic protection-- A. Steel, cast iron, and 
ductile iron structures. (1) A negative (cathodic) voltage of at least 
0.85 volt, with reference to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half 
cell. Determination of this voltage must be made with the protective 
current applied, and in accordance with sections II and IV of this 
appendix.
    (2) A negative (cathodic) voltage shift of at least 300 millivolts. 
Determination of this voltage shift must be made with the protective 
current applied, and in accordance with sections II and IV of this 
appendix. This criterion of voltage shift applies to structures not in 
contact with metals of different anodic potentials.
    (3) A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 
millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in 
accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
    (4) A voltage at least as negative (cathodic) as that originally 
established at the beginning of the Tafel segment of the E-log-I curve. 
This voltage must be measured in accordance with section IV of this 
appendix.
    (5) A net protective current from the electrolyte into the structure 
surface as measured by an earth current technique applied at 
predetermined current discharge (anodic) points of the structure.
    B. Aluminum structures. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of this paragraph, a minimum negative (cathodic) voltage shift of 
150 millivolts, produced by the application of protective current. The 
voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections II and IV 
of this appendix.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, 
a minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 
millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in 
accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
    (3) Notwithstanding the alternative minimum criteria in paragraphs 
(1) and (2) of this paragraph, aluminum, if cathodically protected at 
voltages in excess of 1.20 volts as measured with reference to a copper-
copper sulfate half cell, in accordance with section IV of this 
appendix, and compensated for the voltage (IR) drops other than those 
across the structure-electrolyte boundary may suffer corrosion resulting 
from the build-up of alkali on the metal surface. A voltage in excess of 
1.20 volts may not be used unless previous test results indicate no 
appreciable corrosion will occur in the particular environment.
    (4) Since aluminum may suffer from corrosion under high pH 
conditions, and since application of cathodic protection tends to 
increase the pH at the metal surface, careful investigation or testing 
must be made before applying cathodic protection to stop pitting attack 
on aluminum structures in environments with a natural pH in excess of 8.
    C. Copper structures. A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization 
voltage shift of 100 millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be 
determined in accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
    D. Metals of different anodic potentials. A negative (cathodic) 
voltage, measured in accordance with section IV of this appendix, equal 
to that required for the most anodic metal in the system must be 
maintained. If amphoteric structures are involved that could be damaged 
by high alkalinity covered by paragraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph B of 
this section, they must be electrically isolated with insulating 
flanges, or the equivalent.
    II. Interpretation of voltage measurement. Voltage (IR) drops other 
than those across the structure-electrolyte boundary must be considered 
for valid interpretation of the voltage measurement in paragraphs A(1) 
and (2) and paragraph B(1) of section I of this appendix.
    III. Determination of polarization voltage shift. The polarization 
voltage shift must be determined by interrupting the protective current 
and measuring the polarization decay. When the current is initially 
interrupted, an immediate voltage shift occurs. The voltage reading 
after the immediate shift must be used as the base reading from which to 
measure polarization decay in paragraphs A(3), B(2), and C of section I 
of this appendix.
    IV. Reference half cells. A. Except as provided in paragraphs B and 
C of this section, negative (cathodic) voltage must be measured between 
the structure surface and a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell 
contacting the electrolyte.
    B. Other standard reference half cells may be substituted for the 
saturated cooper-copper sulfate half cell. Two commonly used reference 
half cells are listed below along with

[[Page 92]]

their voltage equivalent to -0.85 volt as referred to a saturated 
copper-copper sulfate half cell:
    (1) Saturated KCl calomel half cell: -0.78 volt.
    (2) Silver-silver chloride half cell used in sea water: -0.80 volt.
    C. In addition to the standard reference half cells, an alternate 
metallic material or structure may be used in place of the saturated 
copper-copper sulfate half cell if its potential stability is assured 
and if its voltage equivalent referred to a saturated copper-copper 
sulfate half cell is established.

    This part contains requirements for oil spill response plans to 
reduce the environmental impact of oil discharged from onshore oil 
pipelines.


<R05>
Sec. 194.3  Applicability.

    This part applies to an operator of an onshore oil pipeline that, 
because of its location, could reasonably be expected to cause 
substantial harm, or significant and substantial harm to the environment 
by discharging oil into or on any navigable waters of the United States 
or adjoining shorelines.


<R05>
Sec. 194.5  Definitions.

    Adverse weather means the weather conditions considered by the 
operator in identifying the response systems and equipment to be 
deployed in accordance with a response plan, including wave height, ice, 
temperature, visibility, and currents within the inland or Coastal 
Response Zone (defined in the National Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 
300)) in which those systems or equipment are intended to function.

United States waters of the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain, specified 
ports and harbors on inland rivers, waters of the contiguous zone, other 
waters of the high seas subject to the National Contingency Plan, and 
the land surface or land substrate, ground waters, and ambient air 
proximal to those waters. (The term ``coastal zone'' delineates an area 
of federal responsibility for response action. Precise boundaries are 
determined by agreements between the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), and are identified in Federal 
Regional Contingency Plans and Area Contingency Plans.)
    Contract or other approved means is:
    (1) A written contract or other legally binding agreement between

importance which is in or adjacent to navigable waters.
    High volume area means an area which an oil pipeline having a 
nominal outside diameter of 20 inches (508 millimeters) or more crosses 
a major river or other navigable waters, which, because of the velocity 
of the river flow and vessel traffic on the river, would require a more 
rapid response in case of a worst case discharge or substantial threat 
of such a discharge. Appendix B to this part contains a list of some of 
the high volume areas in the United States.
    Inland area means the area shoreward of the boundary lines defined 
in 46 CFR part 7, except that in the Gulf of Mexico, it means the area

    Inland zone means the environment inland of the coastal zone 
excluding the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, and specified ports and 
harbors on inland rivers. (The term inland zone delineates an area of 
federal responsibilities for response actions. Precise boundaries are 
determined by agreements between the EPA and the USCG and are identified 
in Federal Regional Contingency Plans.)
    Line section means a continuous run of pipe that is contained 
between adjacent pressure pump stations, between a

[[Page 112]]

pressure pump station and a terminal or breakout tank, between a 
pressure pump station and a block valve, or between adjacent block 
valves.

to conduct response activities for a worst case discharge from a 
pipeline in adverse weather.
    Navigable waters means the waters of the United States, including 
the territorial sea and such waters as lakes, rivers, streams; waters 
which are used for recreation; and waters from which fish or shellfish 
are taken and sold in interstate or foreign commerce.
    Oil means oil of any kind or in any form, including, but not limited 
to, petroleum, fuel oil, vegetable oil, animal oil, sludge, oil refuse, 
oil mixed with wastes other than dredged spoil.
    Oil spill removal organization means an entity that provides 
response resources.
    On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) means the federal official designated by 
the Administrator of the EPA or by the Commandant of the USCG to 
coordinate and direct federal response under subpart D of the National 
Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300).
    Onshore oil pipeline facilities means new and existing pipe, rights-
of-way and any equipment, facility, or building used in the 
transportation of oil located in, on, or under, any land within the 
United States other than submerged land.
    Operator means a person who owns or operates onshore oil pipeline 
facilities.
    Pipeline means all parts of an onshore pipeline facility through 
which oil moves including, but not limited to, line pipe, valves, and 
other appurtenances connected to line pipe, pumping units, fabricated 
assemblies associated with pumping units, metering and delivery stations 
and fabricated assemblies therein, and breakout tanks.
    Qualified individual means an English-speaking representative of an 
operator, located in the United States, available on a 24-hour basis, 
with full authority to: activate and contract with required oil spill 
removal organization(s); activate personnel and equipment maintained by 
the operator; act as liaison with the OSC; and obligate any funds 
required to carry out all required or directed oil response activities.
    Response activities means the containment and removal of oil from 
the water and shorelines, the temporary storage and disposal of 
recovered oil, or the taking of other actions as necessary to minimize 
or mitigate damage to the environment.
    Response area means the inland zone or coastal zone, as defined in 
the National Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300), in which the response 
activity is occurring.
    Response plan means the operator's core plan and the response zone 
appendices for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worse 
case discharge of oil, or the substantial threat of such a discharge.
    Response resources means the personnel, equipment, supplies, and 
other resources necessary to conduct response activities.
    Response zone means a geographic area either along a length of 
pipeline or including multiple pipelines, containing one or more 
adjacent line sections, for which the operator must plan for the 
deployment of, and provide, spill response capabilities. The size of the 
zone is determined by the operator after considering available 
capability, resources, and geographic characteristics.
    Specified minimum yield strength means the minimum yield strength, 
expressed in pounds per square inch, prescribed by the specification 
under which the material is purchased from the manufacturer.
    Stress level means the level of tangential or hoop stress, usually 
expressed as a percentage of specified minimum yield strength.

[[Page 113]]

    Worst case discharge means the largest foreseeable discharge of oil, 
including a discharge from fire or explosion, in adverse weather 
conditions. This volume will be determined by each pipeline operator for 
each response zone and is calculated according to Sec. 194.105.

[58 FR 253, Jan. 5, 1993, as amended by Amdt. 194-3, 63 FR 37505, July 
13, 1998]

substantial harm to the environment in the event of a discharge of oil 
into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines.
    (b) If an operator expects a line section in a response zone to 
cause significant and substantial harm, then the entire response zone 
must, for the purpose of response plan review and approval, be treated 
as if it is expected to

[[Page 114]]

cause significant and substantial harm. However, an operator will not 
have to submit separate plans for each line section.

    (A) Does not transport HVL;
    (B) Is located in a rural area; and
    (C) Is located outside a waterway currently used for commercial 
navigation;
    (ii) A pipeline subject to safety regulations of the U.S. Coast 
Guard; or
    (iii) A pipeline that serves refining, manufacturing, or truck, 
rail, or vessel terminal facilities, if the pipeline is less than 1 mile 
long (measured outside facility grounds) and does not cross an offshore 
area or a waterway currently used for commercial navigation;

[[Page 122]]

    (4) Transportation of petroleum in onshore gathering lines in rural 
areas except gathering lines in the inlets of the Gulf of Mexico subject 
to Sec. 195.413;
    (5) Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in offshore 
pipelines which are located upstream from the outlet flange of each 
facility where hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide are produced or where 
produced hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide are first separated, dehydrated, 
or otherwise processed, whichever facility is farther downstream;
    (6) Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in Outer 
Continental Shelf pipelines which are located upstream of the point at 
which operating responsibility transfers from a producing operator to a 
transporting operator.
    (7) Transportation of a hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide through 
onshore production (including flow lines), refining, or manufacturing 
facilities, or storage or in-plant piping systems associated with such 
facilities;
    (8) Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide--
    (i) By vessel, aircraft, tank truck, tank car, or other non-pipeline 
mode of transportation; or
    (ii) Through facilities located on the grounds of a materials 
transportation terminal that are used exclusively to transfer hazardous 
liquid or carbon dioxide between non-pipeline modes of transportation or 
between a non-pipeline mode and a pipeline, not including any device and 
associated piping that are necessary to control pressure in the pipeline 
under Sec. 195.406(b); and
    (9) Transportation of carbon dioxide downstream from the following 
point, as applicable:

manifolds from which pipelines branch to injection wells.
    (c) Breakout tanks subject to this part must comply with 
requirements that apply specifically to breakout tanks and, to the 
extent applicable, with requirements that apply to pipeline systems and 
pipeline facilities. If a conflict exists between a requirement that 
applies specifically to breakout tanks and a requirement that applies to 
pipeline systems or pipeline facilities, the requirement that applies 
specifically to breakout tanks prevails. Anhydrous ammonia breakout 
tanks need not comply with Secs. 195.132(b), 195.205(b), 195.242 (c) and 
(d), 195.264 (b) and (e), 195.307, 195.428 (c) and (d), and 195.432 (b)

Sec. 195.5  Conversion to service subject to this part.

    (a) A steel pipeline previously used in service not subject to this 
part qualifies for use under this part if the operator prepares and 
follows a written procedure to accomplish the following:
    (1) The design, construction, operation, and maintenance history of 
the pipeline must be reviewed and, where sufficient historical records 
are not available, appropriate tests must be performed to determine if 
the pipeline is in satisfactory condition for safe operation. If one or 
more of the variables necessary to verify the design pressure under 
Sec. 195.106 or to perform the testing under paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section is unknown, the design pressure may be verified and the maximum 
operating pressure determined by--
    (i) Testing the pipeline in accordance with ASME B31.8, Appendix N, 
to produce a stress equal to the yield strength; and
    (ii) Applying, to not more than 80 percent of the first pressure 
that produces a yielding, the design factor F in Sec. 195.106(a) and the 
appropriate factors in Sec. 195.106(e).
    (2) The pipeline right-of-way, all aboveground segments of the 
pipeline, and appropriately selected underground segments must be 
visually inspected for physical defects and operating conditions which 
reasonably could be expected to impair the strength or tightness of the 
pipeline.
    (3) All known unsafe defects and conditions must be corrected in 
accordance with this part.
    (4) The pipeline must be tested in accordance with subpart E of this 
part to substantiate the maximum operating pressure permitted by 
Sec. 195.406.
    (b) A pipeline which qualifies for use under this section need not 
comply with the corrosion control requirements of this part until 12 
months

[[Page 127]]

after it is placed in service, notwithstanding any earlier deadlines for 
compliance. In addition to the requirements of subpart F of this part, 
the corrosion control requirements of subpart D apply to each pipeline 
which substantially meets those requirements before it is placed in 
service or which is a segment that is replaced, relocated, or 
substantially altered.
    (c) Each operator must keep for the life of the pipeline a record of 
the investigations, tests, repairs, replacements, and alterations made 
under the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 195.6  Unusually Sensitive Areas (USAs).

    As used in this part, a USA means a drinking water or ecological 
resource area that is unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a 
hazardous liquid pipeline release.
    (a) An USA drinking water resource is:
    (1) The water intake for a Community Water System (CWS) or a Non-
transient Non-community Water System (NTNCWS) that obtains its water 
supply primarily from a surface water source and does not have an 
adequate alternative drinking water source;
    (2) The Source Water Protection Area (SWPA) for a CWS or a NTNCWS 
that obtains its water supply from a Class I or Class IIA aquifer and 
does not have an adequate alternative drinking water source. Where a 
state has not yet identified the SWPA, the Wellhead Protection Area 
(WHPA) will be used until the state has identified the SWPA; or
    (3) The sole source aquifer recharge area where the sole source 
aquifer is a karst aquifer in nature.
    (b) An USA ecological resource is:
    (1) An area containing a critically imperiled species or ecological 
community;
    (2) A multi-species assemblage area;
    (3) A migratory waterbird concentration area;
    (4) An area containing an imperiled species, threatened or 
endangered species, depleted marine mammal species, or an imperiled 
ecological community where the species or community is aquatic, aquatic 
dependent, or terrestrial with a limited range; or
    (5) An area containing an imperiled species, threatened or 
endangered species, depleted marine mammal species, or imperiled 
ecological community where the species or community occurrence is 
considered to be one of the most viable, highest quality, or in the best 
condition, as identified by an element occurrence ranking (EORANK) of A 
(excellent quality) or B (good quality).
    (c) As used in this part--
    Adequate Alternative Drinking Water Source means a source of water 
that currently exists, can be used almost immediately with a minimal 
amount of effort and cost, involves no decline in water quality, and 
will meet the consumptive, hygiene, and fire fighting requirements of 
the existing population of impacted customers for at least one month for 
a surface water source of water and at least six months for a 
groundwater source.
    Aquatic or Aquatic Dependent Species or Community means a species or 
community that primarily occurs in aquatic, marine, or wetland habitats, 
as well as species that may use terrestrial habitats during all or some 
portion of their life cycle, but that are still closely associated with 
or dependent upon aquatic, marine, or wetland habitats for some critical 
component or portion of their life-history (i.e., reproduction, rearing 
and development, feeding, etc).
    Class I Aquifer means an aquifer that is surficial or shallow, 
permeable, and is highly vulnerable to contamination. Class I aquifers 
include:
    (1) Unconsolidated Aquifers (Class Ia) that consist of surficial, 
unconsolidated, and permeable alluvial, terrace, outwash, beach, dune 
and other similar deposits. These aquifers generally contain layers of 
sand and gravel that, commonly, are interbedded to some degree with silt 
and clay. Not all Class Ia aquifers are important water-bearing units, 
but they are likely to be both permeable and vulnerable. The only 
natural protection of these aquifers is the thickness of the unsaturated 
zone and the presence of fine-grained material;

[[Page 128]]

    (2) Soluble and Fractured Bedrock Aquifers (Class Ib). Lithologies 
in this class include limestone, dolomite, and, locally, evaporitic 
units that contain documented karst features or solution channels, 
regardless of size. Generally these aquifers have a wide range of 
permeability. Also included in this class are sedimentary strata, and 
metamorphic and igneous (intrusive and extrusive) rocks that are 
significantly faulted, fractured, or jointed. In all cases groundwater 
movement is largely controlled by secondary openings. Well yields range 
widely, but the important feature is the potential for rapid vertical 
and lateral ground water movement along preferred pathways, which result 
in a high degree of vulnerability;
    (3) Semiconsolidated Aquifers (Class Ic) that generally contain 
poorly to moderately indurated sand and gravel that is interbedded with 
clay and silt. This group is intermediate to the unconsolidated and 
consolidated end members. These systems are common in the Tertiary age 
rocks that are exposed throughout the Gulf and Atlantic coastal states. 
Semiconsolidated conditions also arise from the presence of intercalated 
clay and caliche within primarily unconsolidated to poorly consolidated 
units, such as occurs in parts of the High Plains Aquifer; or
    (4) Covered Aquifers (Class Id) that are any Class I aquifer 
overlain by less than 50 feet of low permeability, unconsolidated 
material, such as glacial till, lacustrian, and loess deposits.
    Class IIa aquifer means a Higher Yield Bedrock Aquifer that is 
consolidated and is moderately vulnerable to contamination. These 
aquifers generally consist of fairly permeable sandstone or conglomerate 
that contain lesser amounts of interbedded fine grained clastics (shale, 
siltstone, mudstone) and occasionally carbonate units. In general, well 
yields must exceed 50 gallons per minute to be included in this class. 
Local fracturing may contribute to the dominant primary porosity and 
permeability of these systems.
    Community Water System (CWS) means a public water system that serves 
at least 15 service connections used by year-round residents of the area 
or regularly serves at least 25 year-round residents.
    Critically imperiled species or ecological community (habitat) means 
an animal or plant species or an ecological community of extreme rarity, 
based on The Nature Conservancy's Global Conservation Status Rank. There 
are generally 5 or fewer occurrences, or very few remaining individuals 
(less than 1,000) or acres (less than 2,000). These species and 
ecological communities are extremely vulnerable to extinction due to 
some natural or man-made factor.
    Depleted marine mammal species means a species that has been 
identified and is protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 
1972, as amended (MMPA) (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.). The term ``depleted'' 
refers to marine mammal species that are listed as threatened or 
endangered, or are below their optimum sustainable populations (16 
U.S.C. 1362). The term ``marine mammal'' means ``any mammal which is 
morphologically adapted to the marine environment (including sea otters 
and members of the orders Sirenia, Pinnipedia, and Cetacea), or 
primarily inhabits the marine environment (such as the polar bear)'' (16 
U.S.C. 1362). The order Sirenia includes manatees, the order Pinnipedia 
includes seals, sea lions, and walruses, and the order Cetacea includes 
dolphins, porpoises, and whales.
    Ecological community means an interacting assemblage of plants and 
animals that recur under similar environmental conditions across the 
landscape.
    Element occurrence rank (EORANK) means the condition or viability of 
a species or ecological community occurrence, based on a population's 
size, condition, and landscape context. EORANKs are assigned by the 
Natural Heritage Programs. An EORANK of A means an excellent quality and 
an EORANK of B means good quality.
    Imperiled species or ecological community (habitat) means a rare 
species or ecological community, based on The Nature Conservancy's 
Global Conservation Status Rank. There are generally 6 to 20 
occurrences, or few remaining individuals (1,000 to 3,000) or acres 
(2,000 to 10,000). These species and ecological communities are 
vulnerable to

[[Page 129]]

extinction due to some natural or man-made factor.
    Karst aquifer means an aquifer that is composed of limestone or 
dolomite where the porosity is derived from connected solution cavities. 
Karst aquifers are often cavernous with high rates of flow.
    Migratory waterbird concentration area means a designated Ramsar 
site or a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site.
    Multi-species assemblage area means an area where three or more 
different critically imperiled or imperiled species or ecological 
communities, threatened or endangered species, depleted marine mammals, 
or migratory waterbird concentrations co-occur.
    Non-transient Non-community Water System (NTNCWS) means a public 
water system that regularly serves at least 25 of the same persons over 
six months per year. Examples of these systems include schools, 
factories, and hospitals that have their own water supplies.
    Public Water System (PWS) means a system that provides the public 
water for human consumption through pipes or other constructed 
conveyances, if such system has at least 15 service connections or 
regularly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily at least 60 
days out of the year. These systems include the sources of the water 
supplies--i.e., surface or ground. PWS can be community, non-transient 
non-community, or transient non-community systems.
    Ramsar site means a site that has been designated under The 
Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as 
Waterfowl Habitat program. Ramsar sites are globally critical wetland 
areas that support migratory waterfowl. These include wetland areas that 
regularly support 20,000 waterfowl; wetland areas that regularly support 
substantial numbers of individuals from particular groups of waterfowl, 
indicative of wetland values, productivity, or diversity; and wetland 
areas that regularly support 1% of the individuals in a population of 
one species or subspecies of waterfowl.
    Sole source aquifer (SSA) means an area designated by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency under the Sole Source Aquifer program as 
the ``sole or principal'' source of drinking water for an area. Such 
designations are made if the aquifer's ground water supplies 50% or more 
of the drinking water for an area, and if that aquifer were to become 
contaminated, it would pose a public health hazard. A sole source 
aquifer that is karst in nature is one composed of limestone where the 
porosity is derived from connected solution cavities. They are often 
cavernous, with high rates of flow.
    Source Water Protection Area (SWPA) means the area delineated by the 
state for a public water supply system (PWS) or including numerous PWSs, 
whether the source is ground water or surface water or both, as part of 
the state source water assessment program (SWAP) approved by EPA under 
section 1453 of the Safe Drinking Water Act.
    Species means species, subspecies, population stocks, or distinct 
vertebrate populations.
    Terrestrial ecological community with a limited range means a non-
aquatic or non-aquatic dependent ecological community that covers less 
than five (5) acres.
    Terrestrial species with a limited range means a non-aquatic or non-
aquatic dependent animal or plant species that has a range of no more 
than five (5) acres.
    Threatened and endangered species (T&E) means an animal or plant 
species that has been listed and is protected under the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA73) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). 
``Endangered species'' is defined as ``any species which is in danger of 
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range'' (16 
U.S.C. 1532). ``Threatened species'' is defined as ``any species which 
is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future 
throughout all or a significant portion of its range'' (16 U.S.C. 1532).
    Transient Non-community Water System (TNCWS) means a public water 
system that does not regularly serve at least 25 of the same persons 
over six months per year. This type of water system serves a transient 
population found at rest stops, campgrounds, restaurants, and parks with 
their own source of water.

[[Page 130]]

    Wellhead Protection Area (WHPA) means the surface and subsurface 
area surrounding a well or well field that supplies a public water 
system through which contaminants are likely to pass and eventually 
reach the water well or well field.
    Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) site means an 
area that contains migratory shorebird concentrations and has been 
designated as a hemispheric reserve, international reserve, regional 
reserve, or endangered species reserve. Hemispheric reserves host at 
least 500,000 shorebirds annually or 30% of a species flyway population. 
International reserves host 100,000 shorebirds annually or 15% of a 
species flyway population. Regional reserves host 20,000 shorebirds 
annually or 5% of a species flyway population. Endangered species 
reserves are critical to the survival of endangered species and no 
minimum number of birds is required.

Sec. 195.8  Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in pipelines constructed with other than steel pipe.

    No person may transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide 
through a pipe that is constructed after October 1, 1970, for hazardous 
liquids or after July 12, 1991 for carbon dioxide of material other than 
steel unless the person has notified the Administrator in writing at 
least 90 days before the transportation is to begin. The notice must 
state whether carbon dioxide or a hazardous liquid is to be transported 
and the chemical name, common name, properties and characteristics of 
the hazardous liquid to be transported and the material used in 
construction of the pipeline. If the Administrator determines that the 
transportation of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the manner 
proposed would be unduly hazardous, he will, within 90 days after 
receipt of the notice, order the person that gave the notice, in 
writing, not to transport the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the 
proposed manner until further notice.

Sec. 195.9  Outer continental shelf pipelines.

    Operators of transportation pipelines on the Outer Continental Shelf 
must identify on all their respective pipelines the specific points at 
which operating responsibility transfers to a producing operator. For 
those instances in which the transfer points are not identifiable by a 
durable marking, each operator will have until September 15, 1998 to 
identify the transfer points. If it is not practicable to durably mark a 
transfer point and the transfer point is located above water, the 
operator must depict the transfer point on a schematic maintained near 
the transfer point. If a transfer point is located subsea, the operator 
must identify the transfer point on a schematic which must be maintained 
at the nearest upstream facility and provided to RSPA upon request. For 
those cases in which adjoining operators have not agreed on a transfer 
point by September 15, 1998 the Regional Director and the MMS Regional 
Supervisor will make a joint determination of the transfer point.

                     Subpart C--Design Requirements


<R05>
Sec. 195.100  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes minimum design requirements for new pipeline 
systems constructed with steel pipe and for relocating, replacing, or 
otherwise changing existing systems constructed with steel pipe. 
However, it does not apply to the movement of line pipe covered by 
Sec. 195.424.

<R05>
Sec. 195.104  Variations in pressure.

    If, within a pipeline system, two or more components are to be 
connected at a place where one will operate at a higher pressure than 
another, the system must be designed so that any component operating at 
the lower pressure will not be overstressed.


<R05>
Sec. 195.106  Internal design pressure.

    (a) Internal design pressure for the pipe in a pipeline is 
determined in accordance with the following formula:

[[Page 135]]

                           P=(2 St/D) x E x F

    P=Internal design pressure in p.s.i. (kPa) gage.
    S=Yield strength in pounds per square inch (kPa) determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
    t=Nominal wall thickness of the pipe in inches (millimeters). If 
this is unknown, it is determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    D=Nominal outside diameter of the pipe in inches (millimeters).
    E=Seam joint factor determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    F=A design factor of 0.72, except that a design factor of 0.60 is 
used for pipe, including risers, on a platform located offshore or on a 
platform in inland navigable waters, and 0.54 is used for pipe that has 
been subjected to cold expansion to meet the specified minimum yield 
strength and is subsequently heated, other than by welding or stress 
relieving as a part of welding, to a temperature higher than 900 deg. F 
(482 deg. C) for any period of time or over 600 deg. F (316 deg. C) for 
more than 1 hour.

    (b) The yield strength to be used in determining the internal design 
pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is the specified minimum 
yield strength. If the specified minimum yield strength is not known, 
the yield strength to be used in the design formula is one of the 
following:
    (1)(i) The yield strength determined by performing all of the 
tensile tests of API Specification 5L on randomly selected specimens 
with the following number of tests:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Pipe size                          No. of tests
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Less than 6\5/8\ in (168 mm) nominal        One test for each 200
 outside diameter.                           lengths.
6 \5/8\ in through 12\3/4\ in (168 mm       One test for each 100
 through 324 mm) nominal outside diameter.   lengths.
Larger than 12\3/4\ in (324 mm) nominal     One test for each 50
 outside diameter.                           lengths.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) If the average yield-tensile ratio exceeds 0.85, the yield 
strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165,474 kPa). If the average 
yield-tensile ratio is 0.85 or less, the yield strength of the pipe is 
taken as the lower of the following:
    (A) Eighty percent of the average yield strength determined by the 
tensile tests.
    (B) The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests.
    (2) If the pipe is not tensile tested as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section, the yield strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. 
(165,474 kPa).
    (c) If the nominal wall thickness to be used in determining internal 
design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is not known, it is 
determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter 
points on one end. However, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and 
thickness, only 10 individual lengths or 5 percent of all lengths, 
whichever is greater, need be measured. The thickness of the lengths 
that are not measured must be verified by applying a gage set to the 
minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal wall thickness 
to be used is the next wall thickness found in commercial specifications 
that is below the average of all the measurements taken. However, the 
nominal wall thickness may not be more than 1.14 times the smallest 
measurement taken on pipe that is less than 20 inches (508 mm) nominal 
outside diameter, nor more than 1.11 times the smallest measurement 
taken on pipe that is 20 inches (508 mm) or more in nominal outside 
diameter.
    (d) The minimum wall thickness of the pipe may not be less than 87.5 
percent of the value used for nominal wall thickness in determining the 
internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section. In 
addition, the anticipated external loads and external pressures that are 
concurrent with internal pressure must be considered in accordance with 
Secs. 195.108 and 195.110 and, after determining the internal design 
pressure, the nominal wall thickness must be increased as necessary to 
compensate for these concurrent loads and pressures.
    (e) The seam joint factor used in paragraph (a) of this section is 
determined in accordance with the following table:

<R05>
Sec. 195.303  Risk-based alternative to pressure testing older hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines.

    (a) An operator may elect to follow a program for testing a pipeline 
on risk-based criteria as an alternative to the pressure testing in 
Sec. 195.302(b)(1)(i)-(iii) and Sec. 195.302(b)(2)(i) of this subpart. 
Appendix B provides guidance on how this program will work. An operator 
electing such a program shall assign a risk classification to each 
pipeline segment according to the indicators described in paragraph (b) 
of this section as follows:
    (1) Risk Classification A if the location indicator is ranked as low 
or medium risk, the product and volume indicators are ranked as low 
risk, and the probability of failure indicator is ranked as low risk;
    (2) Risk Classification C if the location indicator is ranked as 
high risk; or
    (3) Risk Classification B.
    (b) An operator shall evaluate each pipeline segment in the program 
according to the following indicators of risk:
    (1) The location indicator is--
    (i) High risk if an area is non-rural or environmentally sensitive 
\1\; or
    (ii) Medium risk; or
    (iii) Low risk if an area is not high or medium risk.
    (2) The product indicator is <SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ (See Appendix B, Table C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) High risk if the product transported is highly toxic or is both 
highly volatile and flammable;
    (ii) Medium risk if the product transported is flammable with a 
flashpoint of less than 100 deg. F, but not highly volatile; or
    (iii) Low risk if the product transported is not high or medium 
risk.
    (3) The volume indicator is--
    (i) High risk if the line is at least 18 inches in nominal diameter;
    (ii) Medium risk if the line is at least 10 inches, but less than 18 
inches, in nominal diameter; or
    (iii) Low risk if the line is not high or medium risk.
    (4) The probability of failure indicator is--
    (i) High risk if the segment has experienced more than three 
failures in the last 10 years due to time-dependent defects (e.g., 
corrosion, gouges, or problems developed during manufacture, 
construction or operation, etc.); or
    (ii) Low risk if the segment has experienced three failures or less 
in the last 10 years due to time-dependent defects.
    (c) The program under paragraph (a) of this section shall provide 
for pressure testing for a segment constructed of electric resistance-
welded (ERW) pipe and lapwelded pipe manufactured prior to 1970 
susceptible to longitudinal seam failures as determined through 
paragraph (d) of this section. The timing of such pressure test may be 
determined based on risk classifications discussed under paragraph (b) 
of this section. For other segments, the program may provide for use of 
a magnetic flux leakage or ultrasonic internal inspection survey as an 
alternative to pressure testing and, in the case of such segments in 
Risk Classification A, may provide for no additional measures under this 
subpart.
    (d) All pre-1970 ERW pipe and lapwelded pipe is deemed susceptible 
to longitudinal seam failures unless an engineering analysis shows 
otherwise. In conducting an engineering analysis an operator must 
consider the seam-related leak history of the pipe and pipe 
manufacturing information as available, which may include the pipe 
steel's mechanical properties, including fracture toughness; the 
manufacturing process and controls related to seam properties, including 
whether the ERW process was high-frequency or low-frequency, whether the 
weld seam was heat treated, whether the seam was inspected, the test 
pressure and duration during mill hydrotest; the quality control of the 
steel-making process; and other factors pertinent to seam properties and 
quality.

[[Page 147]]

    (e) Pressure testing done under this section must be conducted in 
accordance with this subpart. Except for segments in Risk Classification 
B which are not constructed with pre-1970 ERW pipe, water must be the 
test medium.
    (f) An operator electing to follow a program under paragraph (a) 
must develop plans that include the method of testing and a schedule for 
the testing by December 7, 1998. The compliance deadlines for completion 
of testing are as shown in the table below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (g) An operator must review the risk classifications for those 
pipeline segments which have not yet been tested under paragraph (a) of 
this section or otherwise inspected under paragraph (c) of this section 
at intervals not to exceed 15 months. If the risk classification of an 
untested or uninspected segment changes, an operator must take 
appropriate action within two years, or establish the maximum operating 
pressure under Sec. 195.406(a)(5).
    (h) An operator must maintain records establishing compliance with 
this section, including records verifying the risk classifications, the 
plans and schedule for testing, the conduct of the testing, and the 
review of the risk classifications.
    (i) An operator may discontinue a program under this section only 
after written notification to the Administrator and approval, if needed, 
of a schedule for pressure testing.

Sec. 195.414  Cathodic protection.

    (a) No operator may operate a hazardous liquid interstate pipeline 
after March 31, 1973, a hazardous liquid

[[Page 155]]

intrastate pipeline after October 19, 1988, or a carbon dioxide pipeline 
after July 12, 1993 that has an effective external surface coating 
material, unless that pipeline is cathodically protected. This paragraph 
does not apply to breakout tank areas and buried pumping station piping. 
For the purposes of this subpart, a pipeline does not have an effective 
external coating, and shall be considered bare, if its cathodic 
protection current requirements are substantially the same as if it were 
bare.
    (b) Each operator shall electrically inspect each bare hazardous 
liquid interstate pipeline, other than a low-stress pipeline, before 
April 1, 1975; each bare hazardous liquid intrastate pipeline, other 
than a low-stress pipeline, before October 20, 1990; each bare carbon 
dioxide pipeline before July 12, 1994; and each bare low-stress pipeline 
before July 12, 1996 to determine any areas in which active corrosion is 
taking place. The operator may not increase its established operating 
pressure on a section of bare pipeline until the section has been so 
electrically inspected. In any areas where active corrosion is found, 
the operator shall provide cathodic protection. Section 195.416(f) and 
(g) apply to all corroded pipe that is found.
    (c) Each operator shall electrically inspect all breakout tank areas 
and buried pumping station piping on hazardous liquid interstate 
pipelines, other than low-stress pipelines, before April 1, 1973; on 
hazardous liquid intrastate pipelines, other than low-stress pipelines, 
before October 20, 1988; on carbon dioxide pipelines before July 12, 
1994; and on low-stress pipelines before July 12, 1996 as to the need 
for cathodic protection, and cathodic protection shall be provided where 
necessary.

Sec. 195.416  External corrosion control.

    (a) Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but 
at least once each calendar year, conduct tests on each buried, in 
contact with the ground, or submerged pipeline facility in its pipeline 
system that is under cathodic protection to determine whether the 
protection is adequate.
    (b) Each operator shall maintain the test leads required for 
cathodic protection in such a condition that electrical measurements can 
be obtained to ensure adequate protection.
    (c) Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 2\1/2\ months, 
but at least six times each calendar year, inspect each of its cathodic 
protection rectifiers.
    (d) Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 5 years, 
electrically inspect the bare pipe in its pipeline system that is not 
cathodically protected and must study leak records for that pipe to 
determine if additional protection is needed.
    (e) Whenever any buried pipe is exposed for any reason, the operator 
shall examine the pipe for evidence of external corrosion. If the 
operator finds that there is active corrosion, that the surface of the 
pipe is generally pitted, or that corrosion has caused a leak, it shall 
investigate further to determine the extent of the corrosion.
    (f) Any pipe that is found to be generally corroded so that the 
remaining wall thickness is less than the minimum thickness required by 
the pipe specification tolerances must be replaced with coated pipe that 
meets the requirements of this part. However, generally corroded pipe 
need not be replaced if--
    (1) The operating pressure is reduced to be commensurate with the 
limits on operating pressure specified in this subpart, based on the 
actual remaining wall thickness; or
    (2) The pipe is repaired by a method that reliable engineering tests 
and analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability of the 
pipe.
    (g) If localized corrosion pitting is found to exist to a degree 
whereleakage might result, the pipe must be replaced or repaired, or the 
operating pressure must be reduced commensurate with the strength of the 
pipe based on the actual remaining wall thickness in the pits.
    (h) The strength of the pipe, based on actual remaining wall 
thickness, for paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section may be determined 
by the procedure in ASME B31G manual for Determining the Remaining 
Strength of Corroded

[[Page 156]]

Pipelines or by the procedure developed by AGA/Battelle--A Modified 
Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe (with 
RSTRENG disk). Application of the procedure in the ASME B31G manual or 
the AGA/Battelle Modified Criterion is applicable to corroded regions 
(not penetrating the pipe wall) in existing steel pipelines in 
accordance with limitations set out in the respective procedures.
    (i) Each operator shall clean, coat with material suitable for the 
prevention of atmospheric corrosion, and, maintain this protection for, 
each component in its pipeline system that is exposed to the atmosphere.
    (j) For aboveground breakout tanks where corrosion of the tank 
bottom is controlled by a cathodic protection system, the cathodic 
protection system must be inspected to ensure it is operated and 
maintained in accordance with API Recommended Practice 651, unless the 
operator notes in the procedure manual (Sec. 195.402(c)) why compliance 
with all or certain provisions of API Recommended Practice 651 is not 
necessary for the safety of a particular breakout tank.

    (a) No operator may transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide 
that would corrode the pipe or other components of its pipeline system, 
unless it has investigated the corrosive effect of the hazardous liquid 
or carbon dioxide on the system and has taken adequate steps to mitigate 
corrosion.
    (b) If corrosion inhibitors are used to mitigate internal corrosion 
the operator shall use inhibitors in sufficient quantity to protect the 
entire part of the system that the inhibitors are designed to protect 
and shall also use coupons or other monitoring equipment to determine 
their effectiveness.
    (c) The operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 7\1/2\ months, 
but at least twice each calendar year, examine coupons or other types of 
monitoring equipment to determine the effectiveness of the inhibitors or 
the extent of any corrosion.
    (d) Whenever any pipe is removed from the pipeline for any reason, 
the operator must inspect the internal surface for evidence of 
corrosion. If the pipe is generally corroded such that the remaining 
wall thickness is less than the minimum thickness required by the pipe 
specification tolerances, the operator shall investigate adjacent pipe 
to determine the extent of the corrosion. The corroded pipe must be 
replaced with pipe that meets the requirements of this part or, based on 
the actual remaining wall thickness, the operating pressure must be 
reduced to be commensurate with the limits on operating pressure 
specified in this subpart.

significantly altered after October 2, 2000, must have an overfill 
protection system installed according to API Recommended Practice 2350. 
However, operators need not comply with any part of API Recommended 
Practice 2350 for a particular breakout tank if the operator notes in 
the manual required by Sec. 195.402 why compliance with that part is not 
necessary for safety of the tank.
    (d) After October 2, 2000, the requirements of paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section for inspection and testing of pressure control 
equipment apply to the inspection and testing of overfill protection 
systems.

<R05>
Sec. 195.442  Damage prevention program.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each 
operator of a buried pipeline must carry out, in accordance with this 
section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from 
excavation activities. For the purpose of this section, the term 
``excavation activities'' includes excavation, blasting, boring, 
tunneling, backfilling, the removal of aboveground structures by either 
explosive or mechanical means, and other earthmoving operations.
    (b) An operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section through participation in a public service program, 
such as a one-call system, but such participation does not relieve the 
operator of the responsibility for compliance with this section. 
However, an operator must perform the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call 
system is a qualified one-call system. In areas that are covered by more 
than one qualified one-call system, an operator need only join one of 
the qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone number 
for excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call 
systems in those areas communicate with one another. An operator's 
pipeline system must be covered by a qualified one-call system where

[[Page 159]]

there is one in place. For the purpose of this section, a one-call 
system is considered a ``qualified one-call system'' if it meets the 
requirements of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) or this section.
    (1) The state has adopted a one-call damage prevention program under 
Sec. 198.37 of this chapter; or
    (2) The one-call system:
    (i) Is operated in accordance with Sec. 198.39 of this chapter;
    (ii) Provides a pipeline operator an opportunity similar to a 
voluntary participant to have a part in management responsibilities; and
    (iii) Assesses a participating pipeline operator a fee that is 
proportionate to the costs of the one-call system's coverage of the 
operator's pipeline.
    (c) The damage prevention program required by paragraph (a) of this 
section must, at a minimum:
    (1) Include the identity, on a current basis, of persons who 
normally engage in excavation activities in the area in which the 
pipeline is located.
    (2) Provides for notification of the public in the vicinity of the 
pipeline and actual notification of persons identified in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section of the following as often as needed to make them 
aware of the damage prevention program:
    (i) The program's existence and purpose; and
    (ii) How to learn the location of underground pipelines before 
excavation activities are begun.
    (3) Provide a means of receiving and recording notification of 
planned excavation activities.
    (4) If the operator has buried pipelines in the area of excavation 
activity, provide for actual notification of persons who give notice of 
their intent to excavate of the type of temporary marking to be provided 
and how to identify the markings.
    (5) Provide for temporary marking of buried pipelines in the area of 
excavation activity before, as far as practical, the activity begins.
    (6) Provide as follows for inspection of pipelines that an operator 
has reason to believe could be damaged by excavation activities:
    (i) The inspection must be done as frequently as necessary during 
and after the activities to verify the integrity of the pipeline; and
    (ii) In the case of blasting, any inspection must include leakage 
surveys.
    (d) A damage prevention program under this section is not required 
for the following pipelines:
    (1) Pipelines located offshore.
    (2) Pipelines to which access is physically controlled by the 
operator.

<R05>
Sec. 195.450  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to this section and Sec. 195.452:
    Emergency flow restricting device or EFRD means a check valve or 
remote control valve as follows:
    (1) Check valve means a valve that permits fluid to flow freely in 
one direction and contains a mechanism to automatically prevent flow in 
the other direction.
    (2) Remote control valve or RCV means any valve that is operated 
from a location remote from where the valve is installed. The RCV is 
usually operated by the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) 
system. The linkage between the pipeline control center and the RCV may 
be by fiber optics, microwave, telephone lines, or satellite.
    High consequence area means:
    (1) A commercially navigable waterway, which means a waterway where 
a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists;
    (2) A high population area, which means an urbanized area, as 
defined and delineated by the Census Bureau, that contains 50,000 or 
more people and has a population density of at least 1,000 people per 
square mile;

[[Page 160]]

    (3) An other populated area, which means a place, as defined and 
delineated by the Census Bureau, that contains a concentrated 
population, such as an incorporated or unincorporated city, town, 
village, or other designated residential or commercial area;
    (4) An unusually sensitive area, as defined in Sec. 195.6.

                      Pipeline Integrity Management


<R05>
Sec. 195.452  Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas.

    (a) Which operators must comply? This section applies to each 
operator who owns or operates a total of 500 or more miles of hazardous 
liquid pipeline subject to this part.
    (b) What must an operator do? (1) No later than March 31, 2002, an 
operator must develop a written integrity management program that 
addresses the risks on each pipeline segment that could affect a high 
consequence area. An operator must include in the program:
    (i) An identification of all pipeline segments that could affect a 
high consequence area. A pipeline segment in a high consequence area is 
presumed to affect that area unless the operator's risk assessment 
effectively demonstrates otherwise. (See Appendix C of this part for 
guidance on identifying pipeline segments.) An operator must complete 
this identification no later than December 31, 2001;
    (ii) A plan for baseline assessment of the line pipe (see paragraph 
(c) of this section);
    (iii) A framework addressing each element of the integrity 
management program, including continual integrity assessment and 
evaluation (see paragraphs (f) and (j) of this section). The framework 
must initially indicate how decisions will be made to implement each 
element.
    (2) An operator must implement and follow the program it develops.
    (3) In carrying out this section, an operator must follow recognized 
industry practices unless the section specifies otherwise or the 
operator demonstrates that an alternative practice is supported by a 
reliable engineering evaluation and provides an equivalent level of 
public safety and environmental protection.
    (c) What must be in the baseline assessment plan? (1) An operator 
must include each of the following elements in its written baseline 
assessment plan:
    (i) The methods selected to assess the integrity of the line pipe. 
For low frequency electric resistance welded pipe or lap welded pipe 
susceptible to longitudinal seam failure, an operator must select 
integrity assessment methods capable of assessing seam integrity and of 
detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies. An operator must assess 
the integrity of the line pipe by:
    (A) Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion 
and deformation anomalies including dents, gouges and grooves;
    (B) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this 
part; or
    (C) Other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an 
equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator 
choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 90 
days before conducting the assessment, by sending a notice to the 
address specified in Sec. 195.58 or to the facsimile number specified in 
Sec. 195.56;
    (ii) A schedule for completing the integrity assessment;
    (iii) An explanation of the assessment methods selected and 
evaluation of risk factors considered in establishing the assessment 
schedule.
    (2) An operator must document, prior to implementing any changes to 
the plan, any modification to the plan, and reasons for the 
modification.
    (d) When must the baseline assessment be completed? (1) Time period. 
An operator must establish a baseline assessment schedule to determine 
the priority for assessing the pipeline segments. An operator must 
complete the baseline assessment by March 31, 2008. An operator must 
assess at least 50% of the line pipe subject to the requirements of this 
section, beginning with the highest risk pipe, by September 30, 2004.
    (2) Prior assessment. To satisfy the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section, an operator may use an integrity assessment 
conducted after January 1, 1996, if the integrity assessment

[[Page 161]]

method meets the requirements of this section. However, if an operator 
uses this prior assessment as its baseline assessment, the operator must 
re-assess the line pipe according to the requirements of paragraph 
(j)(3) of this section.
    (3) Newly-identified areas. (i) When information is available from 
the information analysis (see paragraph (g) of this section), or from 
Census Bureau maps, that the population density around a pipeline 
segment has changed so as to fall within the definition in Sec. 195.450 
of a high population area or other populated area, the operator must 
incorporate the area into its baseline assessment plan as a high 
consequence area within one year from the date the area is identified. 
An operator must complete the baseline assessment of any line pipe that 
could affect the newly-identified high consequence area within five 
years from the date the area is identified.
    (ii) An operator must incorporate a new unusually sensitive area 
into its baseline assessment plan within one year from the date the area 
is identified. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of any 
line pipe that could affect the newly-identified high consequence area 
within five years from the date the area is identified.
    (e) What are the risk factors for establishing an assessment 
schedule (for both the baseline and continual integrity assessments)? 
(1) An operator must establish an integrity assessment schedule that 
prioritizes pipeline segments for assessment (see paragraphs (d)(1) and 
(j)(3) of this section). An operator must base the assessment schedule 
on all risk factors that reflect the risk conditions on the pipeline 
segment. The factors an operator must consider include, but are not 
limited to:
    (i) Results of the previous integrity assessment, defect type and 
size that the assessment method can detect, and defect growth rate;
    (ii) Pipe size, material, manufacturing information, coating type 
and condition, and seam type;
    (iii) Leak history, repair history and cathodic protection history;
    (iv) Product transported;
    (v) Operating stress level;
    (vi) Existing or projected activities in the area;
    (vii) Local environmental factors that could affect the pipeline 
(e.g., corrosivity of soil, subsidence, climatic);
    (viii) geo-technical hazards; and
    (ix) Physical support of the segment such as by a cable suspension 
bridge.
    (2) Appendix C of this part provides further guidance on risk 
factors.
    (f) What are the elements of an integrity management program? An 
integrity management program begins with the initial framework. An 
operator must continually change the program to reflect operating 
experience, conclusions drawn from results of the integrity assessments, 
and other maintenance and surveillance data, and evaluation of 
consequences of a failure on the high consequence area. An operator must 
include, at minimum, each of the following elements in its written 
integrity management program:
    (1) A process for identifying which pipeline segments could affect a 
high consequence area;
    (2) A baseline assessment plan meeting the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section;
    (3) An analysis that integrates all available information about the 
integrity of the entire pipeline and the consequences of a failure (see 
paragraph (g) of this section);
    (4) Criteria for repair actions to address integrity issues raised 
by the assessment methods and information analysis (see paragraph (h) of 
this section);
    (5) A continual process of assessment and evaluation to maintain a 
pipeline's integrity (see paragraph (j) of this section);
    (6) Identification of preventive and mitigative measures to protect 
the high consequence area (see paragraph (i) of this section);
    (7) Methods to measure the program's effectiveness (see paragraph 
(k) of this section);
    (8) A process for review of integrity assessment results and 
information analysis by a person qualified to evaluate the results and 
information (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section).
    (g) What is an information analysis? In periodically evaluating the 
integrity of

[[Page 162]]

each pipeline segment (paragraph (j) of this section), an operator must 
analyze all available information about the integrity of the entire 
pipeline and the consequences of a failure. This information includes:
    (1) Information critical to determining the potential for, and 
preventing, damage due to excavation, including current and planned 
damage prevention activities, and development or planned development 
along the pipeline segment;
    (2) Data gathered through the integrity assessment required under 
this section;
    (3) Data gathered in conjunction with other inspections, tests, 
surveillance and patrols required by this Part, including, corrosion 
control monitoring and cathodic protection surveys; and
    (4) Information about how a failure would affect the high 
consequence area, such as location of the water intake.
    (h) What actions must be taken to address integrity issues? (1) 
General requirements. An operator must take prompt action to address all 
pipeline integrity issues raised by the assessment and information 
analysis. An operator must evaluate all anomalies and repair those 
anomalies that could reduce a pipeline's integrity. An operator must 
comply with Sec. 195.422 in making a repair.
    (2) Discovery of a condition. Discovery of a condition occurs when 
an operator has adequate information about the condition to determine 
the need for repair. Depending on circumstances, an operator may have 
adequate information when the operator receives the preliminary internal 
inspection report, gathers and integrates information from other 
inspections or the periodic evaluation, excavates the anomaly, or when 
an operator receives the final internal inspection report. The date of 
discovery can be no later than the date of the integrity assessment 
results or the final report.
    (3) Review of integrity assessment. An operator must include in its 
schedule for evaluation and repair (as required by paragraph (h)(4) of 
this section), a schedule for promptly reviewing and analyzing the 
integrity assessment results. After March 31, 2004, an operator's 
schedule must provide for review of the integrity assessment results 
within 120 days of conducting each assessment. The operator must obtain 
and assess a final report within an additional 90 days.
    (4) Schedule for repairs. An operator must complete repairs 
according to a schedule that prioritizes the conditions for evaluation 
and repair. An operator must base the schedule on the risk factors 
listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and any pipeline-specific 
risk factors the operator develops. If an operator cannot meet the 
schedule for any of the conditions addressed in paragraphs (h)(5)(i) 
through (iv) of this section, the operator must justify the reasons why 
the schedule cannot be met and that the changed schedule will not 
jeopardize public safety or environmental protection. An operator must 
notify OPS if the operator cannot meet the schedule and cannot provide 
safety through a temporary reduction in operating pressure until a 
permanent repair is made. An operator must send a notice to the address 
specified in Sec. 195.58 or to the facsimile number specified in 
Sec. 195.56.
    (5) Special requirements for scheduling repairs--(i) Immediate 
repair conditions. An operator's evaluation and repair schedule must 
provide for immediate repair conditions. To maintain safety, an operator 
will need to temporarily reduce operating pressure or shut down the 
pipeline until the operator can complete the repair of these conditions. 
An operator must base the temporary operating pressure reduction on 
remaining wall thickness. An operator must treat the following 
conditions as immediate repair conditions:
    (A) Metal loss greater than 80% of nominal wall regardless of 
dimensions.
    (B) Predicted burst pressure less than the maximum operating 
pressure at the location of the anomaly. Burst pressure has been 
calculated from the remaining strength of the pipe, using a suitable 
metal loss strength calculation, e.g., ASME/ANSI B31G (``Manual for 
Determining the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipelines'' (1991)) or 
AGA Pipeline Research Committee Project PR-3-805 (``A Modified Criterion 
for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe'' (December

[[Page 163]]

1989)). These documents are available at the addresses listed at 
Sec. 195.3.
    (C) Dents on the top of the pipeline (above 4 and 8 o'clock 
position) with any indicated metal loss.
    (D) Significant anomaly that in the judgment of the person 
evaluating the assessment results requires immediate action.
    (ii) 60-day conditions. Except for conditions listed in paragraph 
(h)(5)(i) of this section, an operator must schedule for evaluation and 
repair all dents, regardless of size, located on the top of the pipeline 
(above 4 and 8 o'clock position) within 60 days of discovery of the 
condition.
    (iii) Six-month conditions. Except for conditions listed in 
paragraph (h)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section, an operator must schedule 
evaluation and repair of the following within six months of discovery of 
the condition:
    (A) Dents with metal loss or dents that affect pipe curvature at a 
girth or seam weld.
    (B) Dents with reported depths greater than 6% of the pipe diameter.
    (C) Remaining strength of the pipe results in a safe operating 
pressure that is less than the current established MOP at the location 
of the anomaly using a suitable safe operating pressure calculation 
method (e.g., ASME/ANSI B31G (``Manual for Determining the Remaining 
Strength of Corroded Pipelines'' (1991)) or AGA Pipeline Research 
Committee Project PR-3-805 (``A Modified Criterion for Evaluating the 
Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe'' (December 1989)). These documents 
are available at the addresses listed at Sec. 195.3.
    (D) Areas of general corrosion with a predicted metal loss of >50% 
of nominal wall.
    (E) Predicted metal loss of >50% of nominal wall at crossings of 
another pipeline.
    (F) Weld anomalies with a predicted metal loss >50% of nominal wall.
    (G) Potential crack indications that when excavated are determined 
to be cracks.
    (H) Corrosion of or along seam welds.
    (I) Gouges or grooves greater than 12.5% of nominal wall.
    (iv) Other conditions. An operator must schedule evaluation and 
repair of the following conditions:
    (A) Data that reflect a change since last assessed.
    (B) Data that indicate mechanical damage that is located on the top 
half of the pipe.
    (C) Data that indicate anomalies abrupt in nature.
    (D) Data that indicate anomalies longitudinal in orientation.
    (E) Data that indicate anomalies over a large area.
    (F) Anomalies located in or near casings, crossings of another 
pipeline, and areas with suspect cathodic protection.
    (i) What preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take to 
protect the high consequence area? (1) General requirements. An operator 
must take measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a 
pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. These 
measures include conducting a risk analysis of the pipeline segment to 
identify additional actions to enhance public safety or environmental 
protection. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, 
implementing damage prevention best practices, better monitoring of 
cathodic protection where corrosion is a concern, establishing shorter 
inspection intervals, installing EFRDs on the pipeline segment, 
modifying the systems that monitor pressure and detect leaks, providing 
additional training to personnel on response procedures, conducting 
drills with local emergency responders and adopting other management 
controls.
    (2) Risk analysis criteria. In identifying the need for additional 
preventive and mitigative measures, an operator must evaluate the 
likelihood of a pipeline release occurring and how a release could 
affect the high consequence area. This determination must consider all 
relevant risk factors, including, but not limited to:
    (i) Terrain surrounding the pipeline segment, including drainage 
systems such as small streams and other smaller waterways that could act 
as a conduit to the high consequence area;
    (ii) Elevation profile;
    (iii) Characteristics of the product transported;

[[Page 164]]

    (iv) Amount of product that could be released;
    (v) Possibility of a spillage in a farm field following the drain 
tile into a waterway;
    (vi) Ditches along side a roadway the pipeline crosses;
    (vii) Physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable 
suspension bridge;
    (viii) Exposure of the pipeline to operating pressure exceeding 
established maximum operating pressure.
    (3) Leak detection. An operator must have a means to detect leaks on 
its pipeline system. An operator must evaluate the capability of its 
leak detection means and modify, as necessary, to protect the high 
consequence area. An operator's evaluation must, at least, consider, the 
following factors--length and size of the pipeline, type of product 
carried, the pipeline's proximity to the high consequence area, the 
swiftness of leak detection, location of nearest response personnel, 
leak history, and risk assessment results.
    (4) Emergency Flow Restricting Devices (EFRD). If an operator 
determines that an EFRD is needed on a pipeline segment to protect a 
high consequence area in the event of a hazardous liquid pipeline 
release, an operator must install the EFRD. In making this 
determination, an operator must, at least, consider the following 
factors--the swiftness of leak detection and pipeline shutdown 
capabilities, the type of commodity carried, the rate of potential 
leakage, the volume that can be released, topography or pipeline 
profile, the potential for ignition, proximity to power sources, 
location of nearest response personnel, specific terrain between the 
pipeline segment and the high consequence area, and benefits expected by 
reducing the spill size.
    (j) What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to 
maintain a pipeline's integrity? (1) General. After completing the 
baseline integrity assessment, an operator must continue to assess the 
line pipe at specified intervals and periodically evaluate the integrity 
of each pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence area.
    (2) Evaluation. An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as 
frequently as needed to assure pipeline integrity. An operator must base 
the frequency of evaluation on risk factors specific to its pipeline, 
including the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The 
evaluation must consider the past and present integrity assessment 
results, information analysis (paragraph (g) of this section), and 
decisions about repair, and preventive and mitigative actions 
(paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section).
    (3) Assessment intervals. An operator must establish intervals not 
to exceed five (5) years for continually assessing the line pipe's 
integrity. An operator must base the assessment intervals on the risk 
the line pipe poses to the high consequence area to determine the 
priority for assessing the pipeline segments. An operator must establish 
the assessment intervals based on the factors specified in paragraph (e) 
of this section, the analysis of the results from the last integrity 
assessment, and the information analysis required by paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (4) Variance from the 5-year intervals in limited situations--(i) 
Engineering basis. An operator may be able to justify an engineering 
basis for a longer assessment interval on a segment of line pipe. The 
justification must be supported by a reliable engineering evaluation 
combined with the use of other technology, such as external monitoring 
technology, that provides an understanding of the condition of the line 
pipe equivalent to that which is obtainable under paragraph (j)(2) of 
this section. An operator must notify OPS nine months before the end of 
the intervals of five years or less of the reason why the operator 
intends to justify a longer interval. An operator must send a notice to 
the address specified in Sec. 195.58 or to the facsimile number 
specified in Sec. 195.56. The notice must state a proposed alternative 
interval.
    (ii) Unavailable technology. An operator may require a longer 
assessment period for a segment of line pipe (for example, because 
sophisticated internal inspection technology is not available). An 
operator must justify the reasons why it cannot comply with the required 
assessment period and must also demonstrate the actions it is taking to 
evaluate the integrity of the pipeline segment in the interim. An 
operator

[[Page 165]]

must notify OPS 180 days before the end of the intervals of five years 
or less that the operator may require a longer assessment interval. An 
operator must send a notice to the address specified in Sec. 195.58 or 
to the facsimile number specified in Sec. 195.56. The Operator may have 
up to an additional 180 days to complete the assessment.
    (5) Assessment methods. An operator must assess the integrity of the 
line pipe by:
    (i) Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion 
and deformation anomalies including dents, gouges and grooves;
    (ii) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this 
part; or
    (iii) Other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an 
equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator 
choosing this option must notify OPS 60 days before conducting the 
assessment, by sending a notice to the address specified in Sec. 195.58 
or to the facsimile number specified in Sec. 195.56.
    (6) However, for low frequency electric resistance welded pipe or 
lap welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure, an operator 
must select integrity assessment methods capable of assessing seam 
integrity and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.
    (k) What methods to measure program effectiveness must be used? An 
operator's program must include methods to measure whether the program 
is effective in assessing and evaluating the integrity of each pipeline 
segment and in protecting the high consequence areas. See Appendix C of 
this part for guidance on methods that can be used to evaluate a 
program's effectiveness.
    (1) What records must be kept? An operator must maintain for review 
during an inspection:
    (i) A written integrity management program in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) Documents to support the decisions and analyses, including any 
modifications, justifications, variances, deviations and determinations 
made, and actions taken, to implement and evaluate each element of the 
integrity management program listed in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) See Appendix C of this part for examples of records an operator 
would be required to keep.

     Appendix A to Part 195--Delineation Between Federal and State 
       Jurisdiction--Statement of Agency Policy and Interpretation

    In 1979, Congress enacted comprehensive safety legislation governing 
the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, the Hazardous 
Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, 49 U.S.C. 2001 et seq. (HLPSA). The 
HLPSA expanded the existing statutory authority for safety regulation, 
which was limited to transportation by common carriers in interstate and 
foreign commerce, to transportation through facilities used in or 
affecting interstate or foreign commerce. It also added civil penalty, 
compliance order, and injunctive enforcement authorities to the existing 
criminal sanctions. Modeled largely on the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety 
Act of 1968, 49 U.S.C. 1671 et seq. (NGPSA), the HLPSA provides for a 
national hazardous liquid pipeline safety program with nationally 
uniform minimal standards and with enforcement administered through a 
Federal-State partnership. The HLPSA leaves to exclusive Federal 
regulation and enforcement the ``interstate pipeline facilities,'' those 
used for the pipeline transportation of hazardous liquids in interstate 
or foreign commerce. For the remainder of the pipeline facilities, 
denominated ``intrastate pipeline facilities,'' the HLPSA provides that 
the same Federal regulation and enforcement will apply unless a State 
certifies that it will assume those responsibilities. A certified State 
must adopt the same minimal standards but may adopt additional more 
stringent standards so long as they are compatible. Therefore, in States 
which participate in the hazardous liquid pipeline safety program 
through certification, it is necessary to distinguish the interstate 
from the intrastate pipeline facilities.
    In deciding that an administratively practical approach was 
necessary in distinguishing between interstate and intrastate

[[Page 167]]

liquid pipeline facilities and in determining how best to accomplish 
this, DOT has logically examined the approach used in the NGPSA. The 
NGPSA defines the interstate gas pipeline facilities subject to 
exclusive Federal jurisdiction as those subject to the economic 
regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(FERC). Experience has proven this approach practical. Unlike the NGPSA 
however, the HLPSA has no specific reference to FERC jurisdiction, but 
instead defines interstate liquid pipeline facilities by the more 
commonly used means of specifying the end points of the transportation 
involved. For example, the economic regulatory jurisdiction of FERC over 
the transportation of both gas and liquids by pipeline is defined in 
much the same way. In implementing the HLPSA DOT has sought a 
practicable means of distinguishing between interstate and intrastate 
pipeline facilities that provide the requisite degree of certainty to 
Federal and State enforcement personnel and to the regulated entities. 
DOT intends that this statement of agency policy and interpretation 
provide that certainty.
    In 1981, DOT decided that the inventory of liquid pipeline 
facilities identified as subject to the jurisdiction of FERC 
approximates the HLPSA category of ``interstate pipeline facilities.'' 
Administrative use of the FERC inventory has the added benefit of 
avoiding the creation of a separate Federal scheme for determination of 
jurisdiction over the same regulated entities. DOT recognizes that the 
FERC inventory is only an approximation and may not be totally 
satisfactory without some modification. The difficulties stem from some 
significant differences in the economic regulation of liquid and of 
natural gas pipelines. There is an affirmative assertion of jurisdiction 
by FERC over natural gas pipelines through the issuance of certificates 
of public convenience and necessity prior to commencing operations. With 
liquid pipelines, there is only a rebuttable presumption of jurisdiction 
created by the filing by pipeline operators of tariffs (or concurrences) 
for movement of liquids through existing facilities. Although FERC does 
police the filings for such matters as compliance with the general 
duties of common carriers, the question of jurisdiction is normally only 
aired upon complaint. While any person, including State or Federal 
agencies, can avail themselves of the FERC forum by use of the complaint 
process, that process has only been rarely used to review jurisdictional 
matters (probably because of the infrequency of real disputes on the 
issue). Where the issue has arisen, the reviewing body has noted the 
need to examine various criteria primarily of an economic nature. DOT 
believes that, in most cases, the formal FERC forum can better receive 
and evaluate the type of information that is needed to make decisions of 
this nature than can DOT.
    In delineating which liquid pipeline facilities are interstate 
pipeline facilities within the meaning of the HLPSA, DOT will generally 
rely on the FERC filings; that is, if there is a tariff or concurrence 
filed with FERC governing the transportation of hazardous liquids over a 
pipeline facility or if there has been an exemption from the obligation 
to file tariffs obtained from FERC, then DOT will, as a general rule, 
consider the facility to be an interstate pipeline facility within the 
meaning of the HLPSA. The types of situations in which DOT will ignore 
the existence or non-existence of a filing with FERC will be limited to 
those cases in which it appears obvious that a complaint filed with FERC 
would be successful or in which blind reliance on a FERC filing would 
result in a situation clearly not intended by the HLPSA such as a 
pipeline facility not being subject to either State or Federal safety 
regulation. DOT anticipates that the situations in which there is any 
question about the validity of the FERC filings as a ready reference 
will be few and that the actual variations from reliance on those 
filings will be rare. The following examples indicate the types of 
facilities which DOT believes are interstate pipeline facilities subject 
to the HLPSA despite the lack of a filing with FERC and the types of 
facilities over which DOT will generally defer to the jurisdiction of a 
certifying state despite the existence of a filing with FERC.
    Example 1. Pipeline company P operates a pipeline from ``Point A'' 
located in State X to ``Point B'' (also in X). The physical facilities 
never cross a state line and do not connect with any other pipeline 
which does cross a state line. Pipeline company P also operates another 
pipeline between ``Point C'' in State X and ``Point D'' in an adjoining 
State Y. Pipeline company P files a tariff with FERC for transportation 
from ``Point A'' to ``Point B'' as well as for transportation from 
``Point C'' to ``Point D.'' DOT will ignore filing for the line from 
``Point A'' to ``Point B'' and consider the line to be intrastate.
    Example 2. Same as in example 1 except that P does not file any 
tariffs with FERC. DOT will assume jurisdiction of the line between 
``Point C'' and ``Point D.''
    Example 3. Same as in example 1 except that P files its tariff for 
the line between ``Point C'' and ``Point D'' not only with FERC but also 
with State X. DOT will rely on the FERC filing as indication of 
interstate commerce.
    Example 4. Same as in example 1 except that the pipeline from 
``Point A'' to ``Point B'' (in State X) connects with a pipeline 
operated by another company transports liquid between ``Point B'' (in 
State X) and ``Point

[[Page 168]]

D'' (in State Y). DOT will rely on the FERC filing as indication of 
interstate commerce.
    Example 5. Same as in example 1 except that the line between ``Point 
C'' and ``Point D'' has a lateral line connected to it. The lateral is 
located entirely with State X. DOT will rely on the existence or non-
existence of a FERC filing covering transportation over that lateral as 
determinative of interstate commerce.
    Example 6. Same as in example 1 except that the certified agency in 
State X has brought an enforcement action (under the pipeline safety 
laws) against P because of its operation of the line between ``Point A'' 
and ``Point B''. P has successfully defended against the action on 
jurisdictional grounds. DOT will assume jurisdiction if necessary to 
avoid the anomaly of a pipeline subject to neither State or Federal 
safety enforcement. DOT's assertion of jurisdiction in such a case would 
be based on the gap in the state's enforcement authority rather than a 
DOT decision that the pipeline is an interstate pipeline facility.
    Example 7. Pipeline Company P operates a pipeline that originates on 
the Outer Continental Shelf. P does not file any tariff for that line 
with FERC. DOT will consider the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline 
facility.
    Example 8. Pipeline Company P is constructing a pipeline from 
``Point C'' (in State X) to ``Point D'' (in State Y). DOT will consider 
the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.
    Example 9. Pipeline company P is constructing a pipeline from 
``Point C'' to ``Point E'' (both in State X) but intends to file tariffs 
with FERC in the transportation of hazardous liquid in interstate 
commerce. Assuming there is some connection to an interstate pipeline 
facility, DOT will consider this line to be an interstate pipeline 
facility.
    Example 10. Pipeline Company P has operated a pipeline subject to 
FERC economic regulation. Solely because of some statutory economic 
deregulation, that pipeline is no longer regulated by FERC. DOT will 
continue to consider that pipeline to be an interstate pipeline 
facility.
    As seen from the examples, the types of situations in which DOT will 
not defer to the FERC regulatory scheme are generally clear-cut cases. 
For the remainder of the situations where variation from the FERC scheme 
would require DOT to replicate the forum already provided by FERC and to 
consider economic factors better left to that agency, DOT will decline 
to vary its reliance on the FERC filings unless, of course, not doing so 
would result in situations clearly not intended by the HLPSA.

Appendix B to Part 195--Risk-Based Alternative to Pressure Testing Older 
              Hazardous Liquid and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines

                         Risk-Based Alternative

    This Appendix provides guidance on how a risk-based alternative to 
pressure testing older hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines 
rule allowed by Sec. 195.303 will work. This risk-based alternative 
establishes test priorities for older pipelines, not previously pressure 
tested, based on the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment. The 
first step is to determine the classification based on the type of pipe 
or on the pipeline segment's proximity to populated or environmentally 
sensitive area. Secondly, the classifications must be adjusted based on 
the pipeline failure history, product transported, and the release 
volume potential.
    Tables 2-6 give definitions of risk classification A, B, and C 
facilities. For the purposes of this rule, pipeline segments containing 
high risk electric resistance-welded pipe (ERW pipe) and lapwelded pipe 
manufactured prior to 1970 and considered a risk classification C or B 
facility shall be treated as the top priority for testing because of the 
higher risk associated with the susceptibility of this pipe to 
longitudinal seam failures.
    In all cases, operators shall annually, at intervals not to exceed 
15 months, review their facilities to reassess the classification and 
shall take appropriate action within two years or operate the pipeline 
system at a lower pressure. Pipeline failures, changes in the 
characteristics of the pipeline route, or changes in service should all 
trigger a reassessment of the originally classification.
    Table 1 explains different levels of test requirements depending on 
the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment. The overall risk 
classification is determined based on the type of pipe involved, the 
facility's location, the product transported, the relative volume of 
flow and pipeline failure history as determined from Tables 2-6.

                                   A                      Additional pressure testing not
                                                           required.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ If operational experience indicates a history of past failures for a particular pipeline segment, failure
  causes (time-dependent defects due to corrosion, construction, manufacture, or transmission problems, etc.)
  shall be reviewed in determining risk classification (See Table 6) and the timing of the pressure test should
  be accelerated.
\2\ All pre-1970 ERW pipeline segments may not require testing. In determining which ERW pipeline segments
  should be included in this category, an operator must consider the seam-related leak history of the pipe and
  pipe manufacturing information as available, which may include the pipe steel's mechanical properties,
  including fracture toughness; the manufacturing process and controls related to seam properties, including
  whether the ERW process was high-frequency or low-frequency, whether the weld seam was heat treated, whether
  the seam was inspected, the test pressure and duration during mill hydrotest; the quality control of the steel-
  making process; and other factors pertinent to seam properties and quality.
\3\ For those pipeline operators with extensive mileage of pre-1970 ERW pipe, any waiver requests for timing
  relief should be supported by an assessment of hazards in accordance with location, product, volume, and
  probability of failure considerations consistent with Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6.
\4\ A magnetic flux leakage or ultrasonic internal inspection survey may be utilized as an alternative to
  pressure testing where leak history and operating experience do not indicate leaks caused by longitudinal
  cracks or seam failures.
\5\ Pressure tests utilizing a hydrocarbon liquid may be conducted, but only with a liquid which does not
  vaporize rapidly.

    Using LOCATION, PRODUCT, VOLUME, and FAILURE HISTORY ``Indicators'' 
from Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively, the overall risk classification 
of a given pipeline or pipeline segment can be established from Table 2. 
The LOCATION Indicator is the primary factor which determines overall 
risk, with the PRODUCT, VOLUME, and PROBABILITY OF FAILURE Indicators 
used to adjust to a higher or lower overall risk classification per the 
following table.

    Appendix C to Part 195--Guidance for Implementation of Integrity 
                           Management Program

    This Appendix gives guidance to help an operator implement the 
requirements of the integrity management program rule in Secs. 195.450 
and 195.452. Guidance is provided on:
    (1) Information an operator may use to identify a high consequence 
area and factors an operator can use to consider the potential impacts 
of a release on an area;
    (2) Risk factors an operator can use to determine an integrity 
assessment schedule;
    (3) Safety risk indicator tables for leak history, volume or line 
size, age of pipeline, and product transported, an operator may use to 
determine if a pipeline segment falls into a high, medium or low risk 
category;
    (4) Types of internal inspection tools an operator could use to find 
pipeline anomalies;
    (5) Measures an operator could use to measure an integrity 
management program's performance; and
    (6) Types of records an operator will have to maintain.
    I. Identifying a high consequence area and factors for considering a 
pipeline segment's potential impact on a high consequence area.
    A. The rule defines a High Consequence Area as a high population 
area, an other populated area, an unusually sensitive area, or a 
commercially navigable waterway. The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 
will map these areas on the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS). An 
operator, member of the public, or other government agency may view and 
download the data from the NPMS home page http://www.npms.rspa.dot.gov. 
OPS will maintain the NPMS and update it periodically. However, it is an 
operator's responsibility to ensure that it has identified all high 
consequence areas that could be affected by a pipeline segment. An 
operator is also responsible for periodically evaluating its pipeline 
segments to look for population or environmental changes that may have 
occurred around the pipeline and to keep its program current with this 
information. (Refer to Sec. 195.452(d)(3).) For more information to help 
in identifying high consequence areas, an operator may refer to:
    (1) Digital Data on populated areas available on U.S. Census Bureau 
maps.
    (2) Geographic Database on the commercial navigable waterways 
available on http://www.bts.gov/gis/ntatlas/networks.html.
    (3) The Bureau of Transportation Statistics database that includes 
commercially navigable waterways and non-commercially navigable 
waterways. The database can be

[[Page 171]]

downloaded from the BTS website at http://www.bts.gov/gis/ntatlas/
networks.html.
    B. The rule requires an operator to include a process in its program 
for identifying which pipeline segments could affect a high consequence 
area and to take measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a 
pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. (See 
Secs. 195.452 (f) and (i).) Thus, an operator will need to consider how 
each pipeline segment could affect a high consequence area. The primary 
source for the listed risk factors is a US DOT study on instrumented 
Internal Inspection devices (November 1992). Other sources include the 
National Transportation Safety Board, the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards 
Committee. The following list provides guidance to an operator on both 
the mandatory and additional factors:
    (1) Terrain surrounding the pipeline. An operator should consider 
the contour of the land profile and if it could allow the liquid from a 
release to enter a high consequence area. An operator can get this 
information from topographical maps such as U.S. Geological Survey 
quadrangle maps.
    (2) Drainage systems such as small streams and other smaller 
waterways that could serve as a conduit to a high consequence area.
    (3) Crossing of farm tile fields. An operator should consider the 
possibility of a spillage in the field following the drain tile into a 
waterway.
    (4) Crossing of roadways with ditches along the side. The ditches 
could carry a spillage to a waterway.
    (5) The nature and characteristics of the product the pipeline is 
transporting (refined products, crude oils, highly volatile liquids, 
etc.) Highly volatile liquids becomes gaseous when exposed to the 
atmosphere. A spillage could create a vapor cloud that could settle into 
the lower elevation of the ground profile.
    (6) Physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable 
suspension bridge. An operator should look for stress indicators on the 
pipeline (strained supports, inadequate support at towers), atmospheric 
corrosion, vandalism, and other obvious signs of improper maintenance.
    (7) Operating condition of pipeline (pressure, flow rate, etc.) 
Exposure of the pipeline to operating pressure exceeding established 
maximum operating pressure.
    (8) The hydraulic gradient of pipeline.
    (9) The diameter of pipeline, the potential release volume, and the 
distance between the isolation points.
    (10) Potential physical pathways between the pipeline and the high 
consequence area.
    (11) Response capability (time to respond, nature of response).
    (12) Potential natural forces inherent in the area (flood zones, 
earthquakes, subsidence areas, etc.)
    II. Risk factors for establishing frequency of assessment.
    A. By assigning weights or values to the risk factors, and using the 
risk indicator tables, an operator can determine the priority for 
assessing pipeline segments, beginning with those segments that are of 
highest risk, that have not previously been assessed. This list provides 
some guidance on some of the risk factors to consider (see 
Sec. 195.452(e)). An operator should also develop factors specific to 
each pipeline segment it is assessing, including:
    (1) Populated areas, unusually sensitive environmental areas, 
National Fish Hatcheries, commercially navigable waters, areas where 
people congregate.
    (2) Results from previous testing/inspection. (See Sec. 195.452(h).)
    (3) Leak History. (See leak history risk table.)
    (4) Known corrosion or condition of pipeline. (See Sec. 195.452(g).)
    (5) Cathodic protection history.
    (6) Type and quality of pipe coating (disbonded coating results in 
corrosion).
    (7) Age of pipe (older pipe shows more corrosion--may be uncoated or 
have an ineffective coating) and type of pipe seam. (See Age of Pipe 
risk table.)
    (8) Product transported (highly volatile, highly flammable and toxic 
liquids present a greater threat for both people and the environment) 
(see Product transported risk table.)
    (9) Pipe wall thickness (thicker walls give a better safety margin)
    (10) Size of pipe (higher volume release if the pipe ruptures).
    (11) Location related to potential ground movement (e.g., seismic 
faults, rock quarries, and coal mines); climatic (permafrost causes 
settlement--Alaska); geologic (landslides or subsidence).
    (12) Security of throughput (effects on customers if there is 
failure requiring shutdown).
    (13) Time since the last internal inspection/pressure testing.
    (14) With respect to previously discovered defects/anomalies, the 
type, growth rate, and size.
    (15) Operating stress levels in the pipeline.
    (16) Location of the pipeline segment as it relates to the ability 
of the operator to detect and respond to a leak. (e.g., pipelines deep 
underground, or in locations that make leak detection difficult without 
specific sectional monitoring and/or significantly impede access for 
spill response or any other purpose).
    (17) Physical support of the segment such as by a cable suspension 
bridge.

[[Page 172]]

    (18) Non-standard or other than recognized industry practice on 
pipeline installation (e.g., horizontal directional drilling).

    B. Example: This example illustrates a hypothetical model used to 
establish an integrity assessment schedule for a hypothetical pipeline 
segment. After we determine the risk factors applicable to the pipeline 
segment, we then assign values or numbers to each factor, such as, high 
(5), moderate (3), or low (1). We can determine an overall risk 
classification (A, B, C) for the segment using the risk tables and a 
sliding scale (values 5 to 1) for risk factors for which tables are not 
provided. We would classify a segment as C if it fell above \2/3\ of 
maximum value (highest overall risk value for any one segment when 
compared with other segments of a pipeline), a segment as B if it fell 
between \1/3\ to \2/3\ of maximum value, and the remaining segments as 
A.
    i. For the baseline assessment schedule, we would plan to assess 50% 
of all pipeline segments covered by the rule, beginning with the highest 
risk segments, within the first 3\1/2\ years and the remaining segments 
within the seven-year period. For the continuing integrity assessments, 
we would plan to assess the C segments within the first two (2) years of 
the schedule, the segments classified as moderate risk no later than 
year three or four and the remaining lowest risk segments no later than 
year five (5).
    ii. For our hypothetical pipeline segment, we have chosen the 
following risk factors and obtained risk factor values from the 
appropriate table. The values assigned to the risk factors are for 
illustration only.

Age of pipeline: assume 30 years old (refer to ``Age of Pipeline'' risk 
          table)--
Risk Value=5
Pressure tested: tested once during construction--
Risk Value=5
Coated: (yes/no)--yes
Coating Condition: Recent excavation of suspected areas showed holidays 
          in coating (potential corrosion risk)--
Risk Value=5
Cathodically Protected: (yes/no)--yes--Risk Value=1
Date cathodic protection installed: five years after pipeline was 
          constructed (Cathodic protection installed within one year of 
          the pipeline's construction is generally considered low 
          risk.)--Risk Value=3
Close interval survey: (yes/no)--no--Risk Value =5
Internal Inspection tool used: (yes/no)--yes. Date of pig run? In last 
          five years--Risk Value=1
Anomalies found: (yes/no)--yes, but do not pose an immediate safety risk 
          or environmental hazard--Risk Value=3
Leak History: yes, one spill in last 10 years. (refer to ``Leak 
          History'' risk table)--Risk Value=2
Product transported: Diesel fuel. Product low risk. (refer to 
          ``Product'' risk table)--Risk Value=1
Pipe size: 16 inches. Size presents moderate risk (refer to ``Line 
          Size'' risk table)--Risk Value=3
    iii. Overall risk value for this hypothetical segment of pipe is 34. 
Assume we have two other pipeline segments for which we conduct similar 
risk rankings. The second pipeline segment has an overall risk value of 
20, and the third segment, 11. For the baseline assessment we would 
establish a schedule where we assess the first segment (highest risk 
segment) within two years, the second segment within five years and the 
third segment within seven years. Similarly, for the continuing 
integrity assessment, we could establish an assessment schedule where we 
assess the highest risk segment no later than the second year, the 
second segment no later than the third year, and the third segment no 
later than the fifth year.
    III. Safety risk indicator tables for leak history, volume or line 
size, age of pipeline, and product transported.

    IV. Types of internal inspection tools to use.
    An operator should consider at least two types of internal 
inspection tools for the integrity assessment from the following list. 
The type of tool or tools an operator selects will depend on the results 
from previous internal inspection runs, information analysis and risk 
factors specific to the pipeline segment:
    (1) Geometry Internal inspection tools for detecting changes to 
ovality, e.g., bends, dents, buckles or wrinkles, due to construction 
flaws or soil movement, or other outside force damage;
    (2) Metal Loss Tools (Ultrasonic and Magnetic Flux Leakage) for 
determining pipe wall anomalies, e.g., wall loss due to corrosion.
    (3) Crack Detection Tools for detecting cracks and crack-like 
features, e.g., stress corrosion cracking (SCC), fatigue cracks, narrow 
axial corrosion, toe cracks, hook cracks, etc.
    V. Methods to measure performance.
    A. General. (1) This guidance is to help an operator establish 
measures to evaluate the effectiveness of its integrity management 
program. The performance measures required will depend on the details of 
each integrity management program and will be based on an understanding 
and analysis of the failure mechanisms or threats to integrity of each 
pipeline segment.
    (2) An operator should select a set of measurements to judge how 
well its program is performing. An operator's objectives for its program 
are to ensure public safety, prevent or minimize leaks and spills and 
prevent property and environmental damage. A typical integrity 
management program will be an ongoing program and it may contain many 
elements. Therefore, several performance measure are likely to be needed 
to measure the effectiveness of an ongoing program.
    B. Performance measures. These measures show how a program to 
control risk on pipeline segments that could affect a high consequence 
area is progressing under the integrity management requirements. 
Performance measures generally fall into three categories:
    (1) Selected Activity Measures--Measures that monitor the 
surveillance and preventive activities the operator has implemented. 
These measure indicate how well an operator is implementing the various 
elements of its integrity management program.
    (2) Deterioration Measures--Operation and maintenance trends that 
indicate when the integrity of the system is weakening despite 
preventive measures. This category of performance measure may indicate 
that the system condition is deteriorating despite well executed 
preventive activities.
    (3) Failure Measures--Leak History, incident response, product loss, 
etc. These measures will indicate progress towards fewer spills and less 
damage.
    C. Internal vs. External Comparisons. These comparisons show how a 
pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence area is 
progressing in comparison to the operator's other pipeline segments that 
are not covered by the integrity management requirements and how that 
pipeline segment compares to other operators' pipeline segments.
    (1) Internal--Comparing data from the pipeline segment that could 
affect the high consequence area with data from pipeline segments in 
other areas of the system may indicate the effects from the attention 
given to the high consequence area.
    (2) External--Comparing data external to the pipeline segment (e.g., 
OPS incident data) may provide measures on the frequency and size of 
leaks in relation to other companies.
    D. Examples. Some examples of performance measures an operator could 
use include--
    (1) A performance measurement goal to reduce the total volume from 
unintended releases by -% (percent to be determined by operator) with an 
ultimate goal of zero.
    (2) A performance measurement goal to reduce the total number of 
unintended releases (based on a threshold of 5 gallons) by ____-% 
(percent to be determined by operator) with an ultimate goal of zero.
    (3) A performance measurement goal to document the percentage of 
integrity management activities completed during the calendar year.
    (4) A performance measurement goal to track and evaluate the 
effectiveness of the operator's community outreach activities.
    (5) A narrative description of pipeline system integrity, including 
a summary of performance improvements, both qualitative and 
quantitative, to an operator's integrity management program prepared 
periodically.
    (6) A performance measure based on internal audits of the operator's 
pipeline system per 49 CFR Part 195.
    (7) A performance measure based on external audits of the operator's 
pipeline system per 49 CFR Part 195.
    (8) A performance measure based on operational events (for example: 
relief occurrences, unplanned valve closure, SCADA outages, etc.) that 
have the potential to adversely affect pipeline integrity.
    (9) A performance measure to demonstrate that the operator's 
integrity management program reduces risk over time with a focus on high 
risk items.
    (10) A performance measure to demonstrate that the operator's 
integrity management program for pipeline stations and terminals reduces 
risk over time with a focus on high risk items.

[[Page 175]]

    VI. Examples of types of records an operator must maintain.
    The rule requires an operator to maintain certain records. (See 
Sec. 195.452(l)). This section provides examples of some records that an 
operator would have to maintain for inspection to comply with the 
requirement. This is not an exhaustive list.
    (1) a process for identifying which pipelines could affect a high 
consequence area and a document identifying all pipeline segments that 
could affect a high consequence area;
    (2) a plan for baseline assessment of the line pipe that includes 
each required plan element;
    (3) modifications to the baseline plan and reasons for the 
modification;
    (4) use of and support for an alternative practice;
    (5) a framework addressing each required element of the integrity 
management program, updates and changes to the initial framework and 
eventual program;
    (6) a process for identifying a new high consequence area and 
incorporating it into the baseline plan, particularly, a process for 
identifying population changes around a pipeline segment;
    (7) an explanation of methods selected to assess the integrity of 
line pipe;
    (8) a process for review of integrity assessment results and data 
analysis by a person qualified to evaluate the results and data;
    (9) the process and risk factors for determining the baseline 
assessment interval;
    (10) results of the baseline integrity assessment;
    (11) the process used for continual evaluation, and risk factors 
used for determining the frequency of evaluation;
    (12) process for integrating and analyzing information about the 
integrity of a pipeline, information and data used for the information 
analysis;
    (13) results of the information analyses and periodic evaluations;
    (14) the process and risk factors for establishing continual re-
assessment intervals;
    (15) justification to support any variance from the required re-
assessment intervals;
    (16) integrity assessment results and anomalies found, process for 
evaluating and repairing anomalies, criteria for repair actions and 
actions taken to evaluate and repair the anomalies;
    (17) other remedial actions planned or taken;
    (18) schedule for reviewing and analyzing integrity assessment 
results;
    (19) schedule for evaluation and repair of anomalies, justification 
to support deviation from required repair times;
    (20) risk analysis used to identify additional preventive or 
mitigative measures, records of preventive and mitigative actions 
planned or taken;

<R05>
Sec. 198.11  Grant authority.

    The pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.) authorize the 
Administrator to pay out funds appropriated or otherwise make available 
up to 50 percent of the cost of the personnel, equipment, and activities 
reasonably required for each state agency to carry out a safety program 
for intrastate pipeline facilities under a certification or agreement 
with the Administrator or to act as an agent of the Administrator with 
respect to interstate pipeline facilities.

[Amdt. 198-2, 61 FR 18518, Apr. 26, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 198.13  Grant allocation formula.

    (a) Beginning in calendar year 1993, the Administrator places 
increasing emphasis on program performance in allocating state agency 
funds under Sec. 198.11. The maximum percent of each state agency 
allocation that is based on performance follows: 1993--75 percent; 1994 
and subsequent years--100 percent.
    (b) A state's annual grant allocation is based on maximum of 100 
performance points derived as follows:
    (1) Fifty points based on information provided in the state's annual 
certification/agreement attachments which document its activities for 
the past year; and
    (2) Fifty points based on the annual state program evaluation.
    (c) The Administrator assigns weights to various performance factors 
reflecting program compliance, safety priorities, and national concerns 
identified by the Administrator and communicated to each State agency. 
At a minimum, the Administrator considers the following performance 
factors in allocating funds:
    (1) Adequacy of state operating practices;
    (2) Quality of state inspections, investigations, and enforcement/
compliance actions;
    (3) Adequacy of state recordkeeping;
    (4) Extent of state safety regulatory jurisdiction over pipeline 
facilities;
    (5) Qualifications of state inspectors;
    (6) Number of state inspection person-days;
    (7) State adoption of applicable federal pipeline safety standards; 
and
    (8) Any other factor the Administrator deems necessary to measure 
performance.
    (d) Notwithstanding these performance factors, the Administrator 
may, in 1993 and subsequent years, continue funding any state at the 
1991 level, provided its request is at the 1991 level or higher and 
appropriated funds are at the 1991 level or higher.
    (e) The Administrator notifies each state agency in writing of the 
specific performance factors to be used and the

[[Page 177]]

weights to be assigned to each factor at least 9 months prior to 
allocating funds. Prior to notification, RSPA seeks state agency 
comments on any proposed changes to the allocation formula.
    (f) Grants are limited to the appropriated funds available. If total 
state agency requests for grants exceed the funds available, the 
Administrator prorates each state agency's allocation.

<R05>
Sec. 198.35  Grants conditioned on adoption of one-call damage prevention program.

    In allocating grants to State agencies under the pipeline safety 
laws, (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), the Secretary considers whether a State 
has adopted or is seeking to adopt a one-call damage prevention program 
in accordance with Sec. 198.37. If a State has not adopted or is not 
seeking to adopt such program, the State agency may not receive the full 
reimbursement to which it would otherwise be entitled.

[Amdt. 198-2, 61 FR 38403, July 24, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 198.37  State one-call damage prevention program.

    A State must adopt a one-call damage prevention program that 
requires each of the following at a minimum:
    (a) Each area of the State that contains underground pipeline 
facilities must be covered by a one-call notification system.
    (b) Each one-call notification system must be operated in accordance 
with Sec. 198.39.
    (c) Excavators must be required to notify the operational center of 
the one-call notification system that covers the area of each intended 
excavation activity and provide the following information:
    (1) Name of the person notifying the system.
    (2) Name, address and telephone number of the excavator.
    (3) Specific location, starting date, and description of the 
intended excavation activity.

However, an excavator must be allowed to begin an excavation activity in 
an emergency but, in doing so, required to notify the operational center 
at the earliest practicable moment.
    (d) The State must determine whether telephonic and other 
communications to the operational center of a one-call notification 
system under paragraph (c) of this section are to be toll free or not.
    (e) Except with respect to interstate transmission facilities as 
defined in the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), operators 
of underground pipeline facilities must be required to participate in 
the one-call notification systems that cover the areas of the State in 
which those pipeline facilities are located.
    (f) Operators of underground pipeline facilities participating in 
the one-call notification systems must be required to respond in the 
manner prescribed by Sec. 192.614 (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this chapter 
to notices of intended excavation activity received from the operational 
center of a one-call notification system.
    (g) Persons who operate one-call notification systems or operators 
of underground pipeline facilities participating or required to 
participate in the one-call notification systems must be required to 
notify the public and known excavators in the manner prescribed by 
Sec. 192.614 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this chapter of the availability and 
use of one-call notification systems to locate underground pipeline 
facilities. However, this paragraph does not apply to persons (including 
operator's master meters) whose primary activity does not include the 
production, transportation or marketing of gas or hazardous liquids.
    (h) Operators of underground pipeline facilities (other than 
operators of

[[Page 178]]

interstate transmission facilities as defined in the pipeline safety 
laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), and interstate pipelines as defined in 
Sec. 195.2 of this chapter), excavators and persons who operate one-call 
notification systems who violate the applicable requirements of this 
subpart must be subject to civil penalties and injunctive relief that 
are substantially the same as are provided under the pipeline safety 
laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.).

underground pipeline facilities the information received from excavators 
about intended excavation activities.
    (d) It maintains a record of each notice of intent to engage in an 
excavation activity for the minimum time set by the State or, in the 
absence of such time, for the time specified in the applicable State 
statute of limitations on tort actions.
    (e) It tells persons giving notice of an intent to engage in an 
excavation activity the names of participating operators of underground 
pipeline facilities to whom the notice will be transmitted.

<R05>
Sec. 199.105  Drug tests required.

    Each operator shall conduct the following drug tests for the 
presence of a prohibited drug:
    (a) Pre-employment testing. No operator may hire or contract for the 
use of any person as an employee unless that person passes a drug test 
or is covered by an anti-drug program that conforms to the requirements 
of this part.
    (b) Post-accident testing. As soon as possible but no later than 32 
hours after an accident, an operator shall drug test each employee whose 
performance either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely 
discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. An operator may 
decide not to test under this paragraph but such a decision must be 
based on the best information available immediately after the accident 
that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the 
accident or that, because of the time between that performance and the 
accident, it is not likely that a drug test would reveal whether the 
performance was affected by drug use.
    (c) Random testing. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) 
through (4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for 
random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees.
    (2) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported 
positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this 
determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this 
subpart. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator 
considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain 
additional information or reports from operators, and may make 
appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. 
Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the 
minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered 
employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug 
testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year 
following publication.
    (3) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of 
all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data 
received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 199.119 for two 
consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is 
less than 1.0 percent.
    (4) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of 
Sec. 199.119 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive 
rate is equal to or

[[Page 182]]

greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all 
covered employees.
    (5) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made 
by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a 
computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' 
Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other 
comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each 
covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time 
selections are made.
    (6) The operator shall randomly select a sufficient number of 
covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an 
annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random 
drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the operator conducts 
random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be 
tested may be calculated for each individual operator or may be based on 
the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are 
subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage 
rate under this subpart or any DOT drug testing rule.
    (7) Each operator shall ensure that random drug tests conducted 
under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates for administering 
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (8) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing 
under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same 
operator, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency 
regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.
    (9) If an operator is required to conduct random drug testing under 
the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the operator may--
    (i) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same 
required rate; or
    (ii) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to 
which the operator is subject.
    (d) Testing based on reasonable cause. Each operator shall drug test 
each employee when there is reasonable cause to believe the employee is 
using a prohibited drug. The decision to test must be based on a 
reasonable and articulable belief that the employee is using a 
prohibited drug on the basis of specific, contemporaneous physical, 
behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drug use. At least two 
of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of 
the possible symptoms of drug use, shall substantiate and concur in the 
decision to test an employee. The concurrence between the two 
supervisors may be by telephone. However, in the case of operators with 
50 or fewer employees subject to testing under this part, only one 
supervisor of the employee trained in detecting possible drug use 
symptoms shall substantiate the decision to test.
    (e) Return-to-duty testing. A covered employee who refuses to take 
or has a positive drug test may not return to duty in the covered 
function until the covered employee has complied with applicable 
provisions of DOT Procedures concerning substance abuse professionals 
and the return-to-duty process.
    (f) Follow-up testing. A covered employee who refuses to take or has 
a positive drug test shall be subject to unannounced follow-up drug 
tests administered by the operator following the covered employee's 
return to duty. The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall 
be determined by a substance abuse professional, but shall consist of at 
least six tests in the first 12 months following the covered employee's 
return to duty. In addition, follow-up testing may include testing for 
alcohol as directed by the substance abuse professional, to be performed 
in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 
months from the date of the covered employee's return to duty. The 
substance abuse professional may terminate the requirement for follow-up 
testing at any time after the first six

[[Page 183]]

tests have been administered, if the substance abuse professional 
determines that such testing is no longer necessary.

    (a) MRO appointment. Each operator shall designate or appoint a 
medical review officer (MRO). If an operator does not have a qualified 
individual on staff to serve as MRO, the operator may contract for the 
provision of MRO services as part of its anti-drug program.
    (b) MRO qualifications. Each MRO must be a licensed physician who 
has the qualifications required by DOT Procedures.
    (c) MRO duties. The MRO must perform functions for the operator as 
required by DOT Procedures.
    (d) MRO reports. The MRO must report all drug test results to the 
operator in accordance with DOT Procedures.
    (e) Evaluation and rehabilitation may be provided by the operator, 
by a substance abuse professional under contract with the operator, or 
by a substance abuse professional not affiliated with the operator. The 
choice of substance abuse professional and assignment of costs shall be 
made in accordance with the operator/employee agreements and operator/
employee policies.
    (f) The operator shall ensure that a substance abuse professional, 
who determines that a covered employee requires assistance in resolving 
problems with drug abuse, does not refer the covered employee to the 
substance abuse professional's private practice or to a person or 
organization from which the substance abuse professional receives 
remuneration or in which the substance abuse professional has a 
financial interest. This paragraph does not prohibit a substance abuse 
professional from referring a covered employee for assistance provided 
through:
    (1) A public agency, such as a State, county, or municipality;
    (2) The operator or a person under contract to provide treatment for 
drug problems on behalf of the operator;
    (3) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment under 
the employee's health insurance program; or
    (4) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment 
reasonably accessible to the employee.

Sec. 199.111  Retention of samples and additional testing.

    (a) Samples that yield positive results on confirmation must be 
retained by the laboratory in properly secured, long-term, frozen 
storage for at least 365 days as required by the DOT Procedures. Within 
this 365-day period, the employee or the employee's representative, the 
operator, the Administrator, or, if the operator is subject to the 
jurisdiction of a state agency, the state agency may request that the 
laboratory retain the sample for an additional period. If, within the 
365-day period, the laboratory has not received a proper written request 
to retain the sample for a further reasonable period specified in the 
request, the sample may be discarded following the end of the 365-day 
period.

[[Page 184]]

    (b) If the medical review officer (MRO) determines there is no 
legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive test result 
other than the unauthorized use of a prohibited drug, and if timely 
additional testing is requested by the employee according to DOT 
Procedures, the split specimen must be tested. The employee may specify 
testing by the original laboratory or by a second laboratory that is 
certified by the Department of Health and Human Services. The operator 
may require the employee to pay in advance the cost of shipment (if any) 
and reanalysis of the sample, but the employee must be reimbursed for 
such expense if the additional test is negative.
    (c) If the employee specifies testing by a second laboratory, the 
original laboratory must follow approved chain-of-custody procedures in 
transferring a portion of the sample.
    (d) Since some analytes may deteriorate during storage, detected 
levels of the drug below the detection limits established in the DOT 
Procedures, but equal to or greater than the established sensitivity of 
the assay, must, as technically appropriate, be reported and considered 
corroborative of the original positive results.

Sec. 199.113  Employee assistance program.

    (a) Each operator shall provide an employee assistance program (EAP) 
for its employees and supervisory personnel who will determine whether 
an employee must be drug tested based on reasonable cause. The operator 
may establish the EAP as a part of its internal personnel services or 
the operator may contract with an entity that provides EAP services. 
Each EAP must include education and training on drug use. At the 
discretion of the operator, the EAP may include an opportunity for 
employee rehabilitation.
    (b) Education under each EAP must include at least the following 
elements: display and distribution of informational material; display 
and distribution of a community service hot-line telephone number for 
employee assistance; and display and distribution of the employer's 
policy regarding the use of prohibited drugs.
    (c) Training under each EAP for supervisory personnel who will 
determine whether an employee must be drug tested based on reasonable 
cause must include one 60-minute period of training on the specific, 
contemporaneous physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of 
probable drug use.

    With respect to those employees who are contractors or employed by a 
contractor, an operator may provide by contract that the drug testing, 
education, and training required by this part be carried out by the 
contractor provided:
    (a) The operator remains responsible for ensuring that the 
requirements of this part are complied with; and
    (b) The contractor allows access to property and records by the 
operator, the Administrator, and if the operator is subject to the

Sec. 199.209  Other requirements imposed by operators.

    (a) Except as expressly provided in this subpart, nothing in this 
subpart shall be construed to affect the authority of operators, or the 
rights of employees, with respect to the use or possession of alcohol, 
including authority and rights with respect to alcohol testing and 
rehabilitation.
    (b) Operators may, but are not required to, conduct pre-employment 
alcohol testing under this subpart. Each operator that conducts pre-
employment alcohol testing must--
    (1) Conduct a pre-employment alcohol test before the first 
performance of covered functions by every covered employee (whether a 
new employee or someone who has transferred to a position involving the 
performance of covered functions);
    (2) Treat all covered employees the same for the purpose of pre-
employment alcohol testing (i.e., you must not test some covered 
employees and not others);
    (3) Conduct the pre-employment tests after making a contingent offer 
of employment or transfer, subject to the employee passing the pre-
employment alcohol test;
    (4) Conduct all pre-employment alcohol tests using the alcohol 
testing procedures in DOT Procedures; and
    (5) Not allow any covered employee to begin performing covered 
functions unless the result of the employee's test indicates an alcohol 
concentration of less than 0.04.

<R05>
Sec. 199.211  Requirement for notice.

    Before performing an alcohol test under this subpart, each operator 
shall notify a covered employee that the alcohol test is required by 
this subpart. No operator shall falsely represent that a test is 
administered under this subpart.

[[Page 187]]


<R05>
Sec. 199.213  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 199.215  Alcohol concentration.

    Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee from reporting for 
duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of covered functions 
while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. No operator 
having actual knowledge that a covered employee has an alcohol 
concentration of 0.04 or greater shall permit the employee to perform or 
continue to perform covered functions.


<R05>
Sec. 199.217  On-duty use.

    Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee from using alcohol 
while performing covered functions. No operator having actual knowledge 
that a covered employee is using alcohol while performing covered 
functions shall permit the employee to perform or continue to perform 
covered functions.


<R05>
Sec. 199.219  Pre-duty use.

    Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee from using alcohol 
within four hours prior to performing covered functions, or, if an 
employee is called to duty to respond to an emergency, within the time 
period after the employee has been notified to report for duty. No 
operator having actual knowledge that a covered employee has used 
alcohol within four hours prior to performing covered functions or 
within the time period after the employee has been notified to report 
for duty shall permit that covered employee to perform or continue to 
perform covered functions.


<R05>
Sec. 199.221  Use following an accident.

    Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee who has actual 
knowledge of an accident in which his or her performance of covered 
functions has not been discounted by the operator as a contributing 
factor to the accident from using alcohol for eight hours following the 
accident, unless he or she has been given a post-accident test under 
Sec. 199.225(a), or the operator has determined that the employee's 
performance could not have contributed to the accident.


<R05>
Sec. 199.223  Refusal to submit to a required alcohol test.

    Each operator shall require a covered employee to submit to a post-
accident alcohol test required under Sec. 199.225(a), a reasonable 
suspicion alcohol test required under Sec. 199.225(b), or a follow-up 
alcohol test required under Sec. 199.225(d). No operator shall permit an 
employee who refuses to submit to such a test to perform or continue to 
perform covered functions.


<R05>
Sec. 199.225  Alcohol tests required.

    Each operator shall conduct the following types of alcohol tests for 
the presence of alcohol:
    (a) Post-accident. (1) As soon as practicable following an accident, 
each operator shall test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if 
that employee's performance of a covered function either contributed to 
the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor 
to the accident. The decision not to administer a test under this 
section shall be based on the operator's determination, using the best 
available information at the time of the determination, that the covered 
employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident.
    (2)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
2 hours following the accident, the operator shall prepare and maintain 
on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly 
administered. If a test required by paragraph (a) is not administered 
within 8 hours following the accident, the operator shall cease attempts 
to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons 
for not administering the test.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing who 
fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying 
the operator or operator representative of his/her location if he/she 
leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, may 
be deemed by the operator to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing 
in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary 
medical attention for injured people following an accident or to 
prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an

[[Page 188]]

accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to 
the accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.
    (b) Reasonable suspicion testing. (1) Each operator shall require a 
covered employee to submit to an alcohol test when the operator has 
reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the 
prohibitions in this subpart.
    (2) The operator's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to 
require the covered employee to undergo an alcohol test shall be based 
on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the 
appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the employee. The 
required observations shall be made by a supervisor who is trained in 
detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse. The supervisor who makes the 
determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall not conduct the 
breath alcohol test on that employee.
    (3) Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the 
observations required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section are made 
during, just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that 
the employee is required to be in compliance with this subpart. A 
covered employee may be directed by the operator to undergo reasonable 
suspicion testing for alcohol only while the employee is performing 
covered functions; just before the employee is to perform covered 
functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing covered 
functions.
    (4)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
2 hours following the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, the operator shall prepare and maintain on file a record 
stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test 
required by this section is not administered within 8 hours following 
the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the operator 
shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in 
the record the reasons for not administering the test. Records shall be 
submitted to RSPA upon request of the Administrator.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol 
test under this section, an operator shall not permit a covered employee 
to report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of 
covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or 
impaired by alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance 
indicators of alcohol misuse, nor shall an operator permit the covered 
employee to perform or continue to perform covered functions, until:
    (A) An alcohol test is administered and the employee's alcohol 
concentration measures less than 0.02; or
    (B) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty 
period, but not less than 8 hours following the determination under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there is reasonable suspicion to 
believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions in this subpart.
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii), no operator shall 
take any action under this subpart against a covered employee based 
solely on the employee's behavior and appearance in the absence of an 
alcohol test. This does not prohibit an operator with the authority 
independent of this subpart from taking any action otherwise consistent 
with law.
    (c) Return-to-duty testing. Each operator shall ensure that before a 
covered employee returns to duty requiring the performance of a covered 
function after engaging in conduct prohibited by Secs. 199.215 through 
199.223, the employee shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a 
result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
    (d) Follow-up testing. (1) Following a determination under 
Sec. 199.243(b) that a covered employee is in need of assistance in 
resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse, each operator shall 
ensure that the employee is subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol 
testing as directed by a substance abuse professional in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 199.243(c)(2)(ii).
    (2) Follow-up testing shall be conducted when the covered employee 
is

[[Page 189]]

performing covered functions; just before the employee is to perform 
covered functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such 
functions.
    (e) Retesting of covered employees with an alcohol concentration of 
0.02 or greater but less than 0.04. Each operator shall retest a covered 
employee to ensure compliance with the provisions of Sec. 199.237, if an 
operator chooses to permit the employee to perform a covered function 
within 8 hours following the administration of an alcohol test 
indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 
0.04.

<R05>
Sec. 199.243  Referral, evaluation, and treatment.

    (a) Each covered employee who has engaged in conduct prohibited by 
Secs. 199.215 through 199.223 of this subpart shall be advised of the 
resources available to the covered employee in evaluating and resolving 
problems associated with the misuse of alcohol, including the names, 
addresses, and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals and 
counseling and treatment programs.
    (b) Each covered employee who engages in conduct prohibited under

alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
    (2) In addition, each covered employee identified as needing 
assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse--
    (i) Shall be evaluated by a substance abuse professional to 
determine that the employee has properly followed any rehabilitation 
program prescribed under paragraph (b) of this section, and
    (ii) Shall be subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol tests 
administered by the operator following the employee's return to duty. 
The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall be determined 
by a substance abuse professional, but shall consist of at least six 
tests in the first 12 months following the employee's return to duty. In 
addition, follow-up testing may include testing for drugs, as directed 
by the substance abuse professional, to be performed in accordance with 
49 CFR part 40. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the 
date of the employee's return to duty. The substance abuse professional 
may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after 
the first six tests have been administered, if the substance abuse 
professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.
    (d) Evaluation and rehabilitation may be provided by the operator, 
by a substance abuse professional under contract with the operator, or 
by a substance abuse professional not affiliated with the operator. The 
choice of substance abuse professional and assignment of costs shall be 
made in accordance with the operator/employee agreements and operator/
employee policies.
    (e) The operator shall ensure that a substance abuse professional 
who determines that a covered employee requires assistance in resolving
