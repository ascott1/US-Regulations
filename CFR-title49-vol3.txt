                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call (202) 523-4534.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.

[[Page vii]]

    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 190.5  Service.

    (a) Each order, notice, or other document required to be served 
under this part shall be served personally or by registered or certified 
mail.
    (b) Service upon a person's duly authorized representative or agent 
constitutes service upon that person.
    (c) Service by registered or certified mail is complete upon 
mailing. An official U. S. Postal Service receipt from the registered or 
certified mailing constitutes prima facie evidence of service.


<R05>
Sec. 190.7  Subpoenas; witness fees.

    (a) The Administrator, RSPA, the Chief Counsel, RSPA, or the 
official designated by the Administrator, RSPA, to preside over a 
hearing convened in accordance with this part, may sign and issue 
subpoenas individually on their own initiative or, upon request and 
adequate showing by any person participating in the proceeding that the 
information sought will materially advance the proceeding.
    (b) A subpoena may require the attendance of a witness, or the 
production of documentary or other tangible evidence in the possession 
or under the control of person served, or both.
    (c) A subpoena may be served personally by any person who is not an 
interested person and is not less than 18 years of age, or by certified 
or registered mail.
    (d) Service of a subpoena upon the person named therein shall be 
made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to such person and by 
tendering the fees for one day's attendance and mileage as specified by 
paragraph (g) of this section. When a subpoena is issued at the instance 
of any officer or agency of the United States, fees and mileage need not 
be tendered at the time of service. Delivery of a copy of a subpoena and 
tender of the fees to a natural person may be made by handing them to 
the person, leaving them at the person's office with the person in 
charge thereof, leaving them at the person's dwelling place or usual 
place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then 
residing therein, by mailing them by registered or certified mail to the 
person at the last known address, or by any method whereby actual notice 
is given to the person and the fees are made available prior to the 
return date.
    (e) When the person to be served is not a natural person, delivery 
of a copy of the subpoena and tender of the fees may be effected by 
handing them to a designated agent or representative for service, or to 
any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of the person, 
or by mailing them by registered or certified mail to that agent or 
representative and the fees are made available prior to the return date.
    (f) The original subpoena bearing a certificate of service shall be 
filed with the official having responsibility for the proceeding in 
connection with which the subpoena was issued.
    (g) A subpoenaed witness shall be paid the same fees and mileage as 
would be paid to a witness in a proceeding in the district courts of the 
United States. The witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the person 
at whose instance the subpoena was issued.
    (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section, 
and upon request, the witness fees and mileage may be paid by the RSPA 
if the official who issued the subpoena determines on the basis of good 
cause shown, that:
    (1) The presence of the subpoenaed witness will materially advance 
the proceeding; and

[[Page 9]]

    (2) The person at whose instance the subpoena was issued would 
suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness fees and 
mileage.
    (i) Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, prior to the time 
specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than 10 days 
after the date of service of such subpoena, apply to the official who 
issued the subpoena, or if the person is unavailable, to the 
Administrator, RSPA to quash or modify the subpoena. The application 
shall contain a brief statement of the reasons relied upon in support of 
the action sought therein. The Administrator, RSPA, or this issuing 
official, as the case may be, may:
    (1) Deny the application;
    (2) Quash or modify the subpoena; or
    (3) Condition a grant or denial of the application to quash or 
modify the subpoena upon the satisfaction of certain just and reasonable

not submitted within the time prescribed, the case shall proceed to 
final action without the material.
    (j) After submission of all materials during and after the hearing, 
the presiding official shall prepare a written recommendation as to 
final action in the case. This recommendation, along with any material 
submitted during and after the hearing, shall be included in the case

                             Specific Relief


<R05>
Sec. 190.233  Hazardous facility orders.

    (a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, if the 
Associate Administrator, OPS finds, after reasonable notice and 
opportunity for hearing in accord with paragraph (c) of this section, 
and Sec. 190.211(a), a particular pipeline facility to be hazardous to 
life or property, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall issue an order 
pursuant to this section requiring the owner or operator of the facility 
to take corrective action. Corrective action may include suspended or 
restricted use of the facility, physical inspection, testing, repair, 
replacement, or other action, as appropriate.
    (b) The Associate Administrator, OPS may waive the requirement for 
notice and hearing under paragraph (a) of this section before issuing an 
order pursuant to this section when the Associate Administrator, OPS 
determines that the failure to do so would result in the likelihood of 
serious harm to life or property. However, the Associate Administrator, 
OPS shall include in the

[[Page 16]]

order an opportunity for hearing as soon as practicable after issuance 
of the order. The provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section apply 
to an owner or operator's decision to exercise such an opportunity for 
hearing. The purpose of such a post-order hearing is for the Associate 
Administrator, OPS to determine whether the order should remain in 
effect or be rescinded or suspended in accord with paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (c) Notice and hearing:
    (1) Written notice that OPS intends to issue an order under this 
section shall be served in accordance with Sec. 190.5, upon the owner or 
operator of an alleged hazardous facility. The notice shall allege the 
existence of a hazardous facility, stating the facts and circumstances 
supporting the issuance of a ``hazardous facility order'', and providing 
the owner or operator an opportunity for a hearing, identifying the time 
and location of the hearing.
    (2) An owner or operator elects to exercise his opportunity for a 
hearing under this section, by notifying the Associate Administrator, 
OPS of that election in writing within 10 days of service of the notice 
provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or, under paragraph (b) 
of this section when applicable. Absence of such written notification 
waives an owner or operator's opportunity for a hearing and allows the 
Associate Administrator, OPS to proceed to issue a ``hazardous facility 
order'' in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section.
    (3) A hearing under this section shall be presided over by an 
attorney from the Office of Chief Counsel, Research and Special Programs 
Administration, acting as Presiding Official, and conducted without 
strict adherence to rules of evidence. The Presiding Official presents 
the allegations contained in the notice issued under this section. The 
owner or operator of the alleged hazardous facility may submit any 
relevant information or materials, call witnesses and present arguments 
on the issue of whether or not a ``hazardous facility order'' should be 
issued.
    (4) Within 48 hours after conclusion of a hearing under this 
section, the Presiding Official shall submit a recommendation to the 
Associate Administrator, OPS as to whether or not a ``hazardous facility 
order'' is required. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the Associate 
Administrator, OPS shall proceed in accordance with paragraphs (d) 
through (h) of this section. If the Associate Administrator, OPS finds 
the facility to be hazardous to life or property the Associate 
Administrator, OPS shall issue an order in accordance with this section. 
If the Associate Administrator, OPS does not find the facility to be 
hazardous to life or property, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall 
dismiss the allegations contained in the notice, and promptly notify the 
owner or operator in writing by service as prescribed in Sec. 190.5.
    (d) The Associate Administrator, OPS may find a pipeline facility to 
be hazardous under paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) If under the facts and circumstances the Associate 
Administrator, OPS determines the particular facility is hazardous to 
life or property; or
    (2) If the pipeline facility or a component thereof has been 
constructed or operated with any equipment, material, or technique which 
the Associate Administrator, OPS determines is hazardous to life or 
property, unless the operator involved demonstrates to the satisfaction 
of the Associate Administrator, OPS that, under the particular facts and 
circumstances involved, such equipment, material, or technique is not 
hazardous to life or property.
    (e) In making a determination under paragraph (d) of this section, 
the Associate Administrator, OPS shall consider, if relevant:
    (1) The characteristics of the pipe and other equipment used in the 
pipeline facility involved, including its age, manufacturer, physical 
properties (including its resistance to corrosion and deterioration), 
and the method of its manufacture, construction or assembly;
    (2) The nature of the materials transported by such facility 
(including their corrosive and deteriorative qualities), the sequence in 
which such materials are transported, and the pressure required for such 
transportation;

[[Page 17]]

    (3) The aspects of the areas in which the pipeline facility is 
located, in particular the climatic and geologic conditions (including 
soil characteristics) associated with such areas, and the population 
density and population and growth patterns of such areas;
    (4) Any recommendation of the National Transportation Safety Board 
issued in connection with any investigation conducted by the Board; and
    (5) Such other factors as the Associate Administrator, OPS may 
consider appropriate.
    (f) The order shall contain the following information:
    (1) A finding that the pipeline facility is hazardous to life or 
property.
    (2) The relevant facts which form the basis for that finding.
    (3) The legal basis for the order.
    (4) The nature and description of particular corrective action 
required of the respondent.
    (5) The date by which the required action must be taken, or 
completed and, where appropriate, the duration of the order.
    (6) If a hearing has been waived pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section, a statement that an opportunity for a hearing is provided at a 
particular location and at a certain time after issuance of the order.
    (g) The Associate Administrator, OPS shall rescind or suspend a 
hazardous facility order whenever the Associate Administrator, OPS 
determines that the facility is no longer hazardous to life or property. 
When appropriate, however, such a rescission or suspension may be 
accompanied by a notice of probable violation issued under Sec. 190.207.
    (h) At any time after an order issued under this section has become 
effective, the Associate Administrator, OPS may request the Attorney 
General to bring an action for appropriate relief in accordance with 
Sec. 190.235.
    (i) Upon petition by the Attorney General, the District Courts of 
the United States shall have jurisdiction, to enforce orders issued 
under this section by appropriate means.

<R05>
Sec. 190.235  Injunctive action.

    Whenever it appears to the Associate Administrator, OPS that a 
person has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in any act or 
practice constituting a violation of any provision of 49 U.S.C. 60101 et 
seq. or any regulations issued thereunder, the Administrator, RSPA, or 
the person to whom the authority has been delegated, may request the 
Attorney General to bring an action in the appropriate U.S. District 
Court for such relief as is necessary or appropriate, including 
mandatory or prohibitive injunctive relief, interim equitable relief, 
and punitive damages as provided under 49 U.S.C. 60120 and 49 U.S.C. 
5123.

<R05>
190.237  Amendment of plans or procedures.

    (a) A Regional Director begins a proceeding to determine whether an 
operator's plans or procedures required under parts 192, 193, 195, and 
199 of this subchapter are inadequate to assure safe operation of a 
pipeline facility by issuing a notice of amendment. The notice shall 
provide an opportunity for a hearing under Sec. 190.211 of this part and 
shall specify the alleged inadequacies and the proposed action for 
revision of the plans or procedures. The notice shall allow the operator 
30 days after receipt of the notice to submit written comments or 
request a hearing. After considering all material presented in writing 
or at the hearing, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall determine 
whether the plans or procedures are inadequate as alleged and order the 
required amendment if they are inadequate, or withdraw the notice if 
they are not. In determining the adequacy of an operator's plans or 
procedures, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall consider:
    (1) Relevant available pipeline safety data;
    (2) Whether the plans or procedures are appropriate for the 
particular type of pipeline transportation or facility, and for the 
location of the facility;
    (3) The reasonableness of the plans or procedures; and
    (4) The extent to which the plans or procedures contribute to public 
safety.

[[Page 18]]

    (b) The amendment of an operator's plans or procedures prescribed in 
paragraph (a) of this section is in addition to, and may be used in 
conjunction with, the appropriate enforcement actions prescribed in this 
subpart.

20590-0001.


<R05>
Sec. 190.311  General.

    Unless the Administrator, for good cause, finds that notice is 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and 
incorporates that finding and a brief statement of the reasons for it in 
the rule, a notice of proposed rulemaking is issued and interested 
persons are invited to participate in the rulemaking proceedings with 
respect to each substantive rule.


<R05>
Sec. 190.313  Initiation of rulemaking.

    The Administrator initiates rulemaking on his or her own motion; 
however, in so doing, the Administrator may use discretion to consider 
the recommendations of other agencies of the United States or of other 
interested persons including those of any technical advisory body 
established by statute for that purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 190.315  Contents of notices of proposed rulemaking.

    (a) Each notice of proposed rulemaking is published in the Federal 
Register, unless all persons subject to it are named and are personally 
served with a copy of it.

personally served, includes:

[[Page 19]]

    (1) A statement of the time, place, and nature of the proposed

State.


<R05>
Sec. 190.319  Petitions for extension of time to comment.

    A petition for extension of the time to submit comments must be 
received not later than 10 days before expiration of the time stated in 
the notice. It is requested, but not required, that three copies be 
submitted. The filing of the petition does not automatically extend the 
time for petitioner's comments. A petition is granted only if the 
petitioner shows good cause for the extension, and if the extension is 
consistent with the public interest. If an extension is granted, it is 
granted to all persons, and it is published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 190.321  Contents of written comments.

    All written comments must be in English. It is requested, but not 
required, that five copies be submitted. Any interested person should

avoided; however, where necessary, such incorporated material shall be 
identified by document title and page.


<R05>
Sec. 190.323  Consideration of comments received.

    All timely comments and the recommendations of any technical 
advisory body established by statute for the purpose of reviewing the

rulemaking proposal. Late filed comments are considered so far as 
practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 190.325  Additional rulemaking proceedings.

    The Administrator may initiate any further rulemaking proceedings 
that the Administrator finds necessary or desirable. For example, 
interested persons may be invited to make oral arguments, to participate

representative and interested persons, at which minutes of the 
conference are kept, to appear at informal hearings presided over by 
officials designated by the Administrator at which a transcript of

informed administrative action and to protect the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 190.327  Hearings.

hearing, any interested person may petition the Administrator for an 
informal hearing. The petition must be received by the Administrator not 
later than 20 days before expiration of the time stated in the notice. 
The filing of the petition does not automatically result in the 
scheduling of a hearing. A petition is granted only if the petitioner 
shows good cause for a hearing. If a petition for a hearing is granted, 
notice of the hearing is published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Sections 556 and 557 of title 5, United States Code, do not 
apply to hearings held under this part. Unless otherwise specified, 
hearings held under this part are informal, nonadversary fact-finding 
proceedings, at which there are no formal pleadings or

[[Page 20]]

adverse parties. Any regulation issued in a case in which an informal 
hearing is held is not necessarily based exclusively on the record of 
the hearing.
    (c) The Administrator designates a representative to conduct any 
hearing held under this subpart. The Chief Counsel designates a member 
of his or her staff to serve as legal officer at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 190.329  Adoption of final rules.

    Final rules are prepared by representatives of the Office of 
Pipeline Safety and the Office of the Chief Counsel. The regulation is 
then submitted to the Administrator for consideration. If the 
Administrator adopts the regulation, it is published in the Federal 
Register, unless all persons subject to it are named and are personally 
served with a copy of it.


<R05>
Sec. 190.331  Petitions for rulemaking.

    (a) Any interested person may petition the Associate Administrator 
for Pipeline Safety to establish, amend, or repeal a substantive 
regulation, or may petition the Chief Counsel to establish, amend, or 
repeal a procedural regulation.
    (b) Each petition filed under this section must--
    (1) Summarize the proposed action and explain its purpose;
    (2) State the text of the proposed rule or amendment, or specify the 
rule proposed to be repealed;
    (3) Explain the petitioner's interest in the proposed action and the 
interest of any party the petitioner represents; and
    (4) Provide information and arguments that support the proposed 
action, including relevant technical, scientific or other data as 
available to the petitioner, and any specific known cases that 
illustrate the need for the proposed action.
    (c) If the potential impact of the proposed action is substantial, 
and information and data related to that impact are available to the 
petitioner, the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel may request 
the petitioner to provide--
    (1) The costs and benefits to society and identifiable groups within 
society, quantifiable and otherwise;
    (2) The direct effects (including preemption effects) of the 
proposed action on States, on the relationship between the Federal 
Government and the States, and on the distribution of power and 
responsibilities among the various levels of government;
    (3) The regulatory burden on small businesses, small organizations 
and small governmental jurisdictions;

<R05>
Sec. 190.333  Processing of petition.

    (a) General. Unless the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
otherwise specifies, no public hearing, argument, or other proceeding is 
held directly on a petition before its disposition under this section.
    (b) Grants. If the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
determines that the petition contains adequate justification, he or she 
initiates rulemaking action under this subpart.
    (c) Denials. If the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
determines that the petition does not justify rulemaking, the petition 
is denied.
    (d) Notification. The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
will notify a petitioner, in writing, of the decision to grant or deny a 
petition for rulemaking.


<R05>
Sec. 190.335  Petitions for reconsideration.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 190.339(d), any interested person may 
petition the Associate Administrator for reconsideration of any 
regulation issued under this subpart, or may petition the Chief Counsel 
for reconsideration of any procedural regulation issued under this 
subpart and contained in this subpart. It is requested, but not 
required, that three copies be submitted. The petition must be received 
not later than 30 days after publication of the rule in the Federal 
Register. Petitions filed after that time will be considered as

[[Page 21]]

petitions filed under Sec. 190.331. The petition must contain a brief 
statement of the complaint and an explanation as to why compliance with 
the rule is not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not in the public 
interest.
    (b) If the petitioner requests the consideration of additional 
facts, the petitioner must state the reason they were not presented to 
the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel within the prescribed 
time.
    (c) The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel does not 
consider repetitious petitions.
    (d) Unless the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
otherwise provides, the filing of a petition under this section does not 
stay the effectiveness of the rule.


<R05>
Sec. 190.337  Proceedings on petitions for reconsideration.

    (a) The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel may grant or 
deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration without 
further proceedings, except where a grant of the petition would result 
in issuance of a new final rule. In the event that the Associate 
Administrator or the Chief Counsel determines to reconsider any 
regulation, a final decision on reconsideration may be issued without 
further proceedings, or an opportunity to submit comment or information 
and data as deemed appropriate, may be provided. Whenever the Associate 
Administrator or the Chief Counsel determines that a petition should be 
granted or denied, the Office of the Chief Counsel prepares a notice of 
the grant or denial of a petition for reconsideration, for issuance to 
the petitioner, and the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
issues it to the petitioner. The Associate Administrator or the Chief 
Counsel may consolidate petitions relating to the same rules.
    (b) It is the policy of the Associate Administrator or the Chief 
Counsel to issue notice of the action taken on a petition for 
reconsideration within 90 days after the date on which the regulation in 
question is published in the Federal Register, unless it is found 
impracticable to take action within that time. In cases where it is so 
found and the delay beyond that period is expected to be substantial, 
notice of that fact and the date by which it is expected that action 
will be taken is issued to the petitioner and published in the Federal 
Register.


<R05>
Sec. 190.338  Appeals.

    (a) Any interested person may appeal a denial of the Associate 
Administrator or the Chief Counsel, issued under Sec. 190.333 or 
Sec. 190.337, to the Administrator.
    (b) An appeal must be received within 20 days of service of written 
notice to petitioner of the Associate Administrator's or the Chief 
Counsel's decision, or within 20 days from the date of publication of 
the decision in the Federal Register, and should set forth the contested 
aspects of the decision as well as any new arguments or information.
    (c) It is requested, but not required, that three copies of the 
appeal be submitted to the Administrator.
    (d) Unless the Administrator otherwise provides, the filing of an 
appeal under this section does not stay the effectiveness of any rule.


<R05>
Sec. 190.339  Direct final rulemaking.

    (a) Where practicable, the Administrator will use direct final 
rulemaking to issue the following types of rules:
    (1) Minor, substantive changes to regulations;
    (2) Incorporation by reference of the latest edition of technical or 
industry standards;
    (3) Extensions of compliance dates; and
    (4) Other noncontroversial rules where the Administrator determines 
that use of direct final rulemaking is in the public interest, and that 
a regulation is unlikely to result in adverse comment.
    (b) The direct final rule will state an effective date. The direct 
final rule will also state that unless an adverse comment or notice of 
intent to file an adverse comment is received within the specified 
comment period, generally 60 days after publication of the direct final 
rule in the Federal Register, the Administrator will issue a 
confirmation document, generally within 15 days after the close of the 
comment

[[Page 22]]

period, advising the public that the direct final rule will either 
become effective on the date stated in the direct final rule or at least 
30 days after the publication date of the confirmation document, 
whichever is later.
    (c) For purposes of this section, an adverse comment is one which 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. Comments that are frivolous or 
insubstantial will not be considered adverse under this procedure. A 
comment recommending a rule change in addition to the rule will not be 
considered an adverse comment, unless the commenter states why the rule 
would be ineffective without the additional change.
    (d) Only parties who filed comments to a direct final rule issued 
under this section may petition under Sec. 190.335 for reconsideration 
of that direct final rule.
    (e) If an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse 
comment is received, a timely document will be published in the Federal 
Register advising the public and withdrawing the direct final rule in 
whole or in part. The Administrator may then incorporate the adverse 
comment into a subsequent direct final rule or may publish a notice of 
proposed rulemaking. A notice of proposed rulemaking will provide an 
opportunity for public comment, generally a minimum of 60 days, and will 
be processed in accordance with Secs. 190.311-190.329.

any of the following safety-related conditions involving facilities in 
service:
    (1) In the case of a pipeline (other than an LNG facility) that 
operates at a hoop stress of 20 percent or more of its specified minimum 
yield strength, general corrosion that has reduced the wall thickness to 
less than that required for the maximum allowable operating pressure, 
and localized corrosion pitting to a degree where leakage might result.
    (2) Unintended movement or abnormal loading by environmental causes, 
such as an earthquake, landslide, or flood, that impairs the 
serviceability of a pipeline or the structural integrity or reliability 
of an LNG facility that contains, controls, or processes gas or LNG.
    (3) Any crack or other material defect that impairs the structural 
integrity or reliability of an LNG facility that contains, controls, or 
processes gas or LNG.
    (4) Any material defect or physical damage that impairs the 
serviceability of a pipeline that operates at a hoop stress of 20 
percent or more of its specified minimum yield strength.
    (5) Any malfunction or operating error that causes the pressure of a 
pipeline or LNG facility that contains or processes gas or LNG to rise 
above its maximum allowable operating pressure (or working pressure for 
LNG facilities) plus the build-up allowed for operation of pressure 
limiting or control devices.
    (6) A leak in a pipeline or LNG facility that contains or processes 
gas or LNG that constitutes an emergency.
    (7) Inner tank leakage, ineffective insulation, or frost heave that 
impairs the structural integrity of an LNG storage tank.
    (8) Any safety-related condition that could lead to an imminent 
hazard and causes (either directly or indirectly by remedial action of 
the operator), for

[[Page 26]]

purposes other than abandonment, a 20 percent or more reduction in 
operating pressure or shutdown of operation of a pipeline or an LNG 
facility that contains or processes gas or LNG.
    (b) A report is not required for any safety-related condition that--
    (1) Exists on a master meter system or a customer-owned service 
line;
    (2) Is an incident or results in an incident before the deadline for 
filing the safety-related condition report;
    (3) Exists on a pipeline (other than an LNG facility) that is more 
than 220 yards (200 meters) from any building intended for human 
occupancy or outdoor place of assembly, except that reports are required

Sec. 192.101  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes the minimum requirements for the design of 
pipe.


<R05>
Sec. 192.103  General.

    Pipe must be designed with sufficient wall thickness, or must be 
installed with adequate protection, to withstand anticipated external 
pressures and loads that will be imposed on the pipe after installation.


<R05>
Sec. 192.105  Design formula for steel pipe.

    (a) The design pressure for steel pipe is determined in accordance 
with the following formula:

                         P=(2 St/D)  x F x E x T

P=Design pressure in pounds per square inch (kPa) gauge.
S=Yield strength in pounds per square inch (kPa) determined in 
accordance with Sec. 192.107.
D=Nominal outside diameter of the pipe in inches (millimeters).
t=Nominal wall thickness of the pipe in inches (millimeters). If this is 
unknown, it is determined in accordance with Sec. 192.109. Additional 
wall thickness required for concurrent external loads in accordance with 
Sec. 192.103 may not be included in computing design pressure.
F=Design factor determined in accordance with Sec. 192.111.
E=Longitudinal joint factor determined in accordance with Sec. 192.113.
T=Temperature derating factor determined in accordance with 
Sec. 192.115.

    (b) If steel pipe that has been subjected to cold expansion to meet 
the SMYS is subsequently heated, other than by welding or stress 
relieving as a part of welding, the design pressure is limited to 75 
percent of the pressure determined under paragraph (a) of this section 
if the temperature of the pipe exceeds 900 deg. F (482 deg. C) at any 
time or is held above 600 deg. F (316 deg. C) for more than 1 hour.

Sec. 192.107  Yield strength (S) for steel pipe.

    (a) For pipe that is manufactured in accordance with a specification 
listed in section I of appendix B of this part, the yield strength to be 
used in the design formula in Sec. 192.105 is the SMYS stated in the 
listed specification, if that value is known.
    (b) For pipe that is manufactured in accordance with a specification 
not listed in section I of appendix B to this part or whose 
specification or tensile properties are unknown, the yield strength to 
be used in the design formula in Sec. 192.105 is one of the following:
    (1) If the pipe is tensile tested in accordance with section II-D of 
appendix B to this part, the lower of the following:
    (i) 80 percent of the average yield strength determined by the 
tensile tests.
    (ii) The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests.

<R05>
Sec. 192.109  Nominal wall thickness (t) for steel pipe.

    (a) If the nominal wall thickness for steel pipe is not known, it is 
determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter 
points on one end.
    (b) However, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and thickness 
and there are more than 10 lengths, only 10 percent of the individual 
lengths, but not less than 10 lengths, need be measured. The thickness 
of the lengths that are not measured must be verified by applying a 
gauge set to the minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal 
wall thickness to be used in the design formula in Sec. 192.105 is the 
next wall thickness found in commercial specifications that is below the 
average of all the measurements taken. However, the nominal wall 
thickness used may not be more than 1.14 times the smallest measurement 
taken on pipe less than 20 inches (508 millimeters) in outside diameter, 
nor more than 1.11 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe 20 
inches (508 millimeters) or more in outside diameter.

                Subpart D--Design of Pipeline Components


<R05>
Sec. 192.141  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for the design and 
installation of pipeline components and facilities. In addition, it 
prescribes requirements relating to protection against accidental 
overpressuring.


<R05>
Sec. 192.143  General requirements.

    Each component of a pipeline must be able to withstand operating 
pressures and other anticipated loadings without impairment of its 
serviceability with unit stresses equivalent to those allowed for 
comparable material in pipe in the same location and kind of service. 
However, if design based upon unit stresses is impractical for a 
particular component, design may be based upon a pressure rating 
established by the manufacturer by pressure testing that component or a 
prototype of the component.

<R05>
Sec. 192.144  Qualifying metallic components.

    Notwithstanding any requirement of this subpart which incorporates 
by reference an edition of a document listed in appendix A of this part, 
a metallic component manufactured in accordance with any other edition 
of that document is qualified for use under this part if--
    (a) It can be shown through visual inspection of the cleaned 
component that no defect exists which might impair the strength or 
tightness of the component; and
    (b) The edition of the document under which the component was 
manufactured has equal or more stringent requirements for the following 
as an edition of that document currently or previously listed in 
appendix A:
    (1) Pressure testing;
    (2) Materials; and

tested with no leakage to a pressure at least 1.5 times the maximum 
service rating.
    (ii) After the shell test, the seat must be tested to a pressure not 
less than 1.5 times the maximum service pressure rating. Except for 
swing check valves, test pressure during the seat test must be applied 
successively on each side of the closed valve with the opposite side 
open. No visible leakage is permitted.

[[Page 40]]

    (iii) After the last pressure test is completed, the valve must be 
operated through its full travel to demonstrate freedom from 
interference.
    (c) Each valve must be able to meet the anticipated operating 
conditions.
    (d) No valve having shell components made of ductile iron may be 
used at pressures exceeding 80 percent of the pressure ratings for 
comparable steel valves at their listed temperature. However, a valve 
having shell components made of ductile iron may be used at pressures up 
to 80 percent of the pressure ratings for comparable steel valves at 
their listed temperature, if:
    (1) The temperature-adjusted service pressure does not exceed 1,000 
p.s.i. (7 Mpa) gage; and
    (2) Welding is not used on any ductile iron component in the 
fabrication of the valve shells or their assembly.

least the pressure required for the pipeline to which it is being added.


<R05>
Sec. 192.150  Passage of internal inspection devices.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, 
each new transmission line and each line section of a transmission line 
where the line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component is replaced 
must be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of 
instrumented internal inspection devices.
    (b) This section does not apply to: (1) Manifolds;
    (2) Station piping such as at compressor stations, meter stations, 
or regulator stations;

prohibits compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. Within 30 days 
after discovering the emergency or construction problem the operator 
must petition, under Sec. 190.9 of this chapter, for approval that 
design and construction to accommodate passage of instrumented internal 
inspection devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, 
within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial, the operator 
must modify that segment to allow passage of instrumented internal 
inspection devices.

building on a platform located offshore or in inland navigable waters, 
each main compressor building of a compressor station must be located on 
property under the control of the operator. It must be far enough away 
from adjacent property, not under control of the operator, to minimize 
the possibility of fire being communicated to the compressor building 
from structures on adjacent property. There must be enough open space 
around the main compressor building to allow the free movement of fire-
fighting equipment.
    (b) Building construction. Each building on a compressor station 
site must be made of noncombustible materials if it contains either--

have at least two separated and unobstructed exits located so as to 
provide a convenient possibility of escape and an unobstructed passage 
to a place of safety. Each door latch on an exit must be of a type which 
can be readily opened from the inside without a key. Each swinging door 
located in an exterior wall must be mounted to swing outward.

[[Page 43]]

    (d) Fenced areas. Each fence around a compressor station must have 
at least two gates located so as to provide a convenient opportunity for 
escape to a place of safety, or have other facilities affording a 
similarly convenient exit from the area. Each gate located within 200 
feet (61 meters) of any compressor plant building must open outward and, 
when occupied, must be openable from the inside without a key.
    (e) Electrical facilities. Electrical equipment and wiring installed 
in compressor stations must conform to the National Electrical Code, 
ANSI/NFPA 70, so far as that code is applicable.

horsepower (746 kilowatts) or less, each compressor station must have an 
emergency shutdown system that meets the following:
    (1) It must be able to block gas out of the station and blow down 
the station piping.
    (2) It must discharge gas from the blowdown piping at a location 
where the gas will not create a hazard.
    (3) It must provide means for the shutdown of gas compressing 
equipment, gas fires, and electrical facilities in the vicinity of gas 
headers and in the compressor building, except that:
    (i) Electrical circuits that supply emergency lighting required to 
assist station personnel in evacuating the compressor building and the 
area in the vicinity of the gas headers must remain energized; and
    (ii) Electrical circuits needed to protect equipment from damage may 
remain energized.
    (4) It must be operable from at least two locations, each of which 
is:
    (i) Outside the gas area of the station;

emergency exits, if not fenced; and
    (iii) Not more than 500 feet (153 meters) from the limits of the 
station.
    (b) If a compressor station supplies gas directly to a distribution 
system with no other adequate source of gas available, the emergency 
shutdown system must be designed so that it will not function at the 
wrong time and cause an unintended outage on the distribution system.
    (c) On a platform located offshore or in inland navigable waters, 
the emergency shutdown system must be designed and installed to actuate 
automatically by each of the following events:
    (1) In the case of an unattended compressor station:

pressure plus 15 percent; or
    (ii) When an uncontrolled fire occurs on the platform; and
    (2) In the case of a compressor station in a building:
    (i) When an uncontrolled fire occurs in the building; or
    (ii) When the concentration of gas in air reaches 50 percent or more 
of the lower explosive limit in a building which has a source of 
ignition.

For the purpose of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, an electrical 
facility which conforms to Class 1, Group D, of

[[Page 44]]

the National Electrical Code is not a source of ignition.

<R05>
Sec. 192.195  Protection against accidental overpressuring.

    (a) General requirements. Except as provided in Sec. 192.197, each 
pipeline that is connected to a gas source so that the maximum allowable 
operating pressure

[[Page 47]]

could be exceeded as the result of pressure control failure or of some 
other type of failure, must have pressure relieving or pressure limiting 
devices that meet the requirements of Secs. 192.199 and 192.201.
    (b) Additional requirements for distribution systems. Each 
distribution system that is supplied from a source of gas that is at a 
higher pressure than the maximum allowable operating pressure for the 
system must--
    (1) Have pressure regulation devices capable of meeting the 
pressure, load, and other service conditions that will be experienced in 
normal operation of the system, and that could be activated in the event 
of failure of some portion of the system; and
    (2) Be designed so as to prevent accidental overpressuring.


<R05>
Sec. 192.197  Control of the pressure of gas delivered from high-pressure distribution systems.

    (a) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution 
system is under 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage and a service regulator having 
the following characteristics is used, no other pressure limiting device 
is required:
    (1) A regulator capable of reducing distribution line pressure to 
pressures recommended for household appliances.
    (2) A single port valve with proper orifice for the maximum gas 
pressure at the regulator inlet.
    (3) A valve seat made of resilient material designed to withstand 
abrasion of the gas, impurities in gas, cutting by the valve, and to 
resist permanent deformation when it is pressed against the valve port.
    (4) Pipe connections to the regulator not exceeding 2 inches (51 
millimeters) in diameter.
    (5) A regulator that, under normal operating conditions, is able to 
regulate the downstream pressure within the necessary limits of accuracy 
and to limit the build-up of pressure under no-flow conditions to 
prevent a pressure that would cause the unsafe operation of any 
connected and properly adjusted gas utilization equipment.
    (6) A self-contained service regulator with no external static or 
control lines.
    (b) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution 
system is 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, or less, and a service regulator 
that does not have all of the characteristics listed in paragraph (a) of 
this section is used, or if the gas contains materials that seriously 
interfere with the operation of service regulators, there must be 
suitable protective devices to prevent unsafe overpressuring of the 
customer's appliances if the service regulator fails.
    (c) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution 
system exceeds 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, one of the following methods 
must be used to regulate and limit, to the maximum safe value, the 
pressure of gas delivered to the customer:
    (1) A service regulator having the characteristics listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, and another regulator located upstream 
from the service regulator. The upstream regulator may not be set to 
maintain a pressure higher than 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage. A device must 
be installed between the upstream regulator and the service regulator to 
limit the pressure on the inlet of the service regulator to 60 p.s.i. 
(414 kPa) gage or less in case the upstream regulator fails to function 
properly. This device may be either a relief valve or an automatic 
shutoff that shuts, if the pressure on the inlet of the service 
regulator exceeds the set pressure (60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage or less), 
and remains closed until manually reset.
    (2) A service regulator and a monitoring regulator set to limit, to 
a maximum safe value, the pressure of the gas delivered to the customer.
    (3) A service regulator with a relief valve vented to the outside 
atmosphere, with the relief valve set to open so that the pressure of 
gas going to the customer does not exceed a maximum safe value. The 
relief valve may either be built into the service regulator or it may be 
a separate unit installed downstream from the service regulator. This 
combination may be used alone only in those cases where the inlet 
pressure on the service regulator does not exceed the manufacturer's 
safe working pressure rating of the service regulator, and may not be 
used where the inlet

[[Page 48]]

pressure on the service regulator exceeds 125 p.s.i. (862 kPa) gage. For 
higher inlet pressures, the methods in paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this 
section must be used.
    (4) A service regulator and an automatic shutoff device that closes 
upon a rise in pressure downstream from the regulator and remains closed 
until manually reset.

Sec. 192.199  Requirements for design of pressure relief and limiting devices.

    Except for rupture discs, each pressure relief or pressure limiting 
device must:
    (a) Be constructed of materials such that the operation of the 
device will not be impaired by corrosion;
    (b) Have valves and valve seats that are designed not to stick in a 
position that will make the device inoperative;
    (c) Be designed and installed so that it can be readily operated to 
determine if the valve is free, can be tested to determine the pressure 
at which it will operate, and can be tested for leakage when in the 
closed position;
    (d) Have support made of noncombustible material;
    (e) Have discharge stacks, vents, or outlet ports designed to 
prevent accumulation of water, ice, or snow, located where gas can be 
discharged into the atmosphere without undue hazard;
    (f) Be designed and installed so that the size of the openings, 
pipe, and fittings located between the system to be protected and the 
pressure relieving device, and the size of the vent line, are adequate 
to prevent hammering of the valve and to prevent impairment of relief 
capacity;
    (g) Where installed at a district regulator station to protect a 
pipeline system from overpressuring, be designed and installed to 
prevent any single incident such as an explosion in a vault or damage by 
a vehicle from affecting the operation of both the overpressure 
protective device and the district regulator; and
    (h) Except for a valve that will isolate the system under protection 
from its source of pressure, be designed to prevent unauthorized 
operation of any stop valve that will make the pressure relief valve or 
pressure limiting device inoperative.

    (a) Each pressure relief station or pressure limiting station or 
group of those stations installed to protect a pipeline must have enough 
capacity, and must be set to operate, to insure the following:
    (1) In a low pressure distribution system, the pressure may not 
cause the unsafe operation of any connected and properly adjusted gas 
utilization equipment.
    (2) In pipelines other than a low pressure distribution system:
    (i) If the maximum allowable operating pressure is 60 p.s.i. (414 
kPa) gage or more, the pressure may not exceed the maximum allowable 
operating pressure plus 10 percent, or the pressure that produces a hoop 
stress of 75 percent of SMYS, whichever is lower;
    (ii) If the maximum allowable operating pressure is 12 p.s.i. (83 
kPa) gage or more, but less than 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, the pressure 
may not exceed the maximum allowable operating pressure plus 6 p.s.i. 
(41 kPa) gage; or
    (iii) If the maximum allowable operating pressure is less than 12 
p.s.i. (83 kPa) gage, the pressure may not exceed the maximum allowable 
operating pressure plus 50 percent.
    (b) When more than one pressure regulating or compressor station 
feeds into a pipeline, relief valves or other protective devices must be 
installed at each station to ensure that the complete failure of the 
largest capacity regulator or compressor, or any single run of lesser 
capacity regulators or compressors in that station, will not impose 
pressures on any part of the pipeline or distribution system in excess 
of those for which it was designed, or against which it was protected, 
whichever is lower.
    (c) Relief valves or other pressure limiting devices must be 
installed at or near each regulator station in a low-pressure 
distribution system, with a capacity to limit the maximum pressure in 
the main to a pressure that will

[[Page 49]]

not exceed the safe operating pressure for any connected and properly 
adjusted gas utilization equipment.

control, and sampling pipe and components. It does not apply to 
permanently closed systems, such as fluid-filled temperature-responsive 
devices.
    (b) Materials and design. All materials employed for pipe and 
components must be designed to meet the particular conditions of service 
and the following:
    (1) Each takeoff connection and attaching boss, fitting, or adapter 
must be made of suitable material, be able to withstand the maximum 
service pressure and temperature of the pipe or equipment to which it is 
attached, and be designed to satisfactorily withstand all stresses 
without failure by fatigue.
    (2) Except for takeoff lines that can be isolated from sources of 
pressure by other valving, a shutoff valve must be installed in each 
takeoff line as near as practicable to the point of takeoff. Blowdown 
valves must be installed where necessary.
    (3) Brass or copper material may not be used for metal temperatures 
greater than 400 deg. F (204 deg.C).
    (4) Pipe or components that may contain liquids must be protected by 
heating or other means from damage due to freezing.

safety under anticipated operating stresses.
    (8) Each joint between sections of pipe, and between pipe and valves 
or fittings, must be made in a manner suitable for the anticipated 
pressure and temperature condition. Slip type expansion joints may not 
be used. Expansion must be allowed for by providing flexibility within 
the system itself.

Sec. 192.283  Plastic pipe: qualifying joining procedures.

    (a) Heat fusion, solvent cement, and adhesive joints. Before any 
written procedure established under Sec. 192.273(b) is used for making 
plastic pipe joints by a heat fusion, solvent cement, or adhesive 
method, the procedure must be qualified by subjecting specimen joints 
made according to the procedure to the following tests:
    (1) The burst test requirements of--
    (i) In the case of thermoplastic pipe, paragraph 6.6 (Sustained 
Pressure Test) or paragraph 6.7 (Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Pressure 
(Quick Burst)) of ASTM D 2513;
    (ii) In the case of thermosetting plastic pipe, paragraph 8.5 
(Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Pressure) or paragraph 8.9 (Sustained Static 
Pressure Test) of ASTM D2517; or
    (iii) In the case of electrofusion fittings for polyethylene pipe 
and tubing, paragraph 9.1 (Minimum Hydraulic Burst Pressure Test), 
paragraph 9.2 (Sustained Pressure Test), paragraph 9.3 (Tensile Strength 
Test), or paragraph 9.4 (Joint Integrity Tests) of ASTM Designation 
F1055.
    (2) For procedures intended for lateral pipe connections, subject a 
specimen joint made from pipe sections joined at right angles according 
to the procedure to a force on the lateral pipe until failure occurs in 
the specimen. If failure initiates outside the joint area, the procedure 
qualifies for use; and
    (3) For procedures intended for nonlateral pipe connections, follow 
the tensile test requirements of ASTM D638, except that the test may be 
conducted at ambient temperature and humidity. If the specimen elongates 
no less than 25 percent or failure initiates outside the joint area, the 
procedure qualifies for use.
    (b) Mechanical joints. Before any written procedure established 
under Sec. 192.273(b) is used for making mechanical plastic pipe joints 
that are designed to withstand tensile forces, the procedure must be 
qualified by subjecting 5 specimen joints made according to the 
procedure to the following tensile test:
    (1) Use an apparatus for the test as specified in ASTM D 638 (except 
for conditioning).
    (2) The specimen must be of such length that the distance between 
the grips of the apparatus and the end of the stiffener does not affect 
the joint strength.
    (3) The speed of testing is 0.20 in (5.0 mm) per minute, plus or 
minus 25 percent.
    (4) Pipe specimens less than 4 inches (102 mm) in diameter are 
qualified if the pipe yields to an elongation of no less than 25 percent 
or failure initiates outside the joint area.
    (5) Pipe specimens 4 inches (102 mm) and larger in diameter shall be 
pulled until the pipe is subjected to a tensile stress equal to or 
greater than the maximum thermal stress that would be produced by a 
temperature change of 100 deg.F (38 deg.C) or until the pipe is pulled 
from the fitting. If the pipe pulls from the fitting, the lowest value 
of the five test results or the manufacturer's rating, whichever is 
lower must be used in the design calculations for stress.
    (6) Each specimen that fails at the grips must be retested using new 
pipe.
    (7) Results obtained pertain only to the specific outside diameter, 
and material of the pipe tested, except that testing of a heavier wall 
pipe may be used to qualify pipe of the same material but with a lesser 
wall thickness.
    (c) A copy of each written procedure being used for joining plastic 
pipe must be available to the persons making and inspecting joints.
    (d) Pipe or fittings manufactured before July 1, 1980, may be used 
in accordance with procedures that the

[[Page 54]]

manufacturer certifies will produce a joint as strong as the pipe.

<R05>
Sec. 192.383  Excess flow valve customer notification.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section:
    Costs associated with installation means the costs directly 
connected with installing an excess flow valve, for example, costs of 
parts, labor, inventory and procurement. It does not include maintenance 
and replacement costs until such costs are incurred.
    Replaced service line means a natural gas service line where the 
fitting that connects the service line to the main is replaced or the 
piping connected to this fitting is replaced.
    Service line customer means the person who pays the gas bill, or 
where service has not yet been established, the person requesting 
service.
    (b) Which customers must receive notification. Notification is 
required on each newly installed service line or replaced service line 
that operates continuously throughout the year at a pressure not less 
than 68.9 kPa (10 psig) and that serves a single residence. On these 
lines an operator of a natural gas distribution system must notify the 
service line customer once in writing.
    (c) What to put in the written notice. (1) An explanation for the 
customer that an excess flow valve meeting the performance standards 
prescribed under Sec. 192.381 is available for the operator to install 
if the customer bears the costs associated with installation;
    (2) An explanation for the customer of the potential safety benefits 
that may be derived from installing an excess flow valve. The 
explanation must include that an excess flow valve is designed to shut 
off flow of natural gas automatically if the service line breaks;
    (3) A description of installation, maintenance, and replacement 
costs. The notice must explain that if the customer requests the 
operator to install an EFV, the customer bears all costs associated with 
installation, and what those costs are. The notice must alert the 
customer that the costs for maintaining and replacing an EFV may later 
be incurred, and what those costs will be, to the extent known.
    (d) When notification and installation must be made. (1) After 
February 3, 1999 an operator must notify each service

[[Page 62]]

line customer set forth in paragraph (b) of this section:
    (i) On new service lines when the customer applies for service.
    (ii) On replaced service lines when the operator determines the 
service line will be replaced.
    (2) If a service line customer requests installation an operator 
must install the EFV at a mutually agreeable date.
    (e) What records are required. (1) An operator must make the 
following records available for inspection by the Administrator or a 
State agency participating under 49 U.S.C. 60105 or 60106:
    (i) A copy of the notice currently in use; and
    (ii) Evidence that notice has been sent to the service line 
customers set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, within the 
previous three years.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) When notification is not required. The notification requirements 
do not apply if the operator can demonstrate--
    (1) That the operator will voluntarily install an excess flow valve 
or that the state or local jurisdiction requires installation;
    (2) That excess flow valves meeting the performance standards in 
Sec. 192.381 are not available to the operator;
    (3) That the operator has prior experience with contaminants in the 
gas stream that could interfere with the operation of an excess flow 
valve, cause loss of service to a residence, or interfere with necessary 
operation or maintenance activities, such as blowing liquids from the 
line.
    (4) That an emergency or short time notice replacement situation 
made it impractical for the operator to notify a service line customer 
before replacing a service line. Examples of these situations would be 
where an operator has to replace a service line quickly because of--
    (i) Third party excavation damage;
    (ii) Grade 1 leaks as defined in the Appendix G-192-11 of the Gas 
Piping Technology Committee guide for gas transmission and distribution 
systems;
    (iii) A short notice service line relocation request.

    Whenever an operator has knowledge that any portion of a buried 
pipeline is exposed, the exposed portion must be examined for evidence 
of external corrosion if the pipe is bare, or if the coating is 
deteriorated. If external corrosion is found, remedial action must be 
taken to the extent required by Sec. 192.483 and the applicable 
paragraphs of Secs. 192.485, 192.487, or 192.489.

insulating, applied for the purpose of external corrosion control must--
    (1) Be applied on a properly prepared surface;
    (2) Have sufficient adhesion to the metal surface to effectively 
resist underfilm migration of moisture;
    (3) Be sufficiently ductile to resist cracking;
    (4) Have sufficient strength to resist damage due to handling and 
soil stress; and
    (5) Have properties compatible with any supplemental cathodic 
protection.
    (b) Each external protective coating which is an electrically 
insulating type must also have low moisture absorption and high 
electrical resistance.
    (c) Each external protective coating must be inspected just prior to 
lowering the pipe into the ditch and backfilling, and any damage 
detrimental to effective corrosion control must be repaired.
    (d) Each external protective coating must be protected from damage 
resulting from adverse ditch conditions or damage from supporting 
blocks.
    (e) If coated pipe is installed by boring, driving, or other similar 
method, precautions must be taken to minimize damage to the coating 
during installation.

    (a) Each cathodic protection system required by this subpart must 
provide a level of cathodic protection that complies with one or more of 
the applicable criteria contained in appendix D of this part. If none of 
these criteria is applicable, the cathodic protection system must 
provide a level of cathodic protection at least equal to that provided 
by compliance with one or more of these criteria.
    (b) If amphoteric metals are included in a buried or submerged 
pipeline containing a metal of different anodic potential--
    (1) The amphoteric metals must be electrically isolated from the 
remainder of the pipeline and cathodically protected; or
    (2) The entire buried or submerged pipeline must be cathodically 
protected at a cathodic potential that meets the requirements of 
appendix D of this part for amphoteric metals.
    (c) The amount of cathodic protection must be controlled so as not 
to damage the protective coating or the pipe.

at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 
months, to determine whether the cathodic protection meets the 
requirements of Sec. 192.463. However, if tests at those intervals are 
impractical for separately protected short sections of mains or 
transmission lines, not in excess of 100 feet (30 meters), or separately 
protected service lines, these pipelines may be surveyed on a sampling 
basis. At least 10 percent of these protected structures, distributed 
over the entire system must be surveyed each calendar year, with a 
different 10 percent checked each subsequent year, so that the entire 
system is tested in each 10-year period.
    (b) Each cathodic protection rectifier or other impressed current 
power source must be inspected six times

[[Page 65]]

each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 2\1/2\ months, to 
insure that it is operating.
    (c) Each reverse current switch, each diode, and each interference 
bond whose failure would jeopardize structure protection must be 
electrically checked for proper performance six times each calendar 
year, but with intervals not exceeding 2\1/2\ months. Each other 
interference bond must be checked at least once each calendar year, but 
with intervals not exceeding 15 months.
    (d) Each operator shall take prompt remedial action to correct any 
deficiencies indicated by the monitoring.
    (e) After the initial evaluation required by paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of Sec. 192.455 and paragraph (b) of Sec. 192.457, each operator shall, 
at intervals not exceeding 3 years, reevaluate its unprotected pipelines 
and cathodically protect them in accordance with this subpart in areas 
in which active corrosion is found. The operator shall determine the 
areas of active corrosion by electrical survey, or where electrical 
survey is impractical, by the study of corrosion and leak history 
records, by leak detection survey, or by other means.

other structures are electrically interconnected and cathodically 
protected as a single unit.
    (b) One or more insulating devices must be installed where 
electrical isolation of a portion of a pipeline is necessary to 
facilitate the application of corrosion control.
    (c) Except for unprotected copper inserted in ferrous pipe, each 
pipeline must be electrically isolated from metallic casings that are a 
part of the underground system. However, if isolation is not achieved 
because it is impractical, other measures must be taken to minimize 
corrosion of the pipeline inside the casing.
    (d) Inspection and electrical tests must be made to assure that 
electrical isolation is adequate.
    (e) An insulating device may not be installed in an area where a 
combustible atmosphere is anticipated unless precautions are taken to 
prevent arcing.
    (f) Where a pipeline is located in close proximity to electrical 
transmission tower footings, ground cables or counterpoise, or in other 
areas where fault currents or unusual risk of lightning may be 
anticipated, it must be provided with protection against damage due to 
fault currents or lightning, and protective measures must also be taken 
at insulating devices.

    Each operator shall make, and retain for the useful life of the 
pipeline, a record of each test performed under Secs. 192.505 and 
192.507. The record must contain at least the following information:
    (a) The operator's name, the name of the operator's employee 
responsible for making the test, and the name of any test company used.
    (b) Test medium used.
    (c) Test pressure.
    (d) Test duration.
    (e) Pressure recording charts, or other record of pressure readings.
    (f) Elevation variations, whenever significant for the particular 
test.

                           Subpart K--Uprating


<R05>
Sec. 192.551  Scope.

    This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for increasing maximum 
allowable operating pressures (uprating) for pipelines.


<R05>
Sec. 192.553  General requirements.

    (a) Pressure increases. Whenever the requirements of this subpart 
require that an increase in operating pressure be made in increments, 
the pressure must be increased gradually, at a rate that can be 
controlled, and in accordance with the following:
    (1) At the end of each incremental increase, the pressure must be 
held constant while the entire segment of pipeline that is affected is 
checked for leaks.
    (2) Each leak detected must be repaired before a further pressure 
increase is made, except that a leak determined not to be potentially 
hazardous need not be repaired, if it is monitored during the pressure 
increase and it does not become potentially hazardous.
    (b) Records. Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall 
retain for the life of the segment a record of each investigation 
required by this subpart, of all work performed, and of each pressure 
test conducted, in connection with the uprating.
    (c) Written plan. Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline 
shall establish a written procedure that will ensure that each 
applicable requirement of this subpart is complied with.
    (d) Limitation on increase in maximum allowable operating pressure. 
Except as provided in Sec. 192.555(c), a new maximum allowable operating 
pressure established under this subpart may not exceed the maximum that 
would be allowed under this part for a new segment of pipeline 
constructed of the same materials in the same location. However, when 
uprating a steel pipeline, if any variable necessary to determine the 
design pressure under the design formula (Sec. 192.105) is unknown, the 
MAOP may be increased as provided in Sec. 192.619(a)(1).

<R05>
Sec. 192.555  Uprating to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of SMYS in steel pipelines.

    (a) Unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person 
may subject any segment of a steel pipeline to an operating pressure 
that will

[[Page 71]]

produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of SMYS and that is above 
the established maximum allowable operating pressure.
    (b) Before increasing operating pressure above the previously 
established maximum allowable operating pressure the operator shall:
    (1) Review the design, operating, and maintenance history and 
previous testing of the segment of pipeline and determine whether the 
proposed increase is safe and consistent with the requirements of this 
part; and
    (2) Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of 
pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased 
pressure.
    (c) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator 
may increase the maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of 
pipeline constructed before September 12, 1970, to the highest pressure 
that is permitted under Sec. 192.619, using as test pressure the highest 
pressure to which the segment of pipeline was previously subjected 
(either in a strength test or in actual operation).
    (d) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator 
that does not qualify under paragraph (c) of this section may increase 
the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure if at 
least one of the following requirements is met:
    (1) The segment of pipeline is successfully tested in accordance 
with the requirements of this part for a new line of the same material 
in the same location.
    (2) An increased maximum allowable operating pressure may be 
established for a segment of pipeline in a Class 1 location if the line 
has not previously been tested, and if:
    (i) It is impractical to test it in accordance with the requirements 
of this part;
    (ii) The new maximum operating pressure does not exceed 80 percent 
of that allowed for a new line of the same design in the same location; 
and
    (iii) The operator determines that the new maximum allowable 
operating pressure is consistent with the condition of the segment of 
pipeline and the design requirements of this part.
    (e) Where a segment of pipeline is uprated in accordance with 
paragraph (c) or (d)(2) of this section, the increase in pressure must 
be made in increments that are equal to:
    (1) 10 percent of the pressure before the uprating; or
    (2) 25 percent of the total pressure increase,

whichever produces the fewer number of increments.


<R05>
Sec. 192.557  Uprating: Steel pipelines to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS: plastic, cast iron, and ductile iron 
          pipelines.

    (a) Unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person 
may subject:
    (1) A segment of steel pipeline to an operating pressure that will 
produce a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS and that is above the 
previously established maximum allowable operating pressure; or
    (2) A plastic, cast iron, or ductile iron pipeline segment to an 
operating pressure that is above the previously established maximum 
allowable operating pressure.
    (b) Before increasing operating pressure above the previously 
established maximum allowable operating pressure, the operator shall:
    (1) Review the design, operating, and maintenance history of the 
segment of pipeline;
    (2) Make a leakage survey (if it has been more than 1 year since the 
last survey) and repair any leaks that are found, except that a leak 
determined not to be potentially hazardous need not be repaired, if it 
is monitored during the pressure increase and it does not become 
potentially hazardous;
    (3) Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of 
pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased 
pressure;
    (4) Reinforce or anchor offsets, bends and dead ends in pipe joined 
by compression couplings or bell and spigot joints to prevent failure of 
the pipe joint, if the offset, bend, or dead end is exposed in an 
excavation;
    (5) Isolate the segment of pipeline in which the pressure is to be 
increased from any adjacent segment that will

[[Page 72]]

continue to be operated at a lower pressure; and
    (6) If the pressure in mains or service lines, or both, is to be 
higher than the pressure delivered to the customer, install a service 
regulator on each service line and test each regulator to determine that 
it is functioning. Pressure may be increased as necessary to test each 
regulator, after a regulator has been installed on each pipeline subject 
to the increased pressure.
    (c) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, the increase 
in maximum allowable operating pressure must be made in increments that 
are equal to 10 p.s.i. (69 kPa) gage or 25 percent of the total pressure 
increase, whichever produces the fewer number of increments. Whenever 
the requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section apply, there must 
be at least two approximately equal incremental increases.
    (d) If records for cast iron or ductile iron pipeline facilities are 
not complete enough to determine stresses produced by internal pressure, 
trench loading, rolling loads, beam stresses, and other bending loads, 
in evaluating the level of safety of the pipeline when operating at the 
proposed increased pressure, the following procedures must be followed:
    (1) In estimating the stresses, if the original laying conditions 
cannot be ascertained, the operator shall assume that cast iron pipe was 
supported on blocks with tamped backfill and that ductile iron pipe was 
laid without blocks with tamped backfill.
    (2) Unless the actual maximum cover depth is known, the operator 
shall measure the actual cover in at least three places where the cover 
is most likely to be greatest and shall use the greatest cover measured.
    (3) Unless the actual nominal wall thickness is known, the operator 
shall determine the wall thickness by cutting and measuring coupons from 
at least three separate pipe lengths. The coupons must be cut from pipe 
lengths in areas where the cover depth is most likely to be the 
greatest. The average of all measurements taken must be increased by the 
allowance indicated in the following table:

Sec. 192.607  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 192.609  Change in class location: Required study.

    Whenever an increase in population density indicates a change in 
class location for a segment of an existing steel pipeline operating at 
hoop stress that is more than 40 percent of SMYS, or indicates that the 
hoop stress corresponding to the established maximum allowable operating 
pressure for a segment of existing pipeline is not commensurate with the 
present class location, the operator shall immediately make a study to 
determine:
    (a) The present class location for the segment involved.
    (b) The design, construction, and testing procedures followed in the 
original construction, and a comparison of these procedures with those 
required for the present class location by the applicable provisions of 
this part.
    (c) The physical condition of the segment to the extent it can be 
ascertained from available records;
    (d) The operating and maintenance history of the segment;
    (e) The maximum actual operating pressure and the corresponding 
operating hoop stress, taking pressure gradient into account, for the 
segment of pipeline involved; and
    (f) The actual area affected by the population density increase, and 
physical barriers or other factors which may limit further expansion of 
the more densely populated area.


<R05>
Sec. 192.611  Change in class location: Confirmation or revision of maximum allowable operating pressure.

    (a) If the hoop stress corresponding to the established maximum 
allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline is not 
commensurate with the present class location, and the segment is in 
satisfactory physical condition, the maximum allowable operating 
pressure of that segment of pipeline must be confirmed or revised 
according to one of the following requirements:
    (1) If the segment involved has been previously tested in place for 
a period of not less than 8 hours, the maximum allowable operating 
pressure is 0.8 times the test pressure in Class 2 locations, 0.667 
times the test pressure in Class 3 locations, or 0.555 times the test 
pressure in Class 4 locations. The corresponding hoop stress may not 
exceed 72 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations, 60 
percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 
locations.
    (2) The maximum allowable operating pressure of the segment involved 
must be reduced so that the corresponding hoop stress is not more than 
that allowed by this part for new segments of pipelines in the existing 
class location.
    (3) The segment involved must be tested in accordance with the 
applicable requirements of subpart J of this

[[Page 75]]

part, and its maximum allowable operating pressure must then be 
established according to the following criteria:
    (i) The maximum allowable operating pressure after the 
requalification test is 0.8 times the test pressure for Class 2 
locations, 0.667 times the test pressure for Class 3 locations, and 
0.555 times the test pressure for Class 4 locations.
    (ii) The corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 72 percent of the 
SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations, 60 percent of SMYS in Class 3 
locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 locations.
    (b) The maximum allowable operating pressure confirmed or revised in 
accordance with this section, may not exceed the maximum allowable 
operating pressure established before the confirmation or revision.
    (c) Confirmation or revision of the maximum allowable operating 
pressure of a segment of pipeline in accordance with this section does 
not preclude the application of Secs. 192.553 and 192.555.
    (d) Confirmation or revision of the maximum allowable operating 
pressure that is required as a result of a study under Sec. 192.609 must 
be completed within 18 months of the change in class location. Pressure 
reduction under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section within the 18-
month period does not preclude establishing a maximum allowable 
operating pressure under paragraph (a)(3) of this section at a later 
date.

Sec. 192.612  Underwater inspection and re-burial of pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets.

    (a) Each operator shall, in accordance with this section, conduct an 
underwater inspection of its pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its 
inlets. The inspection must be conducted after October 3, 1989 and 
before November 16, 1992.
    (b) If, as a result of an inspection under paragraph (a) of this 
section, or upon notification by any person, an operator discovers that 
a pipeline it operates is exposed on the seabed or constitutes a hazard 
to navigation, the operator shall--
    (1) Promptly, but not later than 24 hours after discovery, notify 
the National Response Center, telephone: 1-800-424-8802 of the location, 
and, if available, the geographic coordinates of that pipeline;
    (2) Promptly, but not later than 7 days after discovery, mark the 
location of the pipeline in accordance with 33 CFR part 64 at the ends 
of the pipeline segment and at intervals of not over 500 yards (457 
meters) long, except that a pipeline segment less than 200 yards (183 
meters) long need only be marked at the center; and
    (3) Within 6 months after discovery, or not later than November 1 of 
the following year if the 6 month period is later than November 1 of the 
year the discovery is made, place the pipeline so that the top of the 
pipe is 36 inches (914 millimeters) below the seabed for normal 
excavation or 18 inches (457 millimeters) for rock excavation.

<R05>
Sec. 192.613  Continuing surveillance.

    (a) Each operator shall have a procedure for continuing surveillance 
of its facilities to determine and take appropriate action concerning 
changes in class location, failures, leakage history, corrosion, 
substantial changes in cathodic protection requirements, and other 
unusual operating and maintenance conditions.
    (b) If a segment of pipeline is determined to be in unsatisfactory 
condition but no immediate hazard exists, the operator shall initiate a 
program to recondition or phase out the segment involved, or, if the 
segment cannot be reconditioned or phased out, reduce the maximum 
allowable operating pressure in accordance with Sec. 192.619 (a) and 
(b).


<R05>
Sec. 192.614  Damage prevention program.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, 
each operator of a buried pipeline must carry out, in accordance with 
this section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from 
excavation activities. For the purposes of this section, the term 
``excavation activities'' includes

[[Page 76]]

excavation, blasting, boring, tunneling, backfilling, the removal of 
aboveground structures by either explosive or mechanical means, and 
other earthmoving operations.
    (b) An operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section through participation in a public service program, 
such as a one-call system, but such participation does not relieve the 
operator of responsibility for compliance with this section. However, an 
operator must perform the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this section 
through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call system is a 
qualified one-call system. In areas that are covered by more than one 
qualified one-call system, an operator need only join one of the 
qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone number for 
excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call systems 
in those areas communicate with one another. An operator's pipeline 
system must be covered by a qualified one-call system where there is one 
in place. For the purpose of this section, a one-call system is 
considered a ``qualified one-call system'' if it meets the requirements 
of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) The state has adopted a one-call damage prevention program under 
Sec. 198.37 of this chapter; or
    (2) The one-call system:
    (i) Is operated in accordance with Sec. 198.39 of this chapter;
    (ii) Provides a pipeline operator an opportunity similar to a 
voluntary participant to have a part in management responsibilities; and
    (iii) Assesses a participating pipeline operator a fee that is 
proportionate to the costs of the one-call system's coverage of the 
operator's pipeline.
    (c) The damage prevention program required by paragraph (a) of this 
section must, at a minimum:
    (1) Include the identity, on a current basis, of persons who 
normally engage in excavation activities in the area in which the 
pipeline is located.
    (2) Provides for notification of the public in the vicinity of the 
pipeline and actual notification of the persons identified in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section of the following as often as needed to make them 
aware of the damage prevention program:
    (i) The program's existence and purpose; and
    (ii) How to learn the location of underground pipelines before 
excavation activities are begun.
    (3) Provide a means of receiving and recording notification of 
planned excavation activities.
    (4) If the operator has buried pipelines in the area of excavation 
activity, provide for actual notification of persons who give notice of 
their intent to excavate of the type of temporary marking to be provided 
and how to identify the markings.
    (5) Provide for temporary marking of buried pipelines in the area of 
excavation activity before, as far as possible, the activity begins.
    (6) Provide as follows for inspection of pipelines that an operator 
has reason to believe could be damaged by excavation activities:
    (i) The inspection must be done as frequently as necessary during 
and after the activities to verify the integrity of the pipeline; and
    (ii) In the case of blasting, any inspection must include leakage 
surveys.
    (d) A damage prevention program under this section is not required 
for the following pipelines:
    (1) Pipelines located offshore.

    (b) If a test is not feasible, review and calculation of the 
required capacity of the relieving device at each station must be made 
at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar 
year, and these required capacities compared with the rated or 
experimentally determined relieving capacity of the device for the 
operating conditions under which it works. After the initial 
calculations, subsequent calculations are not required if the review

    II. Steel pipe of unknown or unlisted specification.
    A. Bending Properties. For pipe 2 inches (51 millimeters) or less in 
diameter, a length of pipe must be cold bent through at least 90 degrees 
around a cylindrical mandrel that has a diameter 12 times the diameter 
of the pipe, without developing cracks at any portion and without 
opening the longitudinal weld.
    For pipe more than 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter, the pipe 
must meet the requirements of the flattening tests set forth in ASTM 
A53, except that the number of tests must be at least equal to the 
minimum required in paragraph II-D of this appendix to determine yield 
strength.
    B. Weldability. A girth weld must be made in the pipe by a welder 
who is qualified under subpart E of this part. The weld must be made 
under the most severe conditions under which welding will be allowed in 
the field and by means of the same procedure that will be used in the 
field. On pipe more than 4 inches (102 millimeters) in diameter, at 
least one test weld must be made for each 100 lengths of pipe. On pipe 4 
inches (102 millimeters) or less in diameter, at least one test weld 
must be made for each 400 lengths of pipe. The weld must be tested in 
accordance with API Standard 1104. If the requirements of API Standard 
1104 cannot be met, weldability may be established by making chemical 
tests for carbon and manganese, and proceeding in accordance with 
section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. The same number 
of chemical tests must be made as are required for testing a girth weld.
    C. Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate 
inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is 
reasonably round and straight and there are no defects which might 
impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.
    D. Tensile Properties. If the tensile properties of the pipe are not 
known, the minimum yield strength may be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165 
MPa) or less, or the tensile properties may be established by performing 
tensile tests as set forth in API Specification 5L. All test specimens 
shall be selected at random and the following number of tests must be 
performed:

    III. Steel pipe manufactured before November 12, 1970, to earlier 
editions of listed specifications. Steel pipe manufactured before 
November 12, 1970, in accordance with a specification of which a later 
edition is listed in section I of this appendix, is qualified for use 
under this part if the following requirements are met:
    A. Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate 
inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is 
reasonably round and straight and that there are no defects which might 
impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.
    B. Similarity of specification requirements. The edition of the 
listed specification under which the pipe was manufactured must have 
substantially the same requirements with respect to the following 
properties as a later edition of that specification listed in section I 
of this appendix:
    (1) Physical (mechanical) properties of pipe, including yield and 
tensile strength, elongation, and yield to tensile ratio, and testing 
requirements to verify those properties.
    (2) Chemical properties of pipe and testing requirements to verify 
those properties.
    C. Inspection or test of welded pipe. On pipe with welded seams, one 
of the following requirements must be met:
    (1) The edition of the listed specification to which the pipe was 
manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with respect 
to nondestructive inspection of welded seams and the standards for 
acceptance or rejection and repair as a later edition of the 
specification listed in section I of this appendix.
    (2) The pipe must be tested in accordance with subpart J of this 
part to at least 1.25 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if 
it is to be installed in a class 1 location and to at least 1.5 times 
the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a 
class 2, 3, or 4 location. Notwithstanding any shorter time period 
permitted under subpart J of this part, the test pressure must be 
maintained for at least 8 hours.

section of this volume.

 Appendix C to Part 192--Qualification of Welders for Low Stress Level 
                                  Pipe

    I. Basic test. The test is made on pipe 12 inches (305 millimeters) 
or less in diameter. The test weld must be made with the pipe in a 
horizontal fixed position so that the test weld includes at least one 
section of overhead position welding. The beveling, root opening, and 
other details must conform to the specifications of the procedure under 
which the welder is being qualified. Upon completion, the test weld is 
cut into four coupons and subjected to a root bend test. If, as a result 
of this test, two or more of the four coupons develop a crack in the 
weld material, or between the weld material and base metal, that is more 
than \1/8\-inch (3.2 millimeters) long in any direction, the weld is 
unacceptable. Cracks that occur on the corner of the specimen during 
testing are not considered.
    II. Additional tests for welders of service line connections to 
mains. A service line connection fitting is welded to a pipe section 
with the same diameter as a typical main. The weld is made in the same 
position as it is made in the field. The weld is unacceptable if it 
shows a serious undercutting or if it has rolled edges. The weld is 
tested by attempting to break the fitting off the run pipe. The weld is 
unacceptable if it breaks and shows incomplete fusion, overlap, or poor 
penetration at the junction of the fitting and run pipe.
    III. Periodic tests for welders of small service lines. Two samples 
of the welder's work, each about 8 inches (203 millimeters) long with 
the weld located approximately in the center, are cut from steel service 
line and tested as follows:
    (1) One sample is centered in a guided bend testing machine and bent 
to the contour of the die for a distance of 2 inches (51 millimeters) on 
each side of the weld. If the sample shows any breaks or cracks after 
removal from the bending machine, it is unacceptable.
    (2) The ends of the second sample are flattened and the entire joint 
subjected to a tensile strength test. If failure occurs adjacent to or 
in the weld metal, the weld is unacceptable. If a tensile strength 
testing machine is not available, this sample must also pass the bending 
test prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

      Appendix D to Part 192--Criteria for Cathodic Protection and 
                      Determination of Measurements

    I. Criteria for cathodic protection-- A. Steel, cast iron, and 
ductile iron structures. (1) A negative (cathodic) voltage of at least 
0.85 volt, with reference to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half 
cell. Determination of this voltage must be made with the protective 
current applied, and in accordance with sections II and IV of this 
appendix.
    (2) A negative (cathodic) voltage shift of at least 300 millivolts. 
Determination of this voltage shift must be made with the protective 
current applied, and in accordance with

[[Page 89]]

sections II and IV of this appendix. This criterion of voltage shift 
applies to structures not in contact with metals of different anodic 
potentials.
    (3) A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 
millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in 
accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
    (4) A voltage at least as negative (cathodic) as that originally 
established at the beginning of the Tafel segment of the E-log-I curve. 
This voltage must be measured in accordance with section IV of this 
appendix.
    (5) A net protective current from the electrolyte into the structure 
surface as measured by an earth current technique applied at 
predetermined current discharge (anodic) points of the structure.
    B. Aluminum structures. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of this paragraph, a minimum negative (cathodic) voltage shift of 
150 millivolts, produced by the application of protective current. The 
voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections II and IV 
of this appendix.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, 
a minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 
millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in 
accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
    (3) Notwithstanding the alternative minimum criteria in paragraphs 
(1) and (2) of this paragraph, aluminum, if cathodically protected at 
voltages in excess of 1.20 volts as measured with reference to a copper-
copper sulfate half cell, in accordance with section IV of this 
appendix, and compensated for the voltage (IR) drops other than those 
across the structure-electrolyte boundary may suffer corrosion resulting 
from the build-up of alkali on the metal surface. A voltage in excess of 
1.20 volts may not be used unless previous test results indicate no 
appreciable corrosion will occur in the particular environment.
    (4) Since aluminum may suffer from corrosion under high pH 
conditions, and since application of cathodic protection tends to 
increase the pH at the metal surface, careful investigation or testing 
must be made before applying cathodic protection to stop pitting attack 
on aluminum structures in environments with a natural pH in excess of 8.
    C. Copper structures. A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization 
voltage shift of 100 millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be 
determined in accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
    D. Metals of different anodic potentials. A negative (cathodic) 
voltage, measured in accordance with section IV of this appendix, equal 
to that required for the most anodic metal in the system must be 
maintained. If amphoteric structures are involved that could be damaged 
by high alkalinity covered by paragraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph B of 
this section, they must be electrically isolated with insulating 
flanges, or the equivalent.
    II. Interpretation of voltage measurement. Voltage (IR) drops other 
than those across the structure-electrolyte boundary must be considered 
for valid interpretation of the voltage measurement in paragraphs A(1) 
and (2) and paragraph B(1) of section I of this appendix.
    III. Determination of polarization voltage shift. The polarization 
voltage shift must be determined by interrupting the protective current 
and measuring the polarization decay. When the current is initially 
interrupted, an immediate voltage shift occurs. The voltage reading 
after the immediate shift must be used as the base reading from which to 
measure polarization decay in paragraphs A(3), B(2), and C of section I 
of this appendix.
    IV. Reference half cells. A. Except as provided in paragraphs B and 
C of this section, negative (cathodic) voltage must be measured between 
the structure surface and a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell 
contacting the electrolyte.
    B. Other standard reference half cells may be substituted for the 
saturated cooper-copper sulfate half cell. Two commonly used reference 
half cells are listed below along with their voltage equivalent to -0.85 
volt as referred to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half cell:
    (1) Saturated KCl calomel half cell: -0.78 volt.
    (2) Silver-silver chloride half cell used in sea water: -0.80 volt.
    C. In addition to the standard reference half cells, an alternate 
metallic material or structure may be used in place of the saturated 
copper-copper sulfate half cell if its potential stability is assured 
and if its voltage equivalent referred to a saturated copper-copper 
sulfate half cell is established.

    (b) This part does not apply to:
    (1) LNG facilities used by ultimate consumers of LNG or natural gas.
    (2) LNG facilities used in the course of natural gas treatment or 
hydrocarbon extraction which do not store LNG.
    (3) In the case of a marine cargo transfer system and associated 
facilities, any matter other than siting pertaining to the system or 
facilities between the marine vessel and the last

[[Page 92]]

manifold (or in the absence of a manifold, the last valve) located 
immediately before a storage tank.
    (4) Any LNG facility located in navigable waters (as defined in 
Section 3(8) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(8)).

<R05>
Sec. 193.2003  Semisolid facilities.

    An LNG facility used in the transportation or storage of LNG in a 
semisolid state need not comply with any requirement of this part which 
the Director finds impractical or unnecessary because of the semisolid 
state of LNG. In making such a finding, the Director may impose 
appropriate alternative safety conditions.


<R05>
Sec. 193.2005  Applicability.

    (a) New or amended standards in this part governing the siting, 
design, installation, or construction of an LNG facility and related 
personnel qualifications and training do not apply to:
    (1) LNG facilities under construction before the date such standards 
are published; or
    (2) LNG facilities for which an application for approval of the 
siting, construction, or operation was filed before March 1, 1978, with 
the Department of Energy (or any predecessor organization of that 
Department) or the appropriate State or local agency in the case of any 
facility not subject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Energy 
under the Natural Gas Act (not including any facility the construction 
of which began after November 29, 1979, not pursuant to such an 
approval).
    (b) If an LNG facility listed in paragraph (a) of this section is 
replaced, relocated, or significantly altered after February 11, 1980, 
the replacement, relocated facility, or significantly altered facility 
must comply with the applicable requirements of this part governing 
siting, design, installation, and construction, except that:
    (1) The siting requirements apply only to LNG storage tanks that are 
significantly altered by increasing the original storage capacity or 
relocated, not pursuant to an application for approval filed as provided 
by paragraph (a)(2) of this section before March 1, 1978; and
    (2) To the extent compliance with the design, installation, and 
construction requirements would make the replaced, relocated, or altered 
facility incompatible with other facilities or would otherwise be 
impracticable, the replaced, relocated, or significantly altered 
facility may be designed, installed, or constructed in accordance with 
the original specifications for the facility, or in a manner that the 
Director finds acceptable.
    (c) The siting, design, installation, and construction of an LNG 
facility under construction before February 11, 1980, or that is listed 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section (except a facility under 
construction before July 1, 1976) must meet the applicable requirements 
of ANSI/NFPA 59A (1972 edition) and part 192 of this chapter or the 
applicable requirements of this part, except that no part 192 standard 
issued after March 1, 1978, applies to an LNG facility listed in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

equipment, and materials from offsite locations can reach the site for 
fire fighting or controlling spill associated hazards or for evacuation 
of personnel.


<R05>
Sec. 193.2057  Thermal radiation protection.

    (a) Thermal exclusion zone. Each LNG container and LNG transfer 
system must have a thermal exclusion zone in accordance with the 
following:
    (1) Within the thermal exclusion zone, the impounding system may not 
be located closer to targets listed in paragraph (d) of this section 
than the exclusion distance ``d'' determined according to this section, 
unless the target is a pipeline facility of the operator.
    (2) If grading and drainage are used under Sec. 193.2149(b), 
operators must comply with the requirements of this section by assuming 
the space needed for drainage and collection of spilled liquid is an 
impounding system.
    (b) Measurement. The exclusion distance ``d'' is the horizontal 
distance measured from the impoundment area to the target where the 
following apply:
    (1) The maximum calculated exclusion distance for each thermal flux 
level shall be used for that exposure (offsite target) in paragraph (d) 
of this section.

[[Page 96]]

    (2) The wind speed producing the maximum exclusion distances shall 
be used except for wind speeds that occur less than 5 percent of the 
time based on recorded data for the area.
    (3) The ambient temperature and relative humidity that produce the 
maximum exclusion distance shall be used except that values that occur 
less than 5 percent of the time based on recorded data for the area 
shall not be used.
    (4) Properties of LNG with the highest anticipated heating value 
shall be used.
    (5) The height of the flame base should be that of any dike or 
containment in relation to the horizontal reference plane. The height of 
the target shall be in relation to the same reference plane.
    (c) Exclusion distance length. The length of an exclusion distance 
for each impounding space may not be less than the distance ``d'' 
determined in accordance with one of the following:
    (1) The method of calculating the exclusion distances for levels of 
radiant exposure listed in paragraph (d) of this section shall be the 
method described in Gas Research Institute report GRI-89/0176 and also 
available as the ``LNGFIRE'' computer program from GRI.
    (2) Determine ``d'' from a mathematical model for thermal radiation 
and other appropriate fire characteristics which assures that the 
incident thermal flux levels in paragraph (d) of this section are not 
exceeded. The model must:
    (i) Use atmospheric conditions which, if applicable, result in 
longer exclusion distances than other atmospheric conditions occurring 
at least 95 percent of the time based on recorded data for the site 
area;
    (ii) Have been evaluated and verified by testing at a scale, 
considering scaling effects, appropriate for the range of application;
    (iii) Have been submitted to the Administrator for approval, with 
supportive data as necessary to demonstrate validity; and
    (iv) Have received approval by the Administrator.
    (d) Limiting values for incident radiant flux on offsite targets. 
The maximum incident radiant flux at an offsite target from burning of a 
total spill in an impounding space must be limited to the distances in 
paragraph (c) of this section using the following values of ``(f)'' or 
``Incident Flux'':

Sec. 193.2059  Flammable vapor-gas dispersion protection.

    (a) Dispersion exclusion zone. Except as provided by paragraph (e) 
of this section, each LNG container and LNG transfer system must have a 
dispersion exclusion zone with a boundary described by the minimum 
dispersion distance computed in accordance with this section. The 
following are prohibited in a dispersion exclusion zone unless it is an 
LNG facility of the operator:
    (1) Outdoor areas occupied by 20 or more persons during normal use, 
such

[[Page 97]]

as beaches, playgrounds, outdoor theaters, other recreation areas, or 
other places of public assembly.
    (2) Buildings that are:
    (i) Used for residences;
    (ii) Occupied by 20 or more persons during normal use;
    (iii) Contain explosive, flammable, or toxic materials in hazardous 
quantities;
    (iv) Have exceptional value or contain objects of exceptional value 
based on historic uniqueness described in Federal, State, or local 
registers; or
    (v) Could result in additional hazard if exposed to a vapor-gas 
cloud.
    (b) Measuring dispersion distance. The dispersion distance is 
measured radially from the inside edge of an impounding system along the 
ground contour to the exclusion zone boundary.
    (c) Computing dispersion distance. A minimum dispersion distance 
must be computed for the impounding system. If grading and drainage are 
used under Sec. 193.2149(b), operators must comply with the requirements 
of this section by assuming the space needed for drainage and collection 
of spilled liquid in an impounding system. Dispersion distances must be 
determined in accordance with the following dispersion parameters, using 
the ``DEGADIS'' model described in Gas Research Institute report No. GRI 
89/0242 titled ``LNG Vapor Dispersion Predication with the DEGADIS Dense 
Gas Dispersion Model'', or a model for vapor dispersion which meets the 
requirements of Sec. 193.2057(c)(2)(ii) through (iv):
    (1) Average gas concentration in air = 2.5 percent.
    (2) Dispersion conditions are a combination of those which result in 
longer predicted downwind dispersion distances than other weather 
conditions at the site at least 90 percent of the time, based on U.S. 
Government weather data, or as an alternative where the model used gives 
longer distances at lower wind speeds, Category F atmosphere, wind speed 
= 4.5 miles/hour (7.2 km/hour), relative humidity equals 50.0 percent, 
and atmospheric temperatures = 0.0 C.
    (3) Dispersion coordinates y, z, and H, where applicable, = 0.
    (4) A surface roughness factor of 3 cm shall be used. Higher values 
for the roughness factor may be used if it can be shown that the terrain 
both upwind and downwind of the vapor cloud has dense vegetation and 
that the vapor cloud height is more than ten times the height of the 
obstacles encountered by the vapor cloud.
    (d) Vaporization design rate. In computing dispersion distance under 
paragraph (c) of this section, the following applies:
    (1) Vaporization results from the spill caused by an assumed rupture 
of a single transfer pipe (or multiple pipes that lack provisions to 
prevent parallel flow) which has the greatest overall flow capacity, 
discharging at maximum potential capacity, in accordance with the 
following conditions:
    (i) The rate of vaporization is not less than the sum of flash 
vaporization and vaporization from boiling by heat transfer from contact 
surfaces during the time necessary for spill detection, instrument 
response, and automatic shutdown by the emergency shutdown system, but 
not less than 10 minutes, plus, in the case of impounding systems for 
LNG storage tanks with side or bottom penetrations, the time necessary 
for the liquid level in the tank to reach the level of the penetration 
or equilibrate with the liquid impounded assuming failure of the 
internal shutoff valve.
    (ii) In determining variations in the vaporization rate due to 
surface contact, the time necessary to wet 100 percent of the impounding 
floor area shall be determined by equation C-9 in the 1974 AGA report 
titled ``Evaluation of LNG Vapor Control Methods,'' or by using an 
equivalent personal computer program based on equation C-9 or by an 
alternative model which meets the requirements of 
Sec. 193.2057(c)(2)(ii) through (iv).
    (iii) After spill flow is terminated, the rate of vaporization is 
vaporization of the remaining spillage, if any, from boiling by heat 
transfer from contact surfaces that are reducing in area and temperature 
as a function of time.
    (iv) Vapor detention space is all space provided for liquid 
impoundment and vapor detention outside the component served, less the 
volume occupied by the spilled liquid at the time the

[[Page 98]]

vapor escapes the vapor detention space.
    (2) The boiling rate of LNG on which dispersion distance is based is 
determined using the weighted average value of the thermal properties of 
the contact surfaces in the impounding space determined from eight 
representative experimental tests on the materials involved. If surfaces 
are insulated, the insulation must be designed, installed, and 
maintained so that it will retain its performance characteristics under 
spill conditions.
    (e) Planned vapor control. An LNG facility need not have a 
dispersion exclusion zone if the Administrator finds that compliance 
with paragraph (a) of this section would be impractical and the operator 
prepares and follows a plan for controlling LNG vapor that is found 
acceptable by the Administrator. The plan must include circumstances 
under which LNG vapor is controlled to preclude the dispersion of a 
flammable mixture from the LNG facility under all predictable 
environmental conditions that could adversely affect control. The 
reliability of the method of control must be demonstrated by testing or 
experience with LNG spills.

Sec. 193.2061  Seismic investigation and design forces.

    (a) Except for shop fabricated storage tanks of 70,000 gallons 
(265,000 liters) or less capacity mounted within 2 feet of the ground, 
if an LNG facility is located at a site in Zone 0 or 1 of the ``Seismic 
Risk Map of the United States,'' UBC, each operator shall determine, 
based on a study of faults, hydrologic regime, and soil conditions, 
whether a potential exists at the site for surface faulting or soil 
liquefaction.
    (b) Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, LNG facilities must be 
designed and built to withstand, without loss of structural or 
functional integrity, the following seismic design forces, as 
applicable:
    (1) For LNG facilities (other than shop fabricated storage tanks of 
70,000 gallons (265,000 liters) or less capacity mounted within 2 feet 
(610 millimeters) of the ground) located at a site in Puerto Rico in 
Zone 2, 3, or 4 of the ``Seismic Risk Map of the United States,'' or at 
a site determined under paragraph (a) of this section to have a 
potential for surface faulting or soil liquefaction, the forces that 
could reasonably be expected to occur at the foundation of the facility 
due to the most critical ground motion, motion amplification, permanent 
differential ground displacement, soil liquefaction, and symmetric and 
asymmetric reaction forces resulting from hydrodynamic pressure and 
motion of contained liquid in interaction with the facility structure.
    (2) For all other LNG facilities, the total lateral force set forth 
in UBC, Volume 1, corresponding to the zone of the ``Seismic Risk Map of 
the United States'' in which the facility is located, and a vertical 
force equal to the total lateral force.
    (c) Each operator of an LNG facility to which paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section applies shall determine the seismic design forces on the 
basis of a detailed geotechnical investigation and in accordance with 
paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section. The investigation must include 
each of the following items that could reasonably be expected to affect 
the site and be sufficient in scope to identify all hazards that could 
reasonably be expected to affect the facility design:
    (1) Identification and evaluation of faults, Quaternary activity of 
those faults, tectonic structures, static and dynamic properties of 
materials underlying the site, and, as applicable, tectonic provinces 
within 100 miles of the site;
    (2) Identification and evaluation of all historically reported 
earthquakes which could affect the determination under this section of 
the most critical ground motion or differential displacement at the site 
when correlated with particular faults, tectonic structures, and 
tectonic provinces, as applicable; and
    (3) Identification and evaluation of the hydrologic regime and the 
potential of liquefaction-induced soil failures.

[[Page 99]]

    (d) The most critical ground motion must be determined in accordance 
with paragraph (e) of this section either:
    (1) Probabilistically, when the available earthquake data are 
sufficient to show that the yearly probability of exceedance of most 
critical ground motion is 10<SUP>-4</SUP> or less; or
    (2) Deterministically, when the available earthquake data are 
insufficient to provide probabilistic estimates, with the objective of 
determining a most critical ground motion with a yearly probability of 
exceedance of 10<SUP>-4</SUP> or less.
    (e) The determination of most critical ground motion, considering 
local and regional seismological conditions, must be made by using the 
following:
    (1) A regionally appropriate attenuation relationship, assuming that 
earthquakes occur at a location on a fault, tectonic structure, or 
tectonic province, as applicable, which would cause the most critical 
seismic movement at the site, except that where epicenters of 
historically reported earthquakes cannot be reasonably related to known 
faults or tectonic structures, but are recognized as being within a 
specific tectonic province which is within 100 miles (161 kilometers) of 
the site, assume that those earthquakes occur within their respective 
provinces at a source closest to the site.
    (2) A horizontal design response spectrum determined from the mean 
plus one standard deviation of a free-field horizontal elastic response 
spectra whose spectral amplitudes are consistent with values expected 
for the most critical ground motion.
    (3) A vertical design response spectrum that is either two-thirds of 
the amplitude of the horizontal design response spectrum at all 
frequencies or equal to the horizontal design response spectrum where 
the site is located within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the earthquake 
source.
    (f) An LNG storage tank or its impounding system may not be located 
at a site where an investigation under paragraph (c) of this section 
shows that any of the following conditions exists unless the 
Administrator grants an approval for the site:
    (1) The estimated design horizontal acceleration exceeds 0.8g at the 
tank or dike foundation.
    (2) The specific local geologic and seismic data base is sufficient 
to predict future differential surface displacement beneath the tank and 
dike area, but displacement not exceeding 30 inches (762 millimeters) 
cannot be assured with a high level of confidence.
    (3) The specific local geologic and seismic data base is not 
sufficient to predict future differential surface displacement beneath 
the tank and dike area, and the estimated cumulative displacement of a 
Quaternary fault within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the tank foundation 
exceeds 60 inches (1.5 meters).
    (4) The potential for soil liquefaction cannot be accommodated by 
design and construction in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.
    (g) An application for approval of a site under paragraph (f) of 
this section must provide at least the following:
    (1) A detailed analysis and evaluation of the geologic and seismic 
characteristics of the site based on the geotechnical investigation 
performed under paragraph (c) of this section, with emphasis on 
prediction of near-field seismic response.
    (2) The design plans and structural analysis for the tank, its 
impounding system, and related foundations, with a report demonstrating 
that the design requirements of this section are satisfied, including 
any test results or other documentation as appropriate.
    (3) A description of safety-related features of the site or designs, 
in addition to those required by this part, if applicable, that would 
mitigate the potential effects of a catastrophic spill (e.g., remoteness 
or topographic features of the site, additional exclusion distances, or 
multiple barriers for containing or impounding LNG).
    (h) Each container which does not have a structurally liquid-tight 
cover must have sufficient freeboard with an appropriate configuration

importance which is in or adjacent to navigable waters.
    High volume area means an area which an oil pipeline having a 
nominal outside diameter of 20 inches (508 millimeters) or more crosses 
a major river or other navigable waters, which, because of the velocity 
of the river flow and vessel traffic on the river, would require a more 
rapid response in case of a worst case discharge or substantial threat 
of such a discharge. Appendix B to this part contains a list of some of

[[Page 132]]

the high volume areas in the United States.
    Inland area means the area shoreward of the boundary lines defined 
in 46 CFR part 7, except that in the Gulf of Mexico, it means the area

    Inland zone means the environment inland of the coastal zone 
excluding the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, and specified ports and 
harbors on inland rivers. (The term inland zone delineates an area of 
federal responsibilities for response actions. Precise boundaries are 
determined by agreements between the EPA and the USCG and are identified 
in Federal Regional Contingency Plans.)
    Line section means a continuous run of pipe that is contained 
between adjacent pressure pump stations, between a pressure pump station 
and a terminal or breakout tank, between a pressure pump station and a 
block valve, or between adjacent block valves.

to conduct response activities for a worst case discharge from a 
pipeline in adverse weather.
    Navigable waters means the waters of the United States, including 
the territorial sea and such waters as lakes, rivers, streams; waters 
which are used for recreation; and waters from which fish or shellfish 
are taken and sold in interstate or foreign commerce.
    Oil means oil of any kind or in any form, including, but not limited 
to, petroleum, fuel oil, vegetable oil, animal oil, sludge, oil refuse, 
oil mixed with wastes other than dredged spoil.
    Oil spill removal organization means an entity that provides 
response resources.
    On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) means the federal official designated by 
the Administrator of the EPA or by the Commandant of the USCG to 
coordinate and direct federal response under subpart D of the National 
Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300).
    Onshore oil pipeline facilities means new and existing pipe, rights-
of-way and any equipment, facility, or building used in the 
transportation of oil located in, on, or under, any land within the 
United States other than submerged land.
    Operator means a person who owns or operates onshore oil pipeline 
facilities.
    Pipeline means all parts of an onshore pipeline facility through 
which oil moves including, but not limited to, line pipe, valves, and 
other appurtenances connected to line pipe, pumping units, fabricated 
assemblies associated with pumping units, metering and delivery stations 
and fabricated assemblies therein, and breakout tanks.
    Qualified individual means an English-speaking representative of an 
operator, located in the United States, available on a 24-hour basis, 
with full authority to: activate and contract with required oil spill 
removal organization(s); activate personnel and equipment maintained by 
the operator; act as liaison with the OSC; and obligate any funds 
required to carry out all required or directed oil response activities.
    Response activities means the containment and removal of oil from 
the water and shorelines, the temporary storage and disposal of 
recovered oil, or the taking of other actions as necessary to minimize 
or mitigate damage to the environment.
    Response area means the inland zone or coastal zone, as defined in 
the National Contingency Plan (40 CFR part 300), in which the response 
activity is occurring.

Sec. 195.5  Conversion to service subject to this part.

    (a) A steel pipeline previously used in service not subject to this 
part qualifies for use under this part if the operator prepares and 
follows a written procedure to accomplish the following:
    (1) The design, construction, operation, and maintenance history of 
the pipeline must be reviewed and, where sufficient historical records 
are not available, appropriate tests must be performed to determine if 
the pipeline is in satisfactory condition for safe operation. If one or 
more of the variables necessary to verify the design pressure under 
Sec. 195.106 or to perform the testing under paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section is unknown, the design pressure may be verified and the maximum 
operating pressure determined by--
    (i) Testing the pipeline in accordance with ASME B31.8, Appendix N, 
to produce a stress equal to the yield strength; and
    (ii) Applying, to not more than 80 percent of the first pressure 
that produces a yielding, the design factor F in Sec. 195.106(a) and the 
appropriate factors in Sec. 195.106(e).
    (2) The pipeline right-of-way, all aboveground segments of the 
pipeline, and appropriately selected underground segments must be 
visually inspected for physical defects and operating conditions which 
reasonably could be expected to impair the strength or tightness of the 
pipeline.
    (3) All known unsafe defects and conditions must be corrected in 
accordance with this part.
    (4) The pipeline must be tested in accordance with subpart E of this 
part to substantiate the maximum operating pressure permitted by 
Sec. 195.406.
    (b) A pipeline which qualifies for use under this section need not 
comply with the corrosion control requirements of this part until 12 
months after it is placed in service, notwithstanding any earlier 
deadlines for compliance. In addition to the requirements of subpart F 
of this part, the corrosion control requirements of subpart D apply to 
each pipeline which substantially meets those requirements before it is 
placed in service or which is a segment that is replaced, relocated, or 
substantially altered.
    (c) Each operator must keep for the life of the pipeline a record of 
the investigations, tests, repairs, replacements, and alterations made 
under the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 195.8  Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in pipelines constructed with other than steel pipe.

    No person may transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide 
through a pipe that is constructed after October 1, 1970, for hazardous 
liquids or after July 12, 1991 for carbon dioxide of material other than 
steel unless the person has notified the Administrator in writing at 
least 90 days before the transportation is to begin. The notice must 
state whether carbon dioxide or a hazardous liquid is to be transported 
and the chemical name, common name, properties and characteristics of 
the hazardous liquid to be transported and the material used in 
construction of the pipeline. If the Administrator determines that the 
transportation of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the manner 
proposed would be unduly hazardous, he will, within 90 days after 
receipt of the notice, order the person that gave the notice, in 
writing, not to transport the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the 
proposed manner until further notice.

<R05>
Sec. 195.9  Outer continental shelf pipelines.

    Operators of transportation pipelines on the Outer Continental Shelf 
must identify on all their respective pipelines the specific points at 
which operating responsibility transfers to a producing operator. For 
those instances in which the transfer points are not identifiable by a 
durable marking, each operator will have until September 15, 1998 to 
identify the transfer points. If it is not practicable to durably mark a 
transfer point and the transfer point is located above water, the 
operator must depict the transfer point on a schematic maintained near 
the transfer point. If a transfer point is located subsea, the operator 
must identify the transfer point on a schematic which must be maintained 
at the nearest upstream facility and provided to RSPA upon request. For 
those cases in which adjoining operators have not agreed on a transfer 
point by September 15, 1998 the Regional Director and the MMS Regional 
Supervisor will make a joint determination of the transfer point.

this is unknown, it is determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    D=Nominal outside diameter of the pipe in inches (millimeters).
    E=Seam joint factor determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    F=A design factor of 0.72, except that a design factor of 0.60 is 
used for

[[Page 151]]

pipe, including risers, on a platform located offshore or on a platform 
in inland navigable waters, and 0.54 is used for pipe that has been 
subjected to cold expansion to meet the specified minimum yield strength 
and is subsequently heated, other than by welding or stress relieving as 
a part of welding, to a temperature higher than 900 deg. F (482 deg. C) 
for any period of time or over 600 deg. F (316 deg. C) for more than 1 
hour.

    (b) The yield strength to be used in determining the internal design 
pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is the specified minimum 
yield strength. If the specified minimum yield strength is not known, 
the yield strength to be used in the design formula is one of the 
following:
    (1)(i) The yield strength determined by performing all of the 
tensile tests of API Specification 5L on randomly selected specimens 
with the following number of tests:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Pipe size                          No. of tests
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Larger than 12\3/4\ in (324 mm) nominal     One test for each 50
 outside diameter.                           lengths.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) If the average yield-tensile ratio exceeds 0.85, the yield 
strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165,474 kPa). If the average 
yield-tensile ratio is 0.85 or less, the yield strength of the pipe is 
taken as the lower of the following:
    (A) Eighty percent of the average yield strength determined by the 
tensile tests.
    (B) The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests.
    (2) If the pipe is not tensile tested as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section, the yield strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. 
(165,474 kPa).
    (c) If the nominal wall thickness to be used in determining internal 
design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is not known, it is 
determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter 
points on one end. However, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and 
thickness, only 10 individual lengths or 5 percent of all lengths, 
whichever is greater, need be measured. The thickness of the lengths 
that are not measured must be verified by applying a gage set to the 
minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal wall thickness 
to be used is the next wall thickness found in commercial specifications 
that is below the average of all the measurements taken. However, the 
nominal wall thickness may not be more than 1.14 times the smallest 
measurement taken on pipe that is less than 20 inches (508 mm) nominal 
outside diameter, nor more than 1.11 times the smallest measurement 
taken on pipe that is 20 inches (508 mm) or more in nominal outside 
diameter.
    (d) The minimum wall thickness of the pipe may not be less than 87.5 
percent of the value used for nominal wall thickness in determining the 
internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section. In 
addition, the anticipated external loads and external pressures that are 
concurrent with internal pressure must be considered in accordance with 
Secs. 195.108 and 195.110 and, after determining the internal design 
pressure, the nominal wall thickness must be increased as necessary to 
compensate for these concurrent loads and pressures.
    (e) The seam joint factor used in paragraph (a) of this section is 
determined in accordance with the following table:

over the entire circumference of the weld.
    (e) All girth welds installed each day in the following locations 
must be nondestructively tested over their entire circumference, except 
that when nondestructive testing is impracticable for a girth weld, it 
need not be tested if the number of girth welds for which testing is 
impracticable does not exceed 10 percent of the girth welds installed 
that day:
    (1) At any onshore location where a loss of hazardous liquid could 
reasonably be expected to pollute any stream, river, lake, reservoir, or 
other body of water, and any offshore area;

Sec. 195.414  Cathodic protection.

    (a) No operator may operate a hazardous liquid interstate pipeline 
after March 31, 1973, a hazardous liquid intrastate pipeline after 
October 19, 1988, or a carbon dioxide pipeline after July 12, 1993 that 
has an effective external surface coating material, unless that pipeline 
is cathodically protected. This paragraph does not apply to breakout 
tank areas and buried pumping station piping. For the purposes of this 
subpart, a pipeline does not have an effective external coating, and 
shall be considered bare, if its cathodic protection current 
requirements are substantially the same as if it were bare.
    (b) Each operator shall electrically inspect each bare hazardous 
liquid interstate pipeline, other than a low-stress pipeline, before 
April 1, 1975; each bare hazardous liquid intrastate pipeline, other 
than a low-stress pipeline, before October 20, 1990; each bare carbon 
dioxide pipeline before July 12, 1994; and each bare low-stress pipeline 
before July 12, 1996 to determine any areas in which active corrosion is 
taking place. The operator may not increase its established operating 
pressure on a section of bare pipeline until the section has been so 
electrically inspected. In any areas where active corrosion is found, 
the operator shall provide cathodic protection. Section 195.416(f) and 
(g) apply to all corroded pipe that is found.
    (c) Each operator shall electrically inspect all breakout tank areas 
and buried pumping station piping on hazardous liquid interstate 
pipelines, other than low-stress pipelines, before April 1, 1973; on 
hazardous liquid intrastate pipelines, other than low-stress pipelines, 
before October 20, 1988; on carbon dioxide pipelines before July 12, 
1994; and on low-stress pipelines before July 12, 1996 as to the need 
for cathodic protection, and cathodic protection shall be provided where 
necessary.

<R05>
Sec. 195.416  External corrosion control.

    (a) Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but 
at least once each calendar year, conduct tests on each buried, in 
contact with the ground, or submerged pipeline facility in its pipeline 
system that is under cathodic protection to determine whether the 
protection is adequate.
    (b) Each operator shall maintain the test leads required for 
cathodic protection in such a condition that electrical measurements can 
be obtained to ensure adequate protection.
    (c) Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 2\1/2\ months, 
but at least six times each calendar year, inspect each of its cathodic 
protection rectifiers.
    (d) Each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 5 years, 
electrically inspect the bare pipe in its pipeline system that is not 
cathodically protected and must study leak records for that pipe to 
determine if additional protection is needed.
    (e) Whenever any buried pipe is exposed for any reason, the operator 
shall examine the pipe for evidence of external corrosion. If the 
operator finds that there is active corrosion, that the surface of the 
pipe is generally pitted, or that corrosion has caused a leak, it shall 
investigate further to determine the extent of the corrosion.
    (f) Any pipe that is found to be generally corroded so that the 
remaining wall thickness is less than the minimum thickness required by 
the pipe specification tolerances must either be replaced with coated 
pipe that meets the requirements of this part or, if the area is small, 
must be repaired. However, the operator need not replace generally 
corroded pipe if the operating pressure is reduced to be commensurate 
with the limits on operating pressure specified in this subpart, based 
on the actual remaining wall thickness.

[[Page 168]]

    (g) If localized corrosion pitting is found to exist to a degree 
where leakage might result, the pipe must be replaced or repaired, or 
the operating pressure must be reduced commensurate with the strength of 
the pipe based on the actual remaining wall thickness in the pits.
    (h) The strength of the pipe, based on actual remaining wall 
thickness, for paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section may be determined 
by the procedure in ASME B31G manual for Determining the Remaining 
Strength of Corroded Pipelines or by the procedure developed by AGA/
Battelle--A Modified Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of 
Corroded Pipe (with RSTRENG disk). Application of the procedure in the 
ASME B31G manual or the AGA/Battelle Modified Criterion is applicable to 
corroded regions (not penetrating the pipe wall) in existing steel 
pipelines in accordance with limitations set out in the respective 
procedures.
    (i) Each operator shall clean, coat with material suitable for the 
prevention of atmospheric corrosion, and, maintain this protection for, 
each component in its pipeline system that is exposed to the atmosphere.

Sec. 195.418  Internal corrosion control.

    (a) No operator may transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide 
that would corrode the pipe or other components of its pipeline system, 
unless it has investigated the corrosive effect of the hazardous liquid 
or carbon dioxide on the system and has taken adequate steps to mitigate 
corrosion.
    (b) If corrosion inhibitors are used to mitigate internal corrosion 
the operator shall use inhibitors in sufficient quantity to protect the 
entire part of the system that the inhibitors are designed to protect 
and shall also use coupons or other monitoring equipment to determine 
their effectiveness.
    (c) The operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 7\1/2\ months, 
but at least twice each calendar year, examine coupons or other types of 
monitoring equipment to determine the effectiveness of the inhibitors or 
the extent of any corrosion.
    (d) Whenever any pipe is removed from the pipeline for any reason, 
the operator must inspect the internal surface for evidence of 
corrosion. If the pipe is generally corroded such that the remaining 
wall thickness is less than the minimum thickness required by the pipe 
specification tolerances, the operator shall investigate adjacent pipe 
to determine the extent of the corrosion. The corroded pipe must be 
replaced with pipe that meets the requirements of this part or, based on 
the actual remaining wall thickness, the operating pressure must be 
reduced to be commensurate with the limits on operating pressure 
specified in this subpart.

<R05>
Sec. 195.442  Damage prevention program.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each 
operator of a buried pipeline must carry out, in accordance with this 
section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from 
excavation activities. For the purpose of this section, the term 
``excavation activities'' includes excavation, blasting, boring, 
tunneling, backfilling, the removal of aboveground structures by either 
explosive or mechanical means, and other earthmoving operations.
    (b) An operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section through participation in a public service program, 
such as a one-call system, but such participation does not relieve the 
operator of the responsibility for compliance with this section. 
However, an operator must perform the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call 
system is a qualified one-call system. In areas that are covered by more 
than one qualified one-call system, an operator need only join one of 
the qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone number 
for excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call 
systems in those areas communicate with one another. An operator's 
pipeline system must be covered by a qualified one-call system where 
there is one in place. For the purpose of this section, a one-call 
system is considered a ``qualified one-call system'' if it meets the 
requirements of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) or this section.
    (1) The state has adopted a one-call damage prevention program under 
Sec. 198.37 of this chapter; or
    (2) The one-call system:
    (i) Is operated in accordance with Sec. 198.39 of this chapter;
    (ii) Provides a pipeline operator an opportunity similar to a 
voluntary participant to have a part in management responsibilities; and
    (iii) Assesses a participating pipeline operator a fee that is 
proportionate to the costs of the one-call system's coverage of the 
operator's pipeline.
    (c) The damage prevention program required by paragraph (a) of this 
section must, at a minimum:
    (1) Include the identity, on a current basis, of persons who 
normally engage in excavation activities in the area in which the 
pipeline is located.
    (2) Provides for notification of the public in the vicinity of the 
pipeline and actual notification of persons identified in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section of the following as often as needed to make them 
aware of the damage prevention program:
    (i) The program's existence and purpose; and
    (ii) How to learn the location of underground pipelines before 
excavation activities are begun.
    (3) Provide a means of receiving and recording notification of 
planned excavation activities.
    (4) If the operator has buried pipelines in the area of excavation 
activity, provide for actual notification of persons who give notice of 
their intent to excavate of the type of temporary marking to be provided 
and how to identify the markings.

[[Page 171]]

    (5) Provide for temporary marking of buried pipelines in the area of 
excavation activity before, as far as practical, the activity begins.
    (6) Provide as follows for inspection of pipelines that an operator 
has reason to believe could be damaged by excavation activities:
    (i) The inspection must be done as frequently as necessary during 
and after the activities to verify the integrity of the pipeline; and
    (ii) In the case of blasting, any inspection must include leakage 
surveys.
    (d) A damage prevention program under this section is not required 
for the following pipelines:
    (1) Pipelines located offshore.
    (2) Pipelines to which access is physically controlled by the 
operator.

     Appendix A to Part 195--Delineation Between Federal and State 
       Jurisdiction--Statement of Agency Policy and Interpretation

    In 1979, Congress enacted comprehensive safety legislation governing 
the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, the Hazardous 
Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, 49 U.S.C. 2001 et seq. (HLPSA). The 
HLPSA expanded the existing statutory authority for safety regulation, 
which was limited to transportation by common carriers in interstate and 
foreign commerce, to transportation through facilities used in or 
affecting interstate or foreign commerce. It also added civil penalty, 
compliance order, and injunctive enforcement authorities to the existing 
criminal sanctions. Modeled largely on the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety 
Act of 1968, 49 U.S.C. 1671 et seq. (NGPSA), the HLPSA provides for a 
national hazardous liquid pipeline safety program with nationally 
uniform minimal standards and with enforcement administered through a 
Federal-State partnership. The HLPSA leaves to exclusive Federal 
regulation and enforcement the ``interstate pipeline facilities,'' those 
used for the pipeline transportation of hazardous liquids in interstate 
or foreign commerce. For the remainder of the pipeline facilities, 
denominated ``intrastate pipeline facilities,'' the HLPSA provides that 
the same Federal regulation and enforcement will apply unless a State 
certifies that it will assume those responsibilities. A certified State 
must adopt the same minimal standards but may adopt additional more 
stringent standards so long as they are compatible. Therefore, in States 
which participate in the hazardous liquid pipeline safety program 
through certification, it is necessary to distinguish the interstate 
from the intrastate pipeline facilities.
    In deciding that an administratively practical approach was 
necessary in distinguishing between interstate and intrastate liquid 
pipeline facilities and in determining how best to accomplish this, DOT 
has logically examined the approach used in the NGPSA. The NGPSA defines 
the interstate gas pipeline facilities subject to exclusive Federal 
jurisdiction as those subject to the economic regulatory jurisdiction of 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Experience has proven 
this approach practical. Unlike the NGPSA however, the HLPSA has no 
specific reference to FERC jurisdiction, but instead defines interstate 
liquid pipeline facilities by the more commonly used means of specifying 
the end points of the transportation involved. For example, the economic 
regulatory jurisdiction of FERC over the transportation of both gas and 
liquids by pipeline is defined in much the same way. In implementing the 
HLPSA DOT has sought a practicable means of distinguishing between 
interstate and intrastate pipeline facilities that provide the requisite 
degree of certainty to Federal and State enforcement personnel and to 
the regulated entities. DOT intends that this statement of agency policy 
and interpretation provide that certainty.
    In 1981, DOT decided that the inventory of liquid pipeline 
facilities identified as subject to the jurisdiction of FERC 
approximates the HLPSA category of ``interstate pipeline facilities.'' 
Administrative use of the FERC inventory has the added benefit of 
avoiding the creation of a separate Federal scheme for determination of 
jurisdiction over the same regulated entities. DOT recognizes that the 
FERC inventory is only an approximation and may not be totally 
satisfactory without some modification. The difficulties stem from some 
significant differences in the economic regulation of liquid and of 
natural gas pipelines. There is an affirmative assertion of jurisdiction 
by FERC over natural gas pipelines through the issuance of certificates

[[Page 172]]

of public convenience and necessity prior to commencing operations. With 
liquid pipelines, there is only a rebuttable presumption of jurisdiction 
created by the filing by pipeline operators of tariffs (or concurrences) 
for movement of liquids through existing facilities. Although FERC does 
police the filings for such matters as compliance with the general 
duties of common carriers, the question of jurisdiction is normally only 
aired upon complaint. While any person, including State or Federal 
agencies, can avail themselves of the FERC forum by use of the complaint 
process, that process has only been rarely used to review jurisdictional 
matters (probably because of the infrequency of real disputes on the 
issue). Where the issue has arisen, the reviewing body has noted the 
need to examine various criteria primarily of an economic nature. DOT 
believes that, in most cases, the formal FERC forum can better receive 
and evaluate the type of information that is needed to make decisions of 
this nature than can DOT.
    In delineating which liquid pipeline facilities are interstate 
pipeline facilities within the meaning of the HLPSA, DOT will generally 
rely on the FERC filings; that is, if there is a tariff or concurrence 
filed with FERC governing the transportation of hazardous liquids over a 
pipeline facility or if there has been an exemption from the obligation 
to file tariffs obtained from FERC, then DOT will, as a general rule, 
consider the facility to be an interstate pipeline facility within the 
meaning of the HLPSA. The types of situations in which DOT will ignore 
the existence or non-existence of a filing with FERC will be limited to 
those cases in which it appears obvious that a complaint filed with FERC 
would be successful or in which blind reliance on a FERC filing would 
result in a situation clearly not intended by the HLPSA such as a 
pipeline facility not being subject to either State or Federal safety 
regulation. DOT anticipates that the situations in which there is any 
question about the validity of the FERC filings as a ready reference 
will be few and that the actual variations from reliance on those 
filings will be rare. The following examples indicate the types of 
facilities which DOT believes are interstate pipeline facilities subject 
to the HLPSA despite the lack of a filing with FERC and the types of 
facilities over which DOT will generally defer to the jurisdiction of a 
certifying state despite the existence of a filing with FERC.
    Example 1. Pipeline company P operates a pipeline from ``Point A'' 
located in State X to ``Point B'' (also in X). The physical facilities 
never cross a state line and do not connect with any other pipeline 
which does cross a state line. Pipeline company P also operates another 
pipeline between ``Point C'' in State X and ``Point D'' in an adjoining 
State Y. Pipeline company P files a tariff with FERC for transportation 
from ``Point A'' to ``Point B'' as well as for transportation from 
``Point C'' to ``Point D.'' DOT will ignore filing for the line from 
``Point A'' to ``Point B'' and consider the line to be intrastate.
    Example 2. Same as in example 1 except that P does not file any 
tariffs with FERC. DOT will assume jurisdiction of the line between 
``Point C'' and ``Point D.''
    Example 3. Same as in example 1 except that P files its tariff for 
the line between ``Point C'' and ``Point D'' not only with FERC but also 
with State X. DOT will rely on the FERC filing as indication of 
interstate commerce.
    Example 4. Same as in example 1 except that the pipeline from 
``Point A'' to ``Point B'' (in State X) connects with a pipeline 
operated by another company transports liquid between ``Point B'' (in 
State X) and ``Point D'' (in State Y). DOT will rely on the FERC filing 
as indication of interstate commerce.
    Example 5. Same as in example 1 except that the line between ``Point 
C'' and ``Point D'' has a lateral line connected to it. The lateral is 
located entirely with State X. DOT will rely on the existence or non-
existence of a FERC filing covering transportation over that lateral as 
determinative of interstate commerce.
    Example 6. Same as in example 1 except that the certified agency in 
State X has brought an enforcement action (under the pipeline safety 
laws) against P because of its operation of the line between ``Point A'' 
and ``Point B''. P has successfully defended against the action on 
jurisdictional grounds. DOT will assume jurisdiction if necessary to 
avoid the anomaly of a pipeline subject to neither State or Federal 
safety enforcement. DOT's assertion of jurisdiction in such a case would 
be based on the gap in the state's enforcement authority rather than a 
DOT decision that the pipeline is an interstate pipeline facility.
    Example 7. Pipeline Company P operates a pipeline that originates on 
the Outer Continental Shelf. P does not file any tariff for that line 
with FERC. DOT will consider the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline 
facility.
    Example 8. Pipeline Company P is constructing a pipeline from 
``Point C'' (in State X) to ``Point D'' (in State Y). DOT will consider 
the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.
    Example 9. Pipeline company P is constructing a pipeline from 
``Point C'' to ``Point E'' (both in State X) but intends to file tariffs 
with FERC in the transportation of hazardous liquid in interstate 
commerce. Assuming there is some connection to an interstate pipeline 
facility, DOT will consider this line to be an interstate pipeline 
facility.
    Example 10. Pipeline Company P has operated a pipeline subject to 
FERC economic

[[Page 173]]

regulation. Solely because of some statutory economic deregulation, that 
pipeline is no longer regulated by FERC. DOT will continue to consider 
that pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.
    As seen from the examples, the types of situations in which DOT will 
not defer to the FERC regulatory scheme are generally clear-cut cases. 
For the remainder of the situations where variation from the FERC scheme 
would require DOT to replicate the forum already provided by FERC and to 
consider economic factors better left to that agency, DOT will decline 
to vary its reliance on the FERC filings unless, of course, not doing so 
would result in situations clearly not intended by the HLPSA.

Sec. 198.11  Grant authority.

    The pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.) authorize the 
Administrator to pay out funds appropriated or

[[Page 174]]

otherwise make available up to 50 percent of the cost of the personnel, 
equipment, and activities reasonably required for each state agency to 
carry out a safety program for intrastate pipeline facilities under a 
certification or agreement with the Administrator or to act as an agent 
of the Administrator with respect to interstate pipeline facilities.

[Amdt. 198-2, 61 FR 18518, Apr. 26, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 198.13  Grant allocation formula.

    (a) Beginning in calendar year 1993, the Administrator places 
increasing emphasis on program performance in allocating state agency 
funds under Sec. 198.11. The maximum percent of each state agency 
allocation that is based on performance follows: 1993--75 percent; 1994 
and subsequent years--100 percent.
    (b) A state's annual grant allocation is based on maximum of 100 
performance points derived as follows:
    (1) Fifty points based on information provided in the state's annual 
certification/agreement attachments which document its activities for 
the past year; and
    (2) Fifty points based on the annual state program evaluation.
    (c) The Administrator assigns weights to various performance factors 
reflecting program compliance, safety priorities, and national concerns 
identified by the Administrator and communicated to each State agency. 
At a minimum, the Administrator considers the following performance 
factors in allocating funds:
    (1) Adequacy of state operating practices;
    (2) Quality of state inspections, investigations, and enforcement/
compliance actions;
    (3) Adequacy of state recordkeeping;
    (4) Extent of state safety regulatory jurisdiction over pipeline 
facilities;
    (5) Qualifications of state inspectors;
    (6) Number of state inspection person-days;
    (7) State adoption of applicable federal pipeline safety standards; 
and
    (8) Any other factor the Administrator deems necessary to measure 
performance.
    (d) Notwithstanding these performance factors, the Administrator 
may, in 1993 and subsequent years, continue funding any state at the 
1991 level, provided its request is at the 1991 level or higher and 
appropriated funds are at the 1991 level or higher.
    (e) The Administrator notifies each state agency in writing of the 
specific performance factors to be used and the weights to be assigned 
to each factor at least 9 months prior to allocating funds. Prior to 
notification, RSPA seeks state agency comments on any proposed changes 
to the allocation formula.
    (f) Grants are limited to the appropriated funds available. If total 
state agency requests for grants exceed the funds available, the 
Administrator prorates each state agency's allocation.


<R04>
        Subpart C--Adoption of One-Call Damage Prevention Program


<R05>
Sec. 198.31  Scope.

    This subpart implements parts of the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 
60101 et seq.), which direct the Secretary to require each State to 
adopt a one-call damage prevention program as a condition to receiving a 
full grant-in-aid for its pipeline safety compliance program.

<R05>
Sec. 198.35  Grants conditioned on adoption of one-call damage prevention program.

    In allocating grants to State agencies under the pipeline safety 
laws, (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), the Secretary considers whether a State 
has adopted or is seeking to adopt a one-call damage prevention program 
in accordance with Sec. 198.37. If a State has not adopted or is not 
seeking to adopt such program, the State agency may not receive the full 
reimbursement to which it would otherwise be entitled.

[Amdt. 198-2, 61 FR 38403, July 24, 1996]


<R05>
Sec. 198.37  State one-call damage prevention program.

    A State must adopt a one-call damage prevention program that 
requires each of the following at a minimum:
    (a) Each area of the State that contains underground pipeline 
facilities

[[Page 175]]

must be covered by a one-call notification system.
    (b) Each one-call notification system must be operated in accordance 
with Sec. 198.39.
    (c) Excavators must be required to notify the operational center of 
the one-call notification system that covers the area of each intended 
excavation activity and provide the following information:
    (1) Name of the person notifying the system.
    (2) Name, address and telephone number of the excavator.
    (3) Specific location, starting date, and description of the 
intended excavation activity.

However, an excavator must be allowed to begin an excavation activity in 
an emergency but, in doing so, required to notify the operational center 
at the earliest practicable moment.
    (d) The State must determine whether telephonic and other 
communications to the operational center of a one-call notification 
system under paragraph (c) of this section are to be toll free or not.
    (e) Except with respect to interstate transmission facilities as 
defined in the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), operators 
of underground pipeline facilities must be required to participate in 
the one-call notification systems that cover the areas of the State in 
which those pipeline facilities are located.
    (f) Operators of underground pipeline facilities participating in 
the one-call notification systems must be required to respond in the 
manner prescribed by Sec. 192.614 (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this chapter 
to notices of intended excavation activity received from the operational 
center of a one-call notification system.
    (g) Persons who operate one-call notification systems or operators 
of underground pipeline facilities participating or required to 
participate in the one-call notification systems must be required to 
notify the public and known excavators in the manner prescribed by 
Sec. 192.614 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this chapter of the availability and 
use of one-call notification systems to locate underground pipeline 
facilities. However, this paragraph does not apply to persons (including 
operator's master meters) whose primary activity does not include the 
production, transportation or marketing of gas or hazardous liquids.
    (h) Operators of underground pipeline facilities (other than 
operators of interstate transmission facilities as defined in the 
pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), and interstate pipelines 
as defined in Sec. 195.2 of this chapter), excavators and persons who 
operate one-call notification systems who violate the applicable 
requirements of this subpart must be subject to civil penalties and 
injunctive relief that are substantially the same as are provided under 
the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.).

Sec. 199.9  Use of persons who fail or refuse a drug test.

    (a) An operator may not knowingly use as an employee any person 
who--
    (1) Fails a drug test required by this part and the medical review 
officer makes a determination under Sec. 199.15(d)(2); or
    (2) Refuses to take a drug test required by this part.
    (b) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to a person who 
has--
    (1) Passed a drug test under DOT Procedures;
    (2) Been recommended by the medical review officer for return to

Dec. 18, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 199.11  Drug tests required.

    Each operator shall conduct the following drug tests for the 
presence of a prohibited drug:
    (a) Pre-employment testing. No operator may hire or contract for the 
use of any person as an employee unless that person passes a drug test 
or is covered by an anti-drug program that conforms to the requirements 
of this part.
    (b) Post-accident testing. As soon as possible but no later than 32 
hours after an accident, an operator shall drug test each employee whose 
performance either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely 
discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. If an employee is 
injured, unconscious, or otherwise unable to evidence consent to the 
drug test, all reasonable steps must be taken to obtain a urine sample. 
An operator may decide not to test under this paragraph but such a 
decision must be based on the best information available immediately 
after the accident that the employee's performance could not have 
contributed to the accident or that, because of the time between that 
performance and the accident, it is not likely that a drug test would 
reveal whether the performance was affected by drug use.
    (c) Random testing. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) 
through (4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for 
random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees.
    (2) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported 
positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this 
determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this 
subpart. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator 
considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain 
additional information or reports from operators, and may make 
appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. 
Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the 
minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered 
employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug 
testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year 
following publication.
    (3) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of 
all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data 
received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 199.25 for two 
consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is 
less than 1.0 percent.
    (4) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of 
Sec. 199.25 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive 
rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will 
increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 
50 percent of all covered employees.
    (5) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made 
by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a 
computer-

[[Page 179]]

based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social 
Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable 
identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered 
employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections 
are made.
    (6) The operator shall randomly select a sufficient number of 
covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an 
annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random 
drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the operator conducts 
random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be 
tested may be calculated for each individual operator or may be based on 
the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are 
subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage 
rate under this subpart or any DOT drug testing rule.
    (7) Each operator shall ensure that random drug tests conducted 
under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates for administering 
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (8) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing 
under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same 
operator, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency 
regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.
    (9) If an operator is required to conduct random drug testing under 
the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the operator may--
    (i) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same 
required rate; or
    (ii) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to 
which the operator is subject.
    (d) Testing based on reasonable cause. Each operator shall drug test 
each employee when there is reasonable cause to believe the employee is 
using a prohibited drug. The decision to test must be based on a 
reasonable and articulable belief that the employee is using a 
prohibited drug on the basis of specific, contemporaneous physical, 
behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drug use. At least two 
of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of 
the possible symptoms of drug use, shall substantiate and concur in the 
decision to test an employee. The concurrence between the two 
supervisors may be by telephone. However, in the case of operators with 
50 or fewer employees subject to testing under this part, only one 
supervisor of the employee trained in detecting possible drug use 
symptoms shall substantiate the decision to test.
    (e) Return to duty testing. A covered employee who refuses to take 
or has a positive drug test may not return to duty in the covered 
function until the covered employee has been evaluated face-to-face by a 
SAP, has properly followed any prescribed assistance, has passed a 
return-to-duty drug test administered under this part, and the SAP has 
determined that the employee may return to duty.
    (f) Follow-up testing. A covered employee who refuses to take or has 
a positive drug test shall be subject to unannounced follow-up drug 
tests administered by the operator following the covered employee's 
return to duty. The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall 
be determined by a substance abuse professional, but shall consist of at 
least six tests in the first 12 months following the covered employee's 
return to duty. In addition, follow-up testing may include testing for 
alcohol as directed by the substance abuse professional, to be performed 
in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 
months from the date of the covered employee's return to duty. The 
substance abuse professional may terminate the requirement for follow-up 
testing at any time after the first six tests have been administered, if 
the

[[Page 180]]

substance abuse professional determines that such testing is no longer 
necessary.

Sec. 199.13  Drug testing laboratory.

    (a) Each operator shall use for the drug testing required by this 
part only drug testing laboratories certified by the Department of 
Health and Human Services under the DOT Procedures.
    (b) The drug testing laboratory must permit--
    (1) Inspections by the operator before the laboratory is awarded a 
testing contract; and
    (2) Unannounced inspections, including examination of records, at 
any time, by the operator, the Administrator, and if the operator is 
subject to state agency jurisdiction, a representative of that state 
agency.


<R05>
Sec. 199.15  Review of drug testing results.

    (a) MRO appointment. Each operator shall designate or appoint a 
medical review officer (MRO). If an operator does not have a qualified 
individual on staff to serve as MRO, the operator may contract for the 
provision of MRO services as part of its anti-drug program.
    (b) MRO qualifications. The MRO must be a licensed physician with 
knowledge of drug abuse disorders.
    (c) MRO duties. The MRO shall perform the following functions for 
the operator:
    (1) Review the results of drug testing before they are reported to 
the operator.
    (2) Review and interpret each confirmed positive test result as 
follows to determine if there is an alternative medical explanation for 
the confirmed positive test result:
    (i) Conduct a medical interview with the individual tested.
    (ii) Review the individual's medical history and any relevant 
biomedical factors.
    (iii) Review all medical records made available by the individual 
tested to determine if a confirmed positive test resulted from legally 
prescribed medication.
    (iv) If necessary, require that the original specimen be reanalyzed 
to determine the accuracy of the reported test result.
    (v) Verify that the laboratory report and assessment are correct.
    (3) Ensure that an employee has been drug tested in accordance with 
the DOT Procedures before the employee returns to duty.
    (d) MRO determinations. The following rules govern MRO 
determinations:
    (1) If the MRO determines, after appropriate review, that there is a 
legitimate medical explanation for the confirmed positive test result 
other than the unauthorized use of a prohibited drug, the MRO is not 
required to take further action.
    (2) If the MRO determines, after appropriate review, that there is 
no legitimate medical explanation for the confirmed positive test result 
other than the unauthorized use of a prohibited drug, the MRO shall 
refer:
    (i) The individual tested to a personnel or administrative office 
for further proceedings in accordance with the operator's anti-drug 
plan; and
    (ii) For evaluation by a SAP who shall determine what assistance, if 
any, the employee needs in resolving problems associated with drug 
misuse.
    (3) Based on a review of laboratory inspection reports, quality 
assurance and quality control data, and other drug test results, the MRO 
may conclude that a particular drug test result is scientifically 
insufficient for further action. Under these circumstances, the MRO 
should conclude that the test is negative for the presence of a 
prohibited drug or drug metabolite in an individual's system.
    (e) Evaluation and rehabilitation may be provided by the operator, 
by a substance abuse professional under contract with the operator, or 
by a substance abuse professional not affiliated with the operator. The 
choice of substance abuse professional and assignment of costs shall be 
made in accordance with the operator/employee agreements and operator/
employee policies.
    (f) The operator shall ensure that a substance abuse professional, 
who determines that a covered employee requires assistance in resolving 
problems

[[Page 181]]

with drug abuse, does not refer the covered employee to the substance 
abuse professional's private practice or to a person or organization 
from which the substance abuse professional receives remuneration or in 
which the substance abuse professional has a financial interest. This 
paragraph does not prohibit a substance abuse professional from 
referring a covered employee for assistance provided through:
    (1) A public agency, such as a State, county, or municipality;
    (2) The operator or a person under contract to provide treatment for 
drug problems on behalf of the operator;
    (3) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment under 
the employee's health insurance program; or
    (4) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment 
reasonably accessible to the employee.

<R05>
Sec. 199.17  Retention of samples and retesting.

    (a) Samples that yield positive results on confirmation must be 
retained by the laboratory in properly secured, long-term, frozen 
storage for at least 365 days as required by the DOT Procedures. Within 
this 365-day period, the employee or the employee's representative, the 
operator, the Administrator, or, if the operator is subject to the 
jurisdiction of a state agency, the state agency may request that the 
laboratory retain the sample for an additional period. If, within the 
365-day period, the laboratory has not received a proper written request 
to retain the sample for a further reasonable period specified in the 
request, the sample may be discarded following the end of the 365-day 
period.
    (b) If the medical review officer (MRO) determines there is no 
legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive test result 
other than the unauthorized use of a prohibited drug, the original 
sample must be retested if the employee makes a written request for 
retesting within 60 days of receipt of the final test result from the 
MRO. The employee may specify retesting by the original laboratory or by 
a second laboratory that is certified by the Department of Health and 
Human Services. The operator may require the employee to pay in advance 
the cost of shipment (if any) and reanalysis of the sample, but the 
employee must be reimbursed for such expense if the retest is negative.
    (c) If the employee specifies retesting by a second laboratory, the 
original laboratory must follow approved chain-of-custody procedures in 
transferring a portion of the sample.
    (d) Since some analytes may deteriorate during storage, detected 
levels of the drug below the detection limits established in the DOT 
Procedures, but equal to or greater than the established sensitivity of 
the assay, must, as technically appropriate, be reported and considered 
corroborative of the original positive results.

<R05>
Sec. 199.19  Employee assistance program.

    (a) Each operator shall provide an employee assistance program (EAP) 
for its employees and supervisory personnel who will determine whether 
an employee must be drug tested based on reasonable cause. The operator 
may establish the EAP as a part of its internal personnel services or 
the operator may contract with an entity that provides EAP services. 
Each EAP must include education and training on drug use. At the 
discretion of the operator, the EAP may include an opportunity for 
employee rehabilitation.
    (b) Education under each EAP must include at least the following 
elements: display and distribution of informational material; display 
and distribution of a community service hot-line telephone number for 
employee assistance; and display and distribution of the employer's 
policy regarding the use of prohibited drugs.
    (c) Training under each EAP for supervisory personnel who will 
determine whether an employee must be drug tested based on reasonable 
cause must include one 60-minute period of training on the specific, 
contemporaneous physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of 
probable drug use.

<R05>
Sec. 199.21  Contractor employees.

    With respect to those employees who are contractors or employed by a 
contractor, an operator may provide by contract that the drug testing, 
education, and training required by this part be carried out by the 
contractor provided:
    (a) The operator remains responsible for ensuring that the 
requirements of this part are complied with; and
    (b) The contractor allows access to property and records by the 
operator, the Administrator, and if the operator is subject to the 
jurisdiction of a state agency, a representative of the state agency for 
the purpose of monitoring the operator's compliance with the 
requirements of this part.


<R05>
Sec. 199.23  Recordkeeping.

    (a) Each operator shall keep the following records for the periods 
specified and permit access to the records as provided by paragraph (b) 
of this section:
    (1) Records that demonstrate the collection process conforms to this 
part must be kept for at least 3 years.
    (2) Records of employee drug test results that show employees who 
had a positive test, and the type of test (e.g., post-accident), and 
records that demonstrate rehabilitation, if any, must be kept for at 
least 5 years, and include the following information:
    (i) The function performed by each employee who had a positive drug 
test result.
    (ii) The prohibited drug(s) that were used by an employee who had a 
positive drug test.
    (iii) The disposition of each employee who had a positive drug test 
or refused a drug test (e.g., termination, rehabilitation, removed from 
covered function, other).
    (3) Records of employee drug test results that show employees passed 
a drug test must be kept for at least 1 year.
    (4) A record of the number of employees tested, by type of test 
(e.g., post-accident), must be kept for at least 5 years.
    (5) Records confirming that supervisors and employees have been 
trained as required by this part must be kept for at least 3 years.
    (b) Information regarding an individual's drug testing results or 
rehabilitation may be released only upon the written consent of the 
individual, except that such information must be released regardless of 
consent to the Administrator or the representative of a state agency 
upon request as part of an accident investigation. Statistical data 
related to drug testing and rehabilitation that is not name-specific and 
training records must be made available to the Administrator or the 
representative of a state agency upon request.

alcohol test required under Sec. 199.225(d). No operator shall permit an 
employee who refuses to submit to such a test to perform or continue to 
perform covered functions.

[[Page 186]]


<R05>
Sec. 199.225  Alcohol tests required.

    Each operator shall conduct the following types of alcohol tests for 
the presence of alcohol:
    (a) Post-accident. (1) As soon as practicable following an accident, 
each operator shall test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if 
that employee's performance of a covered function either contributed to 
the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor 
to the accident. The decision not to administer a test under this 
section shall be based on the operator's determination, using the best 
available information at the time of the determination, that the covered 
employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident.
    (2)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
2 hours following the accident, the operator shall prepare and maintain 
on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly 
administered. If a test required by paragraph (a) is not administered 
within 8 hours following the accident, the operator shall cease attempts 
to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons 
for not administering the test.
    (ii) For the years stated in this paragraph, employers who submit 
MIS reports shall submit to RSPA each record of a test required by this 
section that is not completed within 8 hours. The employer's records of 
tests that could not be completed within 8 hours shall be submitted to 
RSPA by March 15, 1996; March 15, 1997; and March 15, 1998; for calendar 
years 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. Employers shall append these 
records to their MIS submissions. Each record shall include the 
following information:
    (A) Type of test (reasonable suspicion/post-accident);
    (B) Triggering event (including date, time, and location);
    (C) Employee category (do not include employee name or other 
identifying information);
    (D) Reason(s) test could not be completed within 8 hours; and
    (E) If blood alcohol testing could have been completed within eight 
hours, the name, address, and telephone number of the testing site where 
blood testing could have occurred.
    (3) A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing who 
fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying 
the operator or operator representative of his/her location if he/she 
leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, may 
be deemed by the operator to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing 
in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary 
medical attention for injured people following an accident or to 
prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for 
the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident 
or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.
    (b) Reasonable suspicion testing. (1) Each operator shall require a 
covered employee to submit to an alcohol test when the operator has 
reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the 
prohibitions in this subpart.
    (2) The operator's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to 
require the covered employee to undergo an alcohol test shall be based 
on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the 
appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the employee. The 
required observations shall be made by a supervisor who is trained in 
detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse. The supervisor who makes the 
determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall not conduct the 
breath alcohol test on that employee.
    (3) Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the 
observations required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section are made 
during, just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that 
the employee is required to be in compliance with this subpart. A 
covered employee may be directed by the operator to undergo reasonable 
suspicion testing for alcohol only while the employee is performing 
covered functions; just before the employee is to perform covered 
functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing covered 
functions.

[[Page 187]]

    (4)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
2 hours following the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, the operator shall prepare and maintain on file a record 
stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test 
required by this section is not administered within 8 hours following 
the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the operator 
shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in 
the record the reasons for not administering the test. Records shall be 
submitted to RSPA upon request of the Administrator.
    (ii) For the years stated in this paragraph, employers who submit 
MIS reports shall submit to RSPA each record of a test required by this 
section that is not completed within 8 hours. The employer's records of 
tests that could not be completed within 8 hours shall be submitted to 
RSPA by March 15, 1996; March 15, 1997; and March 15, 1998; for calendar 
years 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. Employers shall append these 
records to their MIS submissions. Each record shall include the 
following information:
    (A) Type of test (reasonable suspicion/post-accident);
    (B) Triggering event (including date, time, and location);
    (C) Employee category (do not include employee name or other 
identifying information);
    (D) Reason(s) test could not be completed within 8 hours; and
    (E) If blood alcohol testing could have been completed within eight 
hours, the name, address, and telephone number of the testing site where 
blood testing could have occurred.
    (iii) Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol 
test under this section, an operator shall not permit a covered employee 
to report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of 
covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or 
impaired by alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance 
indicators of alcohol misuse, nor shall an operator permit the covered 
employee to perform or continue to perform covered functions, until:
    (A) An alcohol test is administered and the employee's alcohol 
concentration measures less than 0.02; or
    (B) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty 
period, but not less than 8 hours following the determination under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there is reasonable suspicion to 
believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions in this subpart.
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii), no operator shall 
take any action under this subpart against a covered employee based 
solely on the employee's behavior and appearance in the absence of an 
alcohol test. This does not prohibit an operator with the authority 
independent of this subpart from taking any action otherwise consistent 
with law.
    (c) Return-to-duty testing. Each operator shall ensure that before a 
covered employee returns to duty requiring the performance of a covered 
function after engaging in conduct prohibited by Secs. 199.215 through 
199.223, the employee shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a 
result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
    (d) Follow-up testing. (1) Following a determination under 
Sec. 199.243(b) that a covered employee is in need of assistance in 
resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse, each operator shall 
ensure that the employee is subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol 
testing as directed by a substance abuse professional in accordance with 
the provisions of Sec. 199.243(c)(2)(ii).
    (2) Follow-up testing shall be conducted when the covered employee 
is performing covered functions; just before the employee is to perform 
covered functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such 
functions.
    (e) Retesting of covered employees with an alcohol concentration of 
0.02 or greater but less than 0.04. Each operator shall retest a covered 
employee to ensure compliance with the provisions of Sec. 199.237, if an 
operator chooses to permit the employee to perform a covered function 
within 8 hours following the

[[Page 188]]

administration of an alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 
0.02 or greater but less than 0.04.

Sec. 199.233  Removal from covered function.

    Except as provided in Secs. 199.239 through 199.243, no operator 
shall permit any covered employee to perform covered functions if the 
employee has engaged in conduct prohibited by Secs. 199.215 through 
199.223 or an alcohol misuse rule of another DOT agency.


<R05>
Sec. 199.235  Required evaluation and testing.

    No operator shall permit a covered employee who has engaged in

functions unless the employee has met the requirements of Sec. 199.243.


<R05>
Sec. 199.237  Other alcohol-related conduct.

    (a) No operator shall permit a covered employee tested under the 
provisions of Sec. 199.225, who is found to have an alcohol 
concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04, to perform or 
continue to perform covered functions, until:
    (1) The employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02 in 
accordance with a test administered under Sec. 199.225(e); or
    (2) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty

[[Page 191]]

not less than eight hours following administration of the test.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, no operator 
shall take any action under this subpart against an employee based 
solely on test results showing an alcohol concentration less than 0.04. 
This does not prohibit an operator with authority independent of this 
subpart from taking any action otherwise consistent with law.


<R05>
Sec. 199.239  Operator obligation to promulgate a policy on the misuse of alcohol.

    (a) General requirements. Each operator shall provide educational 
materials that explain these alcohol misuse requirements and the 
operator's policies and procedures with respect to meeting those 
requirements.
    (1) The operator shall ensure that a copy of these materials is 
distributed to each covered employee prior to start of alcohol testing 
under this subpart, and to each person subsequently hired for or 
transferred to a covered position.
    (2) Each operator shall provide written notice to representatives of 
employee organizations of the availability of this information.
    (b) Required content. The materials to be made available to covered 
employees shall include detailed discussion of at least the following:
    (1) The identity of the person designated by the operator to answer 
covered employee questions about the materials.
    (2) The categories of employees who are subject to the provisions of 
this subpart.
    (3) Sufficient information about the covered functions performed by 
those employees to make clear what period of the work day the covered 
employee is required to be in compliance with this subpart.
    (4) Specific information concerning covered employee conduct that is 
prohibited by this subpart.
    (5) The circumstances under which a covered employee will be tested 
for alcohol under this subpart.
    (6) The procedures that will be used to test for the presence of 
alcohol, protect the covered employee and the integrity of the breath 
testing process, safeguard the validity of the test results, and ensure 
that those results are attributed to the correct employee.
    (7) The requirement that a covered employee submit to alcohol tests 
administered in accordance with this subpart.
    (8) An explanation of what constitutes a refusal to submit to an 
alcohol test and the attendant consequences.
    (9) The consequences for covered employees found to have violated 
the prohibitions under this subpart, including the requirement that the 
employee be removed immediately from covered functions, and the 
procedures under Sec. 199.243.
    (10) The consequences for covered employees found to have an alcohol 
concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04.
    (11) Information concerning the effects of alcohol misuse on an 
individual's health, work, and personal life; signs and symptoms of an 
alcohol problem (the employee's or a coworker's); and including 
intervening evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse 
of alcohol including intervening when an alcohol problem is suspected, 
confrontation, referral to any available EAP, and/or referral to 
management.
    (c) Optional provisions. The materials supplied to covered employees 
may also include information on additional operator policies with 
respect to the use or possession of alcohol, including any consequences 
for an employee found to have a specified alcohol level, that are based 
on the operator's authority independent of this subpart. Any such 
additional policies or consequences shall be clearly described as being 
based on independent authority.


<R05>
Sec. 199.241  Training for supervisors.

    Each operator shall ensure that persons designated to determine 
whether reasonable suspicion exists to require a covered employee to 
undergo alcohol testing under Sec. 199.225(b) receive at least 60 
minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance 
indicators of probable alcohol misuse.

[[Page 192]]


<R05>
Sec. 199.243  Referral, evaluation, and treatment.

    (a) Each covered employee who has engaged in conduct prohibited by 
Secs. 199.215 through 199.223 of this subpart shall be advised of the 
resources available to the covered employee in evaluating and resolving 
problems associated with the misuse of alcohol, including the names, 
addresses, and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals and 
counseling and treatment programs.
    (b) Each covered employee who engages in conduct prohibited under 
Secs. 199.215 through 199.223 shall be evaluated by a substance abuse 
professional who shall determine what assistance, if any, the employee 
needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse.
    (c)(1) Before a covered employee returns to duty requiring the 
performance of a covered function after engaging in conduct prohibited 
by Secs. 199.215 through 199.223 of this subpart, the employee shall 
undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an 
alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
    (2) In addition, each covered employee identified as needing 
assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse--
    (i) Shall be evaluated by a substance abuse professional to 
determine that the employee has properly followed any rehabilitation 
program prescribed under paragraph (b) of this section, and
    (ii) Shall be subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol tests 
administered by the operator following the employee's return to duty. 
The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall be determined 
by a substance abuse professional, but shall consist of at least six 
tests in the first 12 months following the employee's return to duty. In 
addition, follow-up testing may include testing for drugs, as directed 
by the substance abuse professional, to be performed in accordance with 
49 CFR part 40. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the 
date of the employee's return to duty. The substance abuse professional 
may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after 
the first six tests have been administered, if the substance abuse 
professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.
    (d) Evaluation and rehabilitation may be provided by the operator, 
by a substance abuse professional under contract with the operator, or 
by a substance abuse professional not affiliated with the operator. The 
choice of substance abuse professional and assignment of costs shall be 
made in accordance with the operator/employee agreements and operator/
employee policies.
    (e) The operator shall ensure that a substance abuse professional 
who determines that a covered employee requires assistance in resolving 
problems with alcohol misuse does not refer the employee to the 
substance abuse professional's private practice or to a person or 
organization from which the substance abuse professional receives 
remuneration or in which the substance abuse professional has a 
financial interest. This paragraph does not prohibit a substance abuse 
professional from referring an employee for assistance provided 
through--
    (1) A public agency, such as a State, county, or municipality;
    (2) The operator or a person under contract to provide treatment for 
alcohol problems on behalf of the operator;
    (3) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment under 
the employee's health insurance program; or
    (4) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment 
reasonably accessible to the employee.


<R05>
Sec. 199.245  Contractor employees.

    (a) With respect to those covered employees who are contractors or 
employed by a contractor, an operator may provide by contract that the 
alcohol testing, training and education required by this subpart be 
carried out by the contractor provided:
    (b) The operator remains responsible for ensuring that the 
requirements of this subpart and part 40 of this title are complied 
with; and
    (c) The contractor allows access to property and records by the 
operator, the Administrator, any DOT agency with regulatory authority 
over the operator or covered employee, and, if the operator is subject 
to the jurisdiction of a state agency, a representative of the state 
agency for the purposes of monitoring the operator's compliance with the 
requirements of this subpart and part 40 of this title.
