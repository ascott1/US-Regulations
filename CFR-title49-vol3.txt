                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2005), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

interested person and is not less than 18 years of age, or by certified 
or registered mail.
    (d) Service of a subpoena upon the person named therein shall be 
made by delivering a copy of the subpoena to such person and by 
tendering the fees for one day's attendance and mileage as specified by 
paragraph (g) of this section. When a subpoena is issued at the instance 
of any officer or agency of the United States, fees and mileage need not 
be tendered at the time of service. Delivery of a copy of a subpoena and 
tender of the fees to a natural person may be made by handing them to 
the person, leaving them at the person's office with the person in 
charge thereof, leaving them at the person's dwelling place or usual 
place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then 
residing therein, by mailing them by registered or certified mail to the 
person at the last known address, or by any method whereby actual notice 
is given to the person and the fees are made available prior to the 
return date.
    (e) When the person to be served is not a natural person, delivery 
of a copy of the subpoena and tender of the fees may be effected by 
handing them to a designated agent or representative for service, or to 
any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of the person, 
or by mailing them by registered or certified mail to that agent or 
representative and the fees are made available prior to the return date.
    (f) The original subpoena bearing a certificate of service shall be 
filed with the official having responsibility for the proceeding in 
connection with which the subpoena was issued.
    (g) A subpoenaed witness shall be paid the same fees and mileage as 
would be paid to a witness in a proceeding in the district courts of the 
United States. The witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the person 
at

[[Page 9]]

whose instance the subpoena was issued.
    (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section, 
and upon request, the witness fees and mileage may be paid by the PHMSA 
if the official who issued the subpoena determines on the basis of good 
cause shown, that:
    (1) The presence of the subpoenaed witness will materially advance 
the proceeding; and
    (2) The person at whose instance the subpoena was issued would 
suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness fees and 
mileage.
    (i) Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, prior to the time 
specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than 10 days 
after the date of service of such subpoena, apply to the official who 
issued the subpoena, or if the person is unavailable, to the 
Administrator, PHMSA to quash or modify the subpoena. The application 
shall contain a brief statement of the reasons relied upon in support of 
the action sought therein. The Administrator, PHMSA, or this issuing 
official, as the case may be, may:
    (1) Deny the application;
    (2) Quash or modify the subpoena; or
    (3) Condition a grant or denial of the application to quash or 
modify the subpoena upon the satisfaction of certain just and reasonable 
requirements. The denial may be summary.
    (j) Upon refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person under the 
provisions of this section, the PHMSA may request the Attorney General 
to seek the aid of the U. S. District Court for any District in which 
the person is found to compel that person, after notice, to appear and 
give testimony, or to appear and produce the subpoenaed documents before 
the PHMSA, or both.

date by which the operator requests the finding or approval to be made.
    (d) The Administrator will make all findings or approvals of 
petitions initiated under this section. A participating state agency 
receiving petitions initiated under this section shall provide the 
Administrator a written recommendation as to the disposition of any 
petition received by them. Where the Administrator does not reverse or 
modify a recommendation made by a state agency within 10 business days 
of its receipt, the recommended disposition shall constitute the 
Administrator's decision on the petition.

not the respondent will be represented by counsel at the hearing.
    (b) A telephone hearing will be held if the amount of the proposed

not submitted within the time prescribed, the case shall proceed to 
final action without the material.
    (j) After submission of all materials during and after the hearing, 
the presiding official shall prepare a written recommendation as to 
final action in the case. This recommendation, along with any material 
submitted during and after the hearing, shall be included in the case

                             Specific Relief


<R05>
Sec. 190.233  Corrective action orders.

    (a) Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, if the 
Associate Administrator, OPS finds, after reasonable notice and 
opportunity for hearing in accord with paragraph (c) of this section and 
Sec. 190.211(a), a particular pipeline facility to be hazardous to 
life, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator, OPS 
shall issue an order pursuant to this section requiring the owner or 
operator of the facility to take corrective action. Corrective action 
may include suspended or restricted use of the facility, physical 
inspection, testing, repair, replacement, or other appropriate action.
    (b) The Associate Administrator, OPS may waive the requirement for 
notice and opportunity for hearing under paragraph (a) of this section 
before issuing an order pursuant to this section when the Associate 
Administrator, OPS determines that the failure to do so would result in 
the likelihood of serious harm to life, property, or the environment. 
However, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall provide an opportunity 
for a hearing as soon as is practicable after the issuance of a 
compliance order. The provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
apply to an owner or operator's decision to exercise its opportunity for 
a hearing. The purpose of such a post-order hearing is for the Associate 
Administrator, OPS to determine whether a compliance order should remain 
in effect or be rescinded or suspended in accord with paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (c) Notice and hearing:
    (1) Written notice that OPS intends to issue an order under this 
section shall be served upon the owner or operator of an alleged 
hazardous facility in accordance with Sec. 190.5. The notice shall 
allege the existence of a hazardous facility and state the facts and 
circumstances supporting the issuance of a corrective action order. The 
notice shall also provide the owner or operator with the opportunity for 
a hearing and shall identify a time and location where a hearing may be 
held.
    (2) An owner or operator that elects to exercise its opportunity for 
a hearing under this section must notify the Associate Administrator, 
OPS of that election in writing within 10 days of service of the notice 
provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or under paragraph (b) 
of this section when applicable. The absence of such written 
notification waives an owner or operator's opportunity for a hearing and 
allows the Associate Administrator, OPS to issue a corrective action 
order in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section.

[[Page 17]]

    (3) A hearing under this section shall be presided over by an 
attorney from the Office of Chief Counsel, Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration, acting as Presiding Official, and 
conducted without strict adherence to formal rules of evidence. The 
Presiding Official presents the allegations contained in the notice 
issued under this section. The owner or operator of the alleged 
hazardous facility may submit any relevant information or materials, 
call witnesses, and present arguments on the issue of whether or not a 
corrective action order should be issued.
    (4) Within 48 hours after conclusion of a hearing under this 
section, the Presiding Official shall submit a recommendation to the 
Associate Administrator, OPS as to whether or not a corrective action 
order is required. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the Associate 
Administrator, OPS shall proceed in accordance with paragraphs (d) 
through (h) of this section. If the Associate Administrator, OPS finds 
the facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the 
environment, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall issue a corrective 
action order in accordance with this section. If the Associate 
Administrator, OPS does not find the facility is or would be hazardous 
to life, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator shall 
withdraw the allegation of the existence of a hazardous facility 
contained in the notice, and promptly notify the owner or operator in 
writing by service as prescribed in Sec. 190.5.
    (d) The Associate Administrator, OPS may find a pipeline facility to 
be hazardous under paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) If under the facts and circumstances the Associate 
Administrator, OPS determines the particular facility is hazardous to 
life, property, or the environment; or
    (2) If the pipeline facility or a component thereof has been 
constructed or operated with any equipment, material, or technique which 
the Associate Administrator, OPS determines is hazardous to life, 
property, or the environment, unless the operator involved demonstrates 
to the satisfaction of the Associate Administrator, OPS that, under the 
particular facts and circumstances involved, such equipment, material, 
or technique is not hazardous.
    (e) In making a determination under paragraph (d) of this section, 
the Associate Administrator, OPS shall consider, if relevant:
    (1) The characteristics of the pipe and other equipment used in the 
pipeline facility involved, including its age, manufacturer, physical 
properties (including its resistance to corrosion and deterioration), 
and the method of its manufacture, construction or assembly;
    (2) The nature of the materials transported by such facility 
(including their corrosive and deteriorative qualities), the sequence in 
which such materials are transported, and the pressure required for such 
transportation;
    (3) The characteristics of the geographical areas in which the 
pipeline facility is located, in particular the climatic and geologic 
conditions (including soil characteristics) associated with such areas, 
and the population density and population and growth patterns of such 
areas;
    (4) Any recommendation of the National Transportation Safety Board 
issued in connection with any investigation conducted by the Board; and
    (5) Such other factors as the Associate Administrator, OPS may 
consider appropriate.
    (f) A corrective action order shall contain the following 
information:
    (1) A finding that the pipeline facility is hazardous to life, 
property, or the environment.
    (2) The relevant facts which form the basis of that finding.
    (3) The legal basis for the order.
    (4) The nature and description of any particular corrective action 
required of the respondent.
    (5) The date by which the required corrective action must be taken 
or completed and, where appropriate, the duration of the order.
    (6) If the opportunity for a hearing was waived pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section, a statement that an opportunity for a 
hearing will be available at a particular time and location after 
issuance of the order.

[[Page 18]]

    (g) The Associate Administrator, OPS shall rescind or suspend a 
corrective action order whenever the Associate Administrator, OPS 
determines that the facility is no longer hazardous to life, property, 
or the environment. When appropriate, however, such a rescission or 
suspension may be accompanied by a notice of probable violation issued 
under Sec. 190.207.
    (h) At any time after a corrective action order issued under this 
section has become effective, the Associate Administrator, OPS may 
request the Attorney General to bring an action for appropriate relief 
in accordance with Sec. 190.235.
    (i) Upon petition by the Attorney General, the District Courts of 
the United States shall have jurisdiction to enforce orders issued under 
this section by appropriate means.

<R05>
Sec. 190.235  Civil actions generally.

    Whenever it appears to the Associate Administrator, OPS that a 
person has engaged, is engaged, or is about to engage in any act or 
practice constituting a violation of any provision of 49 U.S.C. 60101 et 
seq., or any regulations issued thereunder, the Administrator, PHMSA, or 
the person to whom the authority has been delegated, may request the 
Attorney General to bring an action in the appropriate U.S. District 
Court for such relief as is necessary or appropriate, including 
mandatory or prohibitive injunctive relief, interim equitable relief, 
civil penalties, and punitive damages as provided under 49 U.S.C. 60120 
and 49 U.S.C. 5123.

<R05>
Sec. 190.237  Amendment of plans or procedures.

    (a) A Regional Director begins a proceeding to determine whether an 
operator's plans or procedures required under parts 192, 193, 195, and 
199 of this subchapter are inadequate to assure safe operation of a 
pipeline facility by issuing a notice of amendment. The notice shall 
provide an opportunity for a hearing under Sec. 190.211 of this part 
and shall specify the alleged inadequacies and the proposed action for 
revision of the plans or procedures. The notice shall allow the operator 
30 days after receipt of the notice to submit written comments or 
request a hearing. After considering all material presented in writing 
or at the hearing, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall determine 
whether the plans or procedures are inadequate as alleged and order the 
required amendment if they are inadequate, or withdraw the notice if 
they are not. In determining the adequacy of an operator's plans or 
procedures, the Associate Administrator, OPS shall consider:
    (1) Relevant available pipeline safety data;
    (2) Whether the plans or procedures are appropriate for the 
particular type of pipeline transportation or facility, and for the 
location of the facility;
    (3) The reasonableness of the plans or procedures; and
    (4) The extent to which the plans or procedures contribute to public 
safety.
    (b) The amendment of an operator's plans or procedures prescribed in 
paragraph (a) of this section is in addition to, and may be used in 
conjunction with, the appropriate enforcement actions prescribed in this 
subpart.

persons are invited to participate in the rulemaking proceedings with 
respect to each substantive rule.


<R05>

interested persons including those of any technical advisory body 
established by statute for that purpose.


<R05>
Sec. 190.315  Contents of notices of proposed rulemaking.

    A petition for extension of the time to submit comments must be 
received not later than 10 days before expiration of the time stated in 
the notice. It is requested, but not required, that three copies be 
submitted. The filing of the petition does not automatically extend the 
time for petitioner's comments. A petition is granted only if the 
petitioner shows good cause for the extension, and if the extension is 
consistent with the public interest. If an extension is granted, it is 
granted to all persons, and it is published in the Federal Register.


<R05>
Sec. 190.321  Contents of written comments.

    All written comments must be in English. It is requested, but not

<R05>
Sec. 190.323  Consideration of comments received.

    All timely comments and the recommendations of any technical

practicable.


<R05>
Sec. 190.325  Additional rulemaking proceedings.

    The Administrator may initiate any further rulemaking proceedings 
that the Administrator finds necessary or desirable. For example,

representative and interested persons, at which minutes of the 
conference are kept, to appear at informal hearings presided over by 
officials designated by the Administrator at which a transcript of 
minutes are kept, or participate in any other proceeding to assure 
informed administrative action and to protect the public interest.


<R05>
Sec. 190.327  Hearings.

hearing, any interested person may petition the Administrator for an 
informal hearing. The petition must be received by the Administrator not 
later than 20 days before expiration of the time stated in the notice. 
The filing of the petition does not automatically result in the

shows good cause for a hearing. If a petition for a hearing is granted, 
notice of the hearing is published in the Federal Register.
    (b) Sections 556 and 557 of title 5, United States Code, do not 
apply to hearings held under this part. Unless otherwise specified, 
hearings held under this part are informal, nonadversary fact-finding

Any regulation issued in a case in which an informal hearing

[[Page 21]]

is held is not necessarily based exclusively on the record of the 
hearing.

hearing held under this subpart. The Chief Counsel designates a member 
of his or her staff to serve as legal officer at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 190.329  Adoption of final rules.

    Final rules are prepared by representatives of the Office of 
Pipeline Safety and the Office of the Chief Counsel. The regulation is 
then submitted to the Administrator for consideration. If the 
Administrator adopts the regulation, it is published in the Federal 
Register, unless all persons subject to it are named and are personally 
served with a copy of it.


<R05>
Sec. 190.331  Petitions for rulemaking.

    (a) Any interested person may petition the Associate Administrator 
for Pipeline Safety to establish, amend, or repeal a substantive 
regulation, or may petition the Chief Counsel to establish, amend, or 
repeal a procedural regulation.

the petitioner to provide--
    (1) The costs and benefits to society and identifiable groups within 
society, quantifiable and otherwise;
    (2) The direct effects (including preemption effects) of the 
proposed action on States, on the relationship between the Federal

responsibilities among the various levels of government;
    (3) The regulatory burden on small businesses, small organizations 
and small governmental jurisdictions;
    (4) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements and to whom they 
would apply; and

Sec. 190.333  Processing of petition.

    (a) General. Unless the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
otherwise specifies, no public hearing, argument, or other proceeding is 
held directly on a petition before its disposition under this section.
    (b) Grants. If the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
determines that the petition contains adequate justification, he or she 
initiates rulemaking action under this subpart.
    (c) Denials. If the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
determines that the petition does not justify rulemaking, the petition 
is denied.
    (d) Notification. The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
will notify a petitioner, in writing, of the decision to grant or deny a 
petition for rulemaking.


<R05>
Sec. 190.335  Petitions for reconsideration.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. 190.339(d), any interested person 
may petition the Associate Administrator for reconsideration of any 
regulation issued under this subpart, or may petition the Chief Counsel 
for reconsideration of any procedural regulation issued under this 
subpart and contained in this subpart. It is requested, but not 
required, that three copies be submitted. The petition must be received 
not later than 30 days after publication of the rule in the Federal 
Register. Petitions filed after that time will be considered as 
petitions filed under Sec. 190.331. The petition must contain a brief 
statement of

[[Page 22]]

the complaint and an explanation as to why compliance with the rule is 
not practicable, is unreasonable, or is not in the public interest.
    (b) If the petitioner requests the consideration of additional 
facts, the petitioner must state the reason they were not presented to 
the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel within the prescribed 
time.
    (c) The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel does not 
consider repetitious petitions.
    (d) Unless the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
otherwise provides, the filing of a petition under this section does not 
stay the effectiveness of the rule.


<R05>
Sec. 190.337  Proceedings on petitions for reconsideration.

    (a) The Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel may grant or 
deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration without 
further proceedings, except where a grant of the petition would result 
in issuance of a new final rule. In the event that the Associate 
Administrator or the Chief Counsel determines to reconsider any 
regulation, a final decision on reconsideration may be issued without 
further proceedings, or an opportunity to submit comment or information 
and data as deemed appropriate, may be provided. Whenever the Associate 
Administrator or the Chief Counsel determines that a petition should be 
granted or denied, the Office of the Chief Counsel prepares a notice of 
the grant or denial of a petition for reconsideration, for issuance to 
the petitioner, and the Associate Administrator or the Chief Counsel 
issues it to the petitioner. The Associate Administrator or the Chief 
Counsel may consolidate petitions relating to the same rules.
    (b) It is the policy of the Associate Administrator or the Chief 
Counsel to issue notice of the action taken on a petition for 
reconsideration within 90 days after the date on which the regulation in 
question is published in the Federal Register, unless it is found 
impracticable to take action within that time. In cases where it is so 
found and the delay beyond that period is expected to be substantial, 
notice of that fact and the date by which it is expected that action 
will be taken is issued to the petitioner and published in the Federal 
Register.


<R05>
Sec. 190.338  Appeals.

    (a) Any interested person may appeal a denial of the Associate 
Administrator or the Chief Counsel, issued under Sec. 190.333 or Sec. 
190.337, to the Administrator.
    (b) An appeal must be received within 20 days of service of written 
notice to petitioner of the Associate Administrator's or the Chief 
Counsel's decision, or within 20 days from the date of publication of 
the decision in the Federal Register, and should set forth the contested 
aspects of the decision as well as any new arguments or information.
    (c) It is requested, but not required, that three copies of the 
appeal be submitted to the Administrator.
    (d) Unless the Administrator otherwise provides, the filing of an 
appeal under this section does not stay the effectiveness of any rule.


<R05>
Sec. 190.339  Direct final rulemaking.

    (a) Where practicable, the Administrator will use direct final 
rulemaking to issue the following types of rules:
    (1) Minor, substantive changes to regulations;
    (2) Incorporation by reference of the latest edition of technical or 
industry standards;
    (3) Extensions of compliance dates; and
    (4) Other noncontroversial rules where the Administrator determines 
that use of direct final rulemaking is in the public interest, and that 
a regulation is unlikely to result in adverse comment.
    (b) The direct final rule will state an effective date. The direct 
final rule will also state that unless an adverse comment or notice of 
intent to file an adverse comment is received within the specified 
comment period, generally 60 days after publication of the direct final 
rule in the Federal Register, the Administrator will issue a 
confirmation document, generally within 15 days after the close of the 
comment period, advising the public that the direct final rule will 
either become effective on the date stated in the direct final rule or 
at least 30 days after the

[[Page 23]]

publication date of the confirmation document, whichever is later.
    (c) For purposes of this section, an adverse comment is one which 
explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to 
the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or 
unacceptable without a change. Comments that are frivolous or 
insubstantial will not be considered adverse under this procedure. A 
comment recommending a rule change in addition to the rule will not be 
considered an adverse comment, unless the commenter states why the rule 
would be ineffective without the additional change.
    (d) Only parties who filed comments to a direct final rule issued 
under this section may petition under Sec. 190.335 for reconsideration 
of that direct final rule.
    (e) If an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse 
comment is received, a timely document will be published in the Federal 
Register advising the public and withdrawing the direct final rule in 
whole or in part. The Administrator may then incorporate the adverse 
comment into a subsequent direct final rule or may publish a notice of 
proposed rulemaking. A notice of proposed rulemaking will provide an 
opportunity for public comment, generally a minimum of 60 days, and will 
be processed in accordance with Sec. Sec. 190.311-190.329.

pipeline or LNG facility that contains or processes gas or LNG to rise 
above its maximum allowable operating pressure (or working pressure for 
LNG facilities) plus the build-up allowed for

[[Page 27]]

operation of pressure limiting or control devices.
    (6) A leak in a pipeline or LNG facility that contains or processes 
gas or LNG that constitutes an emergency.
    (7) Inner tank leakage, ineffective insulation, or frost heave that 
impairs the structural integrity of an LNG storage tank.
    (8) Any safety-related condition that could lead to an imminent 
hazard and causes (either directly or indirectly by remedial action of 
the operator), for purposes other than abandonment, a 20 percent or more 
reduction in operating pressure or shutdown of operation of a pipeline 
or an LNG facility that contains or processes gas or LNG.
    (b) A report is not required for any safety-related condition that--
    (1) Exists on a master meter system or a customer-owned service 
line;
    (2) Is an incident or results in an incident before the deadline for 
filing the safety-related condition report;

    Operators of transportation pipelines on the Outer Continental Shelf 
(as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act; 43 U.S.C. 1331) 
must identify on all their respective pipelines the specific points at 
which operating responsibility transfers to a producing operator. For 
those instances in which the transfer points are not identifiable by a 
durable marking, each operator will have until September 15, 1998 to 
identify the transfer points. If it is not practicable to durably mark a 
transfer point and the transfer point is located above water, the 
operator must depict the transfer point on a schematic located near the 
transfer point. If a transfer point is located subsea, then the operator 
must identify the transfer point on a schematic which must be maintained 
at the nearest upstream facility and provided to PHMSA upon request. For 
those cases in which adjoining operators have not agreed on a transfer 
point by September 15, 1998 the Regional Director and the MMS Regional

Sec. 192.105  Design formula for steel pipe.

    (a) The design pressure for steel pipe is determined in accordance 
with the following formula:

P=(2 St/D)xFxExT

P=Design pressure in pounds per square inch (kPa) gauge.
S=Yield strength in pounds per square inch (kPa) determined in 
accordance with Sec. 192.107.
D=Nominal outside diameter of the pipe in inches (millimeters).
t=Nominal wall thickness of the pipe in inches (millimeters). If this is 
unknown, it is determined in accordance with Sec. 192.109. Additional 
wall thickness required for concurrent external loads in accordance with 
Sec. 192.103 may not be included in computing design pressure.
F=Design factor determined in accordance with Sec. 192.111.
E=Longitudinal joint factor determined in accordance with Sec. 192.113.
T=Temperature derating factor determined in accordance with Sec. 
192.115.

    (b) If steel pipe that has been subjected to cold expansion to meet 
the SMYS is subsequently heated, other than by welding or stress 
relieving as a part of welding, the design pressure is limited to 75 
percent of the pressure determined under paragraph (a) of this section 
if the temperature of the pipe exceeds 900 [deg]F (482 [deg]C) at any 
time or is held above 600 [deg]F (316 [deg]C) for more than 1 hour.

    (a) For pipe that is manufactured in accordance with a specification 
listed in section I of appendix B of this part, the yield strength to be 
used in the design formula in Sec. 192.105 is the SMYS stated in the 
listed specification, if that value is known.
    (b) For pipe that is manufactured in accordance with a specification 
not listed in section I of appendix B to this part or whose 
specification or tensile properties are unknown, the yield strength to 
be used in the design formula in Sec. 192.105 is one of the following:
    (1) If the pipe is tensile tested in accordance with section II-D of 
appendix B to this part, the lower of the following:
    (i) 80 percent of the average yield strength determined by the 
tensile tests.
    (ii) The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests.

<R05>
Sec. 192.109  Nominal wall thickness (t) for steel pipe.

    (a) If the nominal wall thickness for steel pipe is not known, it is 
determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter 
points on one end.
    (b) However, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and thickness 
and there are more than 10 lengths, only 10 percent of the individual 
lengths, but not less than 10 lengths, need be measured. The thickness 
of the lengths that are not measured must be verified by applying a 
gauge set to the minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal 
wall thickness to be used in the design formula in Sec. 192.105 is the 
next wall thickness found in commercial specifications that is below the 
average of

[[Page 41]]

all the measurements taken. However, the nominal wall thickness used may 
not be more than 1.14 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe less 
than 20 inches (508 millimeters) in outside diameter, nor more than 1.11 
times the smallest measurement taken on pipe 20 inches (508 millimeters) 
or more in outside diameter.

that exceed the applicable pressure-temperature ratings contained in 
those requirements.
    (b) Each cast iron and plastic valve must comply with the following:
    (1) The valve must have a maximum service pressure rating for 
temperatures that equal or exceed the maximum service temperature.
    (2) The valve must be tested as part of the manufacturing, as 
follows:
    (i) With the valve in the fully open position, the shell must be 
tested with no leakage to a pressure at least 1.5 times the maximum 
service rating.
    (ii) After the shell test, the seat must be tested to a pressure not 
less than 1.5 times the maximum service pressure rating. Except for 
swing check valves, test pressure during the seat test must be applied 
successively on each side of the closed valve with the opposite side 
open. No visible leakage is permitted.
    (iii) After the last pressure test is completed, the valve must be 
operated through its full travel to demonstrate freedom from 
interference.

conditions.
    (d) No valve having shell components made of ductile iron may be 
used at pressures exceeding 80 percent of the pressure ratings for 
comparable steel valves at their listed temperature. However, a valve 
having shell components made of ductile iron may be used at pressures up 
to 80 percent of the pressure ratings for comparable steel valves at 
their listed temperature, if:
    (1) The temperature-adjusted service pressure does not exceed 1,000 
p.s.i. (7 Mpa) gage; and
    (2) Welding is not used on any ductile iron component in the 
fabrication of the valve shells or their assembly.

    (b) This section does not apply to: (1) Manifolds;
    (2) Station piping such as at compressor stations, meter stations, 
or regulator stations;
    (3) Piping associated with storage facilities, other than a 
continuous run of transmission line between a compressor station and 
storage facilities;
    (4) Cross-overs;
    (5) Sizes of pipe for which an instrumented internal inspection 
device is not commercially available;
    (6) Transmission lines, operated in conjunction with a distribution 
system which are installed in Class 4 locations;
    (7) Offshore transmission lines, except transmission lines 10\3/4\ 
inches (273 millimeters) or more in outside diameter on which 
construction begins after December 28, 2005, that run from platform to 
platform or platform to shore unless--
    (i) Platform space or configuration is incompatible with launching 
or retrieving instrumented internal inspection devices; or
    (ii) If the design includes taps for lateral connections, the 
operator can demonstrate, based on investigation or experience, that 
there is no reasonably practical alternative under the design 
circumstances to the use of a tap that will obstruct the passage of 
instrumented internal inspection devices; and
    (8) Other piping that, under Sec. 190.9 of this chapter, the 
Administrator finds in a particular case would be impracticable to 
design and construct to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal 
inspection devices.
    (c) An operator encountering emergencies, construction time 
constraints or other unforeseen construction problems need not construct 
a new or replacement segment of a transmission line to meet paragraph 
(a) of this section, if the operator determines and documents why an 
impracticability prohibits compliance with paragraph (a) of this 
section. Within 30 days after discovering the emergency or construction 
problem the operator must petition, under Sec. 190.9 of this chapter, 
for approval that design and construction to accommodate passage of 
instrumented internal inspection devices would be impracticable. If the 
petition is denied, within 1 year after the date of the notice of the 
denial, the operator must modify that segment to allow passage of 
instrumented internal inspection devices.

    (a) Each mechanical fitting used to make a hot tap must be designed 
for at least the operating pressure of the pipeline.
    (b) Where a ductile iron pipe is tapped, the extent of full-thread 
engagement and the need for the use of outside-sealing service 
connections, tapping saddles, or other fixtures must be determined by 
service conditions.
    (c) Where a threaded tap is made in cast iron or ductile iron pipe, 
the diameter of the tapped hole may not be more than 25 percent of the 
nominal diameter of the pipe unless the pipe is reinforced, except that
    (1) Existing taps may be used for replacement service, if they are 
free of cracks and have good threads; and
    (2) A 1\1/4\-inch (32 millimeters) tap may be made in a 4-inch (102 
millimeters) cast iron or ductile iron pipe, without reinforcement.

However, in areas where climate, soil, and service conditions may create 
unusual external stresses on cast iron pipe, unreinforced taps may be 
used only on 6-inch (152 millimeters) or larger pipe.

Sec. 192.163  Compressor stations: Design and construction.

    (a) Location of compressor building. Except for a compressor 
building on a platform located offshore or in inland navigable waters, 
each main compressor building of a compressor station must be located on 
property under the control of the operator. It must be far enough away 
from adjacent property, not under control of the operator, to minimize 
the possibility of fire being communicated to the compressor building 
from structures on adjacent property. There must be enough open space 
around the main compressor building to allow the free movement of fire-
fighting equipment.
    (b) Building construction. Each building on a compressor station 
site must be made of noncombustible materials if it contains either--
    (1) Pipe more than 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter that is 
carrying gas under pressure; or
    (2) Gas handling equipment other than gas utilization equipment used 
for domestic purposes.
    (c) Exits. Each operating floor of a main compressor building must 
have at least two separated and unobstructed exits located so as to 
provide a convenient possibility of escape and an unobstructed passage 
to a place of safety. Each door latch on an exit must be of a type which 
can be readily opened from the inside without a key. Each swinging door 
located in an exterior wall must be mounted to swing outward.
    (d) Fenced areas. Each fence around a compressor station must have 
at least two gates located so as to provide a convenient opportunity for 
escape to a place of safety, or have other facilities affording a 
similarly convenient exit from the area. Each gate located within 200 
feet (61 meters) of any compressor plant building must open outward and, 
when occupied, must be openable from the inside without a key.
    (e) Electrical facilities. Electrical equipment and wiring installed 
in compressor stations must conform to the National Electrical Code, 
ANSI/NFPA 70, so far as that code is applicable.

    (b) If a compressor station supplies gas directly to a distribution 
system with no other adequate source of gas available, the emergency 
shutdown system must be designed so that it will not function at the 
wrong time and cause an unintended outage on the distribution system.
    (c) On a platform located offshore or in inland navigable waters, 
the emergency shutdown system must be designed and installed to actuate 
automatically by each of the following events:
    (1) In the case of an unattended compressor station:
    (i) When the gas pressure equals the maximum allowable operating 
pressure plus 15 percent; or
    (ii) When an uncontrolled fire occurs on the platform; and
    (2) In the case of a compressor station in a building:
    (i) When an uncontrolled fire occurs in the building; or
    (ii) When the concentration of gas in air reaches 50 percent or more 
of the lower explosive limit in a building which has a source of 
ignition.

For the purpose of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, an electrical 
facility which conforms to Class 1, Group D, of the National Electrical 
Code is not a source of ignition.

pipeline that is connected to a gas source so that the maximum allowable 
operating pressure could be exceeded as the result of pressure control 
failure or of some other type of failure, must have pressure relieving 
or pressure limiting devices that meet the requirements of Sec. Sec. 
192.199 and 192.201.
    (b) Additional requirements for distribution systems. Each 
distribution system that is supplied from a source of gas that is at a 
higher pressure than the maximum allowable operating pressure for the 
system must--
    (1) Have pressure regulation devices capable of meeting the 
pressure, load, and other service conditions that will be experienced in 
normal operation of the system, and that could be activated in the event 
of failure of some portion of the system; and
    (2) Be designed so as to prevent accidental overpressuring.


<R05>
Sec. 192.197  Control of the pressure of gas delivered from high-pressure 
distribution systems.

    (a) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution 
system is 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, or less and a service regulator 
having the following characteristics is used, no other pressure limiting 
device is required:
    (1) A regulator capable of reducing distribution line pressure to 
pressures recommended for household appliances.
    (2) A single port valve with proper orifice for the maximum gas 
pressure at the regulator inlet.
    (3) A valve seat made of resilient material designed to withstand 
abrasion of the gas, impurities in gas, cutting by the valve, and to 
resist permanent deformation when it is pressed against the valve port.
    (4) Pipe connections to the regulator not exceeding 2 inches (51 
millimeters) in diameter.
    (5) A regulator that, under normal operating conditions, is able to 
regulate the downstream pressure within the necessary limits of accuracy 
and to limit the build-up of pressure under no-flow conditions to 
prevent a pressure that would cause the unsafe operation of any 
connected and properly adjusted gas utilization equipment.
    (6) A self-contained service regulator with no external static or 
control lines.
    (b) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution 
system is 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, or less, and a service regulator 
that does not have all

[[Page 52]]

of the characteristics listed in paragraph (a) of this section is used, 
or if the gas contains materials that seriously interfere with the 
operation of service regulators, there must be suitable protective 
devices to prevent unsafe overpressuring of the customer's appliances if 
the service regulator fails.
    (c) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution 
system exceeds 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, one of the following methods 
must be used to regulate and limit, to the maximum safe value, the 
pressure of gas delivered to the customer:
    (1) A service regulator having the characteristics listed in 
paragraph (a) of this section, and another regulator located upstream 
from the service regulator. The upstream regulator may not be set to 
maintain a pressure higher than 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage. A device must 
be installed between the upstream regulator and the service regulator to 
limit the pressure on the inlet of the service regulator to 60 p.s.i. 
(414 kPa) gage or less in case the upstream regulator fails to function 
properly. This device may be either a relief valve or an automatic 
shutoff that shuts, if the pressure on the inlet of the service 
regulator exceeds the set pressure (60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage or less), 
and remains closed until manually reset.
    (2) A service regulator and a monitoring regulator set to limit, to 
a maximum safe value, the pressure of the gas delivered to the customer.
    (3) A service regulator with a relief valve vented to the outside 
atmosphere, with the relief valve set to open so that the pressure of 
gas going to the customer does not exceed a maximum safe value. The 
relief valve may either be built into the service regulator or it may be 
a separate unit installed downstream from the service regulator. This 
combination may be used alone only in those cases where the inlet 
pressure on the service regulator does not exceed the manufacturer's 
safe working pressure rating of the service regulator, and may not be 
used where the inlet pressure on the service regulator exceeds 125 
p.s.i. (862 kPa) gage. For higher inlet pressures, the methods in 
paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section must be used.
    (4) A service regulator and an automatic shutoff device that closes 
upon a rise in pressure downstream from the regulator and remains closed 
until manually reset.

at which it will operate, and can be tested for leakage when in the 
closed position;
    (d) Have support made of noncombustible material;
    (e) Have discharge stacks, vents, or outlet ports designed to 
prevent accumulation of water, ice, or snow, located where gas can be

pipe, and fittings located between the system to be protected and the 
pressure relieving device, and the size of the vent line, are adequate 
to prevent hammering of the valve and to prevent impairment of relief 
capacity;
    (g) Where installed at a district regulator station to protect a 
pipeline system from overpressuring, be designed and installed to 
prevent any single incident such as an explosion in a vault or damage by 
a vehicle from affecting the operation of both the overpressure 
protective device and the district regulator; and
    (h) Except for a valve that will isolate the system under protection 
from its source of pressure, be designed to prevent unauthorized 
operation of any stop valve that will make the pressure

Sec. 192.203  Instrument, control, and sampling pipe and components.

    (a) Applicability. This section applies to the design of instrument, 
control, and sampling pipe and components. It does not apply to 
permanently closed systems, such as fluid-filled temperature-responsive 
devices.
    (b) Materials and design. All materials employed for pipe and 
components must be designed to meet the particular conditions of service 
and the following:
    (1) Each takeoff connection and attaching boss, fitting, or adapter 
must be made of suitable material, be able to withstand the maximum 
service pressure and temperature of the pipe or equipment to which it is 
attached, and be designed to satisfactorily withstand all stresses 
without failure by fatigue.
    (2) Except for takeoff lines that can be isolated from sources of 
pressure by other valving, a shutoff valve must be installed in each 
takeoff line as near as practicable to the point of takeoff. Blowdown 
valves must be installed where necessary.
    (3) Brass or copper material may not be used for metal temperatures 
greater than 400[deg] F (204[deg]C).
    (4) Pipe or components that may contain liquids must be protected by 
heating or other means from damage due to freezing.
    (5) Pipe or components in which liquids may accumulate must have 
drains or drips.
    (6) Pipe or components subject to clogging from solids or deposits 
must have suitable connections for cleaning.
    (7) The arrangement of pipe, components, and supports must provide 
safety under anticipated operating stresses.
    (8) Each joint between sections of pipe, and between pipe and valves 
or fittings, must be made in a manner suitable for the anticipated 
pressure and temperature condition. Slip type

[[Page 54]]

expansion joints may not be used. Expansion must be allowed for by 
providing flexibility within the system itself.
    (9) Each control line must be protected from anticipated causes of 
damage and must be designed and installed to prevent damage to any one 
control line from making both the regulator and the over-pressure 
protective device inoperative.

Sec. 192.283  Plastic pipe: Qualifying joining procedures.

    (a) Heat fusion, solvent cement, and adhesive joints. Before any 
written procedure established under Sec. 192.273(b) is used for making 
plastic pipe joints by a heat fusion, solvent cement, or adhesive 
method, the procedure must be qualified by subjecting specimen joints 
made according to the procedure to the following tests:
    (1) The burst test requirements of--
    (i) In the case of thermoplastic pipe, paragraph 6.6 (sustained 
pressure test) or paragraph 6.7 (Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Test) or 
paragraph 8.9 ( Sustained Static pressure Test) of ASTM D2513 (ibr, see 
Sec. 192.7);
    (ii) In the case of thermosetting plastic pipe, paragraph 8.5 
(Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Pressure) or paragraph 8.9 (Sustained Static 
Pressure Test) of ASTM D2517 (ibr, see Sec. 192.7); or
    (iii) In the case of electrofusion fittings for polyethylene pipe 
and tubing,

[[Page 58]]

paragraph 9.1 (Minimum Hydraulic Burst Pressure Test), paragraph 9.2 
(Sustained Pressure Test), paragraph 9.3 (Tensile Strength Test), or 
paragraph 9.4 (Joint Integrity Tests) of ASTM Designation F1055 (ibr, 
see Sec. 192.7).
    (2) For procedures intended for lateral pipe connections, subject a 
specimen joint made from pipe sections joined at right angles according 
to the procedure to a force on the lateral pipe until failure occurs in 
the specimen. If failure initiates outside the joint area, the procedure 
qualifies for use; and
    (3) For procedures intended for non-lateral pipe connections, follow 
the tensile test requirements of ASTM D638 (ibr, see Sec. 192.7), 
except that the test may be conducted at ambient temperature and 
humidity If the specimen elongates no less than 25 percent or failure 
initiates outside the joint area, the procedure qualifies for use.
    (b) Mechanical joints. Before any written procedure established 
under Sec. 192.273(b) is used for making mechanical plastic pipe joints 
that are designed to withstand tensile forces, the procedure must be 
qualified by subjecting 5 specimen joints made according to the 
procedure to the following tensile test:
    (1) Use an apparatus for the test as specified in ASTM D 638 (except 
for conditioning), (ibr, see Sec. 192.7).
    (2) The specimen must be of such length that the distance between 
the grips of the apparatus and the end of the stiffener does not affect 
the joint strength.
    (3) The speed of testing is 0.20 in (5.0 mm) per minute, plus or 
minus 25 percent.
    (4) Pipe specimens less than 4 inches (102 mm) in diameter are 
qualified if the pipe yields to an elongation of no less than 25 percent 
or failure initiates outside the joint area.
    (5) Pipe specimens 4 inches (102 mm) and larger in diameter shall be 
pulled until the pipe is subjected to a tensile stress equal to or 
greater than the maximum thermal stress that would be produced by a 
temperature change of 100[deg]F (38[deg]C) or until the pipe is pulled 
from the fitting. If the pipe pulls from the fitting, the lowest value 
of the five test results or the manufacturer's rating, whichever is 
lower must be used in the design calculations for stress.
    (6) Each specimen that fails at the grips must be retested using new 
pipe.
    (7) Results obtained pertain only to the specific outside diameter, 
and material of the pipe tested, except that testing of a heavier wall 
pipe may be used to qualify pipe of the same material but with a lesser 
wall thickness.
    (c) A copy of each written procedure being used for joining plastic 
pipe must be available to the persons making and inspecting joints.
    (d) Pipe or fittings manufactured before July 1, 1980, may be used 
in accordance with procedures that the manufacturer certifies will 
produce a joint as strong as the pipe.

Sec. 192.309  Repair of steel pipe.

    (a) Each imperfection or damage that impairs the serviceability of a 
length of steel pipe must be repaired or removed. If a repair is made by 
grinding, the remaining wall thickness must at least be equal to either:
    (1) The minimum thickness required by the tolerances in the 
specification to which the pipe was manufactured; or
    (2) The nominal wall thickness required for the design pressure of 
the pipeline.
    (b) Each of the following dents must be removed from steel pipe to 
be operated at a pressure that produces a hoop stress of 20 percent, or 
more, of SMYS, unless the dent is repaired by a method that reliable 
engineering tests and analyses show can permanently restore the 
serviceability of the pipe:
    (1) A dent that contains a stress concentrator such as a scratch, 
gouge, groove, or arc burn.
    (2) A dent that affects the longitudinal weld or a circumferential 
weld.
    (3) In pipe to be operated at a pressure that produces a hoop stress 
of 40 percent or more of SMYS, a dent that has a depth of:
    (i) More than \1/4\ inch (6.4 millimeters) in pipe 12\3/4\ inches 
(324 millimeters) or less in outer diameter; or
    (ii) More than 2 percent of the nominal pipe diameter in pipe over 
12\3/4\ inches (324 millimeters) in outer diameter.

For the purpose of this section a ``dent'' is a depression that produces 
a gross disturbance in the curvature of the pipe wall without reducing 
the pipe-wall thickness. The depth of a dent is measured as the gap 
between the lowest point of the dent and a prolongation of the original 
contour of the pipe.
    (c) Each arc burn on steel pipe to be operated at a pressure that 
produces a hoop stress of 40 percent, or more, of SMYS must be repaired 
or removed. If a repair is made by grinding, the arc

[[Page 60]]

burn must be completely removed and the remaining wall thickness must be 
at least equal to either:
    (1) The minimum wall thickness required by the tolerances in the 
specification to which the pipe was manufactured; or
    (2) The nominal wall thickness required for the design pressure of 
the pipeline.
    (d) A gouge, groove, arc burn, or dent may not be repaired by insert 
patching or by pounding out.
    (e) Each gouge, groove, arc burn, or dent that is removed from a 
length of pipe must be removed by cutting out the damaged portion as a 
cylinder.

    (a) Excess flow valves to be used on single residence service lines 
that operate continuously throughout the year at a pressure not less 
than 10 p.s.i. (69 kPa) gage must be manufactured and tested by the 
manufacturer according to an industry specification, or the 
manufacturer's written specification, to ensure that each valve will:
    (1) Function properly up to the maximum operating pressure at which 
the valve is rated;
    (2) Function properly at all temperatures reasonably expected in the 
operating environment of the service line;
    (3) At 10 p.s.i. (69 kPa) gage:
    (i) Close at, or not more than 50 percent above, the rated closure 
flow rate specified by the manufacturer; and
    (ii) Upon closure, reduce gas flow--
    (A) For an excess flow valve designed to allow pressure to equalize 
across the valve, to no more than 5 percent of the manufacturer's 
specified closure flow rate, up to a maximum of 20 cubic feet per hour 
(0.57 cubic meters per hour); or
    (B) For an excess flow valve designed to prevent equalization of 
pressure across the valve, to no more than 0.4 cubic feet per hour (.01 
cubic meters per hour); and
    (4) Not close when the pressure is less than the manufacturer's 
minimum specified operating pressure and the flow rate is below the 
manufacturer's minimum specified closure flow rate.

practical to the fitting connecting the service line to its source of 
gas supply.
    (e) An operator should not install an excess flow valve on a service 
line where the operator has prior experience with contaminants in the 
gas stream, where these contaminants could be expected to cause the 
excess flow valve to malfunction or where the excess flow valve would 
interfere with necessary operation and maintenance activities on the 
service, such as blowing liquids from the line.

Sec. 192.383  Excess flow valve customer notification.

    (a) Definitions. As used in this section:
    Costs associated with installation means the costs directly 
connected with installing an excess flow valve, for example, costs of 
parts, labor, inventory and procurement. It does not include maintenance 
and replacement costs until such costs are incurred.
    Replaced service line means a natural gas service line where the 
fitting that connects the service line to the main is replaced or the 
piping connected to this fitting is replaced.
    Service line customer means the person who pays the gas bill, or 
where service has not yet been established, the person requesting 
service.
    (b) Which customers must receive notification. Notification is 
required on each newly installed service line or replaced service line 
that operates continuously throughout the year at a pressure not less 
than 68.9 kPa (10 psig) and that serves a single residence. On these 
lines an operator of a natural gas distribution system must notify the 
service line customer once in writing.
    (c) What to put in the written notice. (1) An explanation for the 
customer that an excess flow valve meeting the performance standards 
prescribed under Sec. 192.381 is available for the operator to install 
if the customer bears the costs associated with installation;
    (2) An explanation for the customer of the potential safety benefits 
that may be derived from installing an excess flow valve. The 
explanation must include that an excess flow valve is designed to shut 
off flow of natural gas automatically if the service line breaks;
    (3) A description of installation, maintenance, and replacement 
costs. The notice must explain that if the

[[Page 67]]

customer requests the operator to install an EFV, the customer bears all 
costs associated with installation, and what those costs are. The notice 
must alert the customer that the costs for maintaining and replacing an 
EFV may later be incurred, and what those costs will be, to the extent 
known.
    (d) When notification and installation must be made. (1) After 
February 3, 1999 an operator must notify each service line customer set 
forth in paragraph (b) of this section:
    (i) On new service lines when the customer applies for service.
    (ii) On replaced service lines when the operator determines the 
service line will be replaced.
    (2) If a service line customer requests installation an operator 
must install the EFV at a mutually agreeable date.
    (e) What records are required. (1) An operator must make the 
following records available for inspection by the Administrator or a 
State agency participating under 49 U.S.C. 60105 or 60106:
    (i) A copy of the notice currently in use; and
    (ii) Evidence that notice has been sent to the service line 
customers set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, within the 
previous three years.
    (2) [Reserved]
    (f) When notification is not required. The notification requirements 
do not apply if the operator can demonstrate--
    (1) That the operator will voluntarily install an excess flow valve 
or that the state or local jurisdiction requires installation;
    (2) That excess flow valves meeting the performance standards in 
Sec. 192.381 are not available to the operator;
    (3) That the operator has prior experience with contaminants in the 
gas stream that could interfere with the operation of an excess flow 
valve, cause loss of service to a residence, or interfere with necessary 
operation or maintenance activities, such as blowing liquids from the 
line.
    (4) That an emergency or short time notice replacement situation 
made it impractical for the operator to notify a service line customer 
before replacing a service line. Examples of these situations would be 
where an operator has to replace a service line quickly because of--
    (i) Third party excavation damage;
    (ii) Grade 1 leaks as defined in the Appendix G-192-11 of the Gas 
Piping Technology Committee guide for gas transmission and distribution 
systems;
    (iii) A short notice service line relocation request.

installed after July 31, 1971.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (f) of this 
section, each buried or submerged pipeline installed after July 31, 
1971, must be protected against external corrosion, including the 
following:
    (1) It must have an external protective coating meeting the 
requirements of Sec. 192.461.
    (2) It must have a cathodic protection system designed to protect 
the pipeline in accordance with this subpart, installed and placed in 
operation within 1 year after completion of construction.
    (b) An operator need not comply with paragraph (a) of this section, 
if the operator can demonstrate by tests, investigation, or experience 
in the area of application, including, as a minimum, soil resistivity 
measurements and tests for corrosion accelerating bacteria, that a 
corrosive environment does not exist. However, within 6 months after an 
installation made pursuant to the preceding sentence, the operator shall 
conduct tests, including pipe-to-soil potential measurements with 
respect to either a continuous reference electrode or an electrode using 
close spacing, not to exceed 20 feet (6 meters), and soil resistivity 
measurements at potential profile peak locations, to adequately evaluate 
the potential profile along the entire pipeline. If the tests made 
indicate that a corrosive condition exists, the pipeline must be 
cathodically protected in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section.
    (c) An operator need not comply with paragraph (a) of this section, 
if the operator can demonstrate by tests, investigation, or experience 
that--
    (1) For a copper pipeline, a corrosive environment does not exist; 
or
    (2) For a temporary pipeline with an operating period of service not 
to exceed 5 years beyond installation, corrosion during the 5-year 
period of service of the pipeline will not be detrimental to public 
safety.
    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section, if a pipeline is externally coated, it must be cathodically 
protected in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (e) Aluminum may not be installed in a buried or submerged pipeline 
if that aluminum is exposed to an environment with a natural pH in 
excess of 8, unless tests or experience indicate its suitability in the 
particular environment involved.
    (f) This section does not apply to electrically isolated, metal 
alloy fittings in plastic pipelines, if:
    (1) For the size fitting to be used, an operator can show by test, 
investigation, or experience in the area of application that adequate 
corrosion control is provided by the alloy composition; and
    (2) The fitting is designed to prevent leakage caused by localized 
corrosion pitting.

    (a) Except for buried piping at compressor, regulator, and measuring 
stations, each buried or submerged transmission line installed before 
August 1, 1971, that has an effective external coating must be 
cathodically protected along the entire area that is effectively coated, 
in accordance with this subpart. For the purposes of this subpart, a 
pipeline does not have an effective external coating if its cathodic 
protection current requirements are substantially the same as if it were 
bare. The operator shall make tests to determine the cathodic protection 
current requirements.
    (b) Except for cast iron or ductile iron, each of the following 
buried or submerged pipelines installed before August 1, 1971, must be 
cathodically protected in accordance with this subpart in areas in which 
active corrosion is found:
    (1) Bare or ineffectively coated transmission lines.

Sec. 192.459  External corrosion control: Examination of buried pipeline 
when exposed.

    Whenever an operator has knowledge that any portion of a buried 
pipeline is exposed, the exposed portion must be examined for evidence 
of external corrosion if the pipe is bare, or if the coating is 
deteriorated. If external corrosion requiring remedial action under 
Sec. Sec. 192.483 through 192.489 is found, the operator shall 
investigate circumferentially and longitudinally beyond the exposed 
portion (by visual examination, indirect method, or both) to determine 
whether additional corrosion requiring remedial action exists in the 
vicinity of the exposed portion.

Sec. 192.461  External corrosion control: Protective coating.

    (a) Each external protective coating, whether conductive or 
insulating, applied for the purpose of external corrosion control must--
    (1) Be applied on a properly prepared surface;
    (2) Have sufficient adhesion to the metal surface to effectively 
resist underfilm migration of moisture;
    (3) Be sufficiently ductile to resist cracking;
    (4) Have sufficient strength to resist damage due to handling and 
soil stress; and
    (5) Have properties compatible with any supplemental cathodic 
protection.
    (b) Each external protective coating which is an electrically 
insulating type must also have low moisture absorption and high 
electrical resistance.
    (c) Each external protective coating must be inspected just prior to 
lowering the pipe into the ditch and backfilling, and any damage 
detrimental to effective corrosion control must be repaired.
    (d) Each external protective coating must be protected from damage 
resulting from adverse ditch conditions or damage from supporting 
blocks.
    (e) If coated pipe is installed by boring, driving, or other similar 
method, precautions must be taken to minimize damage to the coating 
during installation.


<R05>
Sec. 192.463  External corrosion control: Cathodic protection.

    (a) Each cathodic protection system required by this subpart must 
provide a level of cathodic protection that complies with one or more of 
the applicable criteria contained in appendix D of this part. If none of 
these criteria is applicable, the cathodic protection system must 
provide a level of cathodic protection at least equal to that provided 
by compliance with one or more of these criteria.
    (b) If amphoteric metals are included in a buried or submerged 
pipeline containing a metal of different anodic potential--
    (1) The amphoteric metals must be electrically isolated from the 
remainder of the pipeline and cathodically protected; or
    (2) The entire buried or submerged pipeline must be cathodically 
protected at a cathodic potential that meets the requirements of 
appendix D of this part for amphoteric metals.
    (c) The amount of cathodic protection must be controlled so as not 
to damage the protective coating or the pipe.


<R05>
Sec. 192.465  External corrosion control: Monitoring.

    (a) Each pipeline that is under cathodic protection must be tested 
at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 
months, to determine whether the cathodic protection meets the 
requirements of Sec. 192.463. However, if tests at those intervals are 
impractical for separately protected short sections of mains or 
transmission lines, not in excess of 100 feet (30 meters), or separately 
protected service lines, these pipelines may be surveyed on a sampling 
basis. At least 10 percent of these protected structures, distributed 
over the entire system must be surveyed each calendar year, with a 
different 10 percent checked each subsequent year, so that

[[Page 70]]

the entire system is tested in each 10-year period.
    (b) Each cathodic protection rectifier or other impressed current 
power source must be inspected six times each calendar year, but with 
intervals not exceeding 2\1/2\ months, to insure that it is operating.
    (c) Each reverse current switch, each diode, and each interference 
bond whose failure would jeopardize structure protection must be 
electrically checked for proper performance six times each calendar 
year, but with intervals not exceeding 2\1/2\ months. Each other 
interference bond must be checked at least once each calendar year, but 
with intervals not exceeding 15 months.
    (d) Each operator shall take prompt remedial action to correct any 
deficiencies indicated by the monitoring.
    (e) After the initial evaluation required by Sec. Sec. 192.455(b) 
and (c) and 192.457(b), each operator must, not less than every 3 years 
at intervals not exceeding 39 months, reevaluate its unprotected 
pipelines and cathodically protect them in accordance with this subpart 
in areas in which active corrosion is found. The operator must determine 
the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey. However, on 
distribution lines and where an electrical survey is impractical on 
transmission lines, areas of active corrosion may be determined by other 
means that include review and analysis of leak repair and inspection 
records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, 
and the pipeline environment. In this section:
    (1) Active corrosion means continuing corrosion which, unless 
controlled, could result in a condition that is detrimental to public 
safety.
    (2) Electrical survey means a series of closely spaced pipe-to-soil 
readings over a pipeline that are subsequently analyzed to identify 
locations where a corrosive current is leaving the pipeline.
    (3) Pipeline environment includes soil resistivity (high or low), 
soil moisture (wet or dry), soil contaminants that may promote corrosive 
activity, and other known conditions that could affect the probability 
of active corrosion.

Sec. 192.467  External corrosion control: Electrical isolation.

    (a) Each buried or submerged pipeline must be electrically isolated 
from other underground metallic structures, unless the pipeline and the 
other structures are electrically interconnected and cathodically 
protected as a single unit.
    (b) One or more insulating devices must be installed where 
electrical isolation of a portion of a pipeline is necessary to 
facilitate the application of corrosion control.
    (c) Except for unprotected copper inserted in ferrous pipe, each 
pipeline must be electrically isolated from metallic casings that are a 
part of the underground system. However, if isolation is not achieved 
because it is impractical, other measures must be taken to minimize 
corrosion of the pipeline inside the casing.
    (d) Inspection and electrical tests must be made to assure that 
electrical isolation is adequate.
    (e) An insulating device may not be installed in an area where a 
combustible atmosphere is anticipated unless precautions are taken to 
prevent arcing.
    (f) Where a pipeline is located in close proximity to electrical 
transmission tower footings, ground cables or counterpoise, or in other 
areas where fault currents or unusual risk of lightning may be 
anticipated, it must be provided with protection against damage due to 
fault currents or lightning, and protective measures must also be taken 
at insulating devices.

    (a) Each segment of metallic pipe that replaces pipe removed from a 
buried or submerged pipeline because of external corrosion must have a 
properly prepared surface and must be provided with an external 
protective coating that meets the requirements of Sec. 192.461.
    (b) Each segment of metallic pipe that replaces pipe removed from a 
buried or submerged pipeline because of external corrosion must be 
cathodically protected in accordance with this subpart.

Sec. 192.485  Remedial measures: Transmission lines.

    (a) General corrosion. Each segment of transmission line with 
general corrosion and with a remaining wall thickness less than that 
required for the MAOP of the pipeline must be replaced or the operating 
pressure reduced commensurate with the strength of the pipe based on 
actual remaining wall thickness. However, corroded pipe may be repaired 
by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can 
permanently restore the serviceability of the pipe. Corrosion pitting so 
closely grouped as to affect the overall strength of the pipe is 
considered general corrosion for the purpose of this paragraph.
    (b) Localized corrosion pitting. Each segment of transmission line 
pipe with localized corrosion pitting to a degree where leakage might 
result must be replaced or repaired, or the operating pressure must be 
reduced commensurate with the strength of the pipe, based on the actual 
remaining wall thickness in the pits.
    (c) Under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the strength of 
pipe based on actual remaining wall thickness may be determined by the 
procedure in ASME/ANSI B31G or the procedure in AGA Pipeline Research 
Committee Project PR 3-805 (with RSTRENG disk). Both procedures apply to 
corroded regions that do not penetrate the pipe wall, subject to the 
limitations prescribed in the procedures.

    (a) Except for service lines, each segment of a steel pipeline that 
is to operate at a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of SMYS must be 
strength tested in accordance with this section to substantiate the 
proposed maximum allowable operating pressure. In addition, in a Class 1 
or Class 2 location, if there is a building intended for human occupancy 
within 300 feet (91 meters) of a pipeline, a hydrostatic test must be 
conducted to a test pressure of at least 125 percent of maximum 
operating pressure on that segment of the pipeline within 300 feet (91 
meters) of such a building, but in no event may the test section be less 
than 600 feet (183 meters) unless the length of the newly

[[Page 74]]

installed or relocated pipe is less than 600 feet (183 meters). However, 
if the buildings are evacuated while the hoop stress exceeds 50 percent 
of SMYS, air or inert gas may be used as the test medium.
    (b) In a Class 1 or Class 2 location, each compressor station 
regulator station, and measuring station, must be tested to at least 
Class 3 location test requirements.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the 
strength test must be conducted by maintaining the pressure at or above 
the test pressure for at least 8 hours.
    (d) If a component other than pipe is the only item being replaced 
or added to a pipeline, a strength test after installation is not 
required, if the manufacturer of the component certifies that--
    (1) The component was tested to at least the pressure required for 
the pipeline to which it is being added;
    (2) The component was manufactured under a quality control system 
that ensures that each item manufactured is at least equal in strength 
to a prototype and that the prototype was tested to at least the 
pressure required for the pipeline to which it is being added; or
    (3) The component carries a pressure rating established through 
applicable ASME/ANSI, MSS specifications, or by unit strength 
calculations as described in Sec. 192.143.
    (e) For fabricated units and short sections of pipe, for which a 
post installation test is impractical, a preinstallation strength test 
must be conducted by maintaining the pressure at or above the test 
pressure for at least 4 hours.

    This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for increasing maximum 
allowable operating pressures (uprating) for pipelines.


<R05>
Sec. 192.553  General requirements.

    (a) Pressure increases. Whenever the requirements of this subpart 
require that an increase in operating pressure be made in increments, 
the pressure must be increased gradually, at a rate that can be 
controlled, and in accordance with the following:

[[Page 76]]

    (1) At the end of each incremental increase, the pressure must be 
held constant while the entire segment of pipeline that is affected is 
checked for leaks.
    (2) Each leak detected must be repaired before a further pressure 
increase is made, except that a leak determined not to be potentially 
hazardous need not be repaired, if it is monitored during the pressure 
increase and it does not become potentially hazardous.
    (b) Records. Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall 
retain for the life of the segment a record of each investigation 
required by this subpart, of all work performed, and of each pressure 
test conducted, in connection with the uprating.
    (c) Written plan. Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline 
shall establish a written procedure that will ensure that each 
applicable requirement of this subpart is complied with.
    (d) Limitation on increase in maximum allowable operating pressure. 
Except as provided in Sec. 192.555(c), a new maximum allowable 
operating pressure established under this subpart may not exceed the 
maximum that would be allowed under Sec. Sec. 192.619 and 192.621 for a 
new segment of pipeline constructed of the same materials in the same 
location. However, when uprating a steel pipeline, if any variable 
necessary to determine the design pressure under the design formula 
(Sec. 192.105) is unknown, the MAOP may be increased as provided in 
Sec. 192.619(a)(1).

Sec. 192.555  Uprating to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress 
of 30 percent or more of SMYS in steel pipelines.

    (a) Unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person 
may subject any segment of a steel pipeline to an operating pressure 
that will produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of SMYS and that 
is above the established maximum allowable operating pressure.
    (b) Before increasing operating pressure above the previously 
established maximum allowable operating pressure the operator shall:
    (1) Review the design, operating, and maintenance history and 
previous testing of the segment of pipeline and determine whether the 
proposed increase is safe and consistent with the requirements of this 
part; and
    (2) Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of 
pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased 
pressure.
    (c) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator 
may increase the maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of 
pipeline constructed before September 12, 1970, to the highest pressure 
that is permitted under Sec. 192.619, using as test pressure the 
highest pressure to which the segment of pipeline was previously 
subjected (either in a strength test or in actual operation).
    (d) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator 
that does not qualify under paragraph (c) of this section may increase 
the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure if at 
least one of the following requirements is met:
    (1) The segment of pipeline is successfully tested in accordance 
with the requirements of this part for a new line of the same material 
in the same location.
    (2) An increased maximum allowable operating pressure may be 
established for a segment of pipeline in a Class 1 location if the line 
has not previously been tested, and if:
    (i) It is impractical to test it in accordance with the requirements 
of this part;
    (ii) The new maximum operating pressure does not exceed 80 percent 
of that allowed for a new line of the same design in the same location; 
and
    (iii) The operator determines that the new maximum allowable 
operating pressure is consistent with the condition of the segment of 
pipeline and the design requirements of this part.
    (e) Where a segment of pipeline is uprated in accordance with 
paragraph (c) or (d)(2) of this section, the increase in pressure must 
be made in increments that are equal to:
    (1) 10 percent of the pressure before the uprating; or

[[Page 77]]

    (2) 25 percent of the total pressure increase,

whichever produces the fewer number of increments.


<R05>
Sec. 192.557  Uprating: Steel pipelines to a pressure that will produce 
a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS: plastic, cast iron, and 
ductile iron pipelines.

    (a) Unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person 
may subject:
    (1) A segment of steel pipeline to an operating pressure that will 
produce a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS and that is above the 
previously established maximum allowable operating pressure; or
    (2) A plastic, cast iron, or ductile iron pipeline segment to an 
operating pressure that is above the previously established maximum 
allowable operating pressure.
    (b) Before increasing operating pressure above the previously 
established maximum allowable operating pressure, the operator shall:
    (1) Review the design, operating, and maintenance history of the 
segment of pipeline;
    (2) Make a leakage survey (if it has been more than 1 year since the 
last survey) and repair any leaks that are found, except that a leak 
determined not to be potentially hazardous need not be repaired, if it 
is monitored during the pressure increase and it does not become 
potentially hazardous;
    (3) Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of 
pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased 
pressure;
    (4) Reinforce or anchor offsets, bends and dead ends in pipe joined 
by compression couplings or bell and spigot joints to prevent failure of 
the pipe joint, if the offset, bend, or dead end is exposed in an 
excavation;
    (5) Isolate the segment of pipeline in which the pressure is to be 
increased from any adjacent segment that will continue to be operated at 
a lower pressure; and
    (6) If the pressure in mains or service lines, or both, is to be 
higher than the pressure delivered to the customer, install a service 
regulator on each service line and test each regulator to determine that 
it is functioning. Pressure may be increased as necessary to test each 
regulator, after a regulator has been installed on each pipeline subject 
to the increased pressure.
    (c) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, the increase 
in maximum allowable operating pressure must be made in increments that 
are equal to 10 p.s.i. (69 kPa) gage or 25 percent of the total pressure 
increase, whichever produces the fewer number of increments. Whenever 
the requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section apply, there must 
be at least two approximately equal incremental increases.
    (d) If records for cast iron or ductile iron pipeline facilities are 
not complete enough to determine stresses produced by internal pressure, 
trench loading, rolling loads, beam stresses, and other bending loads, 
in evaluating the level of safety of the pipeline when operating at the 
proposed increased pressure, the following procedures must be followed:
    (1) In estimating the stresses, if the original laying conditions 
cannot be ascertained, the operator shall assume that cast iron pipe was 
supported on blocks with tamped backfill and that ductile iron pipe was 
laid without blocks with tamped backfill.
    (2) Unless the actual maximum cover depth is known, the operator 
shall measure the actual cover in at least three places where the cover 
is most likely to be greatest and shall use the greatest cover measured.
    (3) Unless the actual nominal wall thickness is known, the operator 
shall determine the wall thickness by cutting and measuring coupons from 
at least three separate pipe lengths. The coupons must be cut from pipe 
lengths in areas where the cover depth is most likely to be the 
greatest. The average of all measurements taken must be increased by the 
allowance indicated in the following table:

Sec. 192.607  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 192.609  Change in class location: Required study.

    Whenever an increase in population density indicates a change in 
class location for a segment of an existing steel pipeline operating at 
hoop stress that is more than 40 percent of SMYS, or indicates that the 
hoop stress corresponding to the established maximum allowable operating 
pressure for

[[Page 80]]

a segment of existing pipeline is not commensurate with the present 
class location, the operator shall immediately make a study to 
determine:
    (a) The present class location for the segment involved.
    (b) The design, construction, and testing procedures followed in the 
original construction, and a comparison of these procedures with those 
required for the present class location by the applicable provisions of 
this part.
    (c) The physical condition of the segment to the extent it can be 
ascertained from available records;
    (d) The operating and maintenance history of the segment;
    (e) The maximum actual operating pressure and the corresponding 
operating hoop stress, taking pressure gradient into account, for the 
segment of pipeline involved; and
    (f) The actual area affected by the population density increase, and 
physical barriers or other factors which may limit further expansion of 
the more densely populated area.


<R05>
Sec. 192.611  Change in class location: Confirmation or revision of 
maximum allowable operating pressure.

    (a) If the hoop stress corresponding to the established maximum 
allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline is not 
commensurate with the present class location, and the segment is in 
satisfactory physical condition, the maximum allowable operating 
pressure of that segment of pipeline must be confirmed or revised 
according to one of the following requirements:
    (1) If the segment involved has been previously tested in place for 
a period of not less than 8 hours, the maximum allowable operating 
pressure is 0.8 times the test pressure in Class 2 locations, 0.667 
times the test pressure in Class 3 locations, or 0.555 times the test 
pressure in Class 4 locations. The corresponding hoop stress may not 
exceed 72 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations, 60 
percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 
locations.
    (2) The maximum allowable operating pressure of the segment involved 
must be reduced so that the corresponding hoop stress is not more than 
that allowed by this part for new segments of pipelines in the existing 
class location.
    (3) The segment involved must be tested in accordance with the 
applicable requirements of subpart J of this part, and its maximum 
allowable operating pressure must then be established according to the 
following criteria:
    (i) The maximum allowable operating pressure after the 
requalification test is 0.8 times the test pressure for Class 2 
locations, 0.667 times the test pressure for Class 3 locations, and 
0.555 times the test pressure for Class 4 locations.
    (ii) The corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 72 percent of the 
SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations, 60 percent of SMYS in Class 3 
locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 locations.
    (b) The maximum allowable operating pressure confirmed or revised in 
accordance with this section, may not exceed the maximum allowable 
operating pressure established before the confirmation or revision.
    (c) Confirmation or revision of the maximum allowable operating 
pressure of a segment of pipeline in accordance with this section does 
not preclude the application of Sec. Sec. 192.553 and 192.555.
    (d) Confirmation or revision of the maximum allowable operating 
pressure that is required as a result of a study under Sec. 192.609 
must be completed within 24 months of the change in class location. 
Pressure reduction under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section within 
the 24-month period does not preclude establishing a maximum allowable 
operating pressure under paragraph (a)(3) of this section at a later 
date.

Sec. 192.612  Underwater inspection and reburial of pipelines in the 
Gulf of Mexico and its inlets.

    (a) Each operator shall prepare and follow a procedure to identify 
its pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets in waters less than 
15 feet (4.6 meters) deep as measured from mean low water that are at 
risk of being an exposed underwater pipeline or a hazard

[[Page 81]]

to navigation. The procedures must be in effect August 10, 2005.
    (b) Each operator shall conduct appropriate periodic underwater 
inspections of its pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets in 
waters less than 15 feet (4.6 meters) deep as measured from mean low 
water based on the identified risk.
    (c) If an operator discovers that its pipeline is an exposed 
underwater pipeline or poses a hazard to navigation, the operator 
shall--
    (1) Promptly, but not later than 24 hours after discovery, notify 
the National Response Center, telephone: 1-800-424-8802, of the location 
and, if available, the geographic coordinates of that pipeline.
    (2) Promptly, but not later than 7 days after discovery, mark the 
location of the pipeline in accordance with 33 CFR part 64 at the ends 
of the pipeline segment and at intervals of not over 500 yards (457 
meters) long, except that a pipeline segment less than 200 yards (183 
meters) long need only be marked at the center; and
    (3) Within 6 months after discovery, or not later than November 1 of 
the following year if the 6 month period is later than November 1 of the 
year of discovery, bury the pipeline so that the top of the pipe is 36 
inches (914 millimeters) below the underwater natural bottom (as 
determined by recognized and generally accepted practices) for normal 
excavation or 18 inches (457 millimeters) for rock excavation.
    (i) An operator may employ engineered alternatives to burial that 
meet or exceed the level of protection provided by burial.
    (ii) If an operator cannot obtain required state or Federal permits 
in time to comply with this section, it must notify OPS; specify whether 
the required permit is State or Federal; and, justify the delay.

<R05>
Sec. 192.613  Continuing surveillance.

    (a) Each operator shall have a procedure for continuing surveillance 
of its facilities to determine and take appropriate action concerning 
changes in class location, failures, leakage history, corrosion, 
substantial changes in cathodic protection requirements, and other 
unusual operating and maintenance conditions.
    (b) If a segment of pipeline is determined to be in unsatisfactory 
condition but no immediate hazard exists, the operator shall initiate a 
program to recondition or phase out the segment involved, or, if the 
segment cannot be reconditioned or phased out, reduce the maximum 
allowable operating pressure in accordance with Sec. 192.619 (a) and 
(b).


<R05>
Sec. 192.614  Damage prevention program.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, 
each operator of a buried pipeline must carry out, in accordance with 
this section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from 
excavation activities. For the purposes of this section, the term 
``excavation activities'' includes excavation, blasting, boring, 
tunneling, backfilling, the removal of aboveground structures by either 
explosive or mechanical means, and other earthmoving operations.
    (b) An operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section through participation in a public service program, 
such as a one-call system, but such participation does not relieve the 
operator of responsibility for compliance with this section. However, an 
operator must perform the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this section 
through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call system is a 
qualified one-call system. In areas that are covered by more than one 
qualified one-call system, an operator need only join one of the 
qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone number for 
excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call systems 
in those areas communicate with one another. An operator's pipeline 
system must be covered by a qualified one-call system where there is one 
in place. For the purpose of this section, a one-call system is 
considered a ``qualified one-call system'' if it meets the requirements 
of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
    (1) The state has adopted a one-call damage prevention program under 
Sec. 198.37 of this chapter; or
    (2) The one-call system:
    (i) Is operated in accordance with Sec. 198.39 of this chapter;

[[Page 82]]

    (ii) Provides a pipeline operator an opportunity similar to a 
voluntary participant to have a part in management responsibilities; and
    (iii) Assesses a participating pipeline operator a fee that is 
proportionate to the costs of the one-call system's coverage of the 
operator's pipeline.
    (c) The damage prevention program required by paragraph (a) of this 
section must, at a minimum:
    (1) Include the identity, on a current basis, of persons who 
normally engage in excavation activities in the area in which the 
pipeline is located.
    (2) Provides for notification of the public in the vicinity of the 
pipeline and actual notification of the persons identified in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section of the following as often as needed to make them 
aware of the damage prevention program:
    (i) The program's existence and purpose; and
    (ii) How to learn the location of underground pipelines before 
excavation activities are begun.
    (3) Provide a means of receiving and recording notification of 
planned excavation activities.
    (4) If the operator has buried pipelines in the area of excavation 
activity, provide for actual notification of persons who give notice of 
their intent to excavate of the type of temporary marking to be provided 
and how to identify the markings.
    (5) Provide for temporary marking of buried pipelines in the area of 
excavation activity before, as far as practical, the activity begins.
    (6) Provide as follows for inspection of pipelines that an operator 
has reason to believe could be damaged by excavation activities:
    (i) The inspection must be done as frequently as necessary during 
and after the activities to verify the integrity of the pipeline; and
    (ii) In the case of blasting, any inspection must include leakage 
surveys.
    (d) A damage prevention program under this section is not required 
for the following pipelines:
    (1) Pipelines located offshore.
    (2) Pipelines, other than those located offshore, in Class 1 or 2 
locations until September 20, 1995.
    (3) Pipelines to which access is physically controlled by the 
operator.
    (e) Pipelines operated by persons other than municipalities 
(including operators of master meters) whose primary activity does not 
include the transportation of gas need not comply with the following:
    (1) The requirement of paragraph (a) of this section that the damage 
prevention program be written; and
    (2) The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this 
section.

Sec. 192.616  Public awareness.

    (a) Each pipeline operator must develop and implement a written 
continuing public education program that follows the guidance provided 
in the American Petroleum Institute's (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 
1162 (IBR, see Sec. 192.7).
    (b) The operator's program must follow the general program 
recommendations of API RP 1162 and assess the unique attributes and 
characteristics of the operator's pipeline and facilities.
    (c) The operator must follow the general program recommendations, 
including baseline and supplemental requirements of API RP 1162, unless 
the operator provides justification in its program or procedural manual 
as to why compliance with all or certain provisions of the recommended 
practice is not practicable and not necessary for safety.
    (d) The operator's program must specifically include provisions to 
educate the public, appropriate government organizations, and persons 
engaged in excavation related activities on:

Sec. 192.619  Maximum allowable operating pressure: Steel or plastic 
pipelines.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no person 
may operate a segment of steel or plastic pipeline at a pressure that 
exceeds the lowest of the following:
    (1) The design pressure of the weakest element in the segment, 
determined in accordance with subparts C and D of this part. However, 
for steel pipe in pipelines being converted under Sec. 192.14 or 
uprated under subpart K of this part, if any variable necessary to 
determine the design pressure under the design formula (Sec. 192.105) 
is unknown, one of the following pressures is to be used as design 
pressure:
    (i) Eighty percent of the first test pressure that produces yield 
under section N5.0 of Appendix N of ASME B31.8, reduced by the 
appropriate factor in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section; or
    (ii) If the pipe is 12\3/4\ inches (324 mm) or less in outside 
diameter and is not tested to yield under this paragraph, 200 p.s.i. 
(1379 kPa).
    (2) The pressure obtained by dividing the pressure to which the 
segment was tested after construction as follows:
    (i) For plastic pipe in all locations, the test pressure is divided

    Source: 69 FR 69817, Dec. 15, 2003, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 192.901  What do the regulations in this subpart cover?

    This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for an integrity 
management program on any gas transmission pipeline covered under this 
part. For gas transmission pipelines constructed of plastic, only the 
requirements in Sec. Sec. 192.917, 192.921, 192.935 and 192.937 apply.


<R05>
Sec. 192.903  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    The following definitions apply to this subpart:
    Assessment is the use of testing techniques as allowed in this 
subpart to ascertain the condition of a covered pipeline segment.
    Confirmatory direct assessment is an integrity assessment method 
using more focused application of the principles and techniques of 
direct assessment to identify internal and external corrosion in a 
covered transmission pipeline segment.
    Covered segment or covered pipeline segment means a segment of gas 
transmission pipeline located in a high consequence area. The terms gas 
and transmission line are defined in Sec. 192.3.
    Direct assessment is an integrity assessment method that utilizes a 
process to evaluate certain threats (i.e., external corrosion, internal 
corrosion and stress corrosion cracking) to a covered pipeline segment's 
integrity. The process includes the gathering and integration of risk 
factor data, indirect

[[Page 95]]

examination or analysis to identify areas of suspected corrosion, direct 
examination of the pipeline in these areas, and post assessment 
evaluation.
    High consequence area means an area established by one of the 
methods described in paragraphs (1) or (2) as follows:
    (1) An area defined as--
    (i) A Class 3 location under Sec. 192.5; or
    (ii) A Class 4 location under Sec. 192.5; or
    (iii) Any area in a Class 1 or Class 2 location where the potential 
impact radius is greater than 660 feet (200 meters), and the area within 
a potential impact circle contains 20 or more buildings intended for 
human occupancy; or
    (iv) Any area in a Class 1 or Class 2 location where the potential 
impact circle contains an identified site.
    (2) The area within a potential impact circle containing--
    (i) 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy, unless the 
exception in paragraph
    (4) applies; or
    (ii) An identified site.
    Identified site means each of the following areas:
    (a) An outside area or open structure that is occupied by twenty 
(20) or more persons on at least 50 days in any twelve (12)-month 
period. (The days need not be consecutive.) Examples include but are not 
limited to, beaches, playgrounds, recreational facilities, camping 
grounds, outdoor theaters, stadiums, recreational areas near a body of 
water, or areas outside a rural building such as a religious facility; 
or
    (b) A building that is occupied by twenty (20) or more persons on at 
least five (5) days a week for ten (10) weeks in any twelve (12)-month 
period. (The days and weeks need not be consecutive.) Examples include, 
but are not limited to, religious facilities, office buildings, 
community centers, general stores, 4-H facilities, or roller skating 
rinks; or
    (c) A facility occupied by persons who are confined, are of impaired 
mobility, or would be difficult to evacuate. Examples include but are 
not limited to hospitals, prisons, schools, day-care facilities, 
retirement facilities or assisted-living facilities.
    Potential impact circle is a circle of radius equal to the potential 
impact radius (PIR).
    Potential impact radius (PIR) means the radius of a circle within 
which the potential failure of a pipeline could have significant impact 
on people or property. PIR is determined by the formula r = 0.69* 
(square root of (p*d \2\)), where `r' is the radius of a circular area 
in feet surrounding the point of failure, `p' is the maximum allowable 
operating pressure (MAOP) in the pipeline segment in pounds per square 
inch and `d' is the nominal diameter of the pipeline in inches.
    Note: 0.69 is the factor for natural gas. This number will vary for 
other gases depending upon their heat of combustion. An operator 
transporting gas other than natural gas must use section 3.2 of ASME/
ANSI B31.8S-2001 (Supplement to ASME B31.8; ibr, see Sec. 192.7) to 
calculate the impact radius formula.
    Remediation is a repair or mitigation activity an operator takes on 
a covered segment to limit or reduce the probability of an undesired 
event occurring or the expected consequences from the event.

<R05>
Sec. 192.905  How does an operator identify a high consequence area?

    (a) General. To determine which segments of an operator's 
transmission pipeline system are covered by this subpart, an operator 
must identify the high consequence areas. An operator must use method 
(1) or (2) from the definition in Sec. 192.903 to identify a high 
consequence area. An operator may apply one method to its entire 
pipeline system, or an operator may apply one method to individual 
portions of the pipeline system. An operator must describe in its 
integrity management program which method it is applying to each portion 
of the operator's pipeline system. The description must include the 
potential impact radius when utilized to establish a high consequence 
area. (See appendix E.I. for guidance on identifying high consequence 
areas.)
    (b)(1) Identified sites. An operator must identify an identified 
site, for purposes of this subpart, from information the operator has 
obtained from

[[Page 96]]

routine operation and maintenance activities and from public officials 
with safety or emergency response or planning responsibilities who 
indicate to the operator that they know of locations that meet the 
identified site criteria. These public officials could include officials 
on a local emergency planning commission or relevant Native American 
tribal officials.
    (2) If a public official with safety or emergency response or 
planning responsibilities informs an operator that it does not have the 
information to identify an identified site, the operator must use one of 
the following sources, as appropriate, to identify these sites.
    (i) Visible marking (e.g., a sign); or
    (ii) The site is licensed or registered by a Federal, State, or 
local government agency; or
    (iii) The site is on a list (including a list on an internet web 
site) or map maintained by or available from a Federal, State, or local 
government agency and available to the general public.
    (c) Newly identified areas. When an operator has information that 
the area around a pipeline segment not previously identified as a high 
consequence area could satisfy any of the definitions in Sec. 192.903, 
the operator must complete the evaluation using method (1) or (2). If 
the segment is determined to meet the definition as a high consequence 
area, it must be incorporated into the operator's baseline assessment 
plan as a high consequence area within one year from the date the area 
is identified.


<R05>
Sec. 192.907  What must an operator do to implement this subpart?

    (a) General. No later than December 17, 2004, an operator of a 
covered pipeline segment must develop and follow a written integrity 
management program that contains all the elements described in Sec. 
192.911 and that addresses the risks on each covered transmission 
pipeline segment. The initial integrity management program must consist, 
at a minimum, of a framework that describes the process for implementing 
each program element, how relevant decisions will be made and by whom, a 
time line for completing the work to implement the program element, and 
how information gained from experience will be continuously incorporated 
into the program. The framework will evolve into a more detailed and 
comprehensive program. An operator must make continual improvements to 
the program.
    (b) Implementation Standards. In carrying out this subpart, an 
operator must follow the requirements of this subpart and of ASME/ANSI 
B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 192.7) and its appendices, where specified. An 
operator may follow an equivalent standard or practice only when the 
operator demonstrates the alternative standard or practice provides an 
equivalent level of safety to the public and property. In the event of a 
conflict between this subpart and ASME/ANSI B31.8S, the requirements in 
this subpart control.


<R05>
Sec. 192.909  How can an operator change its integrity management program?

    (a) General. An operator must document any change to its program and 
the reasons for the change before implementing the change.
    (b) Notification. An operator must notify OPS, in accordance with 
Sec. 192.949, of any change to the program that may substantially 
affect the program's implementation or may significantly modify the 
program or schedule for carrying out the program elements. An operator 
must also notify a State or local pipeline safety authority when either 
a covered segment is located in a State where OPS has an interstate 
agent agreement, or an intrastate covered segment is regulated by that 
State. An operator must provide the notification within 30 days after 
adopting this type of change into its program.

<R05>
Sec. 192.913  When may an operator deviate its program from certain 
requirements of this subpart?

    (a) General. ASME/ANSI B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 192.7) provides the 
essential features of a performance-based or a prescriptive integrity 
management program. An operator that uses a performance-based approach 
that satisfies the requirements for exceptional performance in paragraph 
(b) of this section may deviate from certain requirements in this 
subpart, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Exceptional performance. An operator must be able to demonstrate 
the exceptional performance of its integrity management program through 
the following actions.
    (1) To deviate from any of the requirements set forth in paragraph 
(c) of this section, an operator must have a performance-based integrity 
management program that meets or exceed the performance-based 
requirements of ASME/ANSI B31.8S and includes, at a minimum, the 
following elements--
    (i) A comprehensive process for risk analysis;
    (ii) All risk factor data used to support the program;
    (iii) A comprehensive data integration process;
    (iv) A procedure for applying lessons learned from assessment of 
covered

[[Page 98]]

pipeline segments to pipeline segments not covered by this subpart;
    (v) A procedure for evaluating every incident, including its cause, 
within the operator's sector of the pipeline industry for implications 
both to the operator's pipeline system and to the operator's integrity 
management program;
    (vi) A performance matrix that demonstrates the program has been 
effective in ensuring the integrity of the covered segments by 
controlling the identified threats to the covered segments;
    (vii) Semi-annual performance measures beyond those required in 
Sec. 192.945 that are part of the operator's performance plan. (See 
Sec. 192.911(i).) An operator must submit these measures, by electronic 
or other means, on a semi-annual frequency to OPS in accordance with 
Sec. 192.951; and
    (viii) An analysis that supports the desired integrity reassessment 
interval and the remediation methods to be used for all covered 
segments.
    (2) In addition to the requirements for the performance-based plan, 
an operator must--
    (i) Have completed at least two integrity assessments on each 
covered pipeline segment the operator is including under the 
performance-based approach, and be able to demonstrate that each 
assessment effectively addressed the identified threats on the covered 
segment.
    (ii) Remediate all anomalies identified in the more recent 
assessment according to the requirements in Sec. 192.933, and 
incorporate the results and lessons learned from the more recent 
assessment into the operator's data integration and risk assessment.
    (c) Deviation. Once an operator has demonstrated that it has 
satisfied the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the 
operator may deviate from the prescriptive requirements of ASME/ANSI 
B31.8S and of this subpart only in the following instances.
    (1) The time frame for reassessment as provided in Sec. 192.939 
except that reassessment by some method allowed under this subpart 
(e.g., confirmatory direct assessment) must be carried out at intervals 
no longer than seven years;
    (2) The time frame for remediation as provided in Sec. 192.933 if 
the operator demonstrates the time frame will not jeopardize the safety 
of the covered segment.

<R05>
Sec. 192.915  What knowledge and training must personnel have to carry 
out an integrity management program?

    (a) Supervisory personnel. The integrity management program must 
provide that each supervisor whose responsibilities relate to the 
integrity management program possesses and maintains a thorough 
knowledge of the integrity management program and of the elements for 
which the supervisor is responsible. The program must provide that any 
person who qualifies as a supervisor for the integrity management 
program has appropriate training or experience in the area for which the 
person is responsible.
    (b) Persons who carry out assessments and evaluate assessment 
results. The integrity management program must provide criteria for the 
qualification of any person--
    (1) Who conducts an integrity assessment allowed under this subpart; 
or
    (2) Who reviews and analyzes the results from an integrity 
assessment and evaluation; or
    (3) Who makes decisions on actions to be taken based on these 
assessments.
    (c) Persons responsible for preventive and mitigative measures. The 
integrity management program must provide criteria for the qualification 
of any person--
    (1) Who implements preventive and mitigative measures to carry out 
this subpart, including the marking and locating of buried structures; 
or
    (2) Who directly supervises excavation work carried out in 
conjunction with an integrity assessment.


<R05>
Sec. 192.917  How does an operator identify potential threats to 
pipeline integrity and use the threat identification in its 
integrity program?

    (a) Threat identification. An operator must identify and evaluate 
all potential threats to each covered pipeline

[[Page 99]]

segment. Potential threats that an operator must consider include, but 
are not limited to, the threats listed in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (ibr, see 
Sec. 192.7), section 2, which are grouped under the following four 
categories:
    (1) Time dependent threats such as internal corrosion, external 
corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking;
    (2) Static or resident threats, such as fabrication or construction 
defects;
    (3) Time independent threats such as third party damage and outside 
force damage; and
    (4) Human error.
    (b) Data gathering and integration. To identify and evaluate the 
potential threats to a covered pipeline segment, an operator must gather 
and integrate existing data and information on the entire pipeline that 
could be relevant to the covered segment. In performing this data 
gathering and integration, an operator must follow the requirements in 
ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 4. At a minimum, an operator must gather and 
evaluate the set of data specified in Appendix A to ASME/ANSI B31.8S, 
and consider both on the covered segment and similar non-covered 
segments, past incident history, corrosion control records, continuing 
surveillance records, patrolling records, maintenance history, internal 
inspection records and all other conditions specific to each pipeline.
    (c) Risk assessment. An operator must conduct a risk assessment that 
follows ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 5, and considers the identified 
threats for each covered segment. An operator must use the risk 
assessment to prioritize the covered segments for the baseline and 
continual reassessments (Sec. Sec. 192.919, 192.921, 192.937), and to 
determine what additional preventive and mitigative measures are needed 
(Sec. 192.935) for the covered segment.
    (d) Plastic transmission pipeline. An operator of a plastic 
transmission pipeline must assess the threats to each covered segment 
using the information in sections 4 and 5 of ASME B31.8S, and consider 
any threats unique to the integrity of plastic pipe.
    (e) Actions to address particular threats. If an operator identifies 
any of the following threats, the operator must take the following 
actions to address the threat.
    (1) Third party damage. An operator must utilize the data 
integration required in paragraph (b) of this section and ASME/ANSI 
B31.8S, Appendix A7 to determine the susceptibility of each covered 
segment to the threat of third party damage. If an operator identifies 
the threat of third party damage, the operator must implement 
comprehensive additional preventive measures in accordance with Sec. 
192.935 and monitor the effectiveness of the preventive measures. If, in 
conducting a baseline assessment under Sec. 192.921, or a reassessment 
under Sec. 192.937, an operator uses an internal inspection tool or 
external corrosion direct assessment, the operator must integrate data 
from these assessments with data related to any encroachment or foreign 
line crossing on the covered segment, to define where potential 
indications of third party damage may exist in the covered segment.
    An operator must also have procedures in its integrity management 
program addressing actions it will take to respond to findings from this 
data integration.
    (2) Cyclic fatigue. An operator must evaluate whether cyclic fatigue 
or other loading condition (including ground movement, suspension bridge 
condition) could lead to a failure of a deformation, including a dent or 
gouge, or other defect in the covered segment. An evaluation must assume 
the presence of threats in the covered segment that could be exacerbated 
by cyclic fatigue. An operator must use the results from the evaluation 
together with the criteria used to evaluate the significance of this 
threat to the covered segment to prioritize the integrity baseline 
assessment or reassessment.
    (3) Manufacturing and construction defects. If an operator 
identifies the threat of manufacturing and construction defects 
(including seam defects) in the covered segment, an operator must 
analyze the covered segment to determine the risk of failure from these 
defects. The analysis must consider the results of prior assessments on 
the covered segment. An operator may consider manufacturing and 
construction related defects to be stable defects if

[[Page 100]]

the operating pressure on the covered segment has not increased over the 
maximum operating pressure experienced during the five years preceding 
identification of the high consequence area. If any of the following 
changes occur in the covered segment, an operator must prioritize the 
covered segment as a high risk segment for the baseline assessment or a 
subsequent reassessment.
    (i) Operating pressure increases above the maximum operating 
pressure experienced during the preceding five years;
    (ii) MAOP increases; or
    (iii) The stresses leading to cyclic fatigue increase.
    (4) ERW pipe. If a covered pipeline segment contains low frequency 
electric resistance welded pipe (ERW), lap welded pipe or other pipe 
that satisfies the conditions specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendices 
A4.3 and A4.4, and any covered or noncovered segment in the pipeline 
system with such pipe has experienced seam failure, or operating 
pressure on the covered segment has increased over the maximum operating 
pressure experienced during the preceding five years, an operator must 
select an assessment technology or technologies with a proven 
application capable of assessing seam integrity and seam corrosion 
anomalies. The operator must prioritize the covered segment as a high 
risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent reassessment.
    (5) Corrosion. If an operator identifies corrosion on a covered 
pipeline segment that could adversely affect the integrity of the line 
(conditions specified in Sec. 192.933), the operator must evaluate and 
remediate, as necessary, all pipeline segments (both covered and non-
covered) with similar material coating and environmental 
characteristics. An operator must establish a schedule for evaluating 
and remediating, as necessary, the similar segments that is consistent 
with the operator's established operating and maintenance procedures 
under part 192 for testing and repair.

<R05>
Sec. 192.919  What must be in the baseline assessment plan?

    An operator must include each of the following elements in its 
written baseline assessment plan:
    (a) Identification of the potential threats to each covered pipeline 
segment and the information supporting the threat identification. (See 
Sec. 192.917.);
    (b) The methods selected to assess the integrity of the line pipe, 
including an explanation of why the assessment method was selected to 
address the identified threats to each covered segment. The integrity 
assessment method an operator uses must be based on the threats 
identified to the covered segment. (See Sec. 192.917.) More than one 
method may be required to address all the threats to the covered 
pipeline segment;
    (c) A schedule for completing the integrity assessment of all 
covered segments, including risk factors considered in establishing the 
assessment schedule;
    (d) If applicable, a direct assessment plan that meets the 
requirements of Sec. Sec. 192.923, and depending on the threat to be 
addressed, of Sec. 192.925, Sec. 192.927, or Sec. 192.929; and
    (e) A procedure to ensure that the baseline assessment is being 
conducted in a manner that minimizes environmental and safety risks.


<R05>
Sec. 192.921  How is the baseline assessment to be conducted?

    (a) Assessment methods. An operator must assess the integrity of the 
line pipe in each covered segment by applying one or more of the 
following methods depending on the threats to which the covered segment 
is susceptible. An operator must select the method or methods best 
suited to address the threats identified to the covered segment (See 
Sec. 192.917).
    (1) Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting 
corrosion, and any other threats to which the covered segment is 
susceptible. An operator must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 
192.7), section 6.2 in selecting the appropriate internal inspection 
tools for the covered segment.

[[Page 101]]

    (2) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this 
part. An operator must use the test pressures specified in Table 3 of 
section 5 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S, to justify an extended reassessment 
interval in accordance with Sec. 192.939.
    (3) Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, 
internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. An operator must 
conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed 
in Sec. 192.923 and with, as applicable, the requirements specified in 
Sec. Sec. 192.925, 192.927 or 192.929;
    (4) Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an 
equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator 
choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 180 
days before conducting the assessment, in accordance with Sec. 192.949. 
An operator must also notify a State or local pipeline safety authority 
when either a covered segment is located in a State where OPS has an 
interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate covered segment is 
regulated by that State.
    (b) Prioritizing segments. An operator must prioritize the covered 
pipeline segments for the baseline assessment according to a risk 
analysis that considers the potential threats to each covered segment. 
The risk analysis must comply with the requirements in Sec. 192.917.
    (c) Assessment for particular threats. In choosing an assessment 
method for the baseline assessment of each covered segment, an operator 
must take the actions required in Sec. 192.917(e) to address particular 
threats that it has identified.
    (d) Time period. An operator must prioritize all the covered 
segments for assessment in accordance with Sec. 192.917 (c) and 
paragraph (b) of this section. An operator must assess at least 50% of 
the covered segments beginning with the highest risk segments, by 
December 17, 2007. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of 
all covered segments by December 17, 2012.
    (e) Prior assessment. An operator may use a prior integrity 
assessment conducted before December 17, 2002 as a baseline assessment 
for the covered segment, if the integrity assessment meets the baseline 
requirements in this subpart and subsequent remedial actions to address 
the conditions listed in Sec. 192.933 have been carried out. In 
addition, if an operator uses this prior assessment as its baseline 
assessment, the operator must reassess the line pipe in the covered 
segment according to the requirements of Sec. 192.937 and Sec. 
192.939.
    (f) Newly identified areas. When an operator identifies a new high 
consequence area (see Sec. 192.905), an operator must complete the 
baseline assessment of the line pipe in the newly identified high 
consequence area within ten (10) years from the date the area is 
identified.
    (g) Newly installed pipe. An operator must complete the baseline 
assessment of a newly-installed segment of pipe covered by this subpart 
within ten (10) years from the date the pipe is installed. An operator 
may conduct a pressure test in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, to satisfy the requirement for a baseline assessment.
    (h) Plastic transmission pipeline. If the threat analysis required 
in Sec. 192.917(d) on a plastic transmission pipeline indicates that a 
covered segment is susceptible to failure from causes other than third-
party damage, an operator must conduct a baseline assessment of the 
segment in accordance with the requirements of this section and of Sec. 
192.917. The operator must justify the use of an alternative assessment 
method that will address the identified threats to the covered segment.

<R05>
Sec. 192.923  How is direct assessment used and for what threats?

    (a) General. An operator may use direct assessment either as a 
primary assessment method or as a supplement to the other assessment 
methods allowed under this subpart. An operator may only use direct 
assessment as the primary assessment method to address the identified 
threats of external corrosion (ECDA), internal corrosion (ICDA), and 
stress corrosion cracking (SCCDA).

[[Page 102]]

    (b) Primary method. An operator using direct assessment as a primary 
assessment method must have a plan that complies with the requirements 
in--
    (1) ASME/ANSI B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 192.7), section 6.4; NACE 
RP0502-2002 (ibr, see Sec. 192.7); and Sec. 192.925 if addressing 
external corrosion (ECDA).
    (2) ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 6.4 and appendix B2, and Sec. 192.927 
if addressing internal corrosion (ICDA).
    (3) ASME/ANSI B31.8S, appendix A3, and Sec. 192.929 if addressing 
stress corrosion cracking (SCCDA).
    (c) Supplemental method. An operator using direct assessment as a 
supplemental assessment method for any applicable threat must have a 
plan that follows the requirements for confirmatory direct assessment in 
Sec. 192.931.


<R05>
Sec. 192.925  What are the requirements for using External Corrosion 
Direct Assessment (ECDA)?

    (a) Definition. ECDA is a four-step process that combines 
preassessment, indirect inspection, direct examination, and post 
assessment to evaluate the threat of external corrosion to the integrity 
of a pipeline.
    (b) General requirements. An operator that uses direct assessment to 
assess the threat of external corrosion must follow the requirements in 
this section, in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 192.7), section 6.4, 
and in NACE RP 0502-2002 (ibr, see Sec. 192.7). An operator must 
develop and implement a direct assessment plan that has procedures 
addressing preassessment, indirect examination, direct examination, and 
post-assessment. If the ECDA detects pipeline coating damage, the 
operator must also integrate the data from the ECDA with other 
information from the data integration (Sec. 192.917(b)) to evaluate the 
covered segment for the threat of third party damage, and to address the 
threat as required by Sec. 192.917(e)(1).
    (1) Preassessment. In addition to the requirements in ASME/ANSI 
B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE RP 0502-2002, section 3, the plan's 
procedures for preassessment must include--
    (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when 
conducting ECDA for the first time on a covered segment; and
    (ii) The basis on which an operator selects at least two different, 
but complementary indirect assessment tools to assess each ECDA Region. 
If an operator utilizes an indirect inspection method that is not 
discussed in Appendix A of NACE RP0502-2002, the operator must 
demonstrate the applicability, validation basis, equipment used, 
application procedure, and utilization of data for the inspection 
method.
    (2) Indirect examination. In addition to the requirements in ASME/
ANSI B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE RP 0502-2002, section 4, the plan's 
procedures for indirect examination of the ECDA regions must include--
    (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when 
conducting ECDA for the first time on a covered segment;
    (ii) Criteria for identifying and documenting those indications that 
must be considered for excavation and direct examination. Minimum 
identification criteria include the known sensitivities of assessment 
tools, the procedures for using each tool, and the approach to be used 
for decreasing the physical spacing of indirect assessment tool readings 
when the presence of a defect is suspected;
    (iii) Criteria for defining the urgency of excavation and direct 
examination of each indication identified during the indirect 
examination. These criteria must specify how an operator will define the 
urgency of excavating the indication as immediate, scheduled or 
monitored; and
    (iv) Criteria for scheduling excavation of indications for each 
urgency level.
    (3) Direct examination. In addition to the requirements in ASME/ANSI 
B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE RP 0502-2002, section 5, the plan's 
procedures for direct examination of indications from the indirect 
examination must include--
    (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when 
conducting ECDA for the first time on a covered segment;
    (ii) Criteria for deciding what action should be taken if either:
    (A) Corrosion defects are discovered that exceed allowable limits 
(Section 5.5.2.2 of NACE RP0502-2002), or

[[Page 103]]

    (B) Root cause analysis reveals conditions for which ECDA is not 
suitable (Section 5.6.2 of NACE RP0502-2002);
    (iii) Criteria and notification procedures for any changes in the 
ECDA Plan, including changes that affect the severity classification, 
the priority of direct examination, and the time frame for direct 
examination of indications; and
    (iv) Criteria that describe how and on what basis an operator will 
reclassify and reprioritize any of the provisions that are specified in 
section 5.9 of NACE RP0502-2002.
    (4) Post assessment and continuing evaluation. In addition to the 
requirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE RP 0502-2002, 
section 6, the plan's procedures for post assessment of the 
effectiveness of the ECDA process must include--
    (i) Measures for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of ECDA in 
addressing external corrosion in covered segments; and
    (ii) Criteria for evaluating whether conditions discovered by direct 
examination of indications in each ECDA region indicate a need for 
reassessment of the covered segment at an interval less than that 
specified in Sec. 192.939. (See Appendix D of NACE RP0502-2002.)

Sec. 192.927  What are the requirements for using Internal Corrosion 
Direct Assessment (ICDA)?

    (a) Definition. Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA) is a 
process an operator uses to identify areas along the pipeline where 
fluid or other electrolyte introduced during normal operation or by an 
upset condition may reside, and then focuses direct examination on the 
locations in covered segments where internal corrosion is most likely to 
exist. The process identifies the potential for internal corrosion 
caused by microorganisms, or fluid with CO<INF>2,</INF> O<INF>2,</INF> 
hydrogen sulfide or other contaminants present in the gas.
    (b) General requirements. An operator using direct assessment as an 
assessment method to address internal corrosion in a covered pipeline 
segment must follow the requirements in this section and in ASME/ANSI 
B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 192.7), section 6.4 and appendix B2. The ICDA 
process described in this section applies only for a segment of pipe 
transporting nominally dry natural gas, and not for a segment with 
electrolyte nominally present in the gas stream. If an operator uses 
ICDA to assess a covered segment operating with electrolyte present in 
the gas stream, the operator must develop a plan that demonstrates how 
it will conduct ICDA in the segment to effectively address internal 
corrosion, and must provide notification in accordance with Sec. 
192.921 (a)(4) or Sec. 192.937(c)(4).
    (c) The ICDA plan. An operator must develop and follow an ICDA plan 
that provides for preassessment, identification of ICDA regions and 
excavation locations, detailed examination of pipe at excavation 
locations, and post-assessment evaluation and monitoring.
    (1) Preassessment. In the preassessment stage, an operator must 
gather and integrate data and information needed to evaluate the 
feasibility of ICDA for the covered segment, and to support use of a 
model to identify the locations along the pipe segment where electrolyte 
may accumulate, to identify ICDA regions, and to identify areas within 
the covered segment where liquids may potentially be entrained. This 
data and information includes, but is not limited to--
    (i) All data elements listed in appendix A2 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S;
    (ii) Information needed to support use of a model that an operator 
must use to identify areas along the pipeline where internal corrosion 
is most likely to occur. (See paragraph (a) of this section.) This 
information, includes, but is not limited to, location of all gas input 
and withdrawal points on the line; location of all low points on covered 
segments such as sags, drips, inclines, valves, manifolds, dead-legs, 
and traps; the elevation profile of the pipeline in sufficient detail 
that angles of inclination can be calculated for all pipe segments; and 
the diameter of the pipeline, and the range of expected gas velocities 
in the pipeline;
    (iii) Operating experience data that would indicate historic upsets 
in gas

[[Page 104]]

conditions, locations where these upsets have occurred, and potential 
damage resulting from these upset conditions; and
    (iv) Information on covered segments where cleaning pigs may not 
have been used or where cleaning pigs may deposit electrolytes.
    (2) ICDA region identification. An operator's plan must identify 
where all ICDA Regions are located in the transmission system, in which 
covered segments are located. An ICDA Region extends from the location 
where liquid may first enter the pipeline and encompasses the entire 
area along the pipeline where internal corrosion may occur and where 
further evaluation is needed. An ICDA Region may encompass one or more 
covered segments. In the identification process, an operator must use 
the model in GRI 02-0057, ``Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment of Gas 
Transmission Pipelines--Methodology,'' (ibr, see Sec. 192.7). An 
operator may use another model if the operator demonstrates it is 
equivalent to the one shown in GRI 02-0057. A model must consider 
changes in pipe diameter, locations where gas enters a line (potential 
to introduce liquid) and locations down stream of gas draw-offs (where 
gas velocity is reduced) to define the critical pipe angle of 
inclination above which water film cannot be transported by the gas.
    (3) Identification of locations for excavation and direct 
examination. An operator's plan must identify the locations where 
internal corrosion is most likely in each ICDA region. In the location 
identification process, an operator must identify a minimum of two 
locations for excavation within each ICDA Region within a covered 
segment and must perform a direct examination for internal corrosion at 
each location, using ultrasonic thickness measurements, radiography, or 
other generally accepted measurement technique. One location must be the 
low point (e.g., sags, drips, valves, manifolds, dead-legs, traps) 
within the covered segment nearest to the beginning of the ICDA Region. 
The second location must be further downstream, within a covered 
segment, near the end of the ICDA Region. If corrosion exists at either 
location, the operator must--
    (i) Evaluate the severity of the defect (remaining strength) and 
remediate the defect in accordance with Sec. 192.933;
    (ii) As part of the operator's current integrity assessment either 
perform additional excavations in each covered segment within the ICDA 
region, or use an alternative assessment method allowed by this subpart 
to assess the line pipe in each covered segment within the ICDA region 
for internal corrosion; and
    (iii) Evaluate the potential for internal corrosion in all pipeline 
segments (both covered and non-covered) in the operator's pipeline 
system with similar characteristics to the ICDA region containing the 
covered segment in which the corrosion was found, and as appropriate, 
remediate the conditions the operator finds in accordance with Sec. 
192.933.
    (4) Post-assessment evaluation and monitoring. An operator's plan 
must provide for evaluating the effectiveness of the ICDA process and 
continued monitoring of covered segments where internal corrosion has 
been identified. The evaluation and monitoring process includes--
    (i) Evaluating the effectiveness of ICDA as an assessment method for 
addressing internal corrosion and determining whether a covered segment 
should be reassessed at more frequent intervals than those specified in 
Sec. 192.939. An operator must carry out this evaluation within a year 
of conducting an ICDA; and
    (ii) Continually monitoring each covered segment where internal 
corrosion has been identified using techniques such as coupons, UT 
sensors or electronic probes, periodically drawing off liquids at low 
points and chemically analyzing the liquids for the presence of 
corrosion products. An operator must base the frequency of the 
monitoring and liquid analysis on results from all integrity assessments 
that have been conducted in accordance with the requirements of this 
subpart, and risk factors specific to the covered segment. If an 
operator finds any evidence of corrosion products in the covered 
segment, the operator must take prompt action in accordance with one of 
the two following required actions

[[Page 105]]

and remediate the conditions the operator finds in accordance with Sec. 
192.933.
    (A) Conduct excavations of covered segments at locations downstream 
from where the electrolyte might have entered the pipe; or
    (B) Assess the covered segment using another integrity assessment 
method allowed by this subpart.
    (5) Other requirements. The ICDA plan must also include--
    (i) Criteria an operator will apply in making key decisions (e.g., 
ICDA feasibility, definition of ICDA Regions, conditions requiring 
excavation) in implementing each stage of the ICDA process;
    (ii) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when 
conducting ICDA for the first time on a covered segment and that become 
less stringent as the operator gains experience; and
    (iii) Provisions that analysis be carried out on the entire pipeline 
in which covered segments are present, except that application of the 
remediation criteria of Sec. 192.933 may be limited to covered 
segments.

<R05>
Sec. 192.929  What are the requirements for using Direct Assessment 
for Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCCDA)?

    (a) Definition. Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment (SCCDA) 
is a process to assess a covered pipe segment for the presence of SCC 
primarily by systematically gathering and analyzing excavation data for 
pipe having similar operational characteristics and residing in a 
similar physical environment.
    (b) General requirements. An operator using direct assessment as an 
integrity assessment method to address stress corrosion cracking in a 
covered pipeline segment must have a plan that provides, at minimum, 
for--
    (1) Data gathering and integration. An operator's plan must provide 
for a systematic process to collect and evaluate data for all covered 
segments to identify whether the conditions for SCC are present and to 
prioritize the covered segments for assessment. This process must 
include gathering and evaluating data related to SCC at all sites an 
operator excavates during the conduct of its pipeline operations where 
the criteria in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 192.7), appendix A3.3 
indicate the potential for SCC. This data includes at minimum, the data 
specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, appendix A3.
    (2) Assessment method. The plan must provide that if conditions for 
SCC are identified in a covered segment, an operator must assess the 
covered segment using an integrity assessment method specified in ASME/
ANSI B31.8S, appendix A3, and remediate the threat in accordance with 
ASME/ANSI B31.8S, appendix A3, section A3.4.

<R05>
Sec. 192.931  How may Confirmatory Direct Assessment (CDA) be used?

    An operator using the confirmatory direct assessment (CDA) method as 
allowed in Sec. 192.937 must have a plan that meets the requirements of 
this section and of Sec. Sec. 192.925 (ECDA) and Sec. 192.927 (ICDA).
    (a) Threats. An operator may only use CDA on a covered segment to 
identify damage resulting from external corrosion or internal corrosion.
    (b) External corrosion plan. An operator's CDA plan for identifying 
external corrosion must comply with Sec. 192.925 with the following 
exceptions.
    (1) The procedures for indirect examination may allow use of only 
one indirect examination tool suitable for the application.
    (2) The procedures for direct examination and remediation must 
provide that--
    (i) All immediate action indications must be excavated for each ECDA 
region; and
    (ii) At least one high risk indication that meets the criteria of 
scheduled action must be excavated in each ECDA region.
    (c) Internal corrosion plan. An operator's CDA plan for identifying 
internal corrosion must comply with Sec. 192.927 except that the plan's 
procedures for identifying locations for excavation may require 
excavation of only one high risk location in each ICDA region.
    (d) Defects requiring near-term remediation. If an assessment 
carried out

[[Page 106]]

under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section reveals any defect requiring 
remediation prior to the next scheduled assessment, the operator must 
schedule the next assessment in accordance with NACE RP 0502-2002 (ibr, 
see Sec. 192.7), section 6.2 and 6.3. If the defect requires immediate 
remediation, then the operator must reduce pressure consistent with 
Sec. 192.933 until the operator has completed reassessment using one of 
the assessment techniques allowed in Sec. 192.937.


<R05>
Sec. 192.933  What actions must be taken to address integrity issues?

    (a) General requirements. An operator must take prompt action to 
address all anomalous conditions that the operator discovers through the 
integrity assessment. In addressing all conditions, an operator must 
evaluate all anomalous conditions and remediate those that could reduce 
a pipeline's integrity. An operator must be able to demonstrate that the 
remediation of the condition will ensure that the condition is unlikely 
to pose a threat to the integrity of the pipeline until the next 
reassessment of the covered segment. If an operator is unable to respond 
within the time limits for certain conditions specified in this section, 
the operator must temporarily reduce the operating pressure of the 
pipeline or take other action that ensures the safety of the covered 
segment. If pressure is reduced, an operator must determine the 
temporary reduction in operating pressure using ASME/ANSI B31G (ibr, see 
Sec. 192.7) or AGA Pipeline Research Committee Project PR-3-805 
(``RSTRENG''; ibr, see Sec. 192.7) or reduce the operating pressure to 
a level not exceeding 80% of the level at the time the condition was 
discovered. (See appendix A to this part 192 for information on 
availability of incorporation by reference information). A reduction in 
operating pressure cannot exceed 365 days without an operator providing 
a technical justification that the continued pressure restriction will 
not jeopardize the integrity of the pipeline.
    (b) Discovery of condition. Discovery of a condition occurs when an 
operator has adequate information about a condition to determine that 
the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the 
pipeline. A condition that presents a potential threat includes, but is 
not limited to, those conditions that require remediation or monitoring 
listed under paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section. An 
operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after conducting an 
integrity assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to 
make that determination, unless the operator demonstrates that the 180-
day period is impracticable.
    (c) Schedule for evaluation and remediation. An operator must 
complete remediation of a condition according to a schedule that 
prioritizes the conditions for evaluation and remediation. Unless a 
special requirement for remediating certain conditions applies, as 
provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an operator must follow the 
schedule in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 192.7), section 7, Figure 
4. If an operator cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the 
operator must justify the reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and 
that the changed schedule will not jeopardize public safety. An operator 
must notify OPS in accordance with Sec. 192.949 if it cannot meet the 
schedule and cannot provide safety through a temporary reduction in 
operating pressure or other action. An operator must also notify a State 
or local pipeline safety authority when either a covered segment is 
located in a State where OPS has an interstate agent agreement, or an 
intrastate covered segment is regulated by that State.
    (d) Special requirements for scheduling remediation.--(1) Immediate 
repair conditions. An operator's evaluation and remediation schedule 
must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 7 in providing for immediate 
repair conditions. To maintain safety, an operator must temporarily 
reduce operating pressure in accordance with paragraph (a) of this 
section or shut down the pipeline until the operator completes the 
repair of these conditions. An operator must treat the following 
conditions as immediate repair conditions:
    (i) A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows a 
predicted failure pressure less than or equal to 1.1 times the maximum 
allowable operating pressure at the location of the

[[Page 107]]

anomaly. Suitable remaining strength calculation methods include, ASME/
ANSI B31G; RSTRENG; or an alternative equivalent method of remaining 
strength calculation. These documents are incorporated by reference and 
available at the addresses listed in appendix A to part 192.
    (ii) A dent that has any indication of metal loss, cracking or a 
stress riser.
    (iii) An indication or anomaly that in the judgment of the person 
designated by the operator to evaluate the assessment results requires 
immediate action.
    (2) One-year conditions. Except for conditions listed in paragraph 
(d)(1) and (d)(3) of this section, an operator must remediate any of the 
following within one year of discovery of the condition:
    (i) A smooth dent located between the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock 
positions (upper \2/3\ of the pipe) with a depth greater than 6% of the 
pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline 
diameter less than Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12).
    (ii) A dent with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter 
(0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that 
affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or at a longitudinal seam weld.
    (3) Monitored conditions. An operator does not have to schedule the 
following conditions for remediation, but must record and monitor the 
conditions during subsequent risk assessments and integrity assessments 
for any change that may require remediation:
    (i) A dent with a depth greater than 6% of the pipeline diameter 
(greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 
12) located between the 4 o'clock position and the 8 o'clock position 
(bottom \1/3\ of the pipe).
    (ii) A dent located between the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions 
(upper \2/3\ of the pipe) with a depth greater than 6% of the pipeline 
diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less 
than Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12), and engineering analyses of the dent 
demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.
    (iii) A dent with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter 
(0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that 
affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or a longitudinal seam weld, and 
engineering analyses of the dent and girth or seam weld demonstrate 
critical strain levels are not exceeded. These analyses must consider 
weld properties.

<R05>
Sec. 192.935  What additional preventive and mitigative measures must 
an operator take?

    (a) General requirements. An operator must take additional measures 
beyond those already required by Part 192 to prevent a pipeline failure 
and to mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure in a high 
consequence area. An operator must base the additional measures on the 
threats the operator has identified to each pipeline segment. (See Sec. 
192.917) An operator must conduct, in accordance with one of the risk 
assessment approaches in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 192.7), 
section 5, a risk analysis of its pipeline to identify additional 
measures to protect the high consequence area and enhance public safety. 
Such additional measures include, but are not limited to, installing 
Automatic Shut-off Valves or Remote Control Valves, installing 
computerized monitoring and leak detection systems, replacing pipe 
segments with pipe of heavier wall thickness, providing additional 
training to personnel on response procedures, conducting drills with 
local emergency responders and implementing additional inspection and 
maintenance programs.
    (b) Third party damage and outside force damage--
    (1) Third party damage. An operator must enhance its damage 
prevention program, as required under Sec. 192.614 of this part, with 
respect to a covered segment to prevent and minimize the consequences of 
a release due to third party damage. Enhanced measures to an existing 
damage prevention program include, at a minimum--
    (i) Using qualified personnel (see Sec. 192.915) for work an 
operator is conducting that could adversely affect the integrity of a 
covered segment, such as marking, locating, and direct supervision of 
known excavation work.

[[Page 108]]

    (ii) Collecting in a central database information that is location 
specific on excavation damage that occurs in covered and non covered 
segments in the transmission system and the root cause analysis to 
support identification of targeted additional preventative and 
mitigative measures in the high consequence areas. This information must 
include recognized damage that is not required to be reported as an 
incident under part 191.
    (iii) Participating in one-call systems in locations where covered 
segments are present.
    (iv) Monitoring of excavations conducted on covered pipeline 
segments by pipeline personnel. If an operator finds physical evidence 
of encroachment involving excavation that the operator did not monitor 
near a covered segment, an operator must either excavate the area near 
the encroachment or conduct an above ground survey using methods defined 
in NACE RP-0502-2002 (ibr, see Sec. 192.7). An operator must excavate, 
and remediate, in accordance with ANSI/ASME B31.8S and Sec. 192.933 any 
indication of coating holidays or discontinuity warranting direct 
examination.
    (2) Outside force damage. If an operator determines that outside 
force (e.g., earth movement, floods, unstable suspension bridge) is a 
threat to the integrity of a covered segment, the operator must take 
measures to minimize the consequences to the covered segment from 
outside force damage. These measures include, but are not limited to, 
increasing the frequency of aerial, foot or other methods of patrols, 
adding external protection, reducing external stress, and relocating the 
line.
    (c) Automatic shut-off valves (ASV) or Remote control valves (RCV). 
If an operator determines, based on a risk analysis, that an ASV or RCV 
would be an efficient means of adding protection to a high consequence 
area in the event of a gas release, an operator must install the ASV or 
RCV. In making that determination, an operator must, at least, consider 
the following factors--swiftness of leak detection and pipe shutdown 
capabilities, the type of gas being transported, operating pressure, the 
rate of potential release, pipeline profile, the potential for ignition, 
and location of nearest response personnel.
    (d) Pipelines operating below 30% SMYS. An operator of a 
transmission pipeline operating below 30% SMYS located in a high 
consequence area must follow the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and 
(d)(2) of this section. An operator of a transmission pipeline operating 
below 30% SMYS located in a Class 3 or Class 4 area but not in a high 
consequence area must follow the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1), 
(d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.
    (1) Apply the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(iii) 
of this section to the pipeline; and
    (2) Either monitor excavations near the pipeline, or conduct patrols 
as required by Sec. 192.705 of the pipeline at bi-monthly intervals. If 
an operator finds any indication of unreported construction activity, 
the operator must conduct a follow up investigation to determine if 
mechanical damage has occurred.
    (3) Perform semi-annual leak surveys (quarterly for unprotected 
pipelines or cathodically protected pipe where electrical surveys are 
impractical).
    (e) Plastic transmission pipeline. An operator of a plastic 
transmission pipeline must apply the requirements in paragraphs 
(b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section to the covered 
segments of the pipeline.

<R05>
Sec. 192.937  What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment 
to maintain a pipeline's integrity?

    (a) General. After completing the baseline integrity assessment of a 
covered segment, an operator must continue to assess the line pipe of 
that segment at the intervals specified in Sec. 192.939 and 
periodically evaluate the integrity of each covered pipeline segment as 
provided in paragraph (b) of this section. An operator must reassess a 
covered segment on which a prior assessment is credited as a baseline 
under Sec. 192.921(e) by no later than December 17, 2009. An operator 
must reassess a covered segment on which a baseline assessment is 
conducted during the baseline period specified in

[[Page 109]]

Sec. 192.921(d) by no later than seven years after the baseline 
assessment of that covered segment unless the evaluation under paragraph 
(b) of this section indicates earlier reassessment.
    (b) Evaluation. An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as 
frequently as needed to assure the integrity of each covered segment. 
The periodic evaluation must be based on a data integration and risk 
assessment of the entire pipeline as specified in Sec. 192.917. For 
plastic transmission pipelines, the periodic evaluation is based on the 
threat analysis specified in 192.917(d). For all other transmission 
pipelines, the evaluation must consider the past and present integrity 
assessment results, data integration and risk assessment information 
(Sec. 192.917), and decisions about remediation (Sec. 192.933) and 
additional preventive and mitigative actions (Sec. 192.935). An 
operator must use the results from this evaluation to identify the 
threats specific to each covered segment and the risk represented by 
these threats.
    (c) Assessment methods. In conducting the integrity reassessment, an 
operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in the covered 
segment by any of the following methods as appropriate for the threats 
to which the covered segment is susceptible (see Sec. 192.917), or by 
confirmatory direct assessment under the conditions specified in Sec. 
192.931.
    (1) Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting 
corrosion, and any other threats to which the covered segment is 
susceptible. An operator must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 
192.7), section 6.2 in selecting the appropriate internal inspection 
tools for the covered segment.
    (2) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this 
part. An operator must use the test pressures specified in Table 3 of 
section 5 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S, to justify an extended reassessment 
interval in accordance with Sec. 192.939.
    (3) Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, 
internal corrosion, or stress corrosion cracking. An operator must 
conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed 
in Sec. 192.923 and with as applicable, the requirements specified in 
Sec. Sec. 192.925, 192.927 or 192.929;
    (4) Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an 
equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator 
choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 180 
days before conducting the assessment, in accordance with Sec. 192.949. 
An operator must also notify a State or local pipeline safety authority 
when either a covered segment is located in a State where OPS has an 
interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate covered segment is 
regulated by that State.
    (5) Confirmatory direct assessment when used on a covered segment 
that is scheduled for reassessment at a period longer than seven years. 
An operator using this reassessment method must comply with Sec. 
192.931.

<R05>
Sec. 192.939  What are the required reassessment intervals?

    An operator must comply with the following requirements in 
establishing the reassessment interval for the operator's covered 
pipeline segments.
    (a) Pipelines operating at or above 30% SMYS. An operator must 
establish a reassessment interval for each covered segment operating at 
or above 30% SMYS in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
The maximum reassessment interval by an allowable reassessment method is 
seven years. If an operator establishes a reassessment interval that is 
greater than seven years, the operator must, within the seven-year 
period, conduct a confirmatory direct assessment on the covered segment, 
and then conduct the follow-up reassessment at the interval the operator 
has established. A reassessment carried out using confirmatory direct 
assessment must be done in accordance with Sec. 192.931. The table that 
follows this section sets forth the maximum allowed reassessment 
intervals.
    (1) Pressure test or internal inspection or other equivalent 
technology. An operator that uses pressure testing or internal 
inspection as an assessment method must establish the reassessment 
interval for a covered pipeline segment by--

[[Page 110]]

    (i) Basing the interval on the identified threats for the covered 
segment (see Sec. 192.917) and on the analysis of the results from the 
last integrity assessment and from the data integration and risk 
assessment required by Sec. 192.917; or
    (ii) Using the intervals specified for different stress levels of 
pipeline (operating at or above 30% SMYS) listed in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, 
section 5, Table 3.
    (2) External Corrosion Direct Assessment. An operator that uses ECDA 
that meets the requirements of this subpart must determine the 
reassessment interval according to the requirements in paragraphs 6.2 
and 6.3 of NACE RP0502-2002 (ibr, see Sec. 192.7).
    (3) Internal Corrosion or SCC Direct Assessment. An operator that 
uses ICDA or SCCDA in accordance with the requirements of this subpart 
must determine the reassessment interval according to the following 
method. However, the reassessment interval cannot exceed those specified 
for direct assessment in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 5, Table 3.
    (i) Determine the largest defect most likely to remain in the 
covered segment and the corrosion rate appropriate for the pipe, soil 
and protection conditions;
    (ii) Use the largest remaining defect as the size of the largest 
defect discovered in the SCC or ICDA segment; and
    (iii) Estimate the reassessment interval as half the time required 
for the largest defect to grow to a critical size.
    (b) Pipelines Operating Below 30% SMYS. An operator must establish a 
reassessment interval for each covered segment operating below 30% SMYS 
in accordance with the requirements of this section. The maximum 
reassessment interval by an allowable reassessment method is seven 
years. An operator must establish reassessment by at least one of the 
following--
    (1) Reassessment by pressure test, internal inspection or other 
equivalent technology following the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of 
this section except that the stress level referenced in paragraph 
(a)(1)(ii) of this section would be adjusted to reflect the lower 
operating stress level. If an established interval is more than seven 
years, the operator must conduct by the seventh year of the interval 
either a confirmatory direct assessment in accordance with Sec. 
192.931, or a low stress reassessment in accordance with Sec. 192.941.
    (2) Reassessment by ECDA following the requirements in paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.
    (3) Reassessment by ICDA or SCCDA following the requirements in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (4) Reassessment by confirmatory direct assessment at 7-year 
intervals in accordance with Sec. 192.931, with reassessment by one of 
the methods listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section 
by year 20 of the interval.
    (5) Reassessment by the low stress assessment method at 7-year 
intervals in accordance with Sec. 192.941 with reassessment by one of 
the methods listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section 
by year 20 of the interval.
    (6) The following table sets forth the maximum reassessment 
intervals. Also refer to Appendix E.II for guidance on Assessment 
Methods and Assessment Schedule for Transmission Pipelines Operating 
Below 30% SMYS. In case of conflict between the rule and the guidance in 
the Appendix, the requirements of the rule control. An operator must 
comply with the following requirements in establishing a reassessment 
interval for a covered segment:

<R05>
Sec. 192.941  What is a low stress reassessment?

    (a) General. An operator of a transmission line that operates below 
30% SMYS may use the following method to reassess a covered segment in 
accordance with Sec. 192.939. This method of reassessment addresses the 
threats of external and internal corrosion. The operator must have 
conducted a baseline assessment of the covered segment in accordance 
with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 192.919 and 192.921.
    (b) External corrosion. An operator must take one of the following 
actions to address external corrosion on the low stress covered segment.
    (1) Cathodically protected pipe. To address the threat of external 
corrosion on cathodically protected pipe in a covered segment, an 
operator must perform an electrical survey (i.e. indirect examination 
tool/method) at least every 7 years on the covered segment. An operator 
must use the results of each survey as part of an overall evaluation of 
the cathodic protection and corrosion threat for the covered segment. 
This evaluation must consider, at minimum, the leak repair and 
inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe 
inspection records, and the pipeline environment.
    (2) Unprotected pipe or cathodically protected pipe where electrical 
surveys are impractical. If an electrical survey is impractical on the 
covered segment an operator must--
    (i) Conduct leakage surveys as required by Sec. 192.706 at 4-month 
intervals; and
    (ii) Every 18 months, identify and remediate areas of active 
corrosion by evaluating leak repair and inspection records, corrosion 
monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline 
environment.
    (c) Internal corrosion. To address the threat of internal corrosion 
on a covered segment, an operator must--
    (1) Conduct a gas analysis for corrosive agents at least once each 
calendar year;
    (2) Conduct periodic testing of fluids removed from the segment. At 
least once each calendar year test the fluids removed from each storage 
field that may affect a covered segment; and
    (3) At least every seven (7) years, integrate data from the analysis 
and testing required by paragraphs (c)(1)-(c)(2) with applicable 
internal corrosion leak records, incident reports, safety-related 
condition reports, repair records, patrol records, exposed pipe reports, 
and test records, and define and implement appropriate remediation 
actions.

<R05>
Sec. 192.943  When can an operator deviate from these reassessment 
intervals?

    (a) Waiver from reassessment interval in limited situations. In the 
following limited instances, OPS may allow a waiver from a reassessment 
interval required by Sec. 192.939 if OPS finds a waiver would not be 
inconsistent with pipeline safety.
    (1) Lack of internal inspection tools. An operator who uses internal 
inspection as an assessment method may be able to justify a longer 
reassessment period for a covered segment if internal inspection tools 
are not available to assess the line pipe. To justify this, the operator 
must demonstrate that it cannot obtain the internal inspection tools 
within the required reassessment period and that the actions the 
operator is taking in the interim ensure the integrity of the covered 
segment.
    (2) Maintain product supply. An operator may be able to justify a 
longer reassessment period for a covered segment if the operator 
demonstrates that it cannot maintain local product supply if it conducts 
the reassessment within the required interval.
    (b) How to apply. If one of the conditions specified in paragraph 
(a) (1) or (a) (2) of this section applies, an operator may seek a 
waiver of the required reassessment interval. An operator must apply for 
a waiver in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 60118(c), at least 180 days before 
the end of the required reassessment interval, unless local product 
supply issues make the period impractical. If local product supply 
issues make the period impractical, an operator must apply for the 
waiver as soon

[[Page 112]]

as the need for the waiver becomes known.

<R05>
Sec. 192.945  What methods must an operator use to measure program 
effectiveness?

    (a) General. An operator must include in its integrity management 
program methods to measure, on a semi-annual basis, whether the program 
is effective in assessing and evaluating the integrity of each covered 
pipeline segment and in protecting the high consequence areas. These 
measures must include the four overall performance measures specified in 
ASME/ANSI B31.8S (ibr, see Sec. 192.7), section 9.4, and the specific 
measures for each identified threat specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, 
Appendix A. An operator must submit the four overall performance 
measures, by electronic or other means, on a semi-annual frequency to 
OPS in accordance with Sec. 192.951. An operator must submit its first 
report on overall performance measures by August 31, 2004. Thereafter, 
the performance measures must be complete through June 30 and December 
31 of each year and must be submitted within 2 months after those dates.
    (b) External Corrosion Direct assessment. In addition to the general 
requirements for performance measures in paragraph (a) of this section, 
an operator using direct assessment to assess the external corrosion 
threat must define and monitor measures to determine the effectiveness 
of the ECDA process. These measures must meet the requirements of Sec. 
192.925.

192.919;
    (d) Documents to support any decision, analysis and process 
developed and used to implement and evaluate each element of the 
baseline assessment plan and integrity management program. Documents 
include those developed and used in support of any identification, 
calculation, amendment, modification, justification, deviation and 
determination made, and any action taken to implement and evaluate any 
of the program elements;
    (e) Documents that demonstrate personnel have the required training, 
including a description of the training program, in accordance with 
Sec. 192.915;
    (f) Schedule required by Sec. 192.933 that prioritizes the 
conditions found during an assessment for evaluation and remediation, 
including technical justifications for the schedule.
    (g) Documents to carry out the requirements in Sec. Sec. 192.923 
through 192.929 for a direct assessment plan;
    (h) Documents to carry out the requirements in Sec. 192.931 for 
confirmatory direct assessment;
    (i) Verification that an operator has provided any documentation or 
notification required by this subpart to be provided to OPS, and when 
applicable, a State authority with which OPS has an interstate agent 
agreement, and a State or local pipeline safety authority that regulates 
a covered pipeline segment within that State.

                    Appendix A to Part 192 [Reserved]

              Appendix B to Part 192--Qualification of Pipe

    I. Listed Pipe Specifications
    API 5L--Steel pipe, ``API Specification for Line Pipe'' (ibr, see 
Sec. 192.7)
    ASTM A 53/A53M-99b--Steel pipe, ``Standard Specification for Pipe, 
Steel Black and Hot-Dipped, Zinc-Coated, Welded and Seamless'' (ibr, see 
Sec. 192.7).
    ASTM A 106--Steel pipe, ``Standard Specification for Seamless Carbon 
Steel Pipe for High Temperature Service'' (ibr, see Sec. 192.7).
    ASTM A 333/A 333M--Steel pipe, ``Standard Specification for Seamless 
and Welded Steel Pipe for Low Temperature Service'' (ibr, see Sec. 
192.7).
    ASTM A 381--Steel pipe, ``Standard Specification for Metal-Arc-
Welded Steel Pipe for Use with High-Pressure Transmission Systems'' 
(ibr, see Sec. 192.7).

Fusion-Welded Pipe for Atmospheric and Lower Temperatures'' (ibr, see 
Sec. 192.7).
    ASTM A 672--Steel pipe, ``Standard Specification for Electric-
Fusion-Welded Steel Pipe for High-Pressure Service at Moderate 
Temperatures'' (ibr, see Sec. 192.7).
    ASTM A 691--Steel pipe, ``Standard Specification for Carbon and 
Alloy Steel Pipe, Electric-Fusion-Welded for High Pressure Service at 
High Temperatures'' (ibr, see Sec. 192.7).
    ASTM D 2513--Thermoplastic pipe and tubing, ``Standard Specification 
for Thermoplastic Gas Pressure Pipe, Tubing, and Fittings'' (ibr, see 
Sec. 192.7).
    ASTM D 2517--Thermosetting plastic pipe and tubing, ``Standard 
Specification for Reinforced Epoxy Resin Gas Pressure Pipe and 
Fittings'' (ibr, see Sec. 192.7).
    II. Steel pipe of unknown or unlisted specification.
    A. Bending Properties. For pipe 2 inches (51 millimeters) or less in 
diameter, a length of pipe must be cold bent through at least 90 degrees 
around a cylindrical mandrel that has a diameter 12 times the diameter 
of the pipe, without developing cracks at any portion and without 
opening the longitudinal weld.
    For pipe more than 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter, the pipe 
must meet the requirements of the flattening tests set forth in ASTM A53 
(ibr, see Sec. 192.7), except that the number of tests must be at least 
equal to the minimum required in paragraph II-D of this appendix to 
determine yield strength.
    B. Weldability. A girth weld must be made in the pipe by a welder 
who is qualified under subpart E of this part. The weld must be made 
under the most severe conditions under which welding will be allowed in 
the field and by means of the same procedure that will be used in the 
field. On pipe more than 4 inches (102 millimeters) in diameter, at 
least one test weld must be made for each 100 lengths of pipe. On pipe 4 
inches (102 millimeters) or less in diameter, at least one test weld 
must be made for each 400 lengths of pipe. The weld must be tested in 
accordance with API Standard 1104 (ibr, see Sec. 192.7). If the 
requirements of API Standard 1104 cannot be met, weldability may be 
established by making chemical tests for carbon and manganese, and 
proceeding in accordance with section IX of the ASME Boiler and Pressure 
Vessel Code (ibr, see 192.7). The same number of chemical tests must be 
made as are required for testing a girth weld.
    C. Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate 
inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is 
reasonably round and straight and there are no defects which might 
impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.
    D. Tensile Properties. If the tensile properties of the pipe are not 
known, the minimum yield strength may be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165 
MPa) or less, or the tensile properties may be established by performing 
tensile tests as set forth in API Specification 5L (ibr, see Sec. 
192.7). All test specimens shall be selected at random and the following 
number of tests must be performed:

                   Number of Tensile Tests--All Sizes
10 lengths or less........................  1 set of tests for each
                                             length.

[[Page 114]]

 
11 to 100 lengths.........................  1 set of tests for each 5
                                             lengths, but not less than
                                             10 tests.
Over 100 lengths..........................  1 set of tests for each 10
                                             lengths, but not less than
                                             20 tests.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the yield-tensile ratio, based on the properties determined by those 
tests, exceeds 0.85, the pipe may be used only as provided in Sec. 
192.55(c).
    III. Steel pipe manufactured before November 12, 1970, to earlier 
editions of listed specifications. Steel pipe manufactured before 
November 12, 1970, in accordance with a specification of which a later 
edition is listed in section I of this appendix, is qualified for use 
under this part if the following requirements are met:
    A. Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit adequate 
inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is 
reasonably round and straight and that there are no defects which might 
impair the strength or tightness of the pipe.
    B. Similarity of specification requirements. The edition of the 
listed specification under which the pipe was manufactured must have 
substantially the same requirements with respect to the following 
properties as a later edition of that specification listed in section I 
of this appendix:
    (1) Physical (mechanical) properties of pipe, including yield and 
tensile strength, elongation, and yield to tensile ratio, and testing 
requirements to verify those properties.
    (2) Chemical properties of pipe and testing requirements to verify 
those properties.
    C. Inspection or test of welded pipe. On pipe with welded seams, one 
of the following requirements must be met:
    (1) The edition of the listed specification to which the pipe was 
manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with respect 
to nondestructive inspection of welded seams and the standards for 
acceptance or rejection and repair as a later edition of the 
specification listed in section I of this appendix.
    (2) The pipe must be tested in accordance with subpart J of this 
part to at least 1.25 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if 
it is to be installed in a class 1 location and to at least 1.5 times 
the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be installed in a 
class 2, 3, or 4 location. Notwithstanding any shorter time period 
permitted under subpart J of this part, the test pressure must be 
maintained for at least 8 hours.

 Appendix C to Part 192--Qualification of Welders for Low Stress Level 
                                  Pipe

    I. Basic test. The test is made on pipe 12 inches (305 millimeters) 
or less in diameter. The test weld must be made with the pipe in a 
horizontal fixed position so that the test weld includes at least one 
section of overhead position welding. The beveling, root opening, and 
other details must conform to the specifications of the procedure under 
which the welder is being qualified. Upon completion, the test weld is 
cut into four coupons and subjected to a root bend test. If, as a result 
of this test, two or more of the four coupons develop a crack in the 
weld material, or between the weld material and base metal, that is more 
than \1/8\-inch (3.2 millimeters) long in any direction, the weld is 
unacceptable. Cracks that occur on the corner of the specimen during 
testing are not considered. A welder who successfully passes a butt-weld 
qualification test under this section shall be qualified to weld on all 
pipe diameters less than or equal to 12 inches.
    II. Additional tests for welders of service line connections to 
mains. A service line connection fitting is welded to a pipe section 
with the same diameter as a typical main. The weld is made in the same 
position as it is made in the field. The weld is unacceptable if it 
shows a serious undercutting or if it has rolled edges. The weld is 
tested by attempting to break the fitting off the run pipe. The weld is 
unacceptable if it breaks and shows incomplete fusion, overlap, or poor 
penetration at the junction of the fitting and run pipe.
    III. Periodic tests for welders of small service lines. Two samples 
of the welder's work, each about 8 inches (203 millimeters) long with 
the weld located approximately in the center, are cut from steel service 
line and tested as follows:
    (1) One sample is centered in a guided bend testing machine and bent 
to the contour of the die for a distance of 2 inches (51 millimeters) on 
each side of the weld. If the sample shows any breaks or cracks after 
removal from the bending machine, it is unacceptable.
    (2) The ends of the second sample are flattened and the entire joint 
subjected to a tensile strength test. If failure occurs adjacent to or 
in the weld metal, the weld is unacceptable. If a tensile strength 
testing machine is not available, this sample must also pass the

[[Page 115]]

bending test prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

      Appendix D to Part 192--Criteria for Cathodic Protection and 
                      Determination of Measurements

    I. Criteria for cathodic protection-- A. Steel, cast iron, and 
ductile iron structures. (1) A negative (cathodic) voltage of at least 
0.85 volt, with reference to a saturated copper-copper sulfate half 
cell. Determination of this voltage must be made with the protective 
current applied, and in accordance with sections II and IV of this 
appendix.
    (2) A negative (cathodic) voltage shift of at least 300 millivolts. 
Determination of this voltage shift must be made with the protective 
current applied, and in accordance with sections II and IV of this 
appendix. This criterion of voltage shift applies to structures not in 
contact with metals of different anodic potentials.
    (3) A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 
millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in 
accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
    (4) A voltage at least as negative (cathodic) as that originally 
established at the beginning of the Tafel segment of the E-log-I curve. 
This voltage must be measured in accordance with section IV of this 
appendix.
    (5) A net protective current from the electrolyte into the structure 
surface as measured by an earth current technique applied at 
predetermined current discharge (anodic) points of the structure.
    B. Aluminum structures. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of this paragraph, a minimum negative (cathodic) voltage shift of 
150 millivolts, produced by the application of protective current. The 
voltage shift must be determined in accordance with sections II and IV 
of this appendix.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph, 
a minimum negative (cathodic) polarization voltage shift of 100 
millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be determined in 
accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
    (3) Notwithstanding the alternative minimum criteria in paragraphs 
(1) and (2) of this paragraph, aluminum, if cathodically protected at 
voltages in excess of 1.20 volts as measured with reference to a copper-
copper sulfate half cell, in accordance with section IV of this 
appendix, and compensated for the voltage (IR) drops other than those 
across the structure-electrolyte boundary may suffer corrosion resulting 
from the build-up of alkali on the metal surface. A voltage in excess of 
1.20 volts may not be used unless previous test results indicate no 
appreciable corrosion will occur in the particular environment.
    (4) Since aluminum may suffer from corrosion under high pH 
conditions, and since application of cathodic protection tends to 
increase the pH at the metal surface, careful investigation or testing 
must be made before applying cathodic protection to stop pitting attack 
on aluminum structures in environments with a natural pH in excess of 8.
    C. Copper structures. A minimum negative (cathodic) polarization 
voltage shift of 100 millivolts. This polarization voltage shift must be 
determined in accordance with sections III and IV of this appendix.
    D. Metals of different anodic potentials. A negative (cathodic) 
voltage, measured in accordance with section IV of this appendix, equal 
to that required for the most anodic metal in the system must be 
maintained. If amphoteric structures are involved that could be damaged 
by high alkalinity covered by paragraphs (3) and (4) of paragraph B of 
this section, they must be electrically isolated with insulating 
flanges, or the equivalent.
    II. Interpretation of voltage measurement. Voltage (IR) drops other 
than those across the structure-electrolyte boundary must be considered 
for valid interpretation of the voltage measurement in paragraphs A(1) 
and (2) and paragraph B(1) of section I of this appendix.
    III. Determination of polarization voltage shift. The polarization 
voltage shift must be determined by interrupting the protective current 
and measuring the polarization decay. When the current is initially 
interrupted, an immediate voltage shift occurs. The voltage reading 
after the immediate shift must be used as the base reading from which to 
measure polarization decay in paragraphs A(3), B(2), and C of section I 
of this appendix.
    IV. Reference half cells. A. Except as provided in paragraphs B and 
C of this section, negative (cathodic) voltage must be measured between

 Appendix E to Part 192--Guidance on Determining High Consequence Areas 
    and on Carrying out Requirements in the Integrity Management Rule

           I. Guidance on Determining a High Consequence Area

    To determine which segments of an operator's transmission pipeline 
system are covered for purposes of the integrity management program 
requirements, an operator must identify the high consequence areas. An 
operator must use method (1) or (2) from the definition in Sec. 192.903 
to identify a high consequence area. An operator may apply one method to 
its entire pipeline system, or an operator may apply one method to 
individual portions of the pipeline system. (Refer to figure E.I.A for a 
diagram of a high consequence area).

             Mitigative Measures for Transmission Pipelines

    (a) Table E.II.1 gives guidance to help an operator implement 
requirements on additional preventive and mitigative measures for 
addressing time dependent and independent threats for a transmission 
pipeline operating below 30% SMYS not in an HCA (i.e. outside of 
potential impact circle) but located within a Class 3 or Class 4 
Location.
    (b) Table E.II.2 gives guidance to help an operator implement 
requirements on assessment methods for addressing time dependent and 
independent threats for a transmission pipeline in an HCA.
    (c) Table E.II.3 gives guidance on preventative & mitigative 
measures addressing time

with full authority to: activate and contract with required oil spill 
removal organization(s); activate personnel and equipment maintained by 
the operator; act as liaison with the OSC; and obligate any funds 
required to carry out all required or directed oil response activities.
    Response activities means the containment and removal of oil from 
the water and shorelines, the temporary storage and disposal of 
recovered oil, or the taking of other actions as necessary to minimize

    Response zone means a geographic area either along a length of 
pipeline or including multiple pipelines, containing one or more 
adjacent line sections, for which the operator must plan

[[Page 146]]

for the deployment of, and provide, spill response capabilities. The 
size of the zone is determined by the operator after considering 
available capability, resources, and geographic characteristics.
    Specified minimum yield strength means the minimum yield strength, 
expressed in pounds per square inch, prescribed by the specification 
under which the material is purchased from the manufacturer.
    Stress level means the level of tangential or hoop stress, usually 
expressed as a percentage of specified minimum yield strength.
    Worst case discharge means the largest foreseeable discharge of oil,

<R04>
                        Subpart B_Response Plans


<R05>
Sec. 194.101  Operators required to submit plans.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, unless OPS 
grants a request from an Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) to require 
an operator of a pipeline in paragraph (b) to submit a response plan, 
each operator of an onshore pipeline facility shall prepare and submit a 
response plan to PHMSA as provided in Sec. 194.119. A pipeline which 
does not meet the criteria for significant and substantial harm as 
defined in Sec. 194.103(c) and is not eligible for an exception under 
Sec. 194.101(b), can be expected to cause substantial harm. Operators 
of substantial harm pipeline facilities must prepare and submit plans to 
PHMSA for review.
    (b) Exception. An operator need not submit a response plan for:
    (1) A pipeline that is 6\5/8\ inches (168 millimeters) or less in 
outside nominal diameter, is 10 miles (16 kilometers) or less in length, 
and all of the following conditions apply to the pipeline:
    (i) The pipeline has not experienced a release greater than 1,000 
barrels (159 cubic meters) within the previous five years,
    (ii) The pipeline has not experienced at least two reportable 
releases, as defined in Sec. 195.50, within the previous five years,
    (iii) A pipeline containing any electric resistance welded pipe, 
manufactured prior to 1970, does not operate at a maximum operating 
pressure established under Sec. 195.406 that corresponds to a stress 
level greater than 50 percent of the specified minimum yield strength of 
the pipe, and
    (iv) The pipeline is not in proximity to navigable waters, public 
drinking water intakes, or environmentally sensitive areas.
    (2)(i) A line section that is greater than 6\5/8\ inches in outside 
nominal diameter and is greater than 10 miles in length, where the 
operator determines that it is unlikely that the worst case discharge 
from any point on the line section would adversely affect, within 12 
hours after the initiation of the discharge, any navigable waters, 
public drinking water intake, or environmentally sensitive areas.
    (ii) A line section that is 6\5/8\ inches (168 millimeters) or less 
in outside nominal diameter and is 10 miles (16 kilometers) or less in 
length, where the operator determines that it is unlikely that the worst 
case discharge from any point on the line section would adversely 
affect, within 4 hours after the

[[Page 147]]

initiation of the discharge, any navigable waters, public drinking water 
intake, or environmentally sensitive areas.

2005]


<R05>
Sec. 194.103  Significant and substantial harm; operator's statement.

    (a) Each operator shall submit a statement with its response plan, 
as required by Sec. Sec. 194.107 and 194.113, identifying which line 
sections in a response zone can be expected to cause significant and 
substantial harm to the environment in the event of a discharge of oil 
into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines.
    (b) If an operator expects a line section in a response zone to 
cause significant and substantial harm, then the entire response zone 
must, for the purpose of response plan review and approval, be treated 
as if it is expected to cause significant and substantial harm. However, 
an operator will not have to submit separate plans for each line 
section.
    (c) A line section can be expected to cause significant and 
substantial harm to the environment in the event of a discharge of oil 
into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines if; the pipeline 
is greater than 6\5/8\ inches (168 millimeters) in outside nominal 
diameter, greater than 10 miles (16 kilometers) in length, and the line 
section--
    (1) Has experienced a release greater than 1,000 barrels (159 cubic 
meters) within the previous five years,
    (2) Has experienced two or more reportable releases, as defined in 
Sec. 195.50, within the previous five years,
    (3) Containing any electric resistance welded pipe, manufactured 
prior to 1970, operates at a maximum operating pressure established 
under Sec. 195.406 that corresponds to a stress level greater than 50 
percent of the specified minimum yield strength of the pipe,
    (4) Is located within a 5 mile (8 kilometer) radius of potentially 
affected public drinking water intakes and could reasonably be expected 
to reach public drinking water intakes, or
    (5) Is located within a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) radius of potentially 
affected environmentally sensitive areas, and could reasonably be 
expected to reach these areas.

<R05>
Sec. 194.105  Worst case discharge.

    (a) Each operator shall determine the worst case discharge for each 
of its response zones and provide the methodology, including 
calculations, used to arrive at the volume.
    (b) The worst case discharge is the largest volume, in barrels 
(cubic meters), of the following:
    (1) The pipeline's maximum release time in hours, plus the maximum 
shutdown response time in hours (based on historic discharge data or in 
the absence of such historic data, the operator's best estimate), 
multiplied by the maximum flow rate expressed in barrels per hour (based 
on the maximum daily capacity of the pipeline), plus the largest line 
drainage volume after shutdown of the line section(s) in the response 
zone expressed in barrels (cubic meters); or
    (2) The largest foreseeable discharge for the line section(s) within 
a response zone, expressed in barrels (cubic meters), based on the 
maximum historic discharge, if one exists, adjusted for any subsequent 
corrective or preventive action taken; or
    (3) If the response zone contains one or more breakout tanks, the 
capacity of the single largest tank or battery of tanks within a single 
secondary containment system, adjusted for the capacity or size of the 
secondary containment system, expressed in barrels (cubic meters).
    (4) Operators may claim prevention credits for breakout tank 
secondary containment and other specific spill prevention measures as 
follows:

<R05>
Sec. 194.107  General response plan requirements.

    (a) Each response plan must include procedures and a list of 
resources for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst 
case discharge and to a substantial threat of such a discharge. The 
``substantial threat'' term is equivalent to abnormal operations 
outlined in 49 CFR 195.402(d). To comply with this requirement, an 
operator can incorporate by reference into the response plan the 
appropriate procedures from its manual for operations, maintenance, and 
emergencies, which is prepared in compliance with 49 CFR 195.402.
    (b) An operator must certify in the response plan that it reviewed 
the NCP and each applicable ACP and that its response plan is consistent 
with the NCP and each applicable ACP as follows:
    (1) As a minimum to be consistent with the NCP a facility response 
plan must:
    (i) Demonstrate an operator's clear understanding of the function of 
the Federal response structure, including procedures to notify the 
National Response Center reflecting the relationship between the 
operator's response organization's role and the Federal On Scene 
Coordinator's role in pollution response;
    (ii) Establish provisions to ensure the protection of safety at the 
response site; and
    (iii) Identify the procedures to obtain any required Federal and 
State permissions for using alternative response strategies such as in-
situ burning and dispersants as provided for in the applicable ACPs; and
    (2) As a minimum, to be consistent with the applicable ACP the plan 
must:
    (i) Address the removal of a worst case discharge and the mitigation 
or prevention of a substantial threat of a worst case discharge;
    (ii) Identify environmentally and economically sensitive areas;
    (iii) Describe the responsibilities of the operator and of Federal, 
State and local agencies in removing a discharge and in mitigating or 
preventing a substantial threat of a discharge; and
    (iv) Establish the procedures for obtaining an expedited decision on 
use of dispersants or other chemicals.
    (c) Each response plan must include:
    (1) A core plan consisting of--
    (i) An information summary as required in Sec. 194.113,
    (ii) Immediate notification procedures,
    (iii) Spill detection and mitigation procedures,
    (iv) The name, address, and telephone number of the oil spill 
response organization, if appropriate,
    (v) Response activities and response resources,
    (vi) Names and telephone numbers of Federal, State and local 
agencies which the operator expects to have pollution control 
responsibilities or support,
    (vii) Training procedures,
    (viii) Equipment testing,
    (ix) Drill program--an operator will satisfy the requirement for a 
drill program by following the National Preparedness for Response 
Exercise Program (PREP) guidelines. An operator choosing not to follow 
PREP guidelines must have a drill program that is equivalent to PREP. 
The operator must describe the drill program in the response plan and 
OPS will determine if the program is equivalent to PREP.
    (x) Plan review and update procedures;

[[Page 149]]

    (2) An appendix for each response zone that includes the information 
required in paragraph (c)(1)(i)-(ix) of this section and the worst case 
discharge calculations that are specific to that response zone. An 
operator submitting a response plan for a single response zone does not 
need to have a core plan and a response zone appendix. The operator of a 
single response zone onshore pipeline shall have a single summary in the 
plan that contains the required information in Sec. 194.113.7; and
    (3) A description of the operator's response management system 
including the functional areas of finance, logistics, operations, 
planning, and command. The plan must demonstrate that the operator's 
response management system uses common terminology and has a manageable 
span of control, a clearly defined chain of command, and sufficient 
trained personnel to fill each position.

Sec. 195.1  Applicability.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part 
applies to pipeline facilities and the transportation of hazardous 
liquids or carbon dioxide associated with those facilities in or 
affecting interstate or foreign commerce, including pipeline facilities 
on the Outer Continental Shelf.
    (b) This part does not apply to--
    (1) Transportation of a hazardous liquid that is transported in a 
gaseous state;
    (2) Transportation of a hazardous liquid through a pipeline by 
gravity;
    (3) Transportation through any of the following low-stress 
pipelines:
    (i) An onshore pipeline or pipeline segment that--
    (A) Does not transport HVL;
    (B) Is located in a rural area; and
    (C) Is located outside a waterway currently used for commercial 
navigation;
    (ii) A pipeline subject to safety regulations of the U.S. Coast 
Guard; or
    (iii) A pipeline that serves refining, manufacturing, or truck, 
rail, or vessel terminal facilities, if the pipeline is less than 1 mile 
long (measured outside facility grounds) and does not cross an offshore 
area or a waterway currently used for commercial navigation;
    (4) Transportation of petroleum in onshore gathering lines in rural 
areas except gathering lines in the inlets of the Gulf of Mexico subject 
to Sec. 195.413;
    (5) Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in offshore 
pipelines in State waters which are located upstream from the outlet 
flange of each facility where hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide are 
produced or where produced hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide are first 
separated, dehydrated, or otherwise processed, whichever facility is 
farther downstream;
    (6) Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in Outer 
Continental Shelf pipelines which are located upstream of the point at 
which operating responsibility transfers from a producing operator to a 
transporting operator;
    (7) Transportation of a hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide through 
onshore production (including flow lines), refining, or manufacturing 
facilities, or storage or in-plant piping systems associated with such 
facilities;
    (8) Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide--
    (i) By vessel, aircraft, tank truck, tank car, or other non-pipeline 
mode of transportation; or

[[Page 157]]

    (ii) Through facilities located on the grounds of a materials 
transportation terminal that are used exclusively to transfer hazardous 
liquid or carbon dioxide between non-pipeline modes of transportation or 
between a non-pipeline mode and a pipeline, not including any device and 
associated piping that are necessary to control pressure in the pipeline 
under Sec. 195.406(b); and
    (9) Transportation of carbon dioxide downstream from the following

manifolds from which pipelines branch to injection wells.
    (c) Breakout tanks subject to this part must comply with 
requirements that apply specifically to breakout tanks and, to the 
extent applicable, with requirements that apply to pipeline systems and 
pipeline facilities. If a conflict exists between a requirement that 
applies specifically to breakout tanks and a requirement that applies to 
pipeline systems or pipeline facilities, the requirement that applies 
specifically to breakout tanks prevails. Anhydrous ammonia breakout 
tanks need not comply with Sec. Sec. 195.132(b), 195.205(b), 195.242 
(c) and (d), 195.264 (b) and (e), 195.307, 195.428 (c) and (d), and

Sec. 195.4  Compatibility necessary for transportation of hazardous 
liquids or carbon dioxide.

    No person may transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide 
unless the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide is chemically compatible 
with both the pipeline, including all components, and any other

Sec. 195.5  Conversion to service subject to this part.

    (a) A steel pipeline previously used in service not subject to this 
part qualifies for use under this part if the operator prepares and 
follows a written procedure to accomplish the following:
    (1) The design, construction, operation, and maintenance history of 
the pipeline must be reviewed and, where sufficient historical records 
are not available, appropriate tests must be performed to determine if 
the pipeline

[[Page 162]]

is in satisfactory condition for safe operation. If one or more of the 
variables necessary to verify the design pressure under Sec. 195.106 or 
to perform the testing under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is 
unknown, the design pressure may be verified and the maximum operating 
pressure determined by--
    (i) Testing the pipeline in accordance with ASME B31.8, Appendix N, 
to produce a stress equal to the yield strength; and
    (ii) Applying, to not more than 80 percent of the first pressure 
that produces a yielding, the design factor F in Sec. 195.106(a) and 
the appropriate factors in Sec. 195.106(e).
    (2) The pipeline right-of-way, all aboveground segments of the 
pipeline, and appropriately selected underground segments must be 
visually inspected for physical defects and operating conditions which 
reasonably could be expected to impair the strength or tightness of the 
pipeline.
    (3) All known unsafe defects and conditions must be corrected in 
accordance with this part.
    (4) The pipeline must be tested in accordance with subpart E of this 
part to substantiate the maximum operating pressure permitted by Sec. 
195.406.
    (b) A pipeline that qualifies for use under this section need not 
comply with the corrosion control requirements of subpart H of this part 
until 12 months after it is placed into service, notwithstanding any 
previous deadlines for compliance.
    (c) Each operator must keep for the life of the pipeline a record of 
the investigations, tests, repairs, replacements, and alterations made 
under the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 195.6  Unusually Sensitive Areas (USAs).

    As used in this part, a USA means a drinking water or ecological 
resource area that is unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a 
hazardous liquid pipeline release.
    (a) An USA drinking water resource is:
    (1) The water intake for a Community Water System (CWS) or a Non-
transient Non-community Water System (NTNCWS) that obtains its water 
supply primarily from a surface water source and does not have an 
adequate alternative drinking water source;
    (2) The Source Water Protection Area (SWPA) for a CWS or a NTNCWS 
that obtains its water supply from a Class I or Class IIA aquifer and 
does not have an adequate alternative drinking water source. Where a 
state has not yet identified the SWPA, the Wellhead Protection Area 
(WHPA) will be used until the state has identified the SWPA; or
    (3) The sole source aquifer recharge area where the sole source 
aquifer is a karst aquifer in nature.
    (b) An USA ecological resource is:
    (1) An area containing a critically imperiled species or ecological 
community;
    (2) A multi-species assemblage area;
    (3) A migratory waterbird concentration area;
    (4) An area containing an imperiled species, threatened or 
endangered species, depleted marine mammal species, or an imperiled 
ecological community where the species or community is aquatic, aquatic 
dependent, or terrestrial with a limited range; or
    (5) An area containing an imperiled species, threatened or 
endangered species, depleted marine mammal species, or imperiled 
ecological community where the species or community occurrence is 
considered to be one of the most viable, highest quality, or in the best 
condition, as identified by an element occurrence ranking (EORANK) of A 
(excellent quality) or B (good quality).
    (c) As used in this part--
    Adequate Alternative Drinking Water Source means a source of water 
that currently exists, can be used almost immediately with a minimal 
amount of effort and cost, involves no decline in water quality, and 
will meet the consumptive, hygiene, and fire fighting requirements of 
the existing population of impacted customers for at least one month for 
a surface water source of water and at least six months for a 
groundwater source.

[[Page 163]]

    Aquatic or Aquatic Dependent Species or Community means a species or 
community that primarily occurs in aquatic, marine, or wetland habitats, 
as well as species that may use terrestrial habitats during all or some 
portion of their life cycle, but that are still closely associated with 
or dependent upon aquatic, marine, or wetland habitats for some critical 
component or portion of their life-history (i.e., reproduction, rearing 
and development, feeding, etc).
    Class I Aquifer means an aquifer that is surficial or shallow, 
permeable, and is highly vulnerable to contamination. Class I aquifers 
include:
    (1) Unconsolidated Aquifers (Class Ia) that consist of surficial, 
unconsolidated, and permeable alluvial, terrace, outwash, beach, dune 
and other similar deposits. These aquifers generally contain layers of 
sand and gravel that, commonly, are interbedded to some degree with silt 
and clay. Not all Class Ia aquifers are important water-bearing units, 
but they are likely to be both permeable and vulnerable. The only 
natural protection of these aquifers is the thickness of the unsaturated 
zone and the presence of fine-grained material;
    (2) Soluble and Fractured Bedrock Aquifers (Class Ib). Lithologies 
in this class include limestone, dolomite, and, locally, evaporitic 
units that contain documented karst features or solution channels, 
regardless of size. Generally these aquifers have a wide range of 
permeability. Also included in this class are sedimentary strata, and 
metamorphic and igneous (intrusive and extrusive) rocks that are 
significantly faulted, fractured, or jointed. In all cases groundwater 
movement is largely controlled by secondary openings. Well yields range 
widely, but the important feature is the potential for rapid vertical 
and lateral ground water movement along preferred pathways, which result 
in a high degree of vulnerability;
    (3) Semiconsolidated Aquifers (Class Ic) that generally contain 
poorly to moderately indurated sand and gravel that is interbedded with 
clay and silt. This group is intermediate to the unconsolidated and 
consolidated end members. These systems are common in the Tertiary age 
rocks that are exposed throughout the Gulf and Atlantic coastal states. 
Semiconsolidated conditions also arise from the presence of intercalated 
clay and caliche within primarily unconsolidated to poorly consolidated 
units, such as occurs in parts of the High Plains Aquifer; or
    (4) Covered Aquifers (Class Id) that are any Class I aquifer 
overlain by less than 50 feet of low permeability, unconsolidated 
material, such as glacial till, lacustrian, and loess deposits.
    Class IIa aquifer means a Higher Yield Bedrock Aquifer that is 
consolidated and is moderately vulnerable to contamination. These 
aquifers generally consist of fairly permeable sandstone or conglomerate 
that contain lesser amounts of interbedded fine grained clastics (shale, 
siltstone, mudstone) and occasionally carbonate units. In general, well 
yields must exceed 50 gallons per minute to be included in this class. 
Local fracturing may contribute to the dominant primary porosity and 
permeability of these systems.
    Community Water System (CWS) means a public water system that serves 
at least 15 service connections used by year-round residents of the area 
or regularly serves at least 25 year-round residents.
    Critically imperiled species or ecological community (habitat) means 
an animal or plant species or an ecological community of extreme rarity, 
based on The Nature Conservancy's Global Conservation Status Rank. There 
are generally 5 or fewer occurrences, or very few remaining individuals 
(less than 1,000) or acres (less than 2,000). These species and 
ecological communities are extremely vulnerable to extinction due to 
some natural or man-made factor.
    Depleted marine mammal species means a species that has been 
identified and is protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 
1972, as amended (MMPA) (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.). The term ``depleted'' 
refers to marine mammal species that are listed as threatened or 
endangered, or are below their optimum sustainable populations (16 
U.S.C. 1362). The term ``marine mammal'' means ``any mammal which is 
morphologically adapted to the marine environment (including sea otters 
and members of the orders Sirenia, Pinnipedia, and Cetacea), or 
primarily

[[Page 164]]

inhabits the marine environment (such as the polar bear)'' (16 U.S.C. 
1362). The order Sirenia includes manatees, the order Pinnipedia 
includes seals, sea lions, and walruses, and the order Cetacea includes 
dolphins, porpoises, and whales.
    Ecological community means an interacting assemblage of plants and 
animals that recur under similar environmental conditions across the 
landscape.
    Element occurrence rank (EORANK) means the condition or viability of 
a species or ecological community occurrence, based on a population's 
size, condition, and landscape context. EORANKs are assigned by the 
Natural Heritage Programs. An EORANK of A means an excellent quality and 
an EORANK of B means good quality.
    Imperiled species or ecological community (habitat) means a rare 
species or ecological community, based on The Nature Conservancy's 
Global Conservation Status Rank. There are generally 6 to 20 
occurrences, or few remaining individuals (1,000 to 3,000) or acres 
(2,000 to 10,000). These species and ecological communities are 
vulnerable to extinction due to some natural or man-made factor.
    Karst aquifer means an aquifer that is composed of limestone or 
dolomite where the porosity is derived from connected solution cavities. 
Karst aquifers are often cavernous with high rates of flow.
    Migratory waterbird concentration area means a designated Ramsar 
site or a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site.
    Multi-species assemblage area means an area where three or more 
different critically imperiled or imperiled species or ecological 
communities, threatened or endangered species, depleted marine mammals, 
or migratory waterbird concentrations co-occur.
    Non-transient Non-community Water System (NTNCWS) means a public 
water system that regularly serves at least 25 of the same persons over 
six months per year. Examples of these systems include schools, 
factories, and hospitals that have their own water supplies.
    Public Water System (PWS) means a system that provides the public 
water for human consumption through pipes or other constructed 
conveyances, if such system has at least 15 service connections or 
regularly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily at least 60 
days out of the year. These systems include the sources of the water 
supplies--i.e., surface or ground. PWS can be community, non-transient 
non-community, or transient non-community systems.
    Ramsar site means a site that has been designated under The 
Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as 
Waterfowl Habitat program. Ramsar sites are globally critical wetland 
areas that support migratory waterfowl. These include wetland areas that 
regularly support 20,000 waterfowl; wetland areas that regularly support 
substantial numbers of individuals from particular groups of waterfowl, 
indicative of wetland values, productivity, or diversity; and wetland 
areas that regularly support 1% of the individuals in a population of 
one species or subspecies of waterfowl.
    Sole source aquifer (SSA) means an area designated by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency under the Sole Source Aquifer program as 
the ``sole or principal'' source of drinking water for an area. Such 
designations are made if the aquifer's ground water supplies 50% or more 
of the drinking water for an area, and if that aquifer were to become 
contaminated, it would pose a public health hazard. A sole source 
aquifer that is karst in nature is one composed of limestone where the 
porosity is derived from connected solution cavities. They are often 
cavernous, with high rates of flow.
    Source Water Protection Area (SWPA) means the area delineated by the 
state for a public water supply system (PWS) or including numerous PWSs, 
whether the source is ground water or surface water or both, as part of 
the state source water assessment program (SWAP) approved by EPA under 
section 1453 of the Safe Drinking Water Act.
    Species means species, subspecies, population stocks, or distinct 
vertebrate populations.
    Terrestrial ecological community with a limited range means a non-
aquatic or

[[Page 165]]

non-aquatic dependent ecological community that covers less than five 
(5) acres.
    Terrestrial species with a limited range means a non-aquatic or non-
aquatic dependent animal or plant species that has a range of no more 
than five (5) acres.
    Threatened and endangered species (T&E) means an animal or plant 
species that has been listed and is protected under the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA73) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). 
``Endangered species'' is defined as ``any species which is in danger of 
extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range'' (16 
U.S.C. 1532). ``Threatened species'' is defined as ``any species which 
is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future 
throughout all or a significant portion of its range'' (16 U.S.C. 1532).
    Transient Non-community Water System (TNCWS) means a public water 
system that does not regularly serve at least 25 of the same persons 
over six months per year. This type of water system serves a transient 
population found at rest stops, campgrounds, restaurants, and parks with 
their own source of water.
    Wellhead Protection Area (WHPA) means the surface and subsurface 
area surrounding a well or well field that supplies a public water 
system through which contaminants are likely to pass and eventually 
reach the water well or well field.
    Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) site means an 
area that contains migratory shorebird concentrations and has been 
designated as a hemispheric reserve, international reserve, regional 
reserve, or endangered species reserve. Hemispheric reserves host at 
least 500,000 shorebirds annually or 30% of a species flyway population. 
International reserves host 100,000 shorebirds annually or 15% of a 
species flyway population. Regional reserves host 20,000 shorebirds 
annually or 5% of a species flyway population. Endangered species 
reserves are critical to the survival of endangered species and no 
minimum number of birds is required.

Sec. 195.8  Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in 
pipelines constructed with other than steel pipe.

    No person may transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide 
through a pipe that is constructed after October 1, 1970, for hazardous 
liquids or after July 12, 1991 for carbon dioxide of material other than 
steel unless the person has notified the Administrator in writing at 
least 90 days before the transportation is to begin. The notice must 
state whether carbon dioxide or a hazardous liquid is to be transported 
and the chemical name, common name, properties and characteristics of 
the hazardous liquid to be transported and the material used in 
construction of the pipeline. If the Administrator determines that the 
transportation of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the manner 
proposed would be unduly hazardous, he will, within 90 days after 
receipt of the notice, order the person that gave the notice, in 
writing, not to transport the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the 
proposed manner until further notice.

Sec. 195.9  Outer continental shelf pipelines.

    Operators of transportation pipelines on the Outer Continental Shelf 
must identify on all their respective pipelines the specific points at 
which operating responsibility transfers to a producing operator. For 
those instances in which the transfer points are not identifiable by a 
durable marking, each operator will have until September 15, 1998 to 
identify the transfer points. If it is not practicable to durably mark a 
transfer point and the transfer point is located above water, the 
operator must depict the transfer point on a schematic maintained near 
the transfer point. If a transfer point is located subsea, the operator 
must identify the transfer point on a schematic which must be maintained 
at the nearest upstream facility and provided to PHMSA upon request. For 
those cases in which adjoining operators have not agreed on a transfer 
point by September 15, 1998 the Regional Director and the MMS

[[Page 166]]

Regional Supervisor will make a joint determination of the transfer 
point.

Sec. 195.104  Variations in pressure.

    If, within a pipeline system, two or more components are to be 
connected at a place where one will operate at a higher pressure than 
another, the system must be designed so that any component operating at 
the lower pressure will not be overstressed.


<R05>
Sec. 195.106  Internal design pressure.

    (a) Internal design pressure for the pipe in a pipeline is 
determined in accordance with the following formula:
P=(2St/D)xExF

P=Internal design pressure in p.s.i. (kPa) gage.
S=Yield strength in pounds per square inch (kPa) determined in 
accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
t=Nominal wall thickness of the pipe in inches (millimeters). If this is 
unknown, it is determined in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section.
D=Nominal outside diameter of the pipe in inches (millimeters).
E=Seam joint factor determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section.
F=A design factor of 0.72, except that a design factor of 0.60 is used 
for pipe, including risers, on a platform located offshore or on a 
platform in inland navigable waters, and 0.54 is used for pipe that has 
been subjected to cold expansion to meet the specified minimum yield 
strength and is subsequently heated, other than by welding or stress 
relieving as a part of welding, to a temperature higher than 900 [deg]F 
(482 [deg]C) for any period of time or over 600 [deg]F (316 [deg]C) for 
more than 1 hour.

    (b) The yield strength to be used in determining the internal design 
pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is the specified minimum 
yield strength. If the specified minimum yield strength is not known, 
the yield strength to be used in the design formula is one of the 
following:
    (1)(i) The yield strength determined by performing all of the 
tensile tests of API Specification 5L on randomly selected specimens 
with the following number of tests:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Pipe size                          No. of tests
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Less than 6\5/8\ in (168 mm) nominal        One test for each 200
 outside diameter.                           lengths.
6 \5/8\ in through 12\3/4\ in (168 mm       One test for each 100
 through 324 mm) nominal outside diameter.   lengths.
Larger than 12\3/4\ in (324 mm) nominal     One test for each 50
 outside diameter.                           lengths.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) If the average yield-tensile ratio exceeds 0.85, the yield 
strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165,474 kPa). If the average 
yield-tensile ratio is 0.85 or less, the yield strength of the pipe is 
taken as the lower of the following:
    (A) Eighty percent of the average yield strength determined by the 
tensile tests.
    (B) The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests.
    (2) If the pipe is not tensile tested as provided in paragraph (b) 
of this section, the yield strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. 
(165,474 kPa).
    (c) If the nominal wall thickness to be used in determining internal 
design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is not known, it is 
determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter 
points on one end. However, if the pipe is of uniform

[[Page 171]]

grade, size, and thickness, only 10 individual lengths or 5 percent of 
all lengths, whichever is greater, need be measured. The thickness of 
the lengths that are not measured must be verified by applying a gage 
set to the minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal wall 
thickness to be used is the next wall thickness found in commercial 
specifications that is below the average of all the measurements taken. 
However, the nominal wall thickness may not be more than 1.14 times the 
smallest measurement taken on pipe that is less than 20 inches (508 mm) 
nominal outside diameter, nor more than 1.11 times the smallest 
measurement taken on pipe that is 20 inches (508 mm) or more in nominal 
outside diameter.
    (d) The minimum wall thickness of the pipe may not be less than 87.5 
percent of the value used for nominal wall thickness in determining the 
internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section. In 
addition, the anticipated external loads and external pressures that are 
concurrent with internal pressure must be considered in accordance with 
Sec. Sec. 195.108 and 195.110 and, after determining the internal 
design pressure, the nominal wall thickness must be increased as 
necessary to compensate for these concurrent loads and pressures.
    (e) The seam joint factor used in paragraph (a) of this section is 
determined in accordance with the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   Seam

Sec. 195.303  Risk-based alternative to pressure testing older 
hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines.

    (a) An operator may elect to follow a program for testing a pipeline 
on risk-based criteria as an alternative to the pressure testing in 
Sec. 195.302(b)(1)(i)-(iii) and Sec. 195.302(b)(2)(i) of this subpart. 
Appendix B provides guidance on how this program will work. An operator 
electing such a program shall assign a risk classification to each 
pipeline segment according to the indicators described in paragraph (b) 
of this section as follows:
    (1) Risk Classification A if the location indicator is ranked as low 
or medium risk, the product and volume indicators are ranked as low 
risk, and the probability of failure indicator is ranked as low risk;
    (2) Risk Classification C if the location indicator is ranked as 
high risk; or
    (3) Risk Classification B.
    (b) An operator shall evaluate each pipeline segment in the program 
according to the following indicators of risk:
    (1) The location indicator is--
    (i) High risk if an area is non-rural or environmentally sensitive 
\1\; or
    (ii) Medium risk; or
    (iii) Low risk if an area is not high or medium risk.

[[Page 181]]

    (2) The product indicator is <SUP>1</SUP>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ (See Appendix B, Table C).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (i) High risk if the product transported is highly toxic or is both 
highly volatile and flammable;
    (ii) Medium risk if the product transported is flammable with a 
flashpoint of less than 100[deg] F, but not highly volatile; or
    (iii) Low risk if the product transported is not high or medium 
risk.
    (3) The volume indicator is--
    (i) High risk if the line is at least 18 inches in nominal diameter;
    (ii) Medium risk if the line is at least 10 inches, but less than 18 
inches, in nominal diameter; or
    (iii) Low risk if the line is not high or medium risk.
    (4) The probability of failure indicator is--
    (i) High risk if the segment has experienced more than three 
failures in the last 10 years due to time-dependent defects (e.g., 
corrosion, gouges, or problems developed during manufacture, 
construction or operation, etc.); or
    (ii) Low risk if the segment has experienced three failures or less 
in the last 10 years due to time-dependent defects.
    (c) The program under paragraph (a) of this section shall provide 
for pressure testing for a segment constructed of electric resistance-
welded (ERW) pipe and lapwelded pipe manufactured prior to 1970 
susceptible to longitudinal seam failures as determined through 
paragraph (d) of this section. The timing of such pressure test may be 
determined based on risk classifications discussed under paragraph (b) 
of this section. For other segments, the program may provide for use of 
a magnetic flux leakage or ultrasonic internal inspection survey as an 
alternative to pressure testing and, in the case of such segments in 
Risk Classification A, may provide for no additional measures under this 
subpart.
    (d) All pre-1970 ERW pipe and lapwelded pipe is deemed susceptible 
to longitudinal seam failures unless an engineering analysis shows 
otherwise. In conducting an engineering analysis an operator must 
consider the seam-related leak history of the pipe and pipe 
manufacturing information as available, which may include the pipe 
steel's mechanical properties, including fracture toughness; the 
manufacturing process and controls related to seam properties, including 
whether the ERW process was high-frequency or low-frequency, whether the 
weld seam was heat treated, whether the seam was inspected, the test 
pressure and duration during mill hydrotest; the quality control of the 
steel-making process; and other factors pertinent to seam properties and 
quality.
    (e) Pressure testing done under this section must be conducted in 
accordance with this subpart. Except for segments in Risk Classification 
B which are not constructed with pre-1970 ERW pipe, water must be the 
test medium.
    (f) An operator electing to follow a program under paragraph (a) 
must develop plans that include the method of testing and a schedule for 
the testing by December 7, 1998. The compliance deadlines for completion 
of testing are as shown in the table below:

    (g) An operator must review the risk classifications for those 
pipeline segments which have not yet been tested under paragraph (a) of 
this section or otherwise inspected under paragraph (c) of this section 
at intervals not to exceed 15 months. If the risk classification of an 
untested or uninspected segment changes, an operator must take 
appropriate action within two years, or establish the maximum operating 
pressure under Sec. 195.406(a)(5).
    (h) An operator must maintain records establishing compliance with

(2271 liters) or more of storage capacity that are constructed or 
significantly altered after October 2, 2000, must have an overfill 
protection system installed according to API Recommended Practice 2350. 
However, operators need not comply with any part of API Recommended 
Practice 2350 for a particular breakout tank if the operator notes in 
the manual required by Sec. 195.402 why compliance with that part is 
not necessary for safety of the tank.
    (d) After October 2, 2000, the requirements of paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section for inspection and testing of pressure control 
equipment apply to the inspection and testing of overfill protection 
systems.

<R05>
Sec. 195.442  Damage prevention program.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each 
operator of a buried pipeline must carry out, in accordance with this 
section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from 
excavation activities. For the purpose of this section, the term 
``excavation activities'' includes excavation, blasting, boring, 
tunneling, backfilling, the removal of aboveground structures by either 
explosive or mechanical means, and other earthmoving operations.

[[Page 192]]

    (b) An operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section through participation in a public service program, 
such as a one-call system, but such participation does not relieve the 
operator of the responsibility for compliance with this section. 
However, an operator must perform the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call 
system is a qualified one-call system. In areas that are covered by more 
than one qualified one-call system, an operator need only join one of 
the qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone number 
for excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call 
systems in those areas communicate with one another. An operator's 
pipeline system must be covered by a qualified one-call system where 
there is one in place. For the purpose of this section, a one-call 
system is considered a ``qualified one-call system'' if it meets the 
requirements of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) or this section.
    (1) The state has adopted a one-call damage prevention program under 
Sec. 198.37 of this chapter; or
    (2) The one-call system:
    (i) Is operated in accordance with Sec. 198.39 of this chapter;
    (ii) Provides a pipeline operator an opportunity similar to a 
voluntary participant to have a part in management responsibilities; and
    (iii) Assesses a participating pipeline operator a fee that is 
proportionate to the costs of the one-call system's coverage of the 
operator's pipeline.
    (c) The damage prevention program required by paragraph (a) of this 
section must, at a minimum:
    (1) Include the identity, on a current basis, of persons who 
normally engage in excavation activities in the area in which the 
pipeline is located.
    (2) Provides for notification of the public in the vicinity of the 
pipeline and actual notification of persons identified in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section of the following as often as needed to make them 
aware of the damage prevention program:
    (i) The program's existence and purpose; and
    (ii) How to learn the location of underground pipelines before 
excavation activities are begun.
    (3) Provide a means of receiving and recording notification of 
planned excavation activities.
    (4) If the operator has buried pipelines in the area of excavation 
activity, provide for actual notification of persons who give notice of 
their intent to excavate of the type of temporary marking to be provided 
and how to identify the markings.
    (5) Provide for temporary marking of buried pipelines in the area of 
excavation activity before, as far as practical, the activity begins.
    (6) Provide as follows for inspection of pipelines that an operator 
has reason to believe could be damaged by excavation activities:
    (i) The inspection must be done as frequently as necessary during 
and after the activities to verify the integrity of the pipeline; and
    (ii) In the case of blasting, any inspection must include leakage 
surveys.
    (d) A damage prevention program under this section is not required 
for the following pipelines:
    (1) Pipelines located offshore.
    (2) Pipelines to which access is physically controlled by the 
operator.

                      Pipeline Integrity Management


<R05>
Sec. 195.452  Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas.

    (a) Which pipelines are covered by this section? This section 
applies to each hazardous liquid pipeline and carbon dioxide pipeline 
that could affect a high consequence area, including any pipeline 
located in a high consequence area unless the operator effectively 
demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the 
area. (Appendix C of this part provides guidance on determining if a 
pipeline could affect a high consequence area.) Covered pipelines are 
categorized as follows:
    (1) Category 1 includes pipelines existing on May 29, 2001, that 
were owned or operated by an operator who owned or operated a total of 
500 or more miles of pipeline subject to this part.
    (2) Category 2 includes pipelines existing on May 29, 2001, that 
were owned or operated by an operator who owned or operated less than 
500 miles of pipeline subject to this part.
    (3) Category 3 includes pipelines constructed or converted after May 
29, 2001.
    (b) What program and practices must operators use to manage pipeline 
integrity? Each operator of a pipeline covered by this section must:
    (1) Develop a written integrity management program that addresses 
the risks on each segment of pipeline in the first column of the 
following table not later than the date in the second column:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Pipeline                               Date
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Category 1................................  March 31, 2002.
Category 2................................  February 18, 2003.
Category 3................................  1 year after the date the
                                             pipeline begins operation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Include in the program an identification of each pipeline or 
pipeline segment in the first column of the following table not later 
than the date in the second column:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Pipeline                               Date
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Category 1................................  December 31, 2001.
Category 2................................  November 18, 2002.
Category 3................................  Date the pipeline begins
                                             operation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Include in the program a plan to carry out baseline assessments 
of line pipe as required by paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) Include in the program a framework that--
    (i) Addresses each element of the integrity management program under 
paragraph (f) of this section, including continual integrity assessment 
and evaluation under paragraph (j) of this section; and
    (ii) Initially indicates how decisions will be made to implement 
each element.
    (5) Implement and follow the program.
    (6) Follow recognized industry practices in carrying out this 
section, unless--
    (i) This section specifies otherwise; or
    (ii) The operator demonstrates that an alternative practice is 
supported by a reliable engineering evaluation and provides an 
equivalent level of public safety and environmental protection.

[[Page 194]]

    (c) What must be in the baseline assessment plan? (1) An operator 
must include each of the following elements in its written baseline 
assessment plan:
    (i) The methods selected to assess the integrity of the line pipe. 
An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe by any of the 
following methods. The methods an operator selects to assess low 
frequency electric resistance welded pipe or lap welded pipe susceptible 
to longitudinal seam failure must be capable of assessing seam integrity 
and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.
    (A) Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion 
and deformation anomalies including dents, gouges and grooves;
    (B) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this 
part; or
    (C) Other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an 
equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator 
choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 90 
days before conducting the assessment, by sending a notice to the 
address or facsimile number specified in paragraph (m) of this section.
    (ii) A schedule for completing the integrity assessment;
    (iii) An explanation of the assessment methods selected and 
evaluation of risk factors considered in establishing the assessment 
schedule.
    (2) An operator must document, prior to implementing any changes to 
the plan, any modification to the plan, and reasons for the 
modification.
    (d) When must operators complete baseline assessments? Operators 
must complete baseline assessments as follows:
    (1) Time periods. Complete assessments before the following 
deadlines:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                     Then complete
                                       baseline          And assess at
                                    assessments not    least 50 percent
                                    later than the     of the line pipe
       If the pipeline is:          following date      on an expedited
                                    according to a     basis, beginning
                                     schedule that     with the highest
                                      prioritizes       risk pipe, not
                                     assessments:         later than:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Category 1......................  March 31, 2008....  September 30,
                                                       2004.
Category 2......................  February 17, 2009.  August 16, 2005.
Category 3......................  Date the pipeline   Not applicable.
                                   begins operation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (2) Prior assessment. To satisfy the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section for pipelines in the first column of the 
following table, operators may use integrity assessments conducted after 
the date in the second column, if the integrity assessment method 
complies with this section. However, if an operator uses this prior 
assessment as its baseline assessment, the operator must reassess the 
line pipe according to paragraph (j)(3) of this section. The table 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 Pipeline                               Date
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Category 1................................  January 1, 1996.
Category 2................................  February 15, 1997.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Newly-identified areas. (i) When information is available from 
the information analysis (see paragraph (g) of this section), or from 
Census Bureau maps, that the population density around a pipeline 
segment has changed so as to fall within the definition in Sec. 195.450 
of a high population area or other populated area, the operator must 
incorporate the area into its baseline assessment plan as a high 
consequence area within one year from the date the area is identified. 
An operator must complete the baseline assessment of any line pipe that 
could affect the newly-identified high consequence area within five 
years from the date the area is identified.
    (ii) An operator must incorporate a new unusually sensitive area 
into its baseline assessment plan within one year from the date the area 
is identified. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of any 
line pipe that could affect the newly-identified high consequence area 
within five years from the date the area is identified.
    (e) What are the risk factors for establishing an assessment 
schedule (for both the baseline and continual integrity assessments)? 
(1) An operator must establish an integrity assessment schedule that 
prioritizes pipeline segments for assessment (see paragraphs (d)(1) and 
(j)(3) of this section). An operator must base the assessment schedule 
on all

[[Page 195]]

risk factors that reflect the risk conditions on the pipeline segment. 
The factors an operator must consider include, but are not limited to:
    (i) Results of the previous integrity assessment, defect type and 
size that the assessment method can detect, and defect growth rate;
    (ii) Pipe size, material, manufacturing information, coating type 
and condition, and seam type;
    (iii) Leak history, repair history and cathodic protection history;
    (iv) Product transported;
    (v) Operating stress level;
    (vi) Existing or projected activities in the area;
    (vii) Local environmental factors that could affect the pipeline 
(e.g., corrosivity of soil, subsidence, climatic);
    (viii) geo-technical hazards; and
    (ix) Physical support of the segment such as by a cable suspension 
bridge.
    (2) Appendix C of this part provides further guidance on risk 
factors.
    (f) What are the elements of an integrity management program? An 
integrity management program begins with the initial framework. An 
operator must continually change the program to reflect operating 
experience, conclusions drawn from results of the integrity assessments, 
and other maintenance and surveillance data, and evaluation of 
consequences of a failure on the high consequence area. An operator must 
include, at minimum, each of the following elements in its written 
integrity management program:
    (1) A process for identifying which pipeline segments could affect a 
high consequence area;
    (2) A baseline assessment plan meeting the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section;
    (3) An analysis that integrates all available information about the 
integrity of the entire pipeline and the consequences of a failure (see 
paragraph (g) of this section);
    (4) Criteria for remedial actions to address integrity issues raised 
by the assessment methods and information analysis (see paragraph (h) of 
this section);
    (5) A continual process of assessment and evaluation to maintain a 
pipeline's integrity (see paragraph (j) of this section);
    (6) Identification of preventive and mitigative measures to protect 
the high consequence area (see paragraph (i) of this section);
    (7) Methods to measure the program's effectiveness (see paragraph 
(k) of this section);
    (8) A process for review of integrity assessment results and 
information analysis by a person qualified to evaluate the results and 
information (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section).
    (g) What is an information analysis? In periodically evaluating the 
integrity of each pipeline segment (paragraph (j) of this section), an 
operator must analyze all available information about the integrity of 
the entire pipeline and the consequences of a failure. This information 
includes:
    (1) Information critical to determining the potential for, and 
preventing, damage due to excavation, including current and planned 
damage prevention activities, and development or planned development 
along the pipeline segment;
    (2) Data gathered through the integrity assessment required under 
this section;
    (3) Data gathered in conjunction with other inspections, tests, 
surveillance and patrols required by this Part, including, corrosion 
control monitoring and cathodic protection surveys; and
    (4) Information about how a failure would affect the high 
consequence area, such as location of the water intake.
    (h) What actions must an operator take to address integrity issues?
    (1) General requirements. An operator must take prompt action to 
address all anomalous conditions that the operator discovers through the 
integrity assessment or information analysis. In addressing all 
conditions, an operator must evaluate all anomalous conditions and 
remediate those that could reduce a pipeline's integrity. An operator 
must be able to demonstrate that the remediation of the condition will 
ensure that the condition is unlikely to pose a threat to the long-term 
integrity of the pipeline. A reduction in operating pressure cannot 
exceed 365 days

[[Page 196]]

without an operator taking further remedial action to ensure the safety 
of the pipeline. An operator must comply with Sec. 195.422 when making 
a repair.
    (2) Discovery of condition. Discovery of a condition occurs when an 
operator has adequate information about the condition to determine that 
the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the 
pipeline. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after an 
integrity assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to 
make that determination, unless the operator can demonstrate that the 
180-day period is impracticable.
    (3) Schedule for evaluation and remediation. An operator must 
complete remediation of a condition according to a schedule that 
prioritizes the conditions for evaluation and remediation. If an 
operator cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the operator must 
justify the reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and that the changed 
schedule will not jeopardize public safety or environmental protection. 
An operator must notify OPS if the operator cannot meet the schedule and 
cannot provide safety through a temporary reduction in operating 
pressure. An operator must send the notice to the address specified in 
paragraph (m) of this section.
    (4) Special requirements for scheduling remediation--(i) Immediate 
repair conditions. An operator's evaluation and remediation schedule 
must provide for immediate repair conditions. To maintain safety, an 
operator must temporarily reduce operating pressure or shut down the 
pipeline until the operator completes the repair of these conditions. An 
operator must calculate the temporary reduction in operating pressure 
using the formula in section 451.7 of ASME/ANSI B31.4 (incorportaed by 
reference, see Sec. 195.3). An operator must treat the following 
conditions as immediate repair conditions:
    (A) Metal loss greater than 80% of nominal wall regardless of 
dimensions.
    (B) A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows a 
predicted burst pressure less than the established maximum operating 
pressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable remaining strength 
calculation methods include, but are not limited to, ASME/ANSI B31G 
(``Manual for Determining the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipelines'' 
(1991) or AGA Pipeline Research Committee Project PR-3-805 (``A Modified 
Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe'' 
(December 1989)). These documents are incorporated by reference and are 
available at the addresses listed in Sec. 195.3.
    (C) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 
o'clock positions) that has any indication of metal loss, cracking or a 
stress riser.
    (D) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 
o'clock positions) with a depth greater than 6% of the nominal pipe 
diameter.
    (E) An anomaly that in the judgment of the person designated by the 
operator to evaluate the assessment results requires immediate action.
    (ii) 60-day conditions. Except for conditions listed in paragraph 
(h)(4)(i) of this section, an operator must schedule evaluation and 
remediation of the following conditions within 60 days of discovery of 
condition.
    (A) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 
o'clock positions) with a depth greater than 3% of the pipeline diameter 
(greater than 0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than 
Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12).
    (B) A dent located on the bottom of the pipeline that has any 
indication of metal loss, cracking or a stress riser.
    (iii) 180-day conditions. Except for conditions listed in paragraph 
(h)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, an operator must schedule evaluation 
and remediation of the following within 180 days of discovery of the 
condition:
    (A) A dent with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter 
(0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that 
affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or a longitudinal seam weld.
    (B) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above 4 and 8 o'clock 
position) with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter (0.250 
inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12).

    (C) A dent located on the bottom of the pipeline with a depth 
greater than 6% of the pipeline's diameter.
    (D) A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows an 
operating pressure that is less than the current established maximum 
operating pressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable remaining 
strength calculation methods include, but are not limited to, ASME/ANSI 
B31G (``Manual for Determining the Remaining Strength of Corroded 
Pipelines'' (1991)) or AGA Pipeline Research Committee Project PR-3-805 
(``A Modified Criterion for Evaluating the Remaining Strength of 
Corroded Pipe'' (December 1989)). These documents are incorporated by 
reference and are available at the addresses listed in Sec. 195.3.
    (E) An area of general corrosion with a predicted metal loss greater 
than 50% of nominal wall.
    (F) Predicted metal loss greater than 50% of nominal wall that is 
located at a crossing of another pipeline, or is in an area with 
widespread circumferential corrosion, or is in an area that could affect 
a girth weld.
    (G) A potential crack indication that when excavated is determined 
to be a crack.
    (H) Corrosion of or along a longitudinal seam weld.
    (I) A gouge or groove greater than 12.5% of nominal wall.
    (iv) Other conditions. In addition to the conditions listed in 
paragraphs (h)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, an operator must 
evaluate any condition identified by an integrity assessment or 
information analysis that could impair the integrity of the pipeline, 
and as appropriate, schedule the condition for remediation. Appendix C 
of this part contains guidance concerning other conditions that an 
operator should evaluate.
    (i) What preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take to 
protect the high consequence area? (1) General requirements. An operator 
must take measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a 
pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. These 
measures include conducting a risk analysis of the pipeline segment to 
identify additional actions to enhance public safety or environmental 
protection. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, 
implementing damage prevention best practices, better monitoring of 
cathodic protection where corrosion is a concern, establishing shorter 
inspection intervals, installing EFRDs on the pipeline segment, 
modifying the systems that monitor pressure and detect leaks, providing 
additional training to personnel on response procedures, conducting 
drills with local emergency responders and adopting other management 
controls.
    (2) Risk analysis criteria. In identifying the need for additional 
preventive and mitigative measures, an operator must evaluate the 
likelihood of a pipeline release occurring and how a release could 
affect the high consequence area. This determination must consider all 
relevant risk factors, including, but not limited to:
    (i) Terrain surrounding the pipeline segment, including drainage 
systems such as small streams and other smaller waterways that could act 
as a conduit to the high consequence area;
    (ii) Elevation profile;
    (iii) Characteristics of the product transported;
    (iv) Amount of product that could be released;
    (v) Possibility of a spillage in a farm field following the drain 
tile into a waterway;
    (vi) Ditches along side a roadway the pipeline crosses;
    (vii) Physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable 
suspension bridge;
    (viii) Exposure of the pipeline to operating pressure exceeding 
established maximum operating pressure.
    (3) Leak detection. An operator must have a means to detect leaks on 
its pipeline system. An operator must evaluate the capability of its 
leak detection means and modify, as necessary, to protect the high 
consequence area. An operator's evaluation must, at least, consider, the 
following factors--length and size of the pipeline, type of product 
carried, the pipeline's proximity to the high consequence area, the 
swiftness of leak detection, location of nearest response personnel, 
leak history, and risk assessment results.
    (4) Emergency Flow Restricting Devices (EFRD). If an operator 
determines that

[[Page 198]]

an EFRD is needed on a pipeline segment to protect a high consequence 
area in the event of a hazardous liquid pipeline release, an operator 
must install the EFRD. In making this determination, an operator must, 
at least, consider the following factors--the swiftness of leak 
detection and pipeline shutdown capabilities, the type of commodity 
carried, the rate of potential leakage, the volume that can be released, 
topography or pipeline profile, the potential for ignition, proximity to 
power sources, location of nearest response personnel, specific terrain 
between the pipeline segment and the high consequence area, and benefits 
expected by reducing the spill size.
    (j) What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to 
maintain a pipeline's integrity? (1) General. After completing the 
baseline integrity assessment, an operator must continue to assess the 
line pipe at specified intervals and periodically evaluate the integrity 
of each pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence area.
    (2) Evaluation. An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as 
frequently as needed to assure pipeline integrity. An operator must base 
the frequency of evaluation on risk factors specific to its pipeline, 
including the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The 
evaluation must consider the results of the baseline and periodic 
integrity assessments, information analysis (paragraph (g) of this 
section), and decisions about remediation, and preventive and mitigative 
actions (paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section).
    (3) Assessment intervals. An operator must establish intervals not 
to exceed five (5) years for continually assessing the line pipe's 
integrity. An operator must base the assessment intervals on the risk 
the line pipe poses to the high consequence area to determine the 
priority for assessing the pipeline segments. An operator must establish 
the assessment intervals based on the factors specified in paragraph (e) 
of this section, the analysis of the results from the last integrity 
assessment, and the information analysis required by paragraph (g) of 
this section.
    (4) Variance from the 5-year intervals in limited situations--(i) 
Engineering basis. An operator may be able to justify an engineering 
basis for a longer assessment interval on a segment of line pipe. The 
justification must be supported by a reliable engineering evaluation 
combined with the use of other technology, such as external monitoring 
technology, that provides an understanding of the condition of the line 
pipe equivalent to that which can be obtained from the assessment 
methods allowed in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. An operator must 
notify OPS 270 days before the end of the five-year (or less) interval 
of the justification for a longer interval, and propose an alternative 
interval. An operator must send the notice to the address specified in 
paragraph (m) of this section.
    (ii) Unavailable technology. An operator may require a longer 
assessment period for a segment of line pipe (for example, because 
sophisticated internal inspection technology is not available). An 
operator must justify the reasons why it cannot comply with the required 
assessment period and must also demonstrate the actions it is taking to 
evaluate the integrity of the pipeline segment in the interim. An 
operator must notify OPS 180 days before the end of the five-year (or 
less) interval that the operator may require a longer assessment 
interval, and provide an estimate of when the assessment can be 
completed. An operator must send a notice to the address specified in 
paragraph (m) of this section.
    (5) Assessment methods. An operator must assess the integrity of the 
line pipe by any of the following methods. The methods an operator 
selects to assess low frequency electric resistance welded pipe or lap 
welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure must be capable of 
assessing seam integrity and of detecting corrosion and deformation 
anomalies.
    (i) Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion 
and deformation anomalies including dents, gouges and grooves;
    (ii) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this 
part; or
    (iii) Other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an 
equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator 
choosing this option must notify OPS

[[Page 199]]

90 days before conducting the assessment, by sending a notice to the 
address or facsimile number specified in paragraph (m) of this section.
    (k) What methods to measure program effectiveness must be used? An 
operator's program must include methods to measure whether the program 
is effective in assessing and evaluating the integrity of each pipeline 
segment and in protecting the high consequence areas. See Appendix C of 
this part for guidance on methods that can be used to evaluate a 
program's effectiveness.
    (l) What records must be kept? (1) An operator must maintain for 
review during an inspection:
    (i) A written integrity management program in accordance with 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) Documents to support the decisions and analyses, including any 
modifications, justifications, variances, deviations and determinations 
made, and actions taken, to implement and evaluate each element of the 
integrity management program listed in paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) See Appendix C of this part for examples of records an operator 
would be required to keep.
    (m) Where does an operator send a notification? An operator must 
send any notification required by this section to the Information 
Resources Manager, Office of Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous 
Materials Safety Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Room 
7128, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590, or to the facsimile 
number (202) 366-7128.

<R05>
Sec. 195.551  What do the regulations in this subpart cover?

    This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for protecting steel 
pipelines against corrosion.


<R05>
Sec. 195.553  What special definitions apply to this subpart?

    As used in this subpart--
    Active corrosion means continuing corrosion which, unless 
controlled, could result in a condition that is detrimental to public 
safety or the environment.
    Buried means covered or in contact with soil.
    Electrical survey means a series of closely spaced pipe-to-soil 
readings over a pipeline that are subsequently analyzed to identify 
locations where a corrosive current is leaving the pipeline.
    Pipeline environment includes soil resistivity (high or low), soil 
moisture (wet or dry), soil contaminants that may promote corrosive 
activity, and other known conditions that could affect the probability 
of active corrosion.
    You means operator.

[[Page 201]]


<R05>
Sec. 195.555  What are the qualifications for supervisors?

    You must require and verify that supervisors maintain a thorough 
knowledge of that portion of the corrosion control procedures 
established under Sec. 195.402(c)(3) for which they are responsible for 
insuring compliance.


<R05>
Sec. 195.557  Which pipelines must have coating for external corrosion 
control?

    Except bottoms of aboveground breakout tanks, each buried or 
submerged pipeline must have an external coating for external corrosion 
control if the pipeline is--
    (a) Constructed, relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed after the 
applicable date in Sec. 195.401(c), not including the movement of pipe 
covered by Sec. 195.424; or
    (b) Converted under Sec. 195.5 and--
    (1) Has an external coating that substantially meets Sec. 195.559 
before the pipeline is placed in service; or
    (2) Is a segment that is relocated, replaced, or substantially 
altered.


<R05>
Sec. 195.559  What coating material may I use for external corrosion 
control?

    Coating material for external corrosion control under Sec. 195.557 
must--
    (a) Be designed to mitigate corrosion of the buried or submerged 
pipeline;
    (b) Have sufficient adhesion to the metal surface to prevent under 
film migration of moisture;
    (c) Be sufficiently ductile to resist cracking;
    (d) Have enough strength to resist damage due to handling and soil 
stress;
    (e) Support any supplemental cathodic protection; and
    (f) If the coating is an insulating type, have low moisture 
absorption and provide high electrical resistance.


<R05>
Sec. 195.561  When must I inspect pipe coating used for external 
corrosion control?

    (a) You must inspect all external pipe coating required by Sec. 
195.557 just prior to lowering the pipe into the ditch or submerging the 
pipe.
    (b) You must repair any coating damage discovered.


<R05>
Sec. 195.563  Which pipelines must have cathodic protection?

    (a) Each buried or submerged pipeline that is constructed, 
relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed after the applicable date in 
Sec. 195.401(c) must have cathodic protection. The cathodic protection 
must be in operation not later than 1 year after the pipeline is 
constructed, relocated, replaced, or otherwise changed, as applicable.
    (b) Each buried or submerged pipeline converted under Sec. 195.5 
must have cathodic protection if the pipeline--
    (1) Has cathodic protection that substantially meets Sec. 195.571 
before the pipeline is placed in service; or
    (2) Is a segment that is relocated, replaced, or substantially 
altered.
    (c) All other buried or submerged pipelines that have an effective 
external coating must have cathodic protection.\1\ Except as provided by 
paragraph (d) of this section, this requirement does not apply to 
breakout tanks and does not apply to buried piping in breakout tank 
areas and pumping stations until December 29, 2003.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A pipeline does not have an effective external coating material 
if the current required to cathodically protect the pipeline is 
substantially the same as if the pipeline were bare.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Bare pipelines, breakout tank areas, and buried pumping station 
piping must have cathodic protection in places where regulations in 
effect before January 28, 2002 required cathodic protection as a result 
of electrical inspections. See previous editions of this part in 49 CFR, 
parts 186 to 199.
    (e) Unprotected pipe must have cathodic protection if required by 
Sec. 195.573(b).


<R05>
Sec. 195.565  How do I install cathodic protection on breakout tanks?

    After October 2, 2000, when you install cathodic protection under 
Sec. 195.563(a) to protect the bottom of an aboveground breakout tank 
of more than 500 barrels (79.5m<SUP>3</SUP>) capacity built to API 
Specification 12F, API Standard 620, or API Standard 650 (or its 
predecessor Standard 12C), you must install the system in accordance 
with API Recommended Practice 651. However, installation of the system 
need not

[[Page 202]]

comply with API Recommended Practice 651 on any tank for which you note 
in the corrosion control procedures established under Sec. 
195.402(c)(3) why compliance with all or certain provisions of API 
Recommended Practice 651 is not necessary for the safety of the tank.


<R05>
Sec. 195.567  Which pipelines must have test leads and what must I 
do to install and maintain the leads?

    (a) General. Except for offshore pipelines, each buried or submerged 
pipeline or segment of pipeline under cathodic protection required by 
this subpart must have electrical test leads for external corrosion 
control. However, this requirement does not apply until December 27, 
2004 to pipelines or pipeline segments on which test leads were not 
required by regulations in effect before January 28, 2002.
    (b) Installation. You must install test leads as follows:
    (1) Locate the leads at intervals frequent enough to obtain 
electrical measurements indicating the adequacy of cathodic protection.
    (2) Provide enough looping or slack so backfilling will not unduly 
stress or break the lead and the lead will otherwise remain mechanically 
secure and electrically conductive.
    (3) Prevent lead attachments from causing stress concentrations on 
pipe.
    (4) For leads installed in conduits, suitably insulate the lead from 
the conduit.
    (5) At the connection to the pipeline, coat each bared test lead 
wire and bared metallic area with an electrical insulating material 
compatible with the pipe coating and the insulation on the wire.
    (c) Maintenance. You must maintain the test lead wires in a 
condition that enables you to obtain electrical measurements to 
determine whether cathodic protection complies with Sec. 195.571.


<R05>
Sec. 195.569  Do I have to examine exposed portions of buried pipelines?

    Whenever you have knowledge that any portion of a buried pipeline is 
exposed, you must examine the exposed portion for evidence of external 
corrosion if the pipe is bare, or if the coating is deteriorated. If you 
find external corrosion requiring corrective action under Sec. 195.585, 
you must investigate circumferentially and longitudinally beyond the 
exposed portion (by visual examination, indirect method, or both) to 
determine whether additional corrosion requiring remedial action exists 
in the vicinity of the exposed portion.


<R05>
Sec. 195.571  What criteria must I use to determine the adequacy of 
cathodic protection?

    Cathodic protection required by this subpart must comply with one or 
more of the applicable criteria and other considerations for cathodic 
protection contained in paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3 of NACE Standard RP0169-
96 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 195.3).


<R05>
Sec. 195.573  What must I do to monitor external corrosion control?

    (a) Protected pipelines. You must do the following to determine 
whether cathodic protection required by this subpart complies with Sec. 
195.571:
    (1) Conduct tests on the protected pipeline at least once each 
calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months. However, if 
tests at those intervals are impractical for separately protected short 
sections of bare or ineffectively coated pipelines, testing may be done 
at least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 
39 months.
    (2) Identify before December 29, 2003 or not more than 2 years after 
cathodic protection is installed, whichever comes later, the 
circumstances in which a close-interval survey or comparable technology 
is practicable and necessary to accomplish the objectives of paragraph 
10.1.1.3 of NACE Standard RP0169-96 (incorporated by reference, see 
Sec. 195.3).
    (b) Unprotected pipe. You must reevaluate your unprotected buried or 
submerged pipe and cathodically protect the pipe in areas in which 
active corrosion is found, as follows:
    (1) Determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey, or 
where an electrical survey is impractical, by other means that include 
review and analysis of leak repair and inspection records, corrosion 
monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline 
environment.

                                             not exceeding 15 months.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Breakout tanks. You must inspect each cathodic protection system 
used to control corrosion on the bottom of an aboveground breakout tank 
to ensure that operation and maintenance of the system are in accordance 
with API Recommended Practice 651. However, this inspection is not 
required if you note in the corrosion control procedures established 
under Sec. 195.402(c)(3) why compliance with all or certain operation 
and maintenance provisions of API Recommended Practice 651 is not 
necessary for the safety of the tank.
    (e) Corrective action. You must correct any identified deficiency in 
corrosion control as required by Sec. 195.401(b). However, if the 
deficiency involves a pipeline in an integrity management program under 
Sec. 195.452, you must correct the deficiency as required by Sec. 
195.452(h).

Sec. 195.575  Which facilities must I electrically isolate and what 
inspections, tests, and safeguards are required?

    (a) You must electrically isolate each buried or submerged pipeline 
from other metallic structures, unless you electrically interconnect and 
cathodically protect the pipeline and the other structures as a single 
unit.
    (b) You must install one or more insulating devices where electrical 
isolation of a portion of a pipeline is necessary to facilitate the 
application of corrosion control.
    (c) You must inspect and electrically test each electrical isolation 
to assure the isolation is adequate.
    (d) If you install an insulating device in an area where a 
combustible atmosphere is reasonable to foresee, you must take 
precautions to prevent arcing.
    (e) If a pipeline is in close proximity to electrical transmission 
tower footings, ground cables, or counterpoise, or in other areas where 
it is reasonable to foresee fault currents or an unusual risk of 
lightning, you must protect the pipeline against damage from fault 
currents or lightning and take protective measures at insulating 
devices.


<R05>
Sec. 195.577  What must I do to alleviate interference currents?

    (a) For pipelines exposed to stray currents, you must have a program 
to identify, test for, and minimize the detrimental effects of such 
currents.
    (b) You must design and install each impressed current or galvanic 
anode system to minimize any adverse effects on existing adjacent 
metallic structures.


<R05>
Sec. 195.579  What must I do to mitigate internal corrosion?

    (a) General. If you transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide 
that would corrode the pipeline, you must investigate the corrosive 
effect of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide on the pipeline and 
take adequate steps to mitigate internal corrosion.
    (b) Inhibitors. If you use corrosion inhibitors to mitigate internal 
corrosion, you must--
    (1) Use inhibitors in sufficient quantity to protect the entire part 
of the

[[Page 204]]

pipeline system that the inhibitors are designed to protect;
    (2) Use coupons or other monitoring equipment to determine the 
effectiveness of the inhibitors in mitigating internal corrosion; and
    (3) Examine the coupons or other monitoring equipment at least twice 
each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 7\1/2\ months.
    (c) Removing pipe. Whenever you remove pipe from a pipeline, you 
must inspect the internal surface of the pipe for evidence of corrosion. 
If you find internal corrosion requiring corrective action under Sec. 
195.585, you must investigate circumferentially and longitudinally 
beyond the removed pipe (by visual examination, indirect method, or 
both) to determine whether additional corrosion requiring remedial 
action exists in the vicinity of the removed pipe.
    (d) Breakout tanks. After October 2, 2000, when you install a tank 
bottom lining in an aboveground breakout tank built to API Specification 
12F, API Standard 620, or API Standard 650 (or its predecessor Standard 
12C), you must install the lining in accordance with API Recommended 
Practice 652. However, installation of the lining need not comply with 
API Recommended Practice 652 on any tank for which you note in the 
corrosion control procedures established under Sec. 195.402(c)(3) why 
compliance with all or certain provisions of API Recommended Practice 
652 is not necessary for the safety of the tank.


<R05>
Sec. 195.581  Which pipelines must I protect against atmospheric 
corrosion and what coating material may I use?

    (a) You must clean and coat each pipeline or portion of pipeline 
that is exposed to the atmosphere, except pipelines under paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    (b) Coating material must be suitable for the prevention of 
atmospheric corrosion.
    (c) Except portions of pipelines in offshore splash zones or soil-
to-air interfaces, you need not protect against atmospheric corrosion 
any pipeline for which you demonstrate by test, investigation, or 
experience appropriate to the environment of the pipeline that corrosion 
will--
    (1) Only be a light surface oxide; or
    (2) Not affect the safe operation of the pipeline before the next 
scheduled inspection.


<R05>
Sec. 195.583  What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control?

    (a) You must inspect each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is 
exposed to the atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion, as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                Then the frequency of
       If the pipeline is  located:                inspection is:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Onshore...................................  At least once every 3
                                             calendar years, but with
                                             intervals not exceeding 39
                                             months.
Offshore..................................  At least once each calendar
                                             year, but with intervals
                                             not exceeding 15 months.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) During inspections you must give particular attention to pipe at 
soil-to-air interfaces, under thermal insulation, under disbonded 
coatings, at pipe supports, in splash zones, at deck penetrations, and 
in spans over water.
    (c) If you find atmospheric corrosion during an inspection, you must 
provide protection against the corrosion as required by Sec. 195.581.


<R05>
Sec. 195.585  What must I do to correct corroded pipe?

    (a) General corrosion. If you find pipe so generally corroded that 
the remaining wall thickness is less than that required for the maximum 
operating pressure of the pipeline, you must replace the pipe. However, 
you need not replace the pipe if you--
    (1) Reduce the maximum operating pressure commensurate with the 
strength of the pipe needed for serviceability based on actual remaining 
wall thickness; or
    (2) Repair the pipe by a method that reliable engineering tests and 
analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability of the pipe.
    (b) Localized corrosion pitting. If you find pipe that has localized 
corrosion pitting to a degree that leakage might result, you must 
replace or repair the pipe, unless you reduce the maximum operating 
pressure commensurate with

[[Page 205]]

the strength of the pipe based on actual remaining wall thickness in the 
pits.


<R05>
Sec. 195.587  What methods are available to determine the strength of 
corroded pipe?

    Under Sec. 195.585, you may use the procedure in ASME B31G, 
``Manual for Determining the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipelines,'' 
or the procedure developed by AGA/Battelle, ``A Modified Criterion for 
Evaluating the Remaining Strength of Corroded Pipe (with RSTRENG 
disk),'' to determine the strength of corroded pipe based on actual 
remaining wall thickness. These procedures apply to corroded regions 
that do not penetrate the pipe wall, subject to the limitations set out 
in the respective procedures.


<R05>
Sec. 195.589  What corrosion control information do I have to maintain?

    (a) You must maintain current records or maps to show the location 
of--
    (1) Cathodically protected pipelines;
    (2) Cathodic protection facilities, including galvanic anodes, 
installed after January 28, 2002; and
    (3) Neighboring structures bonded to cathodic protection systems.
    (b) Records or maps showing a stated number of anodes, installed in 
a stated manner or spacing, need not show specific distances to each 
buried anode.
    (c) You must maintain a record of each analysis, check, 
demonstration, examination, inspection, investigation, review, survey, 
and test required by this subpart in sufficient detail to demonstrate 
the adequacy of corrosion control measures or that corrosion requiring 
control measures does not exist. You must retain these records for at 
least 5 years, except that records related to Sec. Sec. 195.569, 
195.573(a) and (b), and 195.579(b)(3) and (c) must be retained for as 
long as the pipeline remains in service.

     Appendix A to Part 195--Delineation Between Federal and State 
       Jurisdiction--Statement of Agency Policy and Interpretation

    In 1979, Congress enacted comprehensive safety legislation governing 
the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, the Hazardous 
Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, 49 U.S.C. 2001 et seq. (HLPSA). The 
HLPSA expanded the existing statutory authority for safety regulation, 
which was limited to transportation by common carriers in interstate and 
foreign commerce, to transportation through facilities used in or 
affecting interstate or foreign commerce. It also added civil penalty, 
compliance order, and injunctive enforcement authorities to the existing 
criminal sanctions. Modeled largely on the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety 
Act of 1968, 49 U.S.C. 1671 et seq. (NGPSA), the HLPSA provides for a 
national hazardous liquid pipeline safety program with nationally 
uniform minimal standards and with enforcement administered through a 
Federal-State partnership. The HLPSA leaves to exclusive Federal 
regulation and enforcement the ``interstate pipeline facilities,'' those 
used for the pipeline transportation of hazardous liquids in interstate 
or foreign commerce. For the remainder of the pipeline facilities, 
denominated ``intrastate pipeline facilities,'' the HLPSA provides that 
the same Federal regulation and enforcement will apply unless a State 
certifies that it will assume those responsibilities. A certified State 
must adopt the same minimal standards but may adopt additional more 
stringent standards so long as they are compatible. Therefore, in States 
which participate in the hazardous liquid pipeline safety program 
through certification, it is necessary to distinguish the interstate 
from the intrastate pipeline facilities.
    In deciding that an administratively practical approach was 
necessary in distinguishing between interstate and intrastate liquid 
pipeline facilities and in determining how best to accomplish this, DOT 
has logically examined the approach used in the NGPSA. The NGPSA defines 
the interstate gas pipeline facilities subject to exclusive Federal 
jurisdiction as those subject to the economic regulatory jurisdiction of 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Experience has proven 
this approach practical. Unlike the NGPSA however, the HLPSA has no 
specific reference to FERC jurisdiction, but instead defines interstate 
liquid pipeline facilities by the more commonly used means of specifying 
the end points of the transportation involved. For example, the economic 
regulatory jurisdiction of FERC over the transportation of both gas and 
liquids by pipeline is defined in much the same way. In implementing the 
HLPSA DOT has sought a practicable means of distinguishing between 
interstate and intrastate pipeline facilities that provide the requisite 
degree of certainty to Federal and State enforcement personnel and to 
the regulated entities. DOT intends that this statement of agency policy 
and interpretation provide that certainty.

[[Page 206]]

    In 1981, DOT decided that the inventory of liquid pipeline 
facilities identified as subject to the jurisdiction of FERC 
approximates the HLPSA category of ``interstate pipeline facilities.'' 
Administrative use of the FERC inventory has the added benefit of 
avoiding the creation of a separate Federal scheme for determination of 
jurisdiction over the same regulated entities. DOT recognizes that the 
FERC inventory is only an approximation and may not be totally 
satisfactory without some modification. The difficulties stem from some 
significant differences in the economic regulation of liquid and of 
natural gas pipelines. There is an affirmative assertion of jurisdiction 
by FERC over natural gas pipelines through the issuance of certificates 
of public convenience and necessity prior to commencing operations. With 
liquid pipelines, there is only a rebuttable presumption of jurisdiction 
created by the filing by pipeline operators of tariffs (or concurrences) 
for movement of liquids through existing facilities. Although FERC does 
police the filings for such matters as compliance with the general 
duties of common carriers, the question of jurisdiction is normally only 
aired upon complaint. While any person, including State or Federal 
agencies, can avail themselves of the FERC forum by use of the complaint 
process, that process has only been rarely used to review jurisdictional 
matters (probably because of the infrequency of real disputes on the 
issue). Where the issue has arisen, the reviewing body has noted the 
need to examine various criteria primarily of an economic nature. DOT 
believes that, in most cases, the formal FERC forum can better receive 
and evaluate the type of information that is needed to make decisions of 
this nature than can DOT.
    In delineating which liquid pipeline facilities are interstate 
pipeline facilities within the meaning of the HLPSA, DOT will generally 
rely on the FERC filings; that is, if there is a tariff or concurrence 
filed with FERC governing the transportation of hazardous liquids over a 
pipeline facility or if there has been an exemption from the obligation 
to file tariffs obtained from FERC, then DOT will, as a general rule, 
consider the facility to be an interstate pipeline facility within the 
meaning of the HLPSA. The types of situations in which DOT will ignore 
the existence or non-existence of a filing with FERC will be limited to 
those cases in which it appears obvious that a complaint filed with FERC 
would be successful or in which blind reliance on a FERC filing would 
result in a situation clearly not intended by the HLPSA such as a 
pipeline facility not being subject to either State or Federal safety 
regulation. DOT anticipates that the situations in which there is any 
question about the validity of the FERC filings as a ready reference 
will be few and that the actual variations from reliance on those 
filings will be rare. The following examples indicate the types of 
facilities which DOT believes are interstate pipeline facilities subject 
to the HLPSA despite the lack of a filing with FERC and the types of 
facilities over which DOT will generally defer to the jurisdiction of a 
certifying state despite the existence of a filing with FERC.

    Example 1. Pipeline company P operates a pipeline from ``Point A'' 
located in State X to ``Point B'' (also in X). The physical facilities 
never cross a state line and do not connect with any other pipeline 
which does cross a state line. Pipeline company P also operates another 
pipeline between ``Point C'' in State X and ``Point D'' in an adjoining 
State Y. Pipeline company P files a tariff with FERC for transportation 
from ``Point A'' to ``Point B'' as well as for transportation from 
``Point C'' to ``Point D.'' DOT will ignore filing for the line from 
``Point A'' to ``Point B'' and consider the line to be intrastate.
    Example 2. Same as in example 1 except that P does not file any 
tariffs with FERC. DOT will assume jurisdiction of the line between 
``Point C'' and ``Point D.''
    Example 3. Same as in example 1 except that P files its tariff for 
the line between ``Point C'' and ``Point D'' not only with FERC but also 
with State X. DOT will rely on the FERC filing as indication of 
interstate commerce.
    Example 4. Same as in example 1 except that the pipeline from 
``Point A'' to ``Point B'' (in State X) connects with a pipeline 
operated by another company transports liquid between ``Point B'' (in 
State X) and ``Point D'' (in State Y). DOT will rely on the FERC filing 
as indication of interstate commerce.
    Example 5. Same as in example 1 except that the line between ``Point 
C'' and ``Point D'' has a lateral line connected to it. The lateral is 
located entirely with State X. DOT will rely on the existence or non-
existence of a FERC filing covering transportation over that lateral as 
determinative of interstate commerce.
    Example 6. Same as in example 1 except that the certified agency in 
State X has brought an enforcement action (under the pipeline safety 
laws) against P because of its operation of the line between ``Point A'' 
and ``Point B''. P has successfully defended against the action on 
jurisdictional grounds. DOT will assume jurisdiction if necessary to 
avoid the anomaly of a pipeline subject to neither State or Federal 
safety enforcement. DOT's assertion of jurisdiction in such a case would 
be based on the gap in the state's enforcement authority rather than a 
DOT decision that the pipeline is an interstate pipeline facility.
    Example 7. Pipeline Company P operates a pipeline that originates on 
the Outer Continental Shelf. P does not file any tariff for

[[Page 207]]

that line with FERC. DOT will consider the pipeline to be an interstate 
pipeline facility.
    Example 8. Pipeline Company P is constructing a pipeline from 
``Point C'' (in State X) to ``Point D'' (in State Y). DOT will consider 
the pipeline to be an interstate pipeline facility.
    Example 9. Pipeline company P is constructing a pipeline from 
``Point C'' to ``Point E'' (both in State X) but intends to file tariffs 
with FERC in the transportation of hazardous liquid in interstate 
commerce. Assuming there is some connection to an interstate pipeline 
facility, DOT will consider this line to be an interstate pipeline 
facility.
    Example 10. Pipeline Company P has operated a pipeline subject to 
FERC economic regulation. Solely because of some statutory economic 
deregulation, that pipeline is no longer regulated by FERC. DOT will 
continue to consider that pipeline to be an interstate pipeline 
facility.

    As seen from the examples, the types of situations in which DOT will 
not defer to the FERC regulatory scheme are generally clear-cut cases. 
For the remainder of the situations where variation from the FERC scheme 
would require DOT to replicate the forum already provided by FERC and to 
consider economic factors better left to that agency, DOT will decline 
to vary its reliance on the FERC filings unless, of course, not doing so 
would result in situations clearly not intended by the HLPSA.

Appendix B to Part 195--Risk-Based Alternative to Pressure Testing Older 
              Hazardous Liquid and Carbon Dioxide Pipelines

                         Risk-Based Alternative

    This Appendix provides guidance on how a risk-based alternative to 
pressure testing older hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines 
rule allowed by Sec. 195.303 will work. This risk-based alternative 
establishes test priorities for older pipelines, not previously pressure 
tested, based on the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment. The 
first step is to determine the classification based on the type of pipe 
or on the pipeline segment's proximity to populated or environmentally 
sensitive area. Secondly, the classifications must be adjusted based on 
the pipeline failure history, product transported, and the release 
volume potential.
    Tables 2-6 give definitions of risk classification A, B, and C 
facilities. For the purposes of this rule, pipeline segments containing 
high risk electric resistance-welded pipe (ERW pipe) and lapwelded pipe 
manufactured prior to 1970 and considered a risk classification C or B 
facility shall be treated as the top priority for testing because of the 
higher risk associated with the susceptibility of this pipe to 
longitudinal seam failures.
    In all cases, operators shall annually, at intervals not to exceed 
15 months, review their facilities to reassess the classification and 
shall take appropriate action within two years or operate the pipeline 
system at a lower pressure. Pipeline failures, changes in the 
characteristics of the pipeline route, or changes in service should all 
trigger a reassessment of the originally classification.
    Table 1 explains different levels of test requirements depending on 
the inherent risk of a given pipeline segment. The overall risk 
classification is determined based on the type of pipe involved, the 
facility's location, the product transported, the relative volume of 
flow and pipeline failure history as determined from Tables 2-6.

                                                           required.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ If operational experience indicates a history of past failures for a particular pipeline segment, failure
  causes (time-dependent defects due to corrosion, construction, manufacture, or transmission problems, etc.)
  shall be reviewed in determining risk classification (See Table 6) and the timing of the pressure test should
  be accelerated.
\2\ All pre-1970 ERW pipeline segments may not require testing. In determining which ERW pipeline segments
  should be included in this category, an operator must consider the seam-related leak history of the pipe and
  pipe manufacturing information as available, which may include the pipe steel's mechanical properties,
  including fracture toughness; the manufacturing process and controls related to seam properties, including
  whether the ERW process was high-frequency or low-frequency, whether the weld seam was heat treated, whether
  the seam was inspected, the test pressure and duration during mill hydrotest; the quality control of the steel-
  making process; and other factors pertinent to seam properties and quality.
\3\ For those pipeline operators with extensive mileage of pre-1970 ERW pipe, any waiver requests for timing
  relief should be supported by an assessment of hazards in accordance with location, product, volume, and
  probability of failure considerations consistent with Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6.

[[Page 208]]

 
\4\ A magnetic flux leakage or ultrasonic internal inspection survey may be utilized as an alternative to
  pressure testing where leak history and operating experience do not indicate leaks caused by longitudinal
  cracks or seam failures.
\5\ Pressure tests utilizing a hydrocarbon liquid may be conducted, but only with a liquid which does not
  vaporize rapidly.

    Using LOCATION, PRODUCT, VOLUME, and FAILURE HISTORY ``Indicators'' 
from Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively, the overall risk classification 
of a given pipeline or pipeline segment can be established from Table 2. 
The LOCATION Indicator is the primary factor which determines overall 
risk, with the PRODUCT, VOLUME, and PROBABILITY OF FAILURE Indicators 
used to adjust to a higher or lower overall risk classification per the 
following table.

chronic hazards associated with the product transported. The VOLUME 
Indicator is selected from Table 5 as H, M, or L based on the nominal 
diameter of the pipeline. The Probability of Failure Indicator is 
selected from Table 6.

  Appendix C to Part 195--Guidance for Implementation of an Integrity 
                           Management Program

    This Appendix gives guidance to help an operator implement the 
requirements of the integrity management program rule in Sec. Sec. 
195.450 and 195.452. Guidance is provided on:
    (1) Information an operator may use to identify a high consequence 
area and factors an operator can use to consider the potential impacts 
of a release on an area;
    (2) Risk factors an operator can use to determine an integrity 
assessment schedule;
    (3) Safety risk indicator tables for leak history, volume or line 
size, age of pipeline, and product transported, an operator may use to 
determine if a pipeline segment falls into a high, medium or low risk 
category;
    (4) Types of internal inspection tools an operator could use to find 
pipeline anomalies;
    (5) Measures an operator could use to measure an integrity 
management program's performance; and
    (6) Types of records an operator will have to maintain.
    (7) Types of conditions that an integrity assessment may identify 
that an operator should include in its required schedule for evaluation 
and remediation.
    I. Identifying a high consequence area and factors for considering a 
pipeline segment's potential impact on a high consequence area.
    A. The rule defines a High Consequence Area as a high population 
area, an other populated area, an unusually sensitive area, or a 
commercially navigable waterway. The Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 
will map these areas on the National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS). An 
operator, member of the public, or other government agency may view and 
download the data from the NPMS home page http://www.npms.rspa.dot.gov. 
OPS will maintain the NPMS and update it periodically. However, it is an 
operator's responsibility to ensure that it has identified all high 
consequence areas that could be affected by a pipeline segment. An 
operator is also responsible for periodically evaluating its pipeline 
segments to look for population or environmental changes that may have 
occurred around the pipeline and to keep its program current with this 
information. (Refer to Sec. 195.452(d)(3).) For more information to 
help in identifying high consequence areas, an operator may refer to:
    (1) Digital Data on populated areas available on U.S. Census Bureau 
maps.
    (2) Geographic Database on the commercial navigable waterways 
available on http://www.bts.gov/gis/ntatlas/networks.html.
    (3) The Bureau of Transportation Statistics database that includes 
commercially navigable waterways and non-commercially navigable 
waterways. The database can be downloaded from the BTS website at http:/
/www.bts.gov/gis/ntatlas/networks.html.
    B. The rule requires an operator to include a process in its program 
for identifying which pipeline segments could affect a high consequence 
area and to take measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a 
pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. (See 
Sec. Sec. 195.452 (f) and (i).) Thus, an operator will need to consider 
how each pipeline segment could affect a high consequence area. The 
primary source for the listed risk factors is a US DOT study on 
instrumented Internal Inspection devices (November 1992). Other sources 
include the National Transportation Safety Board, the Environmental 
Protection Agency and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety 
Standards Committee. The following list provides guidance to an operator 
on both the mandatory and additional factors:
    (1) Terrain surrounding the pipeline. An operator should consider 
the contour of the land profile and if it could allow the liquid from a 
release to enter a high consequence area. An operator can get this 
information from topographical maps such as U.S. Geological Survey 
quadrangle maps.
    (2) Drainage systems such as small streams and other smaller 
waterways that could serve as a conduit to a high consequence area.
    (3) Crossing of farm tile fields. An operator should consider the 
possibility of a spillage in the field following the drain tile into a 
waterway.

[[Page 210]]

    (4) Crossing of roadways with ditches along the side. The ditches 
could carry a spillage to a waterway.
    (5) The nature and characteristics of the product the pipeline is 
transporting (refined products, crude oils, highly volatile liquids, 
etc.) Highly volatile liquids becomes gaseous when exposed to the 
atmosphere. A spillage could create a vapor cloud that could settle into 
the lower elevation of the ground profile.
    (6) Physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable 
suspension bridge. An operator should look for stress indicators on the 
pipeline (strained supports, inadequate support at towers), atmospheric 
corrosion, vandalism, and other obvious signs of improper maintenance.
    (7) Operating conditions of the pipeline (pressure, flow rate, 
etc.). Exposure of the pipeline to an operating pressure exceeding the 
established maximum operating pressure.
    (8) The hydraulic gradient of the pipeline.
    (9) The diameter of the pipeline, the potential release volume, and 
the distance between the isolation points.
    (10) Potential physical pathways between the pipeline and the high 
consequence area.
    (11) Response capability (time to respond, nature of response).
    (12) Potential natural forces inherent in the area (flood zones, 
earthquakes, subsidence areas, etc.)
    II. Risk factors for establishing frequency of assessment.
    A. By assigning weights or values to the risk factors, and using the 
risk indicator tables, an operator can determine the priority for 
assessing pipeline segments, beginning with those segments that are of 
highest risk, that have not previously been assessed. This list provides 
some guidance on some of the risk factors to consider (see Sec. 
195.452(e)). An operator should also develop factors specific to each 
pipeline segment it is assessing, including:
    (1) Populated areas, unusually sensitive environmental areas, 
National Fish Hatcheries, commercially navigable waters, areas where 
people congregate.
    (2) Results from previous testing/inspection. (See Sec. 
195.452(h).)
    (3) Leak History. (See leak history risk table.)
    (4) Known corrosion or condition of pipeline. (See Sec. 
195.452(g).)
    (5) Cathodic protection history.
    (6) Type and quality of pipe coating (disbonded coating results in 
corrosion).
    (7) Age of pipe (older pipe shows more corrosion--may be uncoated or 
have an ineffective coating) and type of pipe seam. (See Age of Pipe 
risk table.)
    (8) Product transported (highly volatile, highly flammable and toxic 
liquids present a greater threat for both people and the environment) 
(see Product transported risk table.)
    (9) Pipe wall thickness (thicker walls give a better safety margin)
    (10) Size of pipe (higher volume release if the pipe ruptures).
    (11) Location related to potential ground movement (e.g., seismic 
faults, rock quarries, and coal mines); climatic (permafrost causes 
settlement--Alaska); geologic (landslides or subsidence).
    (12) Security of throughput (effects on customers if there is 
failure requiring shutdown).
    (13) Time since the last internal inspection/pressure testing.
    (14) With respect to previously discovered defects/anomalies, the 
type, growth rate, and size.
    (15) Operating stress levels in the pipeline.
    (16) Location of the pipeline segment as it relates to the ability 
of the operator to detect and respond to a leak. (e.g., pipelines deep 
underground, or in locations that make leak detection difficult without 
specific sectional monitoring and/or significantly impede access for 
spill response or any other purpose).
    (17) Physical support of the segment such as by a cable suspension 
bridge.
    (18) Non-standard or other than recognized industry practice on 
pipeline installation (e.g., horizontal directional drilling).

    B. Example: This example illustrates a hypothetical model used to 
establish an integrity assessment schedule for a hypothetical pipeline 
segment. After we determine the risk factors applicable to the pipeline 
segment, we then assign values or numbers to each factor, such as, high 
(5), moderate (3), or low (1). We can determine an overall risk 
classification (A, B, C) for the segment using the risk tables and a 
sliding scale (values 5 to 1) for risk factors for which tables are not 
provided. We would classify a segment as C if it fell above \2/3\ of 
maximum value (highest overall risk value for any one segment when 
compared with other segments of a pipeline), a segment as B if it fell 
between \1/3\ to \2/3\ of maximum value, and the remaining segments as 
A.
    i. For the baseline assessment schedule, we would plan to assess 50% 
of all pipeline segments covered by the rule, beginning with the highest 
risk segments, within the first 3\1/2\ years and the remaining segments 
within the seven-year period. For the continuing integrity assessments, 
we would plan to assess the C segments within the first two (2) years of 
the schedule, the segments classified as moderate risk no later than 
year three or four and the remaining lowest risk segments no later than 
year five (5).
    ii. For our hypothetical pipeline segment, we have chosen the 
following risk factors

[[Page 211]]

and obtained risk factor values from the appropriate table. The values 
assigned to the risk factors are for illustration only.

Age of pipeline: assume 30 years old (refer to ``Age of Pipeline'' risk 
table)--
Risk Value=5
Pressure tested: tested once during construction--
Risk Value=5
Coated: (yes/no)--yes
Coating Condition: Recent excavation of suspected areas showed holidays 
in coating (potential corrosion risk)--
Risk Value=5
Cathodically Protected: (yes/no)--yes--Risk Value=1
Date cathodic protection installed: five years after pipeline was 
constructed (Cathodic protection installed within one year of the 
pipeline's construction is generally considered low risk.)--Risk Value=3
Close interval survey: (yes/no)--no--Risk Value =5
Internal Inspection tool used: (yes/no)--yes. Date of pig run? In last 
five years--Risk Value=1
Anomalies found: (yes/no)--yes, but do not pose an immediate safety risk 
or environmental hazard--Risk Value=3
Leak History: yes, one spill in last 10 years. (refer to ``Leak 
History'' risk table)--Risk Value=2
Product transported: Diesel fuel. Product low risk. (refer to 
``Product'' risk table)--Risk Value=1
Pipe size: 16 inches. Size presents moderate risk (refer to ``Line 
Size'' risk table)--Risk Value=3
    iii. Overall risk value for this hypothetical segment of pipe is 34. 
Assume we have two other pipeline segments for which we conduct similar 
risk rankings. The second pipeline segment has an overall risk value of 
20, and the third segment, 11. For the baseline assessment we would 
establish a schedule where we assess the first segment (highest risk 
segment) within two years, the second segment within five years and the 
third segment within seven years. Similarly, for the continuing 
integrity assessment, we could establish an assessment schedule where we 
assess the highest risk segment no later than the second year, the 
second segment no later than the third year, and the third segment no 
later than the fifth year.
    III. Safety risk indicator tables for leak history, volume or line 
size, age of pipeline, and product transported.

  National Fire Protection Association health factors may be used for
  rating acute hazards.

    IV. Types of internal inspection tools to use.
    An operator should consider at least two types of internal 
inspection tools for the integrity assessment from the following list. 
The type of tool or tools an operator selects will depend on the results 
from previous internal inspection runs, information analysis and risk 
factors specific to the pipeline segment:
    (1) Geometry Internal inspection tools for detecting changes to 
ovality, e.g., bends, dents, buckles or wrinkles, due to construction 
flaws or soil movement, or other outside force damage;
    (2) Metal Loss Tools (Ultrasonic and Magnetic Flux Leakage) for 
determining pipe

[[Page 212]]

wall anomalies, e.g., wall loss due to corrosion.
    (3) Crack Detection Tools for detecting cracks and crack-like 
features, e.g., stress corrosion cracking (SCC), fatigue cracks, narrow 
axial corrosion, toe cracks, hook cracks, etc.
    V. Methods to measure performance.
    A. General. (1) This guidance is to help an operator establish 
measures to evaluate the effectiveness of its integrity management 
program. The performance measures required will depend on the details of 
each integrity management program and will be based on an understanding 
and analysis of the failure mechanisms or threats to integrity of each 
pipeline segment.
    (2) An operator should select a set of measurements to judge how 
well its program is performing. An operator's objectives for its program 
are to ensure public safety, prevent or minimize leaks and spills and 
prevent property and environmental damage. A typical integrity 
management program will be an ongoing program and it may contain many 
elements. Therefore, several performance measure are likely to be needed 
to measure the effectiveness of an ongoing program.
    B. Performance measures. These measures show how a program to 
control risk on pipeline segments that could affect a high consequence 
area is progressing under the integrity management requirements. 
Performance measures generally fall into three categories:
    (1) Selected Activity Measures--Measures that monitor the 
surveillance and preventive activities the operator has implemented. 
These measure indicate how well an operator is implementing the various 
elements of its integrity management program.
    (2) Deterioration Measures--Operation and maintenance trends that 
indicate when the integrity of the system is weakening despite 
preventive measures. This category of performance measure may indicate 
that the system condition is deteriorating despite well executed 
preventive activities.
    (3) Failure Measures--Leak History, incident response, product loss, 
etc. These measures will indicate progress towards fewer spills and less 
damage.
    C. Internal vs. External Comparisons. These comparisons show how a 
pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence area is 
progressing in comparison to the operator's other pipeline segments that 
are not covered by the integrity management requirements and how that 
pipeline segment compares to other operators' pipeline segments.
    (1) Internal--Comparing data from the pipeline segment that could 
affect the high consequence area with data from pipeline segments in 
other areas of the system may indicate the effects from the attention 
given to the high consequence area.
    (2) External--Comparing data external to the pipeline segment (e.g., 
OPS incident data) may provide measures on the frequency and size of 
leaks in relation to other companies.
    D. Examples. Some examples of performance measures an operator could 
use include--
    (1) A performance measurement goal to reduce the total volume from 
unintended releases by -% (percent to be determined by operator) with an 
ultimate goal of zero.
    (2) A performance measurement goal to reduce the total number of 
unintended releases (based on a threshold of 5 gallons) by -----% 
(percent to be determined by operator) with an ultimate goal of zero.
    (3) A performance measurement goal to document the percentage of 
integrity management activities completed during the calendar year.
    (4) A performance measurement goal to track and evaluate the 
effectiveness of the operator's community outreach activities.
    (5) A narrative description of pipeline system integrity, including 
a summary of performance improvements, both qualitative and 
quantitative, to an operator's integrity management program prepared 
periodically.
    (6) A performance measure based on internal audits of the operator's 
pipeline system per 49 CFR Part 195.
    (7) A performance measure based on external audits of the operator's 
pipeline system per 49 CFR Part 195.
    (8) A performance measure based on operational events (for example: 
relief occurrences, unplanned valve closure, SCADA outages, etc.) that 
have the potential to adversely affect pipeline integrity.
    (9) A performance measure to demonstrate that the operator's 
integrity management program reduces risk over time with a focus on high 
risk items.
    (10) A performance measure to demonstrate that the operator's 
integrity management program for pipeline stations and terminals reduces 
risk over time with a focus on high risk items.
    VI. Examples of types of records an operator must maintain.
    The rule requires an operator to maintain certain records. (See 
Sec. 195.452(l)). This section provides examples of some records that 
an operator would have to maintain for inspection to comply with the 
requirement. This is not an exhaustive list.
    (1) a process for identifying which pipelines could affect a high 
consequence area and a document identifying all pipeline segments that 
could affect a high consequence area;
    (2) a plan for baseline assessment of the line pipe that includes 
each required plan element;
    (3) modifications to the baseline plan and reasons for the 
modification;

[[Page 213]]

    (4) use of and support for an alternative practice;
    (5) a framework addressing each required element of the integrity 
management program, updates and changes to the initial framework and 
eventual program;
    (6) a process for identifying a new high consequence area and 
incorporating it into the baseline plan, particularly, a process for 
identifying population changes around a pipeline segment;
    (7) an explanation of methods selected to assess the integrity of 
line pipe;
    (8) a process for review of integrity assessment results and data 
analysis by a person qualified to evaluate the results and data;
    (9) the process and risk factors for determining the baseline 
assessment interval;
    (10) results of the baseline integrity assessment;
    (11) the process used for continual evaluation, and risk factors 
used for determining the frequency of evaluation;
    (12) process for integrating and analyzing information about the 
integrity of a pipeline, information and data used for the information 
analysis;
    (13) results of the information analyses and periodic evaluations;
    (14) the process and risk factors for establishing continual re-
assessment intervals;
    (15) justification to support any variance from the required re-
assessment intervals;
    (16) integrity assessment results and anomalies found, process for 
evaluating and remediating anomalies, criteria for remedial actions and 
actions taken to evaluate and remediate the anomalies;
    (17) other remedial actions planned or taken;
    (18) schedule for evaluation and remediation of anomalies, 
justification to support deviation from required remediation times;
    (19) risk analysis used to identify additional preventive or 
mitigative measures, records of preventive and mitigative actions 
planned or taken;
    (20) criteria for determining EFRD installation;
    (21) criteria for evaluating and modifying leak detection 
capability;
    (22) methods used to measure the program's effectiveness.
    VII. Conditions that may impair a pipeline's integrity.
    Section 195.452(h) requires an operator to evaluate and remediate 
all pipeline integrity issues raised by the integrity assessment or 
information analysis. An operator must develop a schedule that 
prioritizes conditions discovered on the pipeline for evaluation and 
remediation. The following are some examples of conditions that an 
operator should schedule for evaluation and remediation.
    A. Any change since the previous assessment.
    B. Mechanical damage that is located on the top side of the pipe.
    C. An anomaly abrupt in nature.
    D. An anomaly longitudinal in orientation.
    E. An anomaly over a large area.
    F. An anomaly located in or near a casing, a crossing of another 
pipeline, or an area with suspect cathodic protection.

Sec. 198.11  Grant authority.

    The pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.) authorize the 
Administrator to pay out funds appropriated or otherwise make available 
up to 50 percent of the cost of the personnel, equipment, and activities 
reasonably required for each state agency to carry out a safety program 
for intrastate pipeline facilities under a certification or agreement 
with the Administrator or to act as an agent of the Administrator with 
respect to interstate pipeline facilities.

<R05>
Sec. 198.13  Grant allocation formula.

    (a) Beginning in calendar year 1993, the Administrator places 
increasing emphasis on program performance in allocating state agency 
funds under Sec. 198.11. The maximum percent of each state agency 
allocation that is based on performance follows: 1993--75 percent; 1994 
and subsequent years--100 percent.
    (b) A state's annual grant allocation is based on maximum of 100 
performance points derived as follows:
    (1) Fifty points based on information provided in the state's annual 
certification/agreement attachments which document its activities for 
the past year; and
    (2) Fifty points based on the annual state program evaluation.
    (c) The Administrator assigns weights to various performance factors 
reflecting program compliance, safety priorities, and national concerns 
identified by the Administrator and communicated to each State agency. 
At a minimum, the Administrator considers the following performance 
factors in allocating funds:
    (1) Adequacy of state operating practices;
    (2) Quality of state inspections, investigations, and enforcement/
compliance actions;
    (3) Adequacy of state recordkeeping;
    (4) Extent of state safety regulatory jurisdiction over pipeline 
facilities;
    (5) Qualifications of state inspectors;
    (6) Number of state inspection person-days;
    (7) State adoption of applicable federal pipeline safety standards; 
and
    (8) Any other factor the Administrator deems necessary to measure 
performance.
    (d) Notwithstanding these performance factors, the Administrator 
may,

[[Page 215]]

in 1993 and subsequent years, continue funding any state at the 1991 
level, provided its request is at the 1991 level or higher and 
appropriated funds are at the 1991 level or higher.
    (e) The Administrator notifies each state agency in writing of the 
specific performance factors to be used and the weights to be assigned 
to each factor at least 9 months prior to allocating funds. Prior to 
notification, PHMSA seeks state agency comments on any proposed changes 
to the allocation formula.
    (f) Grants are limited to the appropriated funds available. If total 
state agency requests for grants exceed the funds available, the 
Administrator prorates each state agency's allocation.

Sec. 198.35  Grants conditioned on adoption of one-call damage prevention 
program.

    In allocating grants to State agencies under the pipeline safety 
laws, (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), the Secretary considers whether a State 
has adopted or is seeking to adopt a one-call damage prevention program 
in accordance with Sec. 198.37. If a State has not adopted or is not 
seeking to adopt such program, the State agency may not receive the full 
reimbursement to which it would otherwise be entitled.

<R05>
Sec. 198.37  State one-call damage prevention program.

    A State must adopt a one-call damage prevention program that 
requires each of the following at a minimum:
    (a) Each area of the State that contains underground pipeline 
facilities must be covered by a one-call notification system.
    (b) Each one-call notification system must be operated in accordance 
with Sec. 198.39.
    (c) Excavators must be required to notify the operational center of 
the one-call notification system that covers the area of each intended 
excavation activity and provide the following information:
    (1) Name of the person notifying the system.
    (2) Name, address and telephone number of the excavator.
    (3) Specific location, starting date, and description of the 
intended excavation activity.

However, an excavator must be allowed to begin an excavation activity in 
an emergency but, in doing so, required to notify the operational center 
at the earliest practicable moment.
    (d) The State must determine whether telephonic and other 
communications to the operational center of a one-call notification 
system under paragraph (c) of this section are to be toll free or not.
    (e) Except with respect to interstate transmission facilities as 
defined in the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), operators 
of underground pipeline facilities must be required to participate in 
the one-call notification systems that cover the areas of the State in 
which those pipeline facilities are located.
    (f) Operators of underground pipeline facilities participating in 
the one-call notification systems must be required to respond in the 
manner prescribed by Sec. 192.614 (b)(4) through (b)(6) of this chapter 
to notices of intended excavation activity received from the operational 
center of a one-call notification system.
    (g) Persons who operate one-call notification systems or operators 
of underground pipeline facilities participating or required to 
participate in the one-call notification systems must be required to 
notify the public and known excavators in the manner prescribed by Sec. 
192.614 (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this chapter of the availability and use

[[Page 216]]

of one-call notification systems to locate underground pipeline 
facilities. However, this paragraph does not apply to persons (including 
operator's master meters) whose primary activity does not include the 
production, transportation or marketing of gas or hazardous liquids.
    (h) Operators of underground pipeline facilities (other than 
operators of interstate transmission facilities as defined in the 
pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.), and interstate pipelines 
as defined in Sec. 195.2 of this chapter), excavators and persons who 
operate one-call notification systems who violate the applicable 
requirements of this subpart must be subject to civil penalties and 
injunctive relief that are substantially the same as are provided under 
the pipeline safety laws (49 U.S.C. 60101 et seq.).

<R05>
Sec. 199.105  Drug tests required.

    Each operator shall conduct the following drug tests for the 
presence of a prohibited drug:
    (a) Pre-employment testing. No operator may hire or contract for the 
use of any person as an employee unless that person passes a drug test 
or is covered by an anti-drug program that conforms to the requirements 
of this part.
    (b) Post-accident testing. As soon as possible but no later than 32 
hours after an accident, an operator shall drug test each employee whose 
performance either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely 
discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. An operator may 
decide not to test under this paragraph but such a decision must be 
based on the best information available immediately after the accident 
that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the 
accident or that, because of the time between that performance and the 
accident, it is not likely that a drug test would reveal whether the 
performance was affected by drug use.
    (c) Random testing. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) 
through (4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for 
random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees.
    (2) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported 
positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this 
determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this 
subpart. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator 
considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain 
additional information or reports from operators, and may make 
appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. 
Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the 
minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered 
employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug 
testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year 
following publication.
    (3) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of 
all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data 
received under the reporting requirements of Sec. 199.119 for two 
consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is 
less than 1.0 percent.
    (4) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing 
is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of 
Sec. 199.119 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive 
rate is equal to or

[[Page 220]]

greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum 
annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all 
covered employees.
    (5) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made 
by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a 
computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' 
Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other 
comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each 
covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time 
selections are made.
    (6) The operator shall randomly select a sufficient number of 
covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an 
annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random 
drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the operator conducts 
random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be 
tested may be calculated for each individual operator or may be based on 
the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are 
subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage 
rate under this subpart or any DOT drug testing rule.
    (7) Each operator shall ensure that random drug tests conducted 
under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates for administering 
random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.
    (8) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing 
under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same 
operator, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency 
regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.
    (9) If an operator is required to conduct random drug testing under 
the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the operator may--
    (i) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool 
containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same 
required rate; or
    (ii) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest 
percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to 
which the operator is subject.
    (d) Testing based on reasonable cause. Each operator shall drug test 
each employee when there is reasonable cause to believe the employee is 
using a prohibited drug. The decision to test must be based on a 
reasonable and articulable belief that the employee is using a 
prohibited drug on the basis of specific, contemporaneous physical, 
behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drug use. At least two 
of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of 
the possible symptoms of drug use, shall substantiate and concur in the 
decision to test an employee. The concurrence between the two 
supervisors may be by telephone. However, in the case of operators with 
50 or fewer employees subject to testing under this part, only one 
supervisor of the employee trained in detecting possible drug use 
symptoms shall substantiate the decision to test.
    (e) Return-to-duty testing. A covered employee who refuses to take 
or has a positive drug test may not return to duty in the covered 
function until the covered employee has complied with applicable 
provisions of DOT Procedures concerning substance abuse professionals 
and the return-to-duty process.
    (f) Follow-up testing. A covered employee who refuses to take or has 
a positive drug test shall be subject to unannounced follow-up drug 
tests administered by the operator following the covered employee's 
return to duty. The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall 
be determined by a substance abuse professional, but shall consist of at 
least six tests in the first 12 months following the covered employee's 
return to duty. In addition, follow-up testing may include testing for 
alcohol as directed by the substance abuse professional, to be performed 
in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 
months from the date of the covered employee's return to duty. The 
substance abuse professional may terminate the requirement for follow-up 
testing at any time after the first six

[[Page 221]]

tests have been administered, if the substance abuse professional 
determines that such testing is no longer necessary.

Sec. 199.107  Drug testing laboratory.

    (a) Each operator shall use for the drug testing required by this 
part only drug testing laboratories certified by the Department of 
Health and Human Services under the DOT Procedures.
    (b) The drug testing laboratory must permit--
    (1) Inspections by the operator before the laboratory is awarded a 
testing contract; and
    (2) Unannounced inspections, including examination of records, at 
any time, by the operator, the Administrator, and if the operator is 
subject to state agency jurisdiction, a representative of that state 
agency.

<R05>
Sec. 199.109  Review of drug testing results.

    (a) MRO appointment. Each operator shall designate or appoint a 
medical review officer (MRO). If an operator does not have a qualified 
individual on staff to serve as MRO, the operator may contract for the 
provision of MRO services as part of its anti-drug program.
    (b) MRO qualifications. Each MRO must be a licensed physician who 
has the qualifications required by DOT Procedures.
    (c) MRO duties. The MRO must perform functions for the operator as 
required by DOT Procedures.
    (d) MRO reports. The MRO must report all drug test results to the 
operator in accordance with DOT Procedures.
    (e) Evaluation and rehabilitation may be provided by the operator, 
by a substance abuse professional under contract with the operator, or 
by a substance abuse professional not affiliated with the operator. The 
choice of substance abuse professional and assignment of costs shall be 
made in accordance with the operator/employee agreements and operator/
employee policies.
    (f) The operator shall ensure that a substance abuse professional, 
who determines that a covered employee requires assistance in resolving 
problems with drug abuse, does not refer the covered employee to the 
substance abuse professional's private practice or to a person or 
organization from which the substance abuse professional receives 
remuneration or in which the substance abuse professional has a 
financial interest. This paragraph does not prohibit a substance abuse 
professional from referring a covered employee for assistance provided 
through:
    (1) A public agency, such as a State, county, or municipality;
    (2) The operator or a person under contract to provide treatment for 
drug problems on behalf of the operator;
    (3) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment under 
the employee's health insurance program; or
    (4) The sole source of therapeutically appropriate treatment 
reasonably accessible to the employee.

<R05>
Sec. 199.111  Retention of samples and additional testing.

    (a) Samples that yield positive results on confirmation must be 
retained by the laboratory in properly secured, long-term, frozen 
storage for at least 365 days as required by the DOT Procedures. Within 
this 365-day period, the employee or the employee's representative, the 
operator, the Administrator, or, if the operator is subject to the 
jurisdiction of a state agency, the state agency may request that the 
laboratory retain the sample for an additional period. If, within the 
365-day period, the laboratory has not received a proper written request 
to retain the sample for a further reasonable period specified in the 
request, the sample may be discarded following the end of the 365-day 
period.

[[Page 222]]

    (b) If the medical review officer (MRO) determines there is no 
legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive test result 
other than the unauthorized use of a prohibited drug, and if timely 
additional testing is requested by the employee according to DOT 
Procedures, the split specimen must be tested. The employee may specify 
testing by the original laboratory or by a second laboratory that is 
certified by the Department of Health and Human Services. The operator 
may require the employee to pay in advance the cost of shipment (if any) 
and reanalysis of the sample, but the employee must be reimbursed for 
such expense if the additional test is negative.
    (c) If the employee specifies testing by a second laboratory, the 
original laboratory must follow approved chain-of-custody procedures in 
transferring a portion of the sample.
    (d) Since some analytes may deteriorate during storage, detected 
levels of the drug below the detection limits established in the DOT 
Procedures, but equal to or greater than the established sensitivity of 
the assay, must, as technically appropriate, be reported and considered 
corroborative of the original positive results.

Sec. 199.113  Employee assistance program.

    (a) Each operator shall provide an employee assistance program (EAP) 
for its employees and supervisory personnel who will determine whether 
an employee must be drug tested based on reasonable cause. The operator 
may establish the EAP as a part of its internal personnel services or 
the operator may contract with an entity that provides EAP services. 
Each EAP must include education and training on drug use. At the 
discretion of the operator, the EAP may include an opportunity for 
employee rehabilitation.
    (b) Education under each EAP must include at least the following 
elements: display and distribution of informational material; display 
and distribution of a community service hot-line telephone number for 
employee assistance; and display and distribution of the employer's 
policy regarding the use of prohibited drugs.
    (c) Training under each EAP for supervisory personnel who will 
determine whether an employee must be drug tested based on reasonable 
cause must include one 60-minute period of training on the specific, 
contemporaneous physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of 
probable drug use.

Sec. 199.115  Contractor employees.

    With respect to those employees who are contractors or employed by a 
contractor, an operator may provide by contract that the drug testing, 
education, and training required by this part be carried out by the 
contractor provided:
    (a) The operator remains responsible for ensuring that the 
requirements of this part are complied with; and
    (b) The contractor allows access to property and records by the 
operator, the Administrator, and if the operator is subject to the 
jurisdiction of a state agency, a representative of the state agency for 
the purpose of monitoring the operator's compliance with the 
requirements of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 199.117  Recordkeeping.

    (a) Each operator shall keep the following records for the periods 
specified and permit access to the records as provided by paragraph (b) 
of this section:
    (1) Records that demonstrate the collection process conforms to this 
part must be kept for at least 3 years.
    (2) Records of employee drug test that indicate a verified positive 
result, records that demonstrate compliance with the recommendations of 
a substance abuse professional, and MIS annual report data shall be 
maintained for a minimum of five years.
    (3) Records of employee drug test results that show employees passed 
a drug test must be kept for at least 1 year.
    (4) Records confirming that supervisors and employees have been 
trained

[[Page 223]]

as required by this part must be kept for at least 3 years.
    (b) Information regarding an individual's drug testing results or 
rehabilitation must be released upon the written consent of the 
individual and as provided by DOT Procedures. Statistical data related 
to drug testing and rehabilitation that is not name-specific and 
training records must be made available to the Administrator or the 
representative of a state agency upon request.

<R05>
Sec. 199.119  Reporting of anti-drug testing results.

    (a) Each large operator (having more than 50 covered employees) 
shall submit an annual MIS report to PHMSA of its anti-drug testing 
using the Management Information System (MIS) form and instructions as 
required by 49 CFR part 40 (at Sec. 40.25 and appendix H to Part 40), 
not later than March 15 of each year for the prior calendar year 
(January 1 through December 31). The Administrator shall require by 
written notice that small operators (50 or fewer covered employees) not 
otherwise required to submit annual MIS reports to prepare and submit 
such reports to PHMSA.
    (b) Each report required under this section shall be submitted to 
the Office of Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Room 7128, 400 
Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590.
    (c) To calculate the total number of covered employees eligible for 
random testing throughout the year, as an operator, you must add the 
total number of covered employees eligible for testing during each 
random testing period for the year and divide that total by the number 
of random testing periods. Covered employees, and only covered 
employees, are to be in an employer's random testing pool, and all 
covered employees must be in the random pool. If you are an employer 
conducting random testing more often than once per month (e.g., you 
select daily, weekly, bi-weekly), you do not need to compute this total 
number of covered employees rate more than on a once per month basis.
    (d) As an employer, you may use a service agent (e.g., C/TPA) to 
perform random selections for you; and your covered employees may be 
part of a larger random testing pool of covered employees. However, you 
must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate 
percentage established for your industry and that only covered employees 
are in the random testing pool.
    (e) Each operator that has a covered employee who performs multi-DOT 
agency functions (e.g., an employee performs pipeline maintenance duties 
and drives a commercial motor vehicle), count the employee only on the 
MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or she is randomly tested. 
Normally, this will be the DOT agency under which the employee performs 
more than 50% of his or her duties. Operators may have to explain the 
testing data for these employees in the event of a DOT agency inspection 
or audit.
    (f) A service agent (e.g., Consortia/Third Party Administrator as 
defined in 49 CFR part 40) may prepare the MIS report on behalf of an 
operator. However, each report shall be certified by the operator's 
anti-drug manager or designated representative for accuracy and 
completeness.

Sec. 199.209  Other requirements imposed by operators.

    (a) Except as expressly provided in this subpart, nothing in this 
subpart shall be construed to affect the authority of operators, or the 
rights of employees, with respect to the use or possession of alcohol, 
including authority and rights with respect to alcohol testing and 
rehabilitation.
    (b) Operators may, but are not required to, conduct pre-employment 
alcohol testing under this subpart. Each operator that conducts pre-
employment alcohol testing must--
    (1) Conduct a pre-employment alcohol test before the first 
performance of covered functions by every covered employee (whether a 
new employee or someone who has transferred to a position involving the 
performance of covered functions);
    (2) Treat all covered employees the same for the purpose of pre-
employment alcohol testing (i.e., you must not test some covered 
employees and not others);
    (3) Conduct the pre-employment tests after making a contingent offer 
of employment or transfer, subject to the employee passing the pre-
employment alcohol test;
    (4) Conduct all pre-employment alcohol tests using the alcohol 
testing procedures in DOT Procedures; and
    (5) Not allow any covered employee to begin performing covered 
functions unless the result of the employee's test indicates an alcohol 
concentration of less than 0.04.

<R05>
Sec. 199.211  Requirement for notice.

    Before performing an alcohol test under this subpart, each operator 
shall notify a covered employee that the alcohol test is required by 
this subpart. No operator shall falsely represent that a test is 
administered under this subpart.


<R05>
Sec. 199.213  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 199.215  Alcohol concentration.

    Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee from reporting for 
duty or remaining on duty requiring the performance of covered functions 
while having an alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater. No operator 
having actual knowledge that a covered employee has an alcohol 
concentration of 0.04 or greater shall permit the employee to perform or 
continue to perform covered functions.


<R05>
Sec. 199.217  On-duty use.

    Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee from using alcohol 
while performing covered functions. No operator having actual knowledge 
that a covered employee is using alcohol while performing covered 
functions shall permit the employee to perform or continue to perform 
covered functions.


<R05>
Sec. 199.219  Pre-duty use.

    Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee from using alcohol 
within four hours prior to performing covered functions, or, if an 
employee is called to duty to respond to an emergency, within the time 
period after the employee has been notified to report for duty. No 
operator having actual knowledge that a covered employee has used 
alcohol within four hours prior to performing covered functions or 
within the time period after the employee has been notified to report 
for duty shall permit that covered employee to perform or continue to 
perform covered functions.

[[Page 225]]


<R05>
Sec. 199.221  Use following an accident.

    Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee who has actual 
knowledge of an accident in which his or her performance of covered 
functions has not been discounted by the operator as a contributing 
factor to the accident from using alcohol for eight hours following the 
accident, unless he or she has been given a post-accident test under 
Sec. 199.225(a), or the operator has determined that the employee's 
performance could not have contributed to the accident.


<R05>
Sec. 199.223  Refusal to submit to a required alcohol test.

    Each operator shall require a covered employee to submit to a post-
accident alcohol test required under Sec. 199.225(a), a reasonable 
suspicion alcohol test required under Sec. 199.225(b), or a follow-up 
alcohol test required under Sec. 199.225(d). No operator shall permit 
an employee who refuses to submit to such a test to perform or continue 
to perform covered functions.


<R05>
Sec. 199.225  Alcohol tests required.

    Each operator shall conduct the following types of alcohol tests for 
the presence of alcohol:
    (a) Post-accident. (1) As soon as practicable following an accident, 
each operator shall test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if 
that employee's performance of a covered function either contributed to 
the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor 
to the accident. The decision not to administer a test under this 
section shall be based on the operator's determination, using the best 
available information at the time of the determination, that the covered 
employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident.
    (2)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
2 hours following the accident, the operator shall prepare and maintain 
on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly 
administered. If a test required by paragraph (a) is not administered 
within 8 hours following the accident, the operator shall cease attempts 
to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons 
for not administering the test.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (3) A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing who 
fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying 
the operator or operator representative of his/her location if he/she 
leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, may 
be deemed by the operator to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing 
in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary 
medical attention for injured people following an accident or to 
prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for 
the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident 
or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.
    (b) Reasonable suspicion testing. (1) Each operator shall require a 
covered employee to submit to an alcohol test when the operator has 
reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the 
prohibitions in this subpart.
    (2) The operator's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to 
require the covered employee to undergo an alcohol test shall be based 
on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the 
appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the employee. The 
required observations shall be made by a supervisor who is trained in 
detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse. The supervisor who makes the 
determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall not conduct the 
breath alcohol test on that employee.
    (3) Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the 
observations required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section are made 
during, just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that 
the employee is required to be in compliance with this subpart. A 
covered employee may be directed by the operator to undergo reasonable 
suspicion testing for alcohol only while the employee is performing 
covered functions; just before the employee is to perform covered 
functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing covered 
functions.

[[Page 226]]

    (4)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 
2 hours following the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, the operator shall prepare and maintain on file a record 
stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test 
required by this section is not administered within 8 hours following 
the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the operator 
shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in 
the record the reasons for not administering the test. Records shall be 
submitted to PHMSA upon request of the Administrator.
    (ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol 
test under this section, an operator shall not permit a covered employee 
to report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of 
covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or 
impaired by alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance 
indicators of alcohol misuse, nor shall an operator permit the covered 
employee to perform or continue to perform covered functions, until:
    (A) An alcohol test is administered and the employee's alcohol 
concentration measures less than 0.02; or
    (B) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty 
period, but not less than 8 hours following the determination under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there is reasonable suspicion to 
believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions in this subpart.
    (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii), no operator shall 
take any action under this subpart against a covered employee based 
solely on the employee's behavior and appearance in the absence of an 
alcohol test. This does not prohibit an operator with the authority 
independent of this subpart from taking any action otherwise consistent 
with law.
    (c) Return-to-duty testing. Each operator shall ensure that before a 
covered employee returns to duty requiring the performance of a covered 
function after engaging in conduct prohibited by Sec. Sec. 199.215 
through 199.223, the employee shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol 
test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 
0.02.
    (d) Follow-up testing. (1) Following a determination under Sec. 
199.243(b) that a covered employee is in need of assistance in resolving 
problems associated with alcohol misuse, each operator shall ensure that 
the employee is subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol testing as 
directed by a substance abuse professional in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 199.243(c)(2)(ii).
    (2) Follow-up testing shall be conducted when the covered employee 
is performing covered functions; just before the employee is to perform 
covered functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such 
functions.
    (e) Retesting of covered employees with an alcohol concentration of 
0.02 or greater but less than 0.04. Each operator shall retest a covered 
employee to ensure compliance with the provisions of Sec. 199.237, if 
an operator chooses to permit the employee to perform a covered function 
within 8 hours following the administration of an alcohol test 
indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 
0.04.

<R05>
Sec. 199.229  Reporting of alcohol testing results.

    (a) Each large operator (having more than 50 covered employees) 
shall submit an annual MIS report to PHMSA of its alcohol testing 
results using the Management Information System (MIS) form and 
instructions as required by 49 CFR part 40 (at Sec. 40.25 and appendix 
H to part 40), not later than March 15 of each year for the previous 
calendar year (January 1 through December 31). The Administrator may 
require by written notice that small operators (50 or fewer covered 
employees) not otherwise required to submit annual MIS reports to 
prepare and submit such reports to PHMSA.
    (b) Each operator that has a covered employee who performs multi-DOT 
agency functions (e.g., an employee performs pipeline maintenance duties 
and drives a commercial motor vehicle), count the employee only on the 
MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or she is tested. Normally, 
this will be the DOT agency under which the employee performs more than 
50% of his or her duties. Operators may have to explain the testing data 
for these employees in the event of a DOT agency inspection or audit.
    (c) Each report required under this section shall be submitted to 
the Office of Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety 
Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Room 7128, 400 
Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590.
    (d) A service agent (e.g., Consortia/Third Party Administrator as 
defined in part 40) may prepare the MIS report on behalf of an operator. 
However, each report shall be certified by the operator's anti-drug 
manager or designated representative for accuracy and completeness.

covered functions unless the employee has met the requirements of Sec. 
199.243.


<R05>
Sec. 199.237  Other alcohol-related conduct.

    (a) No operator shall permit a covered employee tested under the 
provisions of Sec. 199.225, who is found to have an alcohol 
concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04, to perform or 
continue to perform covered functions, until:
    (1) The employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02 in 
accordance with a test administered under Sec. 199.225(e); or
    (2) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty 
period, but not less than eight hours following administration of the 
test.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, no operator 
shall take any action under this subpart against an employee based 
solely on test results showing an alcohol concentration less than 0.04. 
This does not prohibit an operator with authority

[[Page 229]]

independent of this subpart from taking any action otherwise consistent 
with law.


<R05>
Sec. 199.239  Operator obligation to promulgate a policy on the misuse 
of alcohol.

    (a) General requirements. Each operator shall provide educational 
materials that explain these alcohol misuse requirements and the 
operator's policies and procedures with respect to meeting those 
requirements.

distributed to each covered employee prior to start of alcohol testing 
under this subpart, and to each person subsequently hired for or 
transferred to a covered position.
    (2) Each operator shall provide written notice to representatives of 
employee organizations of the availability of this information.
    (b) Required content. The materials to be made available to covered 
employees shall include detailed discussion of at least the following:
    (1) The identity of the person designated by the operator to answer 
covered employee questions about the materials.
    (2) The categories of employees who are subject to the provisions of 
this subpart.

prohibited by this subpart.
    (5) The circumstances under which a covered employee will be tested 
for alcohol under this subpart.
    (6) The procedures that will be used to test for the presence of 
alcohol, protect the covered employee and the integrity of the breath 
testing process, safeguard the validity of the test results, and ensure 
that those results are attributed to the correct employee.
    (7) The requirement that a covered employee submit to alcohol tests 
administered in accordance with this subpart.
    (8) An explanation of what constitutes a refusal to submit to an 
alcohol test and the attendant consequences.
    (9) The consequences for covered employees found to have violated 
the prohibitions under this subpart, including the requirement that the 
employee be removed immediately from covered functions, and the 
procedures under Sec. 199.243.
    (10) The consequences for covered employees found to have an alcohol 
concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04.
    (11) Information concerning the effects of alcohol misuse on an 
individual's health, work, and personal life; signs and symptoms of an 
alcohol problem (the employee's or a coworker's); and including 
intervening evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse 
of alcohol including intervening when an alcohol problem is suspected, 
confrontation, referral to any available EAP, and/or referral to 
management.
    (c) Optional provisions. The materials supplied to covered employees 
may also include information on additional operator policies with 
respect to the use or possession of alcohol, including any consequences 
for an employee found to have a specified alcohol level, that are based 
on the operator's authority independent of this subpart. Any such 
additional policies or consequences shall be clearly described as being 
based on independent authority.


<R05>
Sec. 199.241  Training for supervisors.

    Each operator shall ensure that persons designated to determine 
whether reasonable suspicion exists to require a covered employee to 
undergo alcohol testing under Sec. 199.225(b) receive at least 60 
minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance 
indicators of probable alcohol misuse.


<R05>
Sec. 199.243  Referral, evaluation, and treatment.

    (a) Each covered employee who has engaged in conduct prohibited by 
Sec. Sec. 199.215 through 199.223 of this subpart

[[Page 230]]

shall be advised of the resources available to the covered employee in 
evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol, 
including the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of substance abuse 
professionals and counseling and treatment programs.
    (b) Each covered employee who engages in conduct prohibited under 
Sec. Sec. 199.215 through 199.223 shall be evaluated by a substance 
abuse professional who shall determine what assistance, if any, the 
employee needs in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse.
    (c)(1) Before a covered employee returns to duty requiring the 
performance of a covered function after engaging in conduct prohibited 
by Sec. Sec. 199.215 through 199.223 of this subpart, the employee 
shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an 
alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.
    (2) In addition, each covered employee identified as needing 
assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse--
    (i) Shall be evaluated by a substance abuse professional to 
determine that the employee has properly followed any rehabilitation 
program prescribed under paragraph (b) of this section, and
    (ii) Shall be subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol tests 
administered by the operator following the employee's return to duty. 
The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall be determined 
by a substance abuse professional, but shall consist of at least six 
tests in the first 12 months following the employee's return to duty. In 
addition, follow-up testing may include testing for drugs, as directed 
by the substance abuse professional, to be performed in accordance with 
49 CFR part 40. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the 
date of the employee's return to duty. The substance abuse professional 
may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after 
the first six tests have been administered, if the substance abuse 
professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.
    (d) Evaluation and rehabilitation may be provided by the operator, 
by a substance abuse professional under contract with the operator, or 
by a substance abuse professional not affiliated with the operator. The 
choice of substance abuse professional and assignment of costs shall be 
made in accordance with the operator/employee agreements and operator/
employee policies.
    (e) The operator shall ensure that a substance abuse professional 
who determines that a covered employee requires assistance in resolving 
problems with alcohol misuse does not refer the employee to the 
substance abuse professional's private practice or to a person or 
organization from which the substance abuse professional receives
