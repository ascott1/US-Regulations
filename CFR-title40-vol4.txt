                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, July 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment 
demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements 
of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for 
so long as the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone 
standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Knox

[[Page 19]]

and Lincoln Counties ozone nonattainment area, these determinations 
shall no longer apply.
    (c) Approval. EPA is approving an exemption request submitted by the 
Maine Department of Environmental Protection on September 7, 1995, for 
the Northern Maine area from the NO<INF>X</INF> requirements contained 
in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. This approval exempts Oxford, 
Franklin, Somerset, Piscataquis, Penobscot, Washington, Aroostook, 
Hancock and Waldo Counties from the requirements to implement controls 
beyond those approved in Sec. 52.1020(c)(41) for major sources of 
nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), nonattainment area new source review 
(NSR) for new sources and modifications that are major for 
NO<INF>X</INF>, and the applicable NO<INF>X</INF>-related requirements 
of the general and transportation conformity provisions.

Sec. 52.1072  Conditional approval.

    (a) The State of Maryland's July 11, 1995 submittal for an enhanced 
motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, and the March 
27, 1996 amendment to the original SIP revision is conditionally 
approved based on certain contingencies. The following conditions listed 
in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(15) of this section must be addressed 
in a revised SIP submission. Along with the conditions listed in 
paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(15) of this section is a separate detailed 
I/M checklist explaining what is required to fully remedy the 
deficiencies found in the proposed notice of conditional approval. This 
checklist is found in the Technical Support Document (TSD), located in 
the docket of this rulemaking, that was prepared in support of the 
proposed conditional I/M rulemaking action for Maryland. By no later 
than one year from September 29, 1997, Maryland must submit a revised 
SIP that meets the following conditions for approvability:
    (1) Fully adopt and submit to EPA as a SIP revision, final 
regulations and documentation of the public hearing process addressing 
Maryland's March 27, 1997 amendment to the SIP pertaining to proposed 
regulatory changes to the VEIP, as a result of the flexibility afforded 
to Maryland from federal and state legislative changes.
    (2) Provide confirmation from the State Attorney General's Office 
clearly stating that Maryland's interpretation of the sunset date of the 
program is no earlier than November 15, 2005, or in the absence of such 
an opinion, submit to EPA new legislative authority allowing for such an 
extended sunset date of the program.
    (3) Submit to EPA a modeling demonstration of the program using the 
appropriate assumptions and methodology (see TSD and the Response to 
Public Comments section of this rule for detailed discussions) 
demonstrating compliance with the I/M performance

[[Page 46]]

standard for the years 2002 and 2005 (excluding the year 1999, as 
recommended by EPA).
    (4) Obtain and/or demonstrate to EPA that adequate funding and tools 
exist for the years 1997 and 1998, including a detailed explanation of 
the number of personnel dedicated to quality assurance, data analysis, 
program administration, and enforcement. In addition, Maryland needs to 
provide budget allotments for equipment resources. EPA notes that an 
update of the budget information is adequate to satisfy this condition.
    (5) Provide an explanation to EPA of how all subject vehicles in the 
program will be identified, which includes an estimate of the number of 
unregistered vehicles operated in the program area. Subsequent to EPA 
issuing guidance, Maryland needs to document how vehicles that are 
routinely operated in the program but not registered in the program area 
are identified.
    (6) Provide to EPA applicable sections of state laws and regulations 
specifically addressing engine switching and testing of vehicles with no 
certified engine configuration. Maryland needs to commit to adopting 
non-invasive purge test procedures when EPA specifications become 
available. In addition, EPA expects Maryland to submit written 
procedures for the gas-cap check and to adopt the non-invasive fuel-fill 
pipe pressure specifications and procedures when EPA issues the final 
technical guidance.
    (7) Submit to EPA written specifications for the gas cap check 
procedures referenced in Maryland's regulations.
    (8) Provide to EPA a description of how Maryland's current practice 
of issuing short term extensions because of economic hardship is 
granted, which reasonably and clearly defines the time frame of the 
extension period.
    (9) Submit to EPA documentation of how Maryland will handle out-of-
state exemptions, employ mechanisms to enforce vehicle transfer 
requirements when owners move into the program area, and cite motorists 
for noncompliance with the registration requirement. Maryland will need 
to clarify its practice on vehicle impoundment when a motorist is cited 
for driving with a suspended registration. In addition, EPA needs 
verification on vehicle exemption triggering elements which allow the 
subject vehicle to by-pass an inspection test. Confirmation by VIN check 
or physical examination of the subject vehicle needs to be included in 
the SIP revision, as a means of ensuring validation of the exemption 
triggering elements.
    (10) Demonstrate to EPA that enforcement program oversight is 
quality controlled and quality assured. Maryland needs to provide a 
procedures document that details the specifics of the implementation of 
the enforcement program oversight including information management 
activities, activities of enforcement involved in monitoring the 
program, and auditing the enforcement. Quality control and assurance 
needs to address penalty structures, periodic auditing and analysis, 
program effectiveness, and in use fleet compliance via parking lot 
surveys and road side pullovers.
    (11) Provide a description to EPA of Maryland's auditing program 
that will include a minimum number of covert vehicles that are used for 
auditing purposes, covert and overt performance audits of inspectors, 
audits of stations and inspectors records, equipment audits, and formal 
training of all state I/M enforcement officials and auditors.
    (12) Submit to EPA documentation regarding the set up of Maryland's 
penalty structure used to ensure the contractor is in compliance with 
State regulations. The penalty schedule must be applied to the 
contractor, stations, and inspectors. Information should include 
administrative & judicial responsibilities & procedures, and a 
description of the funding allocations.
    (13) Submit to EPA an administrative procedures manual or 
description of the practice of inspector recertification which must 
occur at least every two years.
    (14) Submit to EPA State regulations documenting provisions for the 
protection of whistle blowers. In addition, Maryland needs to provide 
documentation of how it investigates and responds to complaints made by 
the public.
    (15) Maryland must start mandatory testing of all subject vehicles 
as soon

[[Page 47]]

as possible, or by November 15, 1997 at the latest.
    (b) The State of Maryland's July 12, 1995 submittal for the 15 
Percent Rate of Progress Plan (15% plan) for the Maryland portion of the 
Metropolitan Washington, DC ozone nonattainment area, is conditionally 
approved based on certain contingencies. The conditions for 
approvability are as follows:
    (1) Maryland's 15% plan must be revised to account for growth in 
point sources from 1990-1996.
    (2) Maryland must meet the conditions listed in the October 31, 1996 
proposed conditional I/M rulemaking notice, remodel the I/M reductions 
using the following two EPA guidance memos: ``Date by which States Need 
to Achieve all the Reductions Needed for the 15 Percent Plan from

I/M and Guidance for Recalculation,'' note from John Seitz and Margo 
Oge, dated August 13, 1996, and ``Modeling 15 Percent VOC Reductions 
from I/M in 1999--Supplemental Guidance,'' memorandum from Gay MacGregor 
and Sally Shaver, dated December 23, 1996.
    (3) Maryland must remodel to determine affirmatively the creditable 
reductions from RFG, and Tier 1 in accordance with EPA guidance.
    (4) Maryland must submit a SIP revision amending the 15% plan with a 
demonstration using appropriate documentation methodologies and credit 
calculations that the 56.4 tons/day reduction, supported through 
creditable emission reduction measures in the submittal, satisfies 
Maryland's 15% ROP requirement for the Metropolitan Washington, DC 
nonattainment area.
    (c) The State of Maryland's July 12, 1995 submittal for the 15 
Percent Rate of Progress Plan (15% plan) for the Baltimore ozone 
nonattainment area, is conditionally approved based on certain 
contingencies. The conditions for approvability are as follows:
    (1) Maryland's 15% plan calculations must reflect the EPA approved 
1990 base year emissions inventory in Sec. 52.1075.
    (2) Maryland must meet the conditions listed in the October 31, 1996 
conditional I/M rulemaking notice, including its commitment to remodel 
the I/M reductions using the following two EPA guidance memos: ``Date by 
which States Need to Achieve all the Reductions Needed for the 15 
Percent Plan from I/M and Guidance for Recalculation,'' note from John 
Seitz and Margo Oge dated August 13, 1996, and ``Modeling 15% VOC 
Reductions from I/M in 1999--Supplemental Guidance,'' from Gay MacGregor 
and Sally Shaver dated December 23, 1996.
    (3) Maryland must remodel to determine affirmatively the creditable 
reductions from RFG and Tier I in accordance with EPA guidance.
    (4) Maryland must submit a SIP revision amending the 15% plan with a 
determination using appropriate documentation methodologies and credit 
calculations that the 64.2 TPD reduction, supported through creditable 
emission measures in the submittal, satisfies Maryland's 15% ROP 
requirement for the Baltimore area.

for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, 
as amended on June 27, 1996 and July 29, 1996, and November 1, 1996, is 
conditionally approved based on certain contingencies, for an interim 
period to last eighteen months. If the Commonwealth fails to start its 
program according to schedule, or by November 15, 1997 at the latest, 
this conditional approval will convert to a disapproval after EPA sends 
a letter to the state. If the Commonwealth fails to satisfy the 
following conditions within 12 months of this rulemaking, this 
conditional approval will automatically convert to a disapproval as 
explained under section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act.
    (i) The conditions for approvability are as follows:
    (A) The time extension program as described and committed to in the 
March 3, 1997 letter from Massachusetts must be further defined and 
submitted to EPA as a SIP revision by no later than one year after the 
effective date of this interim approval. Another program which meets the 
requirements of 40 CFR 51.360 (Waivers and Compliance via Diagnostic 
Inspection) and provides for no more than a 1% waiver rate would also be 
approvable.
    (B) Other major deficiencies as described in the proposal must also 
be corrected in 40 CFR 51.351 (Enhanced I/M Performance Standard), 
Sec. 51.354 (Adequate Tools and Resources), Sec. 51.357 (Test Procedures 
and Standards), Sec. 51.359 (Quality Control), and Sec. 51.363 (Quality 
Assurance). The Commonwealth, committed in a letter dated March 3, 1997 
to correct these deficiencies within one year of conditional interim 
approval by EPA.
    (ii) In addition to the above conditions for approval, the 
Commonwealth must correct several minor, or de minimus deficiencies 
related to CAA requirements for enhanced I/M. Although satisfaction of 
these deficiencies does not affect the conditional approval status of 
the Commonwealth's rulemaking granted under the authority of section 110 
of the Clean Air Act, these deficiencies must be corrected in the final 
I/M SIP revision prior to the end of the 18-month interim period granted 
under the National Highway Safety Designation Act of 1995:
    (A) The SIP lacks a detailed description of the program evaluation 
element as required under 40 CFR 51.353;
    (B) The SIP lacks a detailed description of the test frequency and 
convenience element required under 40 CFR 51.355;
    (C) The SIP lacks a detailed description of the number and types of 
vehicles included in the program as required under 40 CFR 51.356;
    (D) The SIP lacks a detailed information concerning the enforcement 
process, and a commitment to a compliance rate to be maintained in 
practice required under 40 CFR 51.361.
    (E) The SIP lacks the details of the enforcement oversight program 
including quality control and quality assurance procedures to be used to 
insure the effective overall performance of the enforcement system as 
required under 40 CFR 51.362;
    (F) The SIP lacks a detailed description of procedures for 
enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors as required 
under 40 CFR 51.364;
    (G) The SIP lacks a detailed description of data analysis and 
reporting provisions as required under 40 CFR 51.366;
    (H) The SIP lacks a public awareness plan as required by 40 CFR 
51.368; and
    (I) The SIP lacks provisions for notifying motorists of required 
recalls prior to inspection of the vehicle as required by 40 CFR 51.370.
    (iii) EPA is also approving this SIP revision under section 110(k), 
for its strengthening effect on the plan.

Sec. 52.1123  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart the Administrator 
approves the Massachusetts plan as identified in Sec. 52.1120 for 
attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 
of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan 
identified in Sec. 52.1120 satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title I 
of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In 
addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D of the 
ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT 
requirements by July 1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued 
between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each 
subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sourceovered by 
CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b) The above requirements for continued satisfaction of Part D are 
fulfilled by Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17) and a narrative 
commitment to review CTG IIIs issued in the future. Both were submitted 
on September 9, 1982. Additionally, each individual RACT determination 
made under 310 CMR 7.18(17) will be submitted as a SIP revision to 
incorporate the limitation into the SIP, and DEQE will propose 
regulations for CTG III category controls if the controls are 
appropriate for the State.

Sec. 52.1125  Emission inventories.

    (a) The Governor's designee for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
submitted the 1990 base year emission inventories for the Springfield 
nonattainment area and the Massachusetts portion of the Boston-Lawrence-
Worcester ozone nonattainment area on November 13, 1992 as a revision to 
the State Implementation Plan (SIP). Revisions to the inventories were 
submitted on November 15, 1993, and November 15, 1994, and March 31, 
1997. The 1990 base year emission inventory requirement of section 
182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied 
for these areas.
    (b) The inventories are for the ozone precursors which are volatile 
organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventories 
covers point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic 
sources.
    (c) Taken together, the Springfield nonattainment area and the 
Massachusetts portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester nonattainment 
area encompass the entire geographic area of the

    (a) Definitions:
    (1) The phrase to commence construction means to engage in a 
continuous program of on-site construction including site clearance, 
grading, dredging, or land filling specifically designed for a parking 
facility in preparation for the fabrication, erection, or installation 
of the building components of the facility. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, interruptions resulting from acts of God, strikes, 
litigation, or other matters beyond the control of the owner shall be 
disregarded in determining whether a construction or modification 
program is continuous.
    (2) The phrase to commence modification means to engage in a 
continuous program of on-site modification including site clearance, 
grading, dredging, or land filling in preparation for a specific 
modification of the parking facility.
    (3) The phrase commercial parking space means a space used for 
parking a vehicle in a commercial parking facility.
    (4) [Reserved]
    (5) Commercial parking facility (also called facility) means any 
lot, garage, building or structure, or combination or portion thereof, 
on or in which motor vehicles are temporarily parked for a fee, 
excluding (i) a parking facility, the use of which is limited 
exclusively to residents (and guests of residents) of a residential 
building or group of buildings under common control, and (ii) parking on 
public streets.
    (6) Freeze means to maintain at all times after October 15, 1973, 
the total quantity of commercial parking spaces available for use at the 
same amounts as were available for use prior to said date; Provided, 
That such quantity may be increased by spaces the construction of which 
commenced prior to October 15, 1973, or as specifically permitted by 
paragraphs (n), (p) and (q) of this section; provided further that such 
additional spaces do not result in an increase of more than 10 percent 
in the

[[Page 74]]

total commercial parking spaces available for use on October 15, 1973, 
in any municipality within the freeze area or at Logan International 
Airport (``Logan Airport''). For purposes of the last clause of the 
previous sentence, the 10 percent limit shall apply to each municipality 
and Logan Airport separately.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) There is hereby established a freeze, as defined by paragraph 
(a)(6) of this section, on the availability of commercial parking 
facilities in the freeze area effective October 15, 1973. In the event 
construction in any municipality, commenced prior to October 15, 1973, 
results in a number of spaces which exceeds the 10 percent limit 
prescribed by paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the Governor shall 
immediately take all necessary steps to assure that the available 
commercial spaces within such municipality shall be reduced to comply 
with the freeze. In the event that such limit is exceeded at Logan 
Airport, then the provisions of paragraph (m) of this section shall 
apply.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) After August 15, 1973, no person shall commence construction of 
any commercial parking facility or modification of any such existing 
facility in the freeze area unless and until he has obtained from the 
Governor or from an agency approved by the Governor a permit stating 
that construction or modification of such facility will be in compliance 
with the parking freeze established by paragraph (c) of this section. 
This paragraph shall not apply to any proposed parking facility for 
which a general construction contract was finally executed by all 
appropriate parties on or before August 15, 1973.
    (f) The Governor shall notify the Regional Administrator in writing 
within 10 days of approval of any agency pursuant to paragraph (e) of 
this section. In order for any agency to be approved by the Governor for 
purposes of issuing permits pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, 
such agency shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Governor that:
    (1) Requirements for permit application and issuance have been 
established. Such requirements shall include but not be limited to a 
condition that before a permit may be issued the following findings of 
fact or factually supported projections must be made:
    (i) The location of the facility; and
    (ii) The total motor vehicle capacity before and after the proposed 
cons t r u c t i o n o r m o d i f i c a t i o n o f t h e facility.
    (2) Criteria for issuance of permits have been established and 
published. Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to:
    (i) Full consideration of all facts contained in the application.
    (ii) Provisions that no permit will be issued if construction or 
modification of the facility will not comply with the requirements of 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Agency procedures provide that no permit for the construction or 
modification of a facility covered by this section shall be issued 
without notice and opportunity for public hearing. The public hearing 
may be of a legislative type; the notice shall conform to the 
requirements of 40 CFR 51.4(b); and the agency rules or procedures may 
provide that if no notice of intent to participate in the hearing is 
received from any member of the public (other than the applicant) prior 
to 7 days before the scheduled hearing date, no hearing need be held. If 
notice of intent to participate is required, the fact shall be noted 
prominently in the required hearing notice.
    (g)-(l) [Reserved]
    (m) On or before January 30, 1975, the Massachusetts Port Authority 
(``Massport'') shall prepare and submit to the Governor for his approval 
a plan showing the manner in which the number of commercial parking 
spaces at Logan Airport which exceeds the number of such spaces 
permitted under the freeze shall be removed from use. The Governor shall 
approve such plan if he determines that (1) implementation of such plan 
would result in reducing the aggregate number of commercial parking 
spaces to the level of such spaces permitted by this section, (2) 
Massport has adequate legal authority to implement such plan and (3) 
adequate commitments have been made by Massport to assure the Governor 
that such plan

[[Page 75]]

will be fully implemented and maintained on and after May 1, 1976. In 
the event that the Governor does not approve such plan by April 1, 1976, 
then the owner or operator of each commercial parking facility located 
at Logan Airport shall, on or before July 1, 1976, reduce the number of 
commercial parking spaces available for use at each such facility by an 
amount which bears the same proportion to the number of spaces exceeding 
the limit imposed by this section as the number of spaces available at 
such facility bears the total number of such spaces which were available 
for use at Logan Airport on April 1, 1976.
    (n) Where an agency approved by the Governor under paragraph (e) of 
this section to issue permits for new construction in the City of 
Cambridge demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Governor that (1) 
specific on-street parking spaces in use as of October 15, 1973, were 
being legally and regularly used as of such date for parking by 
commuters (as that term is defined in Sec. 52.1161(a)(6)) who are not 
residents of Cambridge and that (2) effective measures have been 
implemented (including adequate enforcement) to prevent such spaces from 
being used by such commuters, then such approved agency may issue 
permits for construction of additional new commercial  parking  spaces  
equal  to  one-half  of  the  number  of  spaces  removed  from  regular 
 use  by  such  commuters  and  the  total  quantity  of  commercial  
parking  spaces  allowable  in  Cambridge  under  this  section  shall  
be  raised  accordingly.
    (o) On or before July 31, 1976, and on or before each succeeding 
July 31, the Governor and the chief executive officer of any agency 
approved by the Governor under paragraph (e) of this section shall 
submit a report to the Regional Administrator setting forth:
    (1) The names and addresses of all persons who received permits 
during the previous twelve-month period ending June 30 and number of 
spaces allocated to each such person;
    (2) The number of commercial parking spaces available for use as of 
the June 30 prior to the date of the report;
    (3) The number of commercial parking spaces which remain available 
for allocation by the Governor or such agency as of the June 30 prior to 
the date of the report, including those spaces made available because of 
retirement of existing commercial parking spaces as well as those spaces 
made available because of the effects of paragraphs (n), (p) and (q) of 
this section; and
    (4) The location and capacity of any park-and-ride facility 
designated under paragraph (p) of this section.
    (p) The Governor and any approved agency may issue a permit to 
construct a commercial parking facility which is designated by the 
Governor as a park-and-ride facility to be operated in conjunction with 
mass transit service without regard to the limitations on number of 
spaces imposed by this section.
    (q) Where an agency approved by the Governor can demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the Governor that there have been physically eliminated 
through permanent modification or demolition any legal on-street parking 
spaces within a municipality then such agency may issue permits for 
construction within that municipality of additional new commercial 
parking spaces equal to the number of spaces thus eliminated and the 
total quantity of commercial parking spaces allowable for such 
municipality under this section shall be increased accordingly.
    (r) The provisions of this regulation shall cease to be effective as 
to that portion of the freeze area lying within the City of Boston and 
not included within Boston proper or Logan Airport at such time as the 
City of Boston implements a program, approved by the Governor, which 
shall include effective measures to control the construction of 
additional commercial parking spaces within that area, including 
procedures for issuance of conditional use permits under applicable 
zoning regulations and for assuring compliance with all air quality 
requirements under state and Federal law.

as organic materials which are liquids at standard conditions and which 
are used as dissolvers, viscosity reducers, or cleaning agents, except 
that such materials which exhibit a boiling point higher than 220 deg. 
F. at 0.5 millimeters of mercury absolute pressure or having an 
equivalent vapor pressure shall not be considered to be solvents unless 
exposed to temperatures exceeding 220 deg. F.
    (2) Solvent of high photochemical reactivity means any solvent with 
an aggregate of more than 20 percent of its total volume composed of the 
chemical compounds classified below or which exceeds any of the 
following individual percentage composition limitations in reference to 
the total volume of solvent:
    (i) A combination of hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, 
ethers, or ketones having an olefinic or cycloolefinic type of 
unsaturation: 5 percent;
    (ii) A combination of aromatic compounds with eight or more carbon 
atoms to the molecule except ethylbenzene: 8 percent;
    (iii) A combination of ethylbenzene, ketones having branched 
hydrocarbon structures, trichloroethylene or toluene: 20 percent. 
Whenever any organic solvent or any constituent of an organic solvent 
may be classified from its chemical structure into more than one of the 
above groups of organic compounds, it shall be considered as a member of 
the most reactive chemical group, that is, that group having the least 
allowable percentage of total volume of solvents.
    (3) Organic materials are chemical compounds of carbon excluding 
carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbonic acid, metallic carbides, 
metallic carbonates, and ammonium carbonate.

Sec. 52.1164  Localized high concentrations--carbon monoxide.

    (a) Not later than October 1, 1975, the Commonwealth shall have 
developed and have begun to implement a program to identify urban and 
suburban core areas and roadway/intersection complexes within the Boston 
Intrastate Region which violate the national ambient air quality 
standards for carbon monoxide. Once such localized areas have been 
identified, the Commonwealth, in cooperation with the affected local 
municipalities, shall develop and implement appropriate control 
strategies to insure that such air quality standards will be achieved at 
such areas. Plans shall be developed to include provisions for the 
entire municipality in order to insure that the implemented strategies 
will not create carbon monoxide violations elsewhere in the vicinity 
after the measures have been applied.
    (b) To accomplish the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, 
the Commonwealth shall do the following:
    (1) Identify areas of potentially high carbon monoxide 
concentrations by reviewing all available traffic data, physical site 
data and air quality and meteorological data for all major intersections 
and roadway complexes within the Region. The Regional Administrator will 
provide general guidance on area designations to assist in the initial 
identification process.
    (2) Areas identified under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be 
studied in further detail, including meteorological modeling, traffic 
flow monitoring, air quality monitoring and other measures necessary to 
accurately quantify the extent and actual levels of carbon monoxide in 
the area. A report containing the results of these analyses and 
identifying such areas shall be submitted to the Regional Administrator 
no later than March 1, 1976.
    (3) If, after the completion of actions required by paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, an area shows or is predicted to have violations of the 
carbon monoxide standard, the Commonwealth, in cooperation with the 
affected municipality, shall submit a plan to the Regional Administrator 
containing measures to regulate traffic and parking so as to reduce 
carbon monoxide emissions to achieve air quality standards in the area. 
Such plan shall include: the name of the agency responsible for 
implementing the plan, all technical data and analyses supporting the 
conclusions of the plan, all control strategies adopted as part of the 
plan, and other such information relating to the proposed program as may 
be required by the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator 
shall provide general guidance on applicable control strategies and 
reporting formats to assist in plan development and submittal. Such a 
plan shall be submitted for each municipality which contains one or more 
identified areas no later than October 1, 1975 for Waltham and October 
1, 1976, for other areas.
    (4) All measures called for in the plan submitted under paragraph 
(b)(3) of

[[Page 85]]

this section shall be subject to the approval of the Regional 
Administrator and shall be implemented by May 31, 1977.
    (c) The Commonwealth shall annually review the effectiveness of the 
control strategies developed pursuant to this section and modify them as 
necessary to insure that such carbon monoxide standards will be attained 
and maintained. The results of this review and any changes in the 
measures which the Commonwealth recommends as a result thereof shall be 
reported to the Regional Administrator annually as required under 
Sec. 52.1160.
    (d) Prior to submitting any plan to the Regional Administrator under 
paragraph (b)(3), the Commonwealth shall give prominent public notice of 
the general recommendations of such plan, shall make such plan available 
to the public for at least 30 days and permit any affected public agency 
or member of the public to comment in writing on such plan. The 
Commonwealth shall give the Regional Administrator timely notice of any 
public hearing to be held on such plan and shall make all comments 
received available to the Regional Administrator for inspection and 
copying.

    (a) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air 
Act are not met, since the plan does not include approvable procedures 
for preventing the significant deterioration of air quality.
    (b) Regulation for preventing significant deterioration of air 
quality. The provisions of Sec. 52.21 (b) through (v) are hereby 
incorporated and made a part of the applicable State plan for the State

Sec. 52.1168a  Part D--Disapproval of Rules and Regulations.

    On December 30, 1985, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental 
Quality Engineering (DEQE) submitted a revision to the Massachusetts 
State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the automobile surface coating 
regulation. This revision requested an extension of the final compliance 
dates to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) on 
topcoat and final repair applications. As a result of EPA's disapproval 
of this revision, the existing compliance date of December 31, 1985 
specified in the automobile surface coating regulation contained in the 
Massachusetts SIP will remain in effect (Massachusetts Regulation 310 
CMR 7.18(7) as approved by EPA and codified at 40 CFR 52.1120(c)(30) and 
(53)).
[53 FR 36014, Sept. 16, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 52.1169  Stack height review.

    The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has declared to the satisfaction 
of EPA that no existing emission limitations have been affected by stack 
height credits greater than good engineering practice or any other 
prohibited dispersion technique as defined in EPA's stack height 
regulations, as revised on July 8, 1985. This declaration was submitted 
to EPA on April 8, 1986. The commonwealth has further declared in a 
letter from Bruce K. Maillet, dated June 24, 1986, that, ``[A]s part of 
our new source review activities under the Massachusetts SIP and our 
delegated PSD authority, the Department of Environmental Quality 
Engineering will follow EPA's stack height regulations, as revised in 
the Federal Register on July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892).'' Thus, the 
Commonwealth has satisfactorily demonstrated that its regulations meet 
40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.

ozone NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Michigan will 
implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are 
contained in the contingency plan. Appropriateness of a contingency 
measure will be determined by an urban airshed modeling analysis. The 
Governor or his designee will select the contingency measure(s) to be 
implemented based on the analysis and the MDNR's recommendation. The 
menu of contingency measures includes basic motor vehicle inspection and 
maintenance program upgrades, Stage I vapor recovery expansion, Stage II 
vapor recovery, intensified RACT for degreasing operations,

Plan for ozone a State Implementation Plan for a section 175A 
maintenance plan for the Grand Rapids area as part of Michigan's request 
to redesignate the area from moderate nonattainment to attainment for 
ozone. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include an 
attainment emission inventory for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC, a 
demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission 
inventories to the year 2007 for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC, a plan to 
verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and a commitment to 
submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by 
the Clean Air Act. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS, determined not to 
be attributable to transport from upwind areas, is monitored, Michigan 
will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) contained 
in the contingency plan. Once a violation of the ozone NAAQS is 
recorded, the State will notify EPA, review the data for quality 
assurance, and conduct a technical analysis, including an analysis of 
meteorological conditions leading up to and during the exceedances 
contributing to the violation, to determine local culpability. This 
preliminary analysis will be submitted to EPA and subjected to public 
review and comment. The State will solicit and consider EPA's technical 
advice and analysis before making a final determination on the cause of 
the violation. The Governor or his designee will select the contingency 
measure(s) to be implemented within six months of a monitored violation 
attributable to ozone and ozone precursors from the Grand Rapids area. 
The menu of contingency measures includes a motor vehicle inspection and 
maintenance program, Stage II vapor recovery, gasoline RVP reduction to 
7.8 psi, RACT on major non-CTG VOC sources in the categories of coating 
of plastics, coating of wood furniture, and industrial cleaning 
solvents. Michigan submitted legislation or rules for I/M in House Bill

allowable emissions resulting from the application of the CTG 
presumptive norm. The State must comply with this condition by May 6, 
1981, and any necessary regulations must be finally promulgated by the 
State and submitted to USEPA by September 30, 1981.
    (b) Approval--On November 16, 1992, the Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources submitted Natural Resources Commission Rule 336.202 
(Rule 2), Sections 5 and 14a of the 1965 Air Pollution Act 348, and the

[[Page 114]]

ozone State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the 1990 base year inventory. 
The inventory was submitted by the State of Michigan to satisfy Federal 
requirements under section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 
1990 (the Act), as a revision to the ozone SIP for the Grand Rapids and 
Muskegon areas in Michigan designated nonattainment, classified as 
moderate. These areas include counties of Muskegon, and the two county 
Grand Rapids area (which are the counties of Kent and Ottawa).


    Editorial Note: At 59 FR 40828, Aug. 10, 1994 the following 
paragraph (c) was added to Sec. 52.1174.

    (c) Approval--On November 12, 1993, the Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a petition for exemption from the oxides of 
nitrogen requirements of the Clean Air Act for the Detroit-Ann Arbor 
ozone nonattainment area. The submittal pertained to the exemption from 
the oxides of nitrogen requirements for conformity, inspection and 
maintenance, reasonably available control technology, and new source 
review. These are required by sections 176(c), 182(b)(4), and 182(f) of 
the 1990 amended Clean Air Act, respectively.
    (d) In a letter addressed to David Kee, EPA, dated March 30, 1994, 
Dennis M. Drake, State of Michigan, stated:
    (1) Michigan has not developed RACT regulations for the following 
industrial source categories, which have been addressed in Control 
Techniques Guidance (CTG) documents published prior to the Clean Air Act 
Amendments of 1990, because no affected sources are located in the 
moderate nonattainment counties:

(i) Large petroleum dry cleaners;
(ii) SOCMI air oxidation processes;
(iii) High-density polyethylene and polypropylene resin manufacturing; 
    and
(iv) Pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing.

    (2) (Reserved)
    (e) Approval--On July 1, 1994, the Michigan Department of Natural 
Resources submitted a petition for exemption from the oxides of nitrogen 
requirements of the Clean Air Act for the East Lansing ozone 
nonattainment area. The submittal pertained to the exemption from the 
oxides of nitrogen requirements for conformity and new source review. 
Theses are required by sections 176(c) and 182(f) of the 1990 amended 
Clean Air Act, respectively. If a violation of the ozone standard occurs 
in the East Lansing ozone nonattainment area, the exemption shall no 
longer apply.
    (f) Approval--On July 8, 1994, the Michigan Department of Natural 
Resources submitted a petition for exemption from the oxides of nitrogen 
requirements of the Clean Air Act for the Genesee County ozone 
nonattainment area. The submittal pertained to the exemption from the 
oxides of nitrogen requirements for conformity and new source review. 
These are required by sections 176(c) and 182(f) of the 1990 amended 
Clean Air Act, respectively. If a violation of the ozone standard occurs 
in the Genesee County ozone nonattainment area, the exemption shall no 
longer apply.
    (g)  [Reserved]
    (h) Approval--On January 5, 1993, the Michigan Department of Natural 
Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan 
for the 1990 base year emission inventory. The inventory was submitted 
by the State of Michigan to satisfy Federal requirements under section 
182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, as a revision to the 
ozone State Implementation Plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor moderate ozone 
nonattainment area. This area includes Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, 
Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties.
    (i) Approval--On November 12, 1993, the Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a request to redesignate the Detroit-Ann 
Arbor (consisting of Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, 
Washtenaw, and Wayne counties) ozone nonattainment area to attainment 
for ozone. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a 
maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 
1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year 
(1993 attainment year) emission inventory for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC, a 
demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission 
inventories (including interim years)

[[Page 115]]

to the year 2005 for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC, a plan to verify continued 
attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent 
maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. 
If the area records a violation of the ozone NAAQS (which must be 
confirmed by the State), Michigan will implement one or more appropriate 
contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. 
Appropriateness of a contingency measure will be determined by an urban 
airshed modeling analysis. The Governor or his designee will select the 
contingency measure(s) to be implemented based on the analysis and the 
MDNR's recommendation. The menu of contingency measures includes basic 
motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program upgrades, Stage I vapor 
recovery expansion, Stage II vapor recovery, intensified RACT for 
degreasing operations, NO<INF>X</INF> RACT, and RVP reduction to 7.8 
psi. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the 
redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act 
as amended in 1990, respectively. The redesignation meets the Federal 
requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to 
the Michigan Ozone State Implementation Plan for the above mentioned 
counties.
    (j)  [Reserved]
    (k) Determination--USEPA is determining that, as of July 20, 1995, 
the Grand Rapids and Muskegon ozone nonattainment areas have attained 
the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and 
attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related 
requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to 
the areas for so long as the areas do not monitor any violations of the 
ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in either 
the Grand Rapids or Muskegon ozone nonattainment area, the determination 
shall no longer apply for the area that experiences the violation.
    (l) Approval--EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new 
source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general 
conformity exemptions for the Grand Rapids (Kent and Ottawa Counties) 
and Muskegon (Muskegon County) moderate nonattainment areas as requested 
by the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 
13, 1994 submittal. This approval also covers the exemption of 
NO<INF>X</INF> transportation and general conformity requirements of 
section 176(c) for the Counties of Allegan, Barry, Bay, Berrien, Branch, 
Calhoun, Cass, Clinton, Eaton, Gratiot, Genesee, Hillsdale, Ingham, 
Ionia, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lenawee, Midland, Montcalm, St. Joseph, 
Saginaw, Shiawasse, and Van Buren.
    (m) Approval--On November 24, 1994, the Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation 
Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for the implementation and 
enforcement of the Federal transportation conformity requirements at the 
State or local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 51, subpart T--
Conformity to State or Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation 
Plans, Programs, and Projects Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 
23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act.
    (n) Approval--On November 29, 1994, the Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation 
Plan for general conformity rules. The general conformity SIP revisions 
enable the State of Michigan to implement and enforce the Federal 
general conformity requirements in the nonattainment or maintenance 
areas at the State or local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 93, 
subpart B--Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or 
Federal Implementation Plans.
    (o) Approval--On March 9, 1996, the Michigan Department of 
Environmental Quality submitted a request to redesignate the Grand 
Rapids ozone nonattainment area (consisting of Kent and Ottawa Counties) 
to attainment for ozone. As part of the redesignation request, the State 
submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, 
as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan 
include an attainment emission inventory for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC, a 
demonstration of maintenance of the ozone

[[Page 116]]

NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2007 for 
NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC, a plan to verify continued attainment, a 
contingency plan, and a commitment to submit a subsequent maintenance 
plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If a 
violation of the ozone NAAQS, determined not to be attributable to 
transport from upwind areas, is monitored, Michigan will implement one 
or more appropriate contingency measure(s) contained in the contingency 
plan. Once a violation of the ozone NAAQS is recorded, the State will 
notify EPA, review the data for quality assurance, and conduct a 
technical analysis, including an analysis of meteorological conditions 
leading up to and during the exceedances contributing to the violation, 
to determine local culpability. This preliminary analysis will be 
submitted to EPA and subjected to public review and comment. The State 
will solicit and consider EPA's technical advice and analysis before 
making a final determination on the cause of the violation. The Governor 
or his designee will select the contingency measure(s) to be implemented 
within 6 months of a monitored violation attributable to ozone and ozone 
precursors from the Grand Rapids area. The menu of contingency measures 
includes a motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program, Stage II 
vapor recovery, RVP reduction to 7.8 psi, RACT on major non-CTG VOC 
sources in the categories of coating of plastics, coating of wood 
furniture, and industrial cleaning solvents. The redesignation request 
and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 
107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively. The 
redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the 
Clean Air Act as a revision to the Michigan Ozone State Implementation 
Plan for the above mentioned counties.
    (p) Approval--On November 22, 1995 the Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a petition for exemption from transportation 
conformity requirements for the Muskegon ozone nonattainment area. This 
approval exempts the Muskegon ozone nonattainment area from 
transportation conformity requirements under section 182(b)(1) of the 
Clean Air Act. If a violation of the ozone standard occurs in the 
Muskegon County ozone nonattainment area, the exemption shall no longer 
apply.
    (q) Correction of approved plan-- Michigan air quality 
Administrative Rule, R336.1901 (Rule 901)--Air Contaminant or Water 
Vapor, has been removed from the approved plan pursuant to section 
110(k)(6) of the Clean Air Act (as amended in 1990).

<R05>
Sec. 52.1219  Identification of plan--conditional approval.

    (a) On November 12, 1993, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency 
submitted a revision request to Minnesota's carbon monoxide SIP for 
approval of the State's basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. 
The basic I/M program requirements apply to sources in the State's 
moderate nonattainment areas for carbon monoxide and includes the 
following counties: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and 
Washington Counties. The USEPA is conditionally approving Minnesota's 
basic I/M program provided that the State adopt specific enforceable 
measures as outlined in its July 5, 1994 letter from Charles W. 
Williams, Commissioner, Minnesota Air Pollution Control Agency.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Minnesota Rules relating to Motor Vehicle Emissions parts 
7023.1010 to 7023.1105, effective January 8, 1994.
    (ii) Additional material.
    (A) Letter from the State of Minnesota to USEPA dated July 5, 1994.
    (b) On February 9, 1996, the State of Minnesota submitted a request 
to revise its particulate matter (PM) State Implementation Plan (SIP) 
for the Saint Paul area. This SIP submittal contains administrative 
orders which include control measures for three companies located in the 
Red Rock Road area--St. Paul Terminals, Inc., Lafarge Corporation and 
AMG Resources Corporation. Recent exceedances were attributed to changes 
of emissions/operations that had occurred at particular sources in the 
area. The results from the modeling analysis submitted with the Red Rock 
Road SIP revision, preliminarily demonstrate protection of the PM 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). However, due to the lack 
of emission limits and specific information regarding emission 
distribution at Lafarge Corporation following the installation of the 
pneumatic unloader, EPA is conditionally approving the SIP revision at 
this time. Final approval will be conditioned upon EPA receiving a 
subsequent modeled attainment demonstration with specific emission 
limits for Lafarge Corporation, corrected inputs for Peavey/Con-Agra, 
and consideration of the sources in the 2-4 km range which have 
experienced emission changes that may impact the Red Rock Road 
attainment demonstration.

    (25) On July 9, 1986, the State of Minnesota submitted Rules 
7005.2520 through 7005.2523, submitted to replace the rule APC-29 in the 
existing SIP (see paragraph (20)). This submittal also included State 
permits for three sources, but these permits were withdrawn from USEPA 
consideration on February 24, 1992. This submittal provides for 
regulation of particulate matter from grain handling facilities, and was 
submitted to satisfy a condition on the approval of Minnesota's Part D 
plan for particulate matter.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Minnesota Rule 7005.2520, Definitions; Rule 7005.2521, Standards 
of Performance for Dry Bulk Agricultural Commodity Facilities; Rule 
7005.2522, Nuisance; and Rule 7005.2523, Control Requirements Schedule, 
promulgated by Minnesota on January 16, 1984, and effective at the State

    (ii) Additional Material.
    (A) Appendix E to Minnesota's July 9, 1986, submittal, which is a 
statement signed on April 18, 1986, by Thomas J. Kalitowski, Executive 
Director, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, interpreting Rules 
7005.2520 through 7005.2523 in the context of actual barge loading 
practices in Minnesota.
    (26) On March 13, 1989, the State of Minnesota requested that EPA 
revise the referencing of regulations in the SIP to conform to the 
State's recodification of its regulations. On November

[[Page 124]]

26, 1991, and September 18, 1992, the State submitted an official 
version of the recodified regulations to be incorporated into the SIP. 
The recodified regulations are in Chapter 7001 and Chapter 7005 of 
Minnesota's regulations. Not approved as part of the SIP are recodified 
versions of regulations which EPA previously did not approve. Therefore, 
the SIP does not include Rules 7005.1550 through 7005.1610 (National 
Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for asbestos), 
Rules 7005.2300 through 7005.2330 (limits for iron and steel plants), 
Rules 7005.2550 through 7005.2590 (NESHAP for beryllium), Rules 
7005.2650 through 7005.2690 (NESHAP for mercury), Rule 7005.0116 
(Opacity Standard Adjustment) and Rule 7005.2910 (Performance Test 
Methods for coal handling facilities). Similarly, the SIP continues to 
exclude the exemption now in Rule 7001.1210 as applied to small sources 
subject to new source performance standards, and the SIP is approved 
only for ``existing sources'' in the case of Rules 7005.1250 through 
7005.1280 (Standards of Performance for Liquid Petroleum Storage 
Vessels), Rules 7005.1350 through 7005.1410 (Standards of Performance 
for Sulfuric Acid Plants), Rules 7005.1450 through 7005.1500 (Standards 
of Performance for Nitric Acid Plants), and Rules 7005.2100 through 
7005.2160 (Standards of Performance for Petroleum Refineries). The SIP 
also does not include changes in the State's Rule 7005.0100 (relating to 
offsets) that were withdrawn by the State on February 24, 1992, and does 
not include the new rules 7005.0030 and 7005.0040.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Minnesota regulations in Chapter 7005 as submitted November 26, 
1991, and in Chapter 7001 as submitted September 18, 1992, except for 
those regulations that EPA has not approved as identified above.
    (27) On August 16, 1982, the MPCA submitted an amendment to the St. 
Cloud Area Air Quality Control Plan for Transportation as a State 
Implementation Plan revision. This revision to the SIP was adopted by 
the Board of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency on July 27, 1982. On 
August 31, 1989, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency submitted a 
revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon 
monoxide deleting the Lake George Interchange roadway improvement 
project (10th Avenue at First Street South) from its St. Cloud 
transportation control measures. This revision to the SIP was approved 
by the Board on June 27, 1989.

Sec. 52.1223  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Minnesota's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, 
Title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below.
[45 FR 40581, June 16, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 52.1224  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not provide for public availability of emission 
data.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1 to July 30 and July 1 to December 31.

[[Page 131]]

    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.
    (5) Authority of the Regional Administrator to make available 
information and data was delegated to the Minnesota Pollution Control 
Agency effective October 6, 1977.

Sec. 52.1225  Review of new sources and modifications.

    (a) Part D--Approval. The State of Minnesota has satisfied the 
requirements of sections 173 and 189(a)(1)(A) for permitting of major 
new sources and modifications in nonattainment areas.
    (b)-(d) [Reserved]
    (e) The State of Minnesota has committed to conform to the Stack 
Height Regulations, as set forth in 40 CFR part 51. In a January 14, 
1987, letter to David Kee, USEPA, Thomas J. Kalitowski, Executive 
Director, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, stated:

    Minnesota does not currently have a stack height rule, nor do we 
intend to adopt such a rule. Instead, we will conform with the Stack 
Height Regulations as set forth in the July 8, 1985, Federal Register in 
issuing permits for new or modified sources. In cases where that rule is 
not clear, we will contact USEPA Region V and conform to the current 
federal interpretation of the item in question.

determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission 
limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable 
plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.

<R05>
Sec. 52.1322  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.1323  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Missouri's plans for the attainment and  maintenance  of  the  
national standards. Continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D 
for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal 
of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980, for the sources covered by CTGs 
issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal 
by each successive January of Additional RACT requirements for sources 
covered by CTGs issued the previous January. New source review permits 
issued pursuant to section 173 of the Clean Air Act will not be deemed 
valid by EPA unless the provisions of Section V of the emission offset 
interpretive rule published on January 16, 1979 (44 FR 3274) are met.
    (b) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-2.290 as identified 
under Sec. 52.1320, paragraph (c)(65), with the understanding that any 
alternative compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved by 
EPA as individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the 
enforceable requirements of the SIP would be the reduction requirements 
stated in the rule.
    (c) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-2.230 as identified 
under Sec. 52.1320, paragraph (c)(70), with the understanding that any 
alternative compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved by 
EPA as individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the 
enforceable requirements of the SIP would be the emission limits stated 
in the rule.
    (d) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-5.340 as identified 
under Sec. 52.1320, paragraph (c)(71), with the understanding that any 
alternative compliance plans issued under this rule must be approved as 
individual SIP revisions. In the absence of such approval, the 
enforceable requirements of the SIP would be the reduction requirements 
stated in the rule.
    (e) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-5.330 as identified 
under Sec. 52.1320, paragraph (c)(72), under the following terms, to 
which the state of Missouri has agreed: Subsections (5)(B)3 and (7)(B) 
of the rule contain provisions whereby the director of the Missouri Air 
Pollution Control Program has discretion to establish compliance 
determination procedures and equivalent alternative emission limits for 
individual sources. Any such director discretion determinations under 
this rule must be submitted to EPA for approval as individual SIP 
revisions. In the absence of EPA approval, the enforceable requirements 
of the SIP are the applicable emission limit(s) in subsection (4)(B) and 
the compliance determination provisions stated in subsection(5)(B)1 or 
(5)(B)2.
    (f) The Administrator approves Rule 10 CSR 10-6.120 as identified 
under Sec. 52.1320(c)(76), under the following terms, to which the state 
of Missouri has agreed. Subparagraph (2)(B)2.B.(IV) contains a provision 
whereby the Director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources has 
discretion to approve revisions to the Doe Run Herculaneum work practice 
manual. Any revisions to the work practice manual, pursuant to this 
rule, must be submitted to EPA for approval as an individual SIP 
revision. Thus, any existing federally approved work practices remain in 
effect, until such time that subsequent revisions are submitted to EPA 
and approved as SIP revisions.
    (g) The Missouri portion of the Kansas City metropolitan area was 
designated as nonattainment for ozone in

[[Page 154]]

40 CFR part 81. Therefore, the Administrator approves continuation of 
the 7.8 RVP limit as federally enforceable in the Kansas City 
metropolitan area, even after the area is redesignated to attainment, 
because of its nonattainment designation effective January 6, 1992. 
Also, the requirement for 7.8 psi RVP volatility is deemed necessary to 
ensure attainment and maintenance of the ozone standard as demonstrated 
by the emissions inventory projections (based on use of 7.8 psi RVP) in 
Missouri's ozone maintenance plan for the Kansas City metropolitan area.
    (h) The state of Missouri commits to revise 10 CSR 6.300 to remove 
language in paragraphs (3)(C)4. and (9)(B) which is more stringent than 
the language in the Federal General Conformity rule. In a letter to Mr. 
Dennis Grams, Regional Administrator, EPA, dated December 7, 1995, Mr. 
David Shorr, Director, MDNR, stated:

    We commit to initiating a change in the wording in the above 
paragraphs [paragraphs (3)(C)4. and (9)(B)] of Missouri rule 10 CSR 10-
6.300, and to submit the change to EPA within one year from the date of 
this letter [December 7, 1995]. We intend that the change will give our 
rule the same stringency as the General Conformity Rule.

    (i) Emission limitations and related provisions which are 
established in Missouri's operation permits as federally enforceable 
conditions shall be enforceable by EPA. EPA reserves the right to deem 
permit conditions not federally enforceable. Such a determination will 
be made according to appropriate procedures, and be based upon the 
permit, permit approval procedures, or permit requirements which do not 
conform with the operating permit program requirements or the 
requirements of EPA's underlying regulations.
    (j) The state of Missouri revised 10 CSR 10-6.300 to remove language 
in paragraphs (3)(C)4 and (9)(B) which made the language more stringent 
than that contained in the Federal general conformity rule. This 
fulfills the requirements of the conditional approval granted effective 
May 10, 1996, as published on March 11, 1996.
    (k) The state of Missouri revised 10 CSR 10-2.390 for Kansas City 
and 10 CSR 10-5.480 for St. Louis to update the transportation 
conformity requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart T, 
effective November 14, 1995.
    (l) The Administrator conditionally approves Missouri emergency rule 
10 CSR 10-2.330 under Sec. 52.1320(c)(98). Full approval is contingent 
on the state submitting the permanent rule, to the EPA, by November 30, 
1997.
    (m) The Administrator approves Missouri rule 10 CSR 10-2.330 under 
Sec. 52.1320(c)(105). This fulfills the requirements of the conditional 
approval granted effective November 10, 1997, as published on October 9, 
1997.

Sec. 52.1325  Legal authority.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.232(b) of this chapter are not met 
since the following deficiencies exist in local legal authority.
    (1) St. Louis County Division of Air Pollution Control:
    (i) Authority to require recordkeeping is lacking (Sec. 51.230(e) of 
this chapter).
    (ii) Authority to make emission data available to the public is 
inadequate because section 612.350, St. Louis County Air Pollution 
Control Code, requires confidential treatment in certain circumstances 
if the data concern secret processes (Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter).
    (2) St. Louis City Division of Air Pollution Control:
    (i) Authority to require recordkeeping is lacking (Sec. 51.230(e) of 
this chapter).
    (ii) Authority to require reports on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from stationary sources is lacking (Sec. 51.230(e) of this 
chapter).
    (iii) Authority to require installation, maintenance, and use of 
emission monitoring devices is lacking. Authority to make emission data 
available to

[[Page 155]]

the public is inadequate because Section 39 of Ordinance 54699 requires 
confidential treatment in certain circumstances if the data relate to 
production or sales figures or to processes or production unique to the 
owner or operator or would tend to affect adversely the competitive 
position of the owner or operator (Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter).
    (3) Kansas City Health Department:
    (i) Authority to require recordkeeping is lacking (Sec. 51.230(e) of 
this chapter).
    (4) Independence Health Department:
    (i) Authority to require recordkeeping is lacking (Sec. 51.230(e) of 
this chapter).
    (ii) Authority to make emission data available to the public is 
lacking since section 11.161 of the code of the city of Independence 
requires confidential treatment in certain circumstances if the data 
relate to secret processes or trade secrets affecting methods or results 
of manufacture (Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter).
    (5) Springfield Department of Health:
    (i) Authority to abate emissions on an emergency basis is lacking 
(Sec. 51.230(c) of this chapter).
    (ii) Authority to require recordkeeping is lacking (Sec. 51.230(e) 
of this chapter).
    (iii) Authority to make emission data available to the public is 
inadequate because section 2A-42 of the Springfield City Code requires 
confidential treatment of such data in certain circumstances 
(Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter).
    (c) The provisions of Sec. 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met 
since statutory, authority to prevent construction, modification, or 
operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or 
combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions 
of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance 
of a national air quality standard is not adequate.

Regional Office within 45 days of each exceedance.
    (3) When an appropriate number of verifiable exceedances of the 24-
hour standard occur, calculated according to section 2.0 of the 
PM<INF>10</INF> SIP Development Guideline, or when an exceedance of the 
annual PM<INF>10</INF> standard occurs, acknowledge that a nonattainment 
problem exists and immediately notify the Regional Office.
    (4) Within 30 days of the notification referred to in paragraph 
(a)(3) of this section, or within 37 months of promulgation of the 
PM<INF>10</INF> standards, whichever comes first, determine whether 
measures in the existing SIP will assure timely attainment and 
maintenance of the PM<INF>10</INF> standards and immediately notify the 
Regional Office.
    (5) Within 6 months of the notification referred to in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section, adopt and submit to EPA a PM<INF>10</INF> 
control strategy that assures attainment as expeditiously as practicable 
but no later than 3 years from approval of the committal SIP.
    An emission inventory will be compiled for the identified Group II 
areas. If either area is found to be violating the PM<INF>10</INF> 
standards, the inventory will be completed as part of the PM<INF>10</INF> 
SIP for that area on a schedule consistent with that outlined in 
paragraphs 3, 4, and 5. If the PM<INF>10</INF> standards are not 
violated, the inventory will be completed not later than July 1, 1989, 
and submitted to EPA not later than August 31, 1990, as part of the 
determination of adequacy of the current SIP to attain and maintain the 
PM<INF>10</INF> air quality standards.
    (b) We request that the total suspended particulate nonattainment 
areas in Omaha and Weeping Water (all secondary nonattainment) and 
Louisville (Primary nonattainment) be redesignated to unclassifiable.

Sec. 52.1473  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
in Washoe County, since the plan does not provide procedures for making 
emission data, as correlated with allowable emissions, available to the 
public. In addition, Chapter 020.065 of the ``Air Pollution Control 
Regulations'' of the District Board of Health of Washoe County in the 
Northwest Nevada Intrastate Region is disapproved since it contains 
provisions which restrict the public availability of emission data as 
correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control 
measures.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of

[[Page 181]]

the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions 
from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by 
the Regional administrator to determine whether such source is in 
compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

section shall be determined using the continuous measurement system(s) 
installed, calibrated, maintained and operated in accordance with the 
requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. For all stacks 
equipped with the measurement system(s) required by paragraph (d)(4) of 
this section, a 6-hour average sulfur dioxide emission rate shall be 
calculated as of the end of each clock hour, for the preceding six 
hours, in the following manner:
    (a) Divide each 6-hour period into 24 15-minute segments.
    (b) Determine on a compatible basis a sulfur dioxide concentration 
and stack gas flow rate measurement for each 15-minute period for each 
affected stack. These measurements may be obtained either by continuous 
integration of sulfur dioxide concentration and stack gas flow rate 
measurements (from the respective affected facilities) recorded during 
the 15-minute period or from the arithmetic average of any number of 
sulfur dioxide concentration and stack gas flow readings equally spaced 
over the 15-minute period. In the later case, the same number of 
concentration readings shall be taken in each 15-minute period and the 
readings shall be similarly spaced within each 15-minute period.
    (c) Calculate the arithmetic average (lbs SO<INF>2</INF>/hr) from 
all 24 emission rate measurements in each 6-hour period for each stack.
    (d) Total the average sulfur dioxide emission rates for all affected 
stacks.
    (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this 
section, compliance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section shall also be determined by using the methods described below at 
such times as may be specified by the Administrator. For all stacks 
equipped with the measurement system(s) required by paragraph (d)(4) of 
this section, a 6-hour average sulfur dioxide emission rate (lbs 
SO<INF>2</INF>/hr) shall be determined as follows:
    (a) The test of each stack emission rate shall be conducted while 
the processing units vented through such stack are operating at or above 
the maximum rate at which they will be operated and under such other 
conditions as the Administrator mayspecify.
    (b) Concentrations of sulfur dioxide in emissions shall be 
determined by using Method 8 as described in part 60 of this chapter. 
The analytical and computational portions of Method 8 as they relate to 
determination of sulfuric acid mist and sulfur trioxide as well as 
isokinetic sampling may be omitted from the over-all test procedure.
    (c) Three independent sets of measurements of sulfur dioxide 
concentrations and stack gas volumetric flow rates shall be conducted 
during three 6-hour periods for each stack. Each 6-hour period will 
consist of three consecutive 2-hour periods. Measurements of emissions 
from all stacks on the smelter premises need not be conducted 
simultaneously. All tests must be completed within a 72-hour period.
    (d) In using Method 8, traversing shall be conducted according to 
Method 1 as described in part 60 of this chapter. The minimum sampling 
volume for each two hour test shall be 40 ft <SUP>3</SUP> corrected to 
standard conditions, dry basis.
    (e) The volumetric flow rate of the total effluent from each stack 
evaluated shall be determined by using Method 2 as described in part 60 
of this chapter and by traversing according to Method 1. Gas analysis 
shall be performed by using the integrated sample technique of Method 4 
as described inpart 60 of this chapter except that stack gases arising 
only from a sulfuric acid production unit may be considered to have zero 
moisture content.
    (f) The gas sample shall be extracted at a rate proportional to the 
gas velocity at the sampling point.
    (g) For each two hour test period, the sulfur dioxide emission rate 
for each stack shall be determined by multiplying the stack gas 
volumetric flow rate (ft <SUP>3</SUP>/hr at standard conditions, dry 
basis) by the sulfur dioxide concentration (lb/ft <SUP>3</SUP> at 
standard conditions, dry basis). The emission rate in lbs/hr-maximum 6-
hour average for each stack is determined by calculating the arithmetic 
average of the results of the three 2-hour tests.
    (h) The sum total of sulfur dioxide emissions from the smelter 
premises in lbs/hr is determined by adding together

[[Page 185]]

the emission rates (lbs/hr) from all stacks equipped with the 
measurement system(s) required by paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

Sec. 52.1573  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves New Jersey's plans for attainment and maintenance of the 
national ambient air quality standards under section 110 of the Clean 
Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies 
all requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 
1977, except as noted below in Sec. 52.1581. In addition, continued 
satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the 
SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 
1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January, 1978 and 
January, 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of 
additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the 
previous January.

Sec. 52.1574  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission 
data is inadequate.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the

[[Page 222]]

nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other 
information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to 
determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission 
limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable 
plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

Sec. 52.1577  Compliance schedules.

    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.261 of this chapter are not met 
since Chapter 7, section 7.1(c) of New Jersey's ``Air Pollution Control 
Code'' permits certain sources to defer compliance with Chapter 7 until 
after the required date for attainment of the national standards for 
particulate matter.
    (c) The requirements of Sec. 51.262(a) of this chapter are not met 
since Chapter 7 of New Jersey's ``Air Pollution Control Code'' does not 
provide for periodic increments of progress toward compliance for those 
sources with compliance schedules extending over a period of 18 or more 
months.
    (d) Regulation for increments of progress. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner or operator of any 
stationary source in the State of New Jersey to which an exception 
extending beyond January 31, 1974, is applicable under Chapter 7, 
section 7.1(c) of the New Jersey Air Pollution Control Code shall, no 
later than 120 days following the effective date of this paragraph, 
submit to the Administrator for approval, a proposed compliance schedule 
that demonstrates compliance with the emission limitations prescribed by 
Chapter 7 of the New Jersey Air Pollution Control Code as expeditiously 
as practicable but no later than July 31, 1975. The compliance schedule 
shall provide for periodic increments of progress towards compliance. 
The dates for achievement of such increments shall be specified. 
Increments of progress shall include, but not be limited to: Submittal 
of the final control plan to the Administrator; letting of necessary 
contracts

[[Page 223]]

for construction or process changes or issuance of orders for the 
purchase of component parts to accomplish emission control or process 
modification; initiation of onsite construction or installation of 
emission control equipment or process change; completion of onsite 
construction or installation of emission control equipment or process 
modification; and final compliance.

satisfaction of the Administrator that compliance with the applicable 
regulations will be achieved on or before January 31, 1974, no 
compliance schedule shall be required.
    (3) Any owner or operator required to submit a compliance schedule 
pursuant to this paragraph shall within 5 days after the deadline for 
each increment of progress, certify to the Administrator whether or not 
the required increment of the approved compliance schedule has been met.
    (4) Any compliance schedule adopted by the State and approved by the 
Administrator shall satisfy the requirements of this paragraph for the 
affected source.

Sec. 52.1578  Review of new sources and modifications.

    (a) Subchapter 18 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled, 
``Control and Prohibitions of Air Pollution from Ambient Air Quality in 
Nonattainment Areas (Emission Offset Rule),'' N.J.A.C. 7:27-18.1 et 
seq., as submitted to EPA on August 5, 1980 by the New Jersey Department 
of Environmental Protection, is approved for the entire State of New 
Jersey, with the following provisions:
    (1) The definition of ``significant emission increase'' as it 
appears in section 7:27-18.1, entitled, ``Definitions,'' is disapproved. 
The following definition of ``significant emission increase'' is 
applicable: ``An increase, since December 21, 1976, in the rate of 
allowable emissions, including fugitive pollutant emissions, at a 
facility of any criteria pollutant greater than or equal to 50 tons per 
year, 1,000 pounds per day, or 100 pounds per hour, not including 
decreases in the rates of allowable emissions except where such 
decreases are contemporaneous with emission increases. The increase in 
the rates of allowable emissions shall be the cumulative total of 
increases from all new or altered equipment for which permits have been 
issued on or after December 21, 1976 and for which permit applications 
have been received by the Department, and the fugitive emissions 
associated with that equipment. The hourly and daily rates shall apply 
only with respect to a pollutant for which a national ambient air 
quality standard for a period not exceeding 24 hours has been 
established.
    (2) Subsection (e)(1) under section 7:27-18.2, entitled, ``General 
Provisions,'' is disapproved and replaced with the following: ``The 
requirements of paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section 
shall again become applicable when proposed new construction or 
alterations at the facility would cause the increase in the rate of 
allowable emissions of that criteria pollutant to again exceed 50 tons 
per year, 1,000 pounds per day, or 100 pounds per hour whichever is most 
restrictive. The accumulation of increases in the rate of allowable 
emissions shall resume from zero after each application of paragraphs 
(c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section.''

<R05>
Sec. 52.1580   Conditional approval.

    (a) Enhanced inspection and maintenance. (1) The State of New 
Jersey's March 27, 1996 submittal for an enhanced motor vehicle 
inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, as amended on November 27, 
1996 and April 22, 1997, is conditionally approved based on certain 
contingencies, for an interim period to last 18 months. If New Jersey

[[Page 224]]

fails to start its program by November 15, 1997, the interim approval 
granted under the provisions of the NHSDA, which EPA believes allows the 
State to take full credit in its 15 percent plan for all of the emission 
reduction credits in its proposal, will convert to a disapproval after a 
finding letter is sent to the State by EPA. If the State fails to submit 
to EPA the final modeling demonstrating that its program will meet the 
relevant enhanced I/M performance standard by February 1, 1998, the 
conditional approval will automatically convert to a disapproval as 
explained under Section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act.
    (2) In addition to the above condition, the State must correct eight 
minor, or de minimus, deficiencies related to the CAA requirements for 
enhanced I/M. The minor deficiencies are listed in EPA's conditional 
interim final rulemaking on New Jersey's motor vehicle inspection and 
maintenance program published on May 14, 1997. Although satisfaction of 
these deficiencies does not affect the conditional interim approval 
status of the State's rulemaking, these deficiencies must be corrected 
in the final I/M SIP revision to be submitted at the end of the 18-month 
interim period.
    (3) EPA is also approving this SIP revision under Section 110(k), 
for its strengthening effect on the plan.
    (b) 15 Percent and 9 Percent Ozone Plans. New Jersey's December 31, 
1996 and February 25, 1997 submittals for the 15 Percent Rate of 
Progress Plan (15 Percent Plan) and 9 Percent Reasonable Further 
Progress Plan (9 Percent Plan) for the Northern New Jersey (New York, 
Northern New Jersey, Long Island Area) nonattainment area and the 
Trenton (Philadelphia, Wilmington, Trenton Area) nonattainment area, is 
conditionally approved for an interim period as referenced in paragraph 
(a) of this section. The conditions for approvability are as follows:
    (1) New Jersey must remodel by July 30, 1998 to determine 
affirmatively the creditable reductions from the enhanced inspection and 
maintenance (I/M) program as used in the 15 Percent and 9 Percent Plans. 
This remodeling must be in accordance with EPA guidance documents: 
``Date by which States Need to Achieve all the Reductions Needed for the 
15 Percent Plan from I/M and Guidance for Recalculation,'' note from 
John Seitz and Margo Oge, dated August 13, 1996, and ``Modeling 15 
Percent VOC Reductions from I/M in 1999--Supplemental Guidance'', 
memorandum from Gay MacGregor and Sally Shaver, dated December 23, 1996. 
Should the State fail to fulfill the remodeling condition by July 30, 
1998, this conditional interim approval will convert to a disapproval 
pursuant to section 110(k)(4) of the Clean Air Act.
    (2) New Jersey must demonstrate by December 14, 1998 that 15 percent 
and 9 percent emission reductions are still achievable in the Northern 
New Jersey and Trenton nonattainment areas as required by sections 
182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act and in accordance with 
EPA's policies and guidance.

Sec. 52.1582  Control strategy and regulations: Ozone (volatile organic substances) and carbon monoxide.

    (a) Subchapter 16 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled 
``Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Volatile Organic 
Substances,'' N.J.A.C. 7:27-16.1 et seq. as revised on December 31, 1981 
and effective March 1, 1982, is approved with the following provisions 
and conditions:
    (1) Subsections 16.6(c)(4) and 16.6(c)(5) are approved. The State 
must comply with the public participation procedures it submitted to EPA 
on December 19, 1980 and must supply to EPA a copy of each notice of a 
proposed bubble that it supplies the public. In addition, the State must 
promptly transmit to EPA notice setting forth each set of emission 
limits approved by the state pursuant to subsections 16.6(c)(4) and 
16.6(c)(5) as well as the emission limitations previously applicable. 
Finally, the State must transmit any relevant additional material EPA 
may request, and it must notify the public of an approved set of 
emission limits at the time it transmits notice of those limits to EPA.

[[Page 225]]

    (2) Emission limitations required by subsections 16.5(a), 16.6(a) 
and 16.6(b) are applicable requirements of the New Jersey SIP for the 
purposes of section 113 of the Clean Air Act and shall be enforceable by 
EPA and by citizens in the same manner as other requirements of the SIP; 
except that emission limitations adopted by the State under and which 
comply with subsections 16.6(c) (4) and (5) shall be the applicable 
requirements of the New Jersey SIP in lieu of those contained in 
subsections 16.5(a), 16.6(a) and 16.6(b) and shall be enforceable by EPA 
and by citizens, if the State meets the requirements set out in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (3) Although EPA approves the variance provisions in subchapter 
7:27-16.9 and 7:27-16.10, in order to be considered as part of the SIP, 
each variance issued under these provisions must be submitted to and 
approved by EPA as a SIP revision.
    (4) The December 17, 1979 version of Subchapter 16 is approved as a 
part of the SIP only to the extent that it addresses compliance dates 
for Group I Control Techniques Guideline source categories.
    (b) Subchapter 17 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled 
``Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Toxic Substances,'' 
N.J.A.C. 7:27-17.1 et seq. as revised on October 17, 1979 and effective 
December 17, 1979, is approved for the regulation of perchloroethylene 
dry cleaners, as further clarified in a New Jersey Department of 
Environmental Protection memorandum ``Subchapter 17 Requirements for 
Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning Systems'' dated October 25, 1982.
    (c) The November 15, 1993 SIP revision submitted by the New Jersey 
Department of Environmental Protection and Energy demonstrates the 
fulfillment of section 182(b)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act for states to 
adopt RACT regulations for all sources for which EPA has issued a CTG 
before enactment of the 1990 Clean Air Act.
    (d)(1) The base year ozone precursor emission inventory requirement 
of section 182(a)(1) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments has been 
satisfied for the Atlantic City, New York/ Northern New Jersey/Long 
Island, Philadelphia/Wilmington/ Trenton, and Allentown/Bethlehem/Easton 
areas of New Jersey. The inventory was submitted on November 15, 1993 
and amended on November 21, 1994 by the New Jersey Department of 
Environmental Protection as a revision to the ozone State Implementation 
Plan (SIP). Revisions to the 1990 base year emission inventory dated 
December 31, 1996 for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and 
Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas of New Jersey have 
been approved.
    (2) The base year carbon monoxide emission inventory requirement of 
section 187(a)(1) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments has been 
satisfied for the entire State. The inventory was submitted on November 
15, 1992 and amended on September 28, 1995 by the New Jersey Department 
of Environmental Protection as a revision to the carbon monoxide State 
Implementation Plan.
    (3) The 1996 and 1999 ozone projection year emission inventories 
included in New Jersey's December 31, 1996 State Implementation Plan 
revision for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and 
Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas have been approved.
    (4) The conformity emission budgets for the three metropolitan 
planning organizations and McGuire Air Force Base included in New 
Jersey's December 31, 1996 State Implementation Plan revision have been 
approved.
    (5) The photochemical assessment monitoring stations network 
included in New Jersey's December 31, 1996 State Implementation Plan 
revision for the New York/Northern New Jersey/Long Island and 
Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton nonattainment areas has been approved.
    (6) The demonstration that emissions from growth in vehicle miles 
traveled will not increase motor vehicle emissions and, therefore, 
offsetting measures are not necessary which was included in New Jersey's 
December 31, 1996 State Implementation Plan revision for the New York/
Northern New Jersey/Long Island and Philadelphia/Wilmington/Trenton 
nonattainment areas has been approved.
    (7) The enforceable commitments to: participate in the consultative 
process

[[Page 226]]

to address regional transport; adopt additional control measures as 
necessary to attain the ozone standard, meet rate of progress 
requirements, and eliminate significant contribution to nonattainment 
downwind; identify any reductions that are needed from upwind areas for 
the area to meet the ozone standard; and implement the Ozone Transport 
Commission NO<INF>X</INF> Memorandum of Understanding included in New 
Jersey's December 31, 1996 State Implementation Plan revision for the

    (b) Before any steam or electric power generating facility in Zone 
3, as defined in N.J.A.C. 7:27-10.1, burning fuel oil on June 4, 1979, 
having a rated hourly gross heat input greater than 200,000,000 British 
Thermal Units (BTU's), and capable of burning coal without major 
reconstruction or construction, which facility was in operation prior to 
May 6, 1968, or group of such facilities having a combined rated hourly 
capacity greater than 450,000,000 BTU's may be permitted by the State to 
convert to the use of coal, the State shall submit to EPA a copy of the 
proposed permit together with an air quality analysis employing 
methodology acceptable to EPA. If EPA determines, on the basis of the 
submitted analysis, that the proposed coal conversion will not interfere 
with the attainment or maintenance of air quality standards and will not 
be the cause for any Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) 
increment to be exceeded, then the permit authorizing conversion may 
become effective immediately upon the publication of such a 
determination (as a Notice) in the Federal Register. If EPA determines 
that the submitted analysis is inadequate or that it shows that the 
proposed conversion will interfere with attainment or maintenance of air 
quality standards or cause any PSD increment to be exceeded, then EPA 
shall so inform the State of its determination, and the permit 
authorizing conversion shall not become effective and conversion shall 
not

occur until an adequate analysis is submitted or, if necessary, until a 
control strategy revision which would require any necessary emission 
reductions is submitted by the State and placed into effect as an EPA 
approved revision to the implementation plan. In addition, this same 
procedure shall apply to any State permit applied for that would 
authorize a relaxation in the sulfur-in-coal limitation at any such 
facility, as defined above in this paragraph, having already been 
granted a permit to convert to coal.
    (c) The U.S. Gypsum Co. in Clark, New Jersey is permitted to burn 
fuel oil with a sulfur content of 2.0 percent, by weight, at either 
Boiler 1, 2 or 3 until March 31, 1985 or until Boiler 4 is ready to 
burn coal, whichever occurs first. Such oil burning must conform with 
New Jersey requirements and conditions as set forth in applicable 
regulations and administrative orders.

Sec. 52.1673  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this section, the Administrator 
approves the New York State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the attainment 
and maintenance of the national standards under section 110(a)(2) of the 
Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan 
satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title I of the Clean Air Act, as 
amended in 1977. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements 
of Part D for the ozone element of the SIP depends on the adoption and 
submittal of requirements for reasonable available control technology 
(RACT) by January 1985 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent 
January of additional RACT requirements for sources covered by Control 
Techniques Guidelines (CTGs) issued by the previous January.

    (a)-(c) [Reserved]
    (d) Section 225.3(e) of Subchapter A, Chapter III, Title 6 of New 
York State's Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations, is 
disapproved since it does not provide for the type of permanent control 
necessary to assure attainment and maintenance of national standards.
    (e) Any special limitation promulgated by the Commissioner under 6 
NYCRR section 225.2(b) and (c), any exception issued by the Commissioner 
under 6 NYCRR section 225.3, and any permission issued by the 
Commissioner under 6 NYCRR section 225.5(c) shall not exempt any person 
from the requirements otherwise imposed by 6 NYCRR Part 225; provided 
that the Administrator may approve such special limitation, exception or 
permission as a plan revision when the provisions of this part, section 
110 (a)(3)(A) of the Act, and 40 CFR part 51 (relating to approval of 
and revisions to State implementation plans) have been satisfied with 
respect to such special limitation, exception or permission.
    (f) The following applies to the Environmental Protection Agency's 
approval as a SIP revision of the ``special limitation'' promulgated by 
the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental 
Conservation on November 20, 1979 permitting the purchase and use by the 
Consolidated Edison Company of New York,

    (2) If any of the facilities identified in paragraph (g)(1) of this 
section, fail to meet the requirements of that paragraph, the 
Consolidated Edison Company shall not burn fuel oil with a sulfur 
content in excess of 0.30 percent, by weight. For this purpose, 
Consolidated Edison shall maintain a reserve supply of fuel oil with a 
maximum sulfur content of 0.30 percent, by weight, and shall have a 
mechanism to switch promptly to the use of such fuel oil.
    (3) EPA's approval of this revision to the New York SIP will extend 
for a period of twelve months from [August 11, 1980] or such longer 
period limited to twelve months from the date on which fuel oil with a 
sulfur content exceeding 0.30 percent, by weight, is first burned at any 
of the affected Consolidated Edison facilities. However, once the use of 
high sulfur fuel oil has commenced, failure to meet any of the 
conversion dates specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall not 
extend the period of EPA approval.

by July 1, 1981.
    (g) The Environmental Protection Agency has approved a New York 
State Implementation Plan revision relating to the SO<INF>2</INF> 
emission limit for units 4 and 5 of Orange and Rockland Utilities' 
Lovett generating station. The revision which allows Lovett to burn coal 
at units 4 and 5 was submitted by the New York State Department of 
Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) on September 18, 1990, with 
additional materials submitted on April 12, 1991, and June 3, 1991. This 
action sets the emission limit applicable to the facility to 1.0 pound 
per million British thermal units (MMBtu) for units 4 and 5 if both are 
operated on coal, or to 1.5 lb/

[[Page 257]]

MMBtu for one unit if the other is operated on fuel oil, natural gas or 
is not operated at all, as set forth in the Certificates to Operate 
issued by NYSDEC on April 3, 1991. The SO<INF>2</INF> emission limit, 
monitoring and recordkeeping requirements pertaining to the

<R05>
Sec. 52.1680  Control strategy: Monitoring and reporting.

    (a) Section 227.6 (a) and (f) are disapproved because they are not 
consistent with the continuous monitoring and reporting requirements of 
40 CFR 51.214.

Sec. 52.1681  Control strategy: Lead.

    As part of the attainment demonstration for lead, the State of New 
York has committed to rate all sources of lead or lead compound 
emissions with either an ``A'' or ``B'' environmental rating pursuant to 
6 NYCRR Part 212.

<R05>
Sec. 52.1682  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.1683  Control strategy: Ozone.

    (a) The State of New York has certified to the satisfaction of the 
EPA that no sources are located in the nonattainment area of the State 
which are covered by the following Control Techniques Guidelines:
    (1) Natural Gas/Gasoline Processing Plants.
    (2) Air Oxidation Processes at Synthetic Organic Chemical 
Manufacturing Industries.
    (3) Manufacture of High-Density Polyethylene, Polypropylene, and 
Polystyrene Resins.
    (b) EPA approves on September 20, 1991 a request by New York State 
to implement modified I/M audit and enforcement procedures for a two-
year trial period as specified in a September 19, 1988 letter from 
Thomas Allen, NYSDEC, to Raymond Werner, EPA, which also provided 
justification for such modifications.
    (c) The State of New York's March 27, 1996 submittal for an enhanced 
motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, as amended on 
September 16, 1997, and September 17, 1997, is approved with an interim 
period to last 18 months. If New York fails to start its program by 
November 15, 1998, the interim approval granted under the provisions of 
the NHSDA, which EPA believes allows the State to take full credit in 
its 15 percent plan for all of the emission reduction credits in its 
proposal, will convert to a disapproval after a finding letter is sent 
to the State by EPA.
    (d) The State must correct six minor, or de minimus, deficiencies 
related to the CAA requirements for enhanced I/M. The minor deficiencies 
are listed in EPA's interim final rulemaking on New York's motor vehicle 
inspection and maintenance program published on October 24, 1997. 
Although satisfaction of these deficiencies does not affect the interim 
approval status of the State's rulemaking, these deficiencies must be 
corrected in the final I/M SIP revision to be submitted at the end of 
the 18-month interim period.
    (e) EPA is also approving this SIP revision under Section 110(k) for 
its strengthening effect on the plan.
    (f) Attainment Determination--EPA has determined that, as of 
February 5, 1998, the Poughkeepsie ozone nonattainment area (consisting 
of Dutchess and Putnam Counties and northern Orange County) has air 
monitoring data that attains the one-hour

[[Page 263]]

ozone standard and that the requirements of section 182(b)(1) 
(reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration) and related 
requirements of section 172(c)(9) (contingency measures) of the Clean 
Air Act do not apply to the area.

    (a) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air 
Act are not met, since the plan does not include approvable procedures 
for preventing the significant deterioration of air quality.
    (b) Regulations for preventing significant deterioration of air 
quality. The provisions of Sec. 52.21 (b) through (w) are hereby 
incorporated and made a part of the applicable state plan for the State 
of New York.

Sec. 52.1772  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves North Carolina's plans for the attainment and maintenance of 
the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. 
Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements 
of Part D, Title I of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as 
noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of 
Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and 
submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the sources covered 
by CTGs issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and 
submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for 
sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b) New Source review permits issued pursuant to section 173 of the 
Clean Air Act will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of 
Section V of the Emission Offset (Interpretative Rule) published on 
January 16, 1979 (44 FR 3274) are met.

Sec. 52.1781  Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.

    (a) The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as outlined 
in the three-year variance for the coal-fired units of Duke Power 
Company and Carolina Power & Light Company from the particulate emission 
limits of Regulation 15 N.C.A.C. 2D.0503, with submittals on June 18, 
September 7, October 31, and December 14, 1979, by the North Carolina 
Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, is 
disapproved only insofar that it provides an exemption for excess 
emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and verified malfunction. 
(See Sec. 52.1770(c)(22).)
    (b) The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as contained 
in regulation 15 NCAC 2D.0536, which was submitted on January 24 and 
February 21, 1983, and on December 17, 1985, and became effective on 
August 1, 1987, is disapproved insofar as it provides annual opacity 
limits for the seven plants of Duke Power Company and for Plants Roxboro 
and Cape Fear of Carolina Power and Light Company.
    (c) The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as contained 
in revisions to 15 NCAC 2D.0536 submitted on January 24, 1983, February 
21, 1983, and December 17, 1985, is disapproved as it applies to the 
Carolina Power and Light Asheville, Lee, Sutton and Weatherspoon Plants. 
These plants will continue to be subject to the particulate limits of 15 
NCAC 2D.0503, contained in the original SIP, submitted to EPA on January 
27, 1972, and approved on May 31, 1982 at 47 FR 10884.
    (d) In letters dated February 4, 1987, and June 15, 1987, the North 
Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development 
certified that no emission limits in the State's plan are based on 
dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's stack height rules.

Agency (OEPA) submitted amendments to the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 
Chapter 3745-21 and supporting data to USEPA as a proposed revision to 
the ozone portion of its SIP. OAC Chapter 3745-21, entitled ``Carbon 
Monoxide, Photochemically Reactive Materials, Hydrocarbons, and Related 
Material Standards'', contains Ohio's VOC RACT I and II regulations. The 
amendments to these regulations are embodied in the OAC as follows: 
Definitions, Rule 3745-21-01; Attainment dates and compliance time 
schedules, Rule 3745-21-04; Control of emissions of organic compounds 
from stationary sources, Rule 3745-21-09; and Compliance test methods 
and procedures, Rule 3745-21-10. See (c)(15). USEPA is not taking action 
on the applicability of Rule 3745-21-09 to new sources of VOC, to the 
gasoline throughout exemption level for gasoline dispensing facilities, 
and to the compliance date extension for Honda of America Manufacturing, 
Inc. auto and motorcycle assembly plant in Marysville. USEPA is not 
taking action on OAC Rule 3745-21-

09(AA))(2)(a) which exempts any dry cleaning facility in which less than 
60,000 pounds of fabrics are cleaned per year. USEPA is not taking 
action on OAC Rule 3745-21-09(U)(2)(f) (i) and (ii) which apply to new 
sources (surface coating lines). USEPA is identifying deficiencies in 
the existing Rule 3745-21-09(D)(3) which contains an alternative daily 
emission limitation for can coating facilities. USEPA identified the 
following deficiencies within this rule: This rule presents equations 
for determining an alternative daily emission limitation. USEPA finds 
that the equations are incorrect in that they are based on volume of 
coating used (in gallons, excluding water), which in many cases can lead 
to erroneous results. Equivalency calculations for coatings should be 
performed on a basis of volume of coating solids used rather than volume 
of coating used. (45 FR 80824 gives an example calculation for can 
coating done on a volume solids basis.)

    (114) On November 12, 1996, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency 
submitted a request to incorporate section(G)(9)(g) of Rule 3745-21-07 
of the Ohio Administrative Code into the Ohio State Implementation Plan 
(SIP). Section (G)(9)(g) provides an additional exemption from organic 
compound emission controls for qualifying new sources. Because, in the 
process of adopting section(G)(9)(g), minor editorial changes were made 
to other parts of Rule 3745-21-07, the United States Environmental 
Protection Agency is incorporating all of Rule 3745-21-07 into the Ohio 
SIP. This will avoid confusion by making the SIP approved rule identical 
to the current State rule.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Rule 3745-21-07 of the Ohio Administrative Code, adopted October 
7, 1996, effective October 31, 1996, as certified by Donald R. 
Schregardus, Director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
    (115) On January 3, 1997, the Ohio EPA submitted a revision to the 
Hamilton County sulfur dioxide implementation plan for the Procter and 
Gamble Company, Ohio Administrative Code 3745-18-37(GG)(2), which limits 
combined average operating rate of all boilers (B001, B008, B021, and 
B022) to a maximum of 922 million BTU per hour for any calendar day. 
Boilers B001 and B008 are each allowed to emit 1.1 pounds of sulfur 
dioxide per million BTU actual heat input. Boiler B021 is limited to 
1.50 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million BTU; and boiler B022 is 
limited to 2.0 pounds of sulfur dioxide per million BTU average heat 
input.

    (116) On December 9, 1996, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency 
submitted two revisions to its sulfur dioxide rules. The first revision 
provides adjusted, State adopted limits for a Sun Oil Company facility. 
The second revision, applicable Statewide, exempts sources from 
operating hour limits on days when only natural gas is burned. Further, 
by letter of December 15, 1997, the State requested that U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency address the addition of emission limits 
for stationary gas turbines and stationary internal combustion engines 
in rule 3745-18-06 that have been adopted previously.

    (117) On August 1, 1997 the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency 
submitted a requested revision to the Ohio State Implementation Plan. 
This revision constituted amendments to the emissions statement 
reporting regulations approved on October 13, 1994 and codified in 
paragraph (c)(100) of this section. The revision is intended to limit 
the applicability of these rules to stationary sources located within 
the State's marginal and above ozone nonattainment areas.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Ohio Administrative Code Rule 3745-24-02 Applicability.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart the Administrator 
approves Ohio's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. 
Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plan satisfies all the 
requirements of Part D, Title 1 of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, 
except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the 
requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the 
adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by January 1, 1981 for the 
sources covered by CTGs between January 1978 and

[[Page 302]]

January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of 
additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the 
previous January.

Sec. 52.1876  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.1877  Control strategy: Photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons).

    (a) The requirements of Subpart G of this chapter are not met 
because the Ohio plan does not provide for the attainment and 
maintenance of the national standard for photochemical oxidants 
(hydrocarbons) in the Metropolitan Cincinnati interstate region by May 
31, 1975.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 52.14 are not met by Rule 3745-21-
09(N)(3) (a) and (e); Rule 3745-21-09(Z)(1)(a); Rule 3745-21-10, Section 
G; and Rule 3745-21-10, Section H, because these Ohio Rules do not 
provide for attainment and maintenance of the photochemical oxidant 
(hydrocarbon) standards throughout Ohio.
    (1) USEPA is disapproving new exemptions for the use of cutback 
asphalt [(Rule 3745-21-09(N)(3) (a) and (e)], because Ohio did not 
provide documentation regarding the temperature ranges in the additional 
two months that the State permits the use of cutback asphalts, and a 
lack of training is not sufficient reason for the 1000 gallons 
exemptions.
    (2) USEPA is disapproving Section V [Rule 3745-21-09(V)], because it 
contains an alternative leak testing procedure for gasoline tank trucks 
which USEPA finds to be unapprovable.
    (3) USEPA is disapproving exclusion of the external floating roof 
(crude oil) storage tanks from the secondary seal requirement [Rule 
3745-21-09(Z)(1)(a)], because Ohio has not demonstrated that the 
relaxation would not interfere

[[Page 303]]

with the timely attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for ozone.
    (4) USEPA is disapproving compliance test method Section G, [Rule 
3745-21-10] as an alternative leak testing procedure for gasoline tank 
trucks, because such action on Section G, is consistent with USEPA's 
action on Rule 3745-21-09(V), which USEPA finds to be unapprovable.
    (5) USEPA is disapproving compliance test method Section H, [Rule 
3745-21-10], which involves a pressure test of only the vapor recovery 
lines and associated equipment. Compliance test method Section H is 
inconsistent with USEPA's control technique guidances and with tank 
truck certification regulations that are in effect in 19 other States. 
In addition, OEPA has presented no acceptable evidence demonstrating why 
this rule constitutes RACT.

Sec. 52.1879  Review of new sources and modifications.

    (a) The requirements of sections 172, 173, 182, and 189 for 
permitting of major new sources and major modifications in nonattainment 
areas for ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide 
are not met, because Ohio's regulations exempt source categories which 
may not be exempted and because the State has not adopted the new 
permitting requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 in a 
clear or enforceable manner.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) The requirements of Sec. 51.161 of this chapter are not met 
because the State failed to submit procedures providing for public 
comment on review of new or modified stationary sources.
    (d) Regulation providing for public comment. (1) For purposes of 
this paragraph, Director shall mean the Director of the Ohio 
Environmental Protection Agency.
    (2) Prior to approval or disapproval of the construction or 
modification of a stationary source, the Director shall:
    (i) Make a preliminary determination whether construction or 
modification of the stationary source should be approved, approved with 
conditions or disapproved;
    (ii) Make available in at least one location in the region in which 
the proposed stationary source would be constructed or modified, a copy 
of all materials submitted by the owner or operator, a copy of the 
Director's preliminary determination, and a copy or summary of other 
materials, if any, considered by the Director in making his preliminary 
determination; and
    (iii) Notify the public, by prominent advertisement in a newspaper 
of general circulation in the region in which the proposed stationary 
source would be constructed or modified, of the opportunity for public 
comment on the information submitted by the owner or operator and the 
Director's preliminary determination on the approvability of the new or 
modified stationary source.
    (3) A copy of the notice required pursuant to this paragraph shall 
be sent to the Administrator through the appropriate regional office and 
to all other State and local air pollution control agencies having 
jurisdiction within the region where the stationary source will be 
constructed or modified.
    (4) Public comments submitted in writing within 30 days of the date 
such information is made available shall be considered by the Director 
in making his final decision on the application.
    (e) Approval-- The USEPA is approving exemption requests submitted 
by the State of Ohio on March 18, November 1, and November 15, 1994, 
from the requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. 
This approval exempts the following counties in Ohio from the 
NO<INF>X</INF>-related general and transportation conformity provisions; 
and nonattainment area NSR for new sources and modifications that are 
major for NO<INF>X:</INF> Clinton, Columbiana, Delaware, Franklin, 
Jefferson, Licking, Mahoning, Preble, Stark, and Trumbull. This approval 
also exempts the following counties in Ohio from the NO<INF>X</INF>-
related general conformity provisions, nonattainment area NSR for new 
sources and modifications that are major for NO<INF>X</INF>, 
NO<INF>X</INF> RACT; and a demonstration of compliance with the enhanced 
I/M performance standard for

[[Page 304]]

NO<INF>X:</INF> Ashtabula, Butler, Clermont, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Hamilton, 
Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, Summit and Warren. If, prior to 
redesignation to attainment, a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored 
in the Canton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Youngstown, and 
Steubenville areas, Preble County and Clinton County, the exemptions 
from the requirements of Section 182(f) of the Act in the applicable 
area(s) shall no longer apply.
    (f) Approval--USEPA is approving two exemption requests submitted by 
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency on September 20, 1993, and 
November 8, 1993, for the Toledo and Dayton ozone nonattainment areas, 
respectively, from the requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the 
Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the Lucas, Wood, Clark, Greene, 
Miami, and Montgomery Counties from the requirements to implement 
reasonably available control technology (RACT) for major sources of 
nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), nonattainment area new source review 
(NSR) for new sources and modifications that are major for 
NO<INF>X</INF>, and the NO<INF>X</INF>-related requirements of the 
general and transportation conformity provisions. For the Dayton ozone 
nonattainment area, the Dayton local area has opted for an enhanced 
inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs. Upon final approval of this 
exemption, the Clark, Greene, Miami, and Montgomery Counties shall not 
be required to demonstrate compliance with the enhanced I/M performance 
standard for NO<INF>X</INF>. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is 
monitored in the Toledo or Dayton area(s), the exemptions from the 
requirements of Section 182(f) of the Act in the applicable area(s) 
shall no longer apply.

Sec. 52.1880  Control strategy: Particulate matter.

    (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met 
because the Ohio plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of 
the secondary standards for particulate matter in the Greater 
Metropolitan Cleveland Intrastate Region and the Ohio portions of the 
Northwest Pennsylvania-Youngstown and the Steubenville-Weirton-Wheeling 
Interstate Regions.
    (b) In Pickaway County, Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Company, 
or any subsequent owner or operator of the Picway Generating Station, 
shall not operate simultaneously Units 3 and 4 (boilers 7 and 8) at any 
time. These units will terminate operation no later than October 1, 
1980.
    (c) Ohio Regulation EP-12 (open burning) is disapproved insofar as 
EP-12-03(D)(1) and EP-12-04(D)(1) allow open burning of hazardous or 
toxic materials.
    (d) Part D--Limited disapproval--Notwithstanding the approval of 
rules as specified in Sec. 52.1870(c)(97), USEPA disapproves the plan 
for Cuyahoga County because the plan fails to require timely 
implementation of reasonably available control measures and fails to 
assure attainment, and USEPA disapproves the plan for Jefferson County 
because the plan fails to assure attainment.
    (e)--(f) [Reserved]
    (g) The B.F. Goodrich Chemical Plant State Implementation Plan 
revision is being disapproved because it is not supported by an adequate 
attainment demonstration and therefore does not meet the requirements of 
Sec. 51.13(e).
    (h) Approval. On January 4, 1989, the State of Ohio submitted a 
committal SIP for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter equal 
to or less than 10 micrometers (PM<INF>10</INF>) for Ohio's Group II 
areas. The Group II areas of concern are in Belmont, Butler, Columbiana, 
Franklin, Hamilton, Lorain, Mahoning, Montgomery, Richland, Sandusky, 
Scioto, Seneca, Stark, Summit, Trumbull, and Wyandot Counties. The 
committal SIP contains all the requirements identified in the July 1, 
1987, promulgation of the SIP requirements for PM<INF>10</INF> at 52 FR 
24681.
    (i) Part D--Disapproval--Ohio's Part D TSP plan for the Middletown 
area is disapproved. Although USEPA is disapproving the plan, the 
emission limitations and other requirements in the

[[Page 305]]

federally approved SIP remain in effect. See Sec. 52.1870(c)(27).

calorific value is measured by ASTM Method D2015-66, D240-64, or D1826-
64) of all fossil and non-fossil fuels burned. Where two or more fossil 
fuel-fired steam generating units are vented to the same stack the heat 
input shall be the aggregate of all units vented to the stack.
    (vi) Owner or operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, 
controls, or supervises a facility, building, structure, or installation 
which directly or indirectly results or may result in emissions of any 
air pollutant for which a national standard is in effect.
    (vii) Primary zinc smelter means any installation engaged in the 
production, or any intermediate process in the production, of zinc or 
zinc oxide from the zinc sulfide ore concentrates through the use of

be considered as a single process for purposes of this regulation.
    (ix) Process weight means the total weight of all materials and 
solid fuels introduced into any specific process. Liquid and gaseous 
fuels and combustion air will not be considered as part of the process 
weight unless they become part of the product. For a cyclical or batch 
operation, the process weight per hour will be derived by dividing the 
total process weight by the number of hours from the beginning of any 
given process to the completion thereof, excluding any time during which 
the equipment is idle. For a continuous operation, the process weight 
per hour will be derived by dividing the process weight for the number 
of hours in a given period of time by the number of hours in that 
period. For fluid catalytic cracking units, process weight shall mean

Sec. 52.1885  Control strategy: Ozone.

    (a) Part D--Approval. The following portions of the Ohio plan are 
approved:
    (1) The ozone portions of rules 01, 02, 03, 04 (except the portion 
disapproved below), 05, 06, 07, 08, 09 (except the portions 
conditionally approved below) and 10 of Chapter 3745-21 of the Ohio 
Administrative Code.
    (2) The Attainment Demonstrations for the following urban areas: 
Akron, Canton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo and 
Youngstown.
    (3) The Reasonable Further Progress Demonstration for the following 
areas: Akron, Canton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo 
and Youngstown.
    (4) The ozone nonattainment area plan for the rural nonattainment 
areas.
    (5) [Reserved]
    (6) Approval--On June 10, 1997, Ohio submitted revisions to the 
maintenance plans for the Toledo area (including Lucas and Wood 
counties), the Cleveland/Akron/Lorain area (including Lorain, Cuyahoga, 
Lake, Ashtabula, Geauga, Medina, Summit and Portage counties), and the 
Dayton-Springfield area (including Montgomery, Clark, Greene, and Miami 
counties). The revisions consist of an allocation of a portion of the 
safety margin in each area to the transportation conformity mobile 
source budget for that area. The mobile source budgets for 
transportation conformity purposes for Toledo are now: 35.85 tons per 
day of volatile organic compound emissions for the year 2005 and 35.19 
tons per day of oxides of nitrogen emissions for the year 2005. The 
mobile source budgets for transportation conformity purposes for 
Cleveland-Akron-Lorain are now: 82.7 tons per day of volatile organic 
compound emissions for the year 2006 and 104.4 tons per day of oxides of 
nitrogen emissions for the year 2006. For the Dayton-Springfield area, 
the oxides of

[[Page 333]]

nitrogen mobile source budget remains the same and the mobile source 
budget for volatile organic compounds is now 34.1 tons per day.
    (7) Approval--On October 20, 1997, Ohio submitted a revision to the 
maintenance plan for the Jefferson County area. The revision consists of 
an allocation of a portion of the safety margin in the area to the 
transportation conformity mobile source budget for that area. The mobile 
source budget for transportation conformity purposes for Jefferson 
County are now: 5.1 tons per day of volatile organic compound emissions 
for the year 2005 and 4.4 tons per day of oxides of nitrogen emissions 
for the year 2005.
    (b) The maintenance plans for the following counties are approved:

revised rule 04(c)(18) of Chapter 3745-21 of the Ohio Administrative 
Code as it applies to facilities formerly covered by the compliance 
schedule in old rule 04(c)(1) of Chapter 3745-21. This disapproval in 
and of itself does not result in the growth restrictions of section 
110(a)(2)(I).
    (d) Part D--No Action. USEPA at this time takes no action on the 
vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program required for those non-
attainment areas which have requested an extension to demonstrate ozone 
attainment.
    (e)-(q)  [Reserved]
    (r) Approval--USEPA is approving two exemption requests submitted by 
the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency on September 20, 1993, and 
November 8, 1993, for the Toledo and Dayton ozone nonattainment areas, 
respectively, from the requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the 
Clean Air Act. This approval exempts the Lucas, Wood, Clark, Greene, 
Miami, and Montgomery Counties from the requirements to implement 
reasonably available control technology (RACT) for major sources of 
nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>), nonattainment area new source review 
(NSR) for new sources and modifications that are major for 
NO<INF>X</INF>, and the NO<INF>X</INF>-related requirements of the 
general and transportation conformity provisions. For the Dayton ozone 
nonattainment area, the Dayton local area has opted for an enhanced 
inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. Upon final approval of this 
exemption, the Clark, Greene, Miami, and Montgomery Counties shall not 
be required to demonstrate compliance with the enhanced I/M performance 
standard for NO<INF>X</INF>. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is 
monitored in the Toledo or Dayton area(s), the exemptions from the 
requirements of Section 182(f) of the Act in the applicable area(s) 
shall no longer apply.
    (s) Approval--The 1990 base-year ozone emissions inventory 
requirement of Section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act has been satisfied 
for the following ozone nonattainment areas: Toledo (Lucas and Wood 
Counties) and Dayton (Clark, Greene, Miami, and Montgomery Counties).
    (t)  [Reserved]
    (u) Approval--The 1990 base-year ozone emissions inventory 
requirement of Section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act has been satisfied

    (w) Determination--USEPA is determining that, as of May 7, 1996, the 
Cleveland-Akron-Lorain ozone nonattainment area (which includes the 
Counties of Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage 
and Summit) have attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable 
further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 
182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air 
Act do not apply to the area.
    (x) Approval-- The USEPA is approving exemption requests submitted 
by the State of Ohio on March 18, November 1, and November 15, 1994, 
from the requirements contained in Section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act. 
This approval exempts the following counties in Ohio from the 
NO<INF>X</INF>-related general and transportation conformity provisions, 
and nonattainment area NSR for new sources and modifications that are

    (2) On April 20, 1994, Ohio submitted Rule 3745-35-07, entitled 
``Federally Enforceable Limitations on Potential to Emit,'' and 
requested authority to issue such limitations as conditions in State 
operating permits. On June 16, 1994, Ohio submitted a commitment to 
revise Rule 3745-35-07 to clarify that the rule provides for USEPA 
objection to permits after issuance. The revisions are approved provided 
Ohio fulfills this commitment by October 25, 1995.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Rule 3745-35-07, adopted April 4, 1994, effective April 20, 
1994.
    (3) Conditional Approval--On August 17, 1995, the Ohio Environmental 
Protection Agency submitted a revision to the State Implementation Plan. 
The submittal pertained to a plan for the implementation of the federal 
transportation conformity requirements at the State or local level in 
accordance with 40 CFR part 51, subpart T--Conformity to State or 
Federal Implementation Plans of Transportation Plans, Programs, and 
Projects Developed, Funded or Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the 
Federal Transit Act. This conditional approval is based, in part, on the 
State's commitment, submitted in a letter on April 1, 1996, to submit 
revised transportation conformity rules to incorporate the two 
amendments to the federal transportation

[[Page 336]]

conformity regulations. The State of Ohio committed to revise its 
transportation conformity rules by November 14, 1996. If the State 
ultimately fails to meet its commitment to meet these requirements 
within one year of final conditional approval, then USEPA's action for 
the State's requested SIP revision will automatically convert to a final 
disapproval.

Sec. 52.1972  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Oregon's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds that the carbon monoxide and ozone attainment 
plans satisfy all requirements of part D, title 1, of the Clean Air Act 
as amended in 1977, except as noted in the following sections. In 
addition, continued satisfaction of part D requirements for the ozone 
portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT 
requirements by July 1, 1980, for the sources covered by CTGs issued 
between January 1978 and January 1979. Additional RACT requirements must 
be submitted by each subsequent January for sources covered by CTGs 
issued by the previous January. Further, new source review permits 
issued pursuant to section 173 of the Clean Air Act will not be deemed 
valid by EPA unless the provisions of Section V of the emission offset 
interpretive rule published on January 16, 1979 (44 FR 3274) are met.

Sec. 52.2022  Extensions.

    (a) The Administrator hereby extends for 18 months the statutory 
timetable for submission of Pennsylvania's plan for attainment and 
maintenance of the secondary standards for sulfur oxides and particulate 
matter in the Southwest Pennsylvania Intrastate Region and in 
Pennsylvania's portion of the Metropolitan Philadelphia Interstate 
Region.
    (b) The Administrator hereby extends for 2 years the attainment date 
for the

[[Page 400]]

national standards for carbon monoxide in the Southwest Pennsylvania 
Intrastate Region, for 1 year the attainment date for the national 
standard for photochemical oxidants in the Southwest Pennsylvania 
Intrastate Region, and for 1 year the attainment date for the national 
standards for carbon monoxide in the Pennsylvania portion of the 
Metropolitan Philadelphia Interstate Region.
    (c) The Administrator hereby extends for 18 months, until July 1, 
1980, the statutory timetable for submission of Pennsylvania's plan for 
attainment and maintenance of the secondary national ambient air quality 
standard for particulate matter in Pennsylvania's portion of the 
Metropolitan Philadelphia Interstate Air Quality Control Region.
    (d) The Administrator hereby extends the attainment date for the 
national ambient air quality standard for ozone to December 31, 1987 for 
the following counties:

    Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Washington, Westmoreland, 
Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, Philadelphia, Lehigh, and 
Northampton.

    (e) The Administrator hereby extends the dates for attainment of the 
national ambient air quality standard for carbon monoxide to December 
31, 1987 in Philadelphia County and to December 31, 1985 in Allegheny 
County.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2023  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Pennsylvania's plan for attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards.
    (b) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Pennsylvania's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national ambient air quality standards under section 110 of the Clean 
Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies 
all requirements of Part D, Title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 
1977, except as noted below.
    (c) The Allegheny County Bureau of Air Pollution Control (BAPC) 
Article XX, section 534 at paragraph D, does not fulfill its 1982 ozone 
SIP commitment to adopt all applicable control technique guidelines 
published by EPA. These regulations establish and require reasonable 
available control technology to control fugitive volatile organic 
compounds emissions (VOC) from synthetic organic chemical and polymer 
manufacturing-fugitive sources and associated test method required to 
determine compliance, but provide the Director of the Bureau authority 
to approve an alternative VOC emission reduction system and/or 
alternative monitoring procedure. The approval of any such alternatives 
by the Director of the BAPC cannot and would not amend the SIP. Only the 
Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
has the authority to approve an alternative VOC emission reduction 
system and/or the use of an alternative monitoring procedure as a 
revision to the SIP. Air Pollution Article XX, section 534 at paragraph 
D of the SIP will remain inadequate until this language providing for 
Director discretion is corrected to require that any such alternatives 
approved by the Director of BAPC must also be approved by EPA. The 
amended version of Article XX, section 534, paragraph D must be adopted 
by the Commonwealth, submitted to EPA and approved as a SIP revision to 
correct this deficiency in the Pennsylvania SIP.
    (d) Limited approval/limited disapproval of revisions to the 
Pennsylvania Regulations, Chapter 129.82 pertaining to Stage II Vapor 
Recovery and the associated definition of gasoline dispensing facilities 
in Chapter 121.1 submitted on March 4, 1992, by the Pennsylvania 
Department of Environmental Resources. The Pennsylvania Stage II 
regulation is deficient in that it does not include the testing and 
certification procedures contained in EPA's October 1991 Stage II 
guidance documents (EPA-450/3-91-022a and EPA-450/3-91-022b).
    (e) Disapproval of the April 19, 1995 NO<INF>X</INF> RACT proposal 
for Pennsylvania Power Company--New Castle plant located in Lawrence 
County, Pennsylvania.

    (j) The conditionally approved Pennsylvania enhanced I/M SIP 
revision (59 FR 44936) submitted on November 3, 1993 by the Pennsylvania 
Department of Environmental Resources was converted to a disapproval by 
an April 13, 1995 letter from EPA to Pennsylvania.
    (k) Conditional limited approval of revisions to the Pennsylvania 
Regulations, Chapter 129.91 through 129.95, pertaining to VOC and 
NO<INF>X</INF> RACT submitted on February 4, 1994 and amended on May 3,

<R05>
Sec. 52.2024  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the legal authority to provide for public availability of emission 
data is inadequate.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations, which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2025  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, 
since section 5-1104 of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter could, in 
some circumstances, prohibit the disclosure of emission data to the 
public. Therefore, section 5-1104 is disapproved.

Sec. 52.2026  Conditional approval.

    The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's March 27, 1996 submittal for an 
enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, as 
amended on June 27, 1996 and July 29, 1996, and November 1, 1996, is 
conditionally approved based on certain contingencies, for an interim 
period to last eighteen months.

[[Page 402]]

    (a) If the Commonwealth fails to start its program according to the 
schedule it provided (i.e., by no later than November 15, 1997 for the 
five-county Philadelphia area and no later than November 15, 1999 for 
the remaining sixteen counties), this conditional approval will convert 
to a disapproval after EPA sends a letter to the state. If the 
Commonwealth fails to satisfy the following conditions per the deadlines 
listed within each condition, this conditional approval will 
automatically convert to a disapproval as explained under section 110(k) 
of the Clean Air Act. The conditions for approvability are as follows:
    (1) By no later than September 15, 1997, a notice must be published 
in the Pennsylvania Bulletin by the Secretary of the Pennsylvania 
Department of Transportation which certifies that the enhanced I/M 
program is required in order to comply with Federal law and also 
certifies the geographic areas which are subject to the enhanced I/M 
program (the geographic coverage must be identical to that listed in 
Appendix A-1 of the March 22, 1996 SIP submittal), and certifies the 
commencement date of the enhanced I/M program.
    (2) The Commonwealth must submit to EPA as a SIP amendment, by 
November 30, 1998, the final Pennsylvania I/M program evaluation plan 
requiring an approved alternative sound evaluation methodology to be 
performed on a minimum of 0.1 percent of the subject fleet each year as 
per 40 CFR 51.353(c)(3) and which meets the program evaluation elements 
as specified in 40 CFR 51.353(c).
    (3) By no later than November 15, 1997, the Commonwealth must submit 
a demonstration to EPA as an amendment to the SIP that meets the 
requirements of 40 CFR 51.361(b)(1) and (b)(2) and demonstrates that 
Pennsylvania's existing sticker enforcement system is more effective 
than registration denial enforcement.
    (4) Within twelve months of EPA's final interim rulemaking action, 
Pennsylvania must adopt and submit a final Pennsylvania I/M regulation 
which requires and which specifies the following: exhaust test 
procedures, standards, and equipment specifications; and evaporative 
system functional test methods, standards and procedures; a visual 
inspection procedure for determining the presence of or tampering with 
of vehicle emission control devices; and a repair technician training 
and certification (TTC) program. The test methods and procedures 
established under the Commonwealth's I/M regulation must be acceptable 
to EPA, as well as to the Commonwealth. The test methods and standards 
provided for by the Commonwealth's final regulation must reflect the 
modeling assumptions found in the Commonwealth's final performance 
standard modeling demonstration (which must satisfy the requirements of 
40 CFR 51.351). Within the same time frame, detailed test equipment 
specifications and standards (which are acceptable to EPA, as well as to 
the Commonwealth) for all of the I/M evaporative and exhaust tests 
provided for by the Commonwealth's regulation (as described above) must 
be finalized and submitted as a SIP revision to EPA.
    (5) The Commonwealth must perform and submit the final modeling 
demonstration that its program will meet the relevant enhanced 
performance standard, within twelve months of EPA's final interim 
rulemaking.
    (b) In addition to the above conditions for approval, the 
Commonwealth must correct several minor, or de minimus deficiencies 
related to CAA requirements for enhanced I/M. Although satisfaction of 
these deficiencies does not affect the conditional approval status of 
the Commonwealth's rulemaking granted under the authority of section 110 
of the Clean Air Act, these deficiencies must be corrected in the final 
I/M SIP revision prior to the end of the 18-month interim period granted 
under the National Highway Safety Designation Act of 1995:
    (1) The final I/M SIP submittal must detail the number of personnel 
and equipment dedicated to the quality assurance program, data 
collection, data analysis, program administration, enforcement, public 
education and assistance, on-road testing and other necessary functions 
as per 40 CFR 51.354;
    (2) The definition of light duty truck in the definitions section of 
the final

[[Page 403]]

Pennsylvania I/M regulation must provide for coverage up to 9,000 pounds 
GVWR;
    (3) The final Pennsylvania I/M regulation must require 
implementation of the final full stringency emission standards at the 
beginning of the second test cycle so that the state can obtain the full 
emission reduction program credit prior to the first program evaluation 
date;
    (4) The final Pennsylvania I/M regulation must require a real-time 
data link between the state or contractor and each emission inspection 
station as per 40 CFR 51.358(b)(2);
    (5) The final I/M SIP submittal must provide quality control 
requirements for one-mode ASM (or two-mode ASM if the Commonwealth opts 
for it);
    (6) The Pennsylvania I/M regulation must only allow the Commonwealth 
or a single contractor to issue waivers as per 40 CFR 51.360(c)(1);
    (7) The final I/M SIP submittal must include the RFP, or other 
legally binding document, which adequately addresses how the private 
vendor selected to perform motorist compliance enforcement 
responsibilities for the Commonwealth's program will comply with the 
requirements as per 40 CFR 51.362;
    (8) The final I/M SIP submittal must include the RFP that adequately 
addresses how the private vendor will comply with 40 CFR 51.363, a 
procedures manual which adequately addresses the quality assurance 
program and a requirement that annual auditing of the quality assurance 
auditors will occur as per 40 CFR 51.363(d)(2);
    (9) The final I/M SIP submittal must include provisions to maintain 
records of all warnings, civil fines, suspensions, revocations, 
violations and penalties against inspectors and stations, per the 
requirements of 40 CFR 51.364;
    (10) The final I/M SIP submittal must include a RFP, or other 
legally binding document, which adequately addresses how the private 
vendor selected by the Commonwealth to perform data collection and data 
analysis and reporting will comply with all the requirements of 40 CFR 
51.365 and 51.366;
    (11) The final Pennsylvania I/M regulation must require that 
emissions inspectors complete a refresher training course or pass a 
comprehensive skill examination prior to being recertified and the final 
SIP revisions must include a commitment that the Commonwealth will 
monitor and evaluate the inspector training program delivery, per the 
requirements of 40 CFR 51.367;
    (12) The final I/M SIP submittal must include a RFP, or other 
legally binding document, which adequately addresses how the 
Commonwealth's selected contractor will comply with the public 
information requirements of 40 CFR 51.368;
    (13) The Pennsylvania I/M regulation must include provisions that 
meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.368(a)and 51.369(b) for a repair 
facility performance monitoring program plan and for providing the 
motorist with diagnostic information based on the particular portions of 
the test that were failed; and
    (14) The final I/M SIP submittal must contain sufficient information 
to adequately address the on-road test program resource allocations, 
methods of analyzing and reporting the results of the on-road testing 
and information on staffing requirements for both the Commonwealth and 
the private vendor for the on-road testing program.
    (c) The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's September 12, 1996 submittal 
for the 15 Percent Rate of Progress Plan (15% plan) for the Pennsylvania 
portion of the Philadelphia ozone nonattainment area, is conditionally 
approved based on certain contingencies, for an interim period. The

    (e) EPA approves as a revision to the Pennsylvania State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) the 1990 base year emission inventories for 
the Reading, Pennsylvania area (Berks County) submitted by the Secretary 
of the Environment, on January 28, 1997. This submittal consists of the 
1990 base year point, area, non-road mobile, biogenic and on-road mobile 
source emission inventories in the area for the following pollutants: 
volatile organic compounds (VOC), carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of 
nitrogen (NO<INF>X</INF>).
    (f) Sharon Steel Company 1990 VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions for 
three emission units (Blast Furnace Operations, Basic Oxygen Furnace 
Shop, Blast Furnace Casthouse), submitted June 10, 1996, are approved. 
Sharon Steel Company is located in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, which is 
in a marginal ozone nonattainment area. The 1990 VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions from the Blast Furnace Operations (flame suppression, heaters 
and torpedo cars, flare stack, tuyeres) are 0.4 TPY and 49.3 TPY, 
respectively. The 1990 VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> emissions from the Basic 
Oxygen Furnace Shop (scrap preheating, ladle preheating and heaters) are 
1.4 TPY and 39.6 TPY, respectively. The 1990 VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> 
emissions from the Blast Furnace Casthouse are 205.4 TPY and 11.0 TPY, 
respectively.

    (i) The 1990 VOC emission inventory for the Philadelphia ozone 
nonattainment area, submitted on September 12, 1996 by Pennsylvania 
Department of Environmental Protection, is approved, with the exception 
of the revisions to the emission inventory for those sources at United 
States Steel--Fairless that were approved in Sec. 52.2036 (b) on April 
9, 1996.
    (j) EPA is approving Pennsylvania's request that the 1990 emissions 
inventory for VOCs from R.R. Donnelley & Sons--East Plant be corrected 
to accurately reflect the 1990 emissions. The 1990 baseyear VOC 
emissions inventory will be corrected to 864 tons. Justification for the 
change in VOC emissions is described as follows:
    (1) For rotogravure operations, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (East 
Plant) initially assumed a 5% retention of solvent in the web, and then 
revised their assumption to 2% based on the amount of solvent actually 
being recovered by the six bed carbon adsorption system. Based on VOC 
emissions data submitted to PADEP for the year 1990, the actual VOC 
emissions from rotogravure operations was 794.51 tons. The figures were 
taken from data submitted to PADEP from the facility dated May 6, 1996 
(subsequently submitted to EPA from PADEP via letter dated December 13, 
1996).
    (2) For heatset web offset lithographic operations, boilers, and 
associated solvent cleaning equipment, R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company 
provided data calculating estimates for actual 1990 VOC emissions of 
69.83 tons. The figures were taken from the facility's

Sec. 52.2037  Control strategy: Carbon monoxide and ozone (hydrocarbons).

    (a) Part D--Conditional Approval--the Pennsylvania plan for carbon 
monoxide and ozone is approved provided that the following conditions 
are satisfied:
    (1) Firm commitments to implement the Newton Branch electrification 
are submitted to EPA by December 30, 1980. If firm commitments are not 
submitted, the State must submit substitute measures with equivalent 
reductions by June 30, 1981.
    (b)(1)(i) Determination--EPA has made a determination, effective 
August 15, 1996, that the Pittsburgh-Beaver Valley ozone nonattainment 
area (the Pittsburgh area) is no longer in attainment of the National 
Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone due to monitored violations of 
the standard. Therefore, effective August 15, 1996, EPA is revoking the 
determination of attainment for the area made July 19, 1995, and is 
reinstating the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration 
requirements of section 182(b)(1) and contingency measure requirements 
of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act beginning on August 15, 1996. 
With regard to the attainment demonstration requirements, EPA has 
determined that the following schedule is reasonable for the 
development, adoption, and submittal of an attainment demonstration by 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the Commonwealth).
    (A) By August 15, 1996, the Commonwealth must submit to EPA, and 
make available for public comment as a proposed SIP submission, complete 
photochemical oxidant modeling for the Pittsburgh area which identifies 
the VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> reductions levels necessary for attainment, 
and a list of available control strategies.
    (B) By October 1, 1996, the Commonwealth must submit to EPA a SIP 
revision containing a photochemical oxidant modeling demonstration and a 
list of available control strategies.
    (C) By April 1, 1997, the Commonwealth must submit to EPA a full SIP 
revision for those emission reduction strategies selected by the 
Commonwealth for the Pittsburgh area for which new regulations are not 
required.
    (D) By April 1, 1997, the Commonwealth must submit to EPA a 
committal SIP revision for those emission reduction strategies selected 
by the Commonwealth for the Pittsburgh area that require new 
regulations.
    (E) By December 31, 1997, the Commonwealth must submit to EPA as a 
SIP revision adopted final fully enforceable regulations encompassing 
the emission reduction strategies contained in the committal SIP.
    (ii) Unless the Commonwealth makes the required submittal to EPA, 
the sanctions and sanction clocks halted by the July 19, 1995 action 
suspending the attainment demonstration requirements at issue will be 
reinstated, as to each of the submittals included in this milestone 
schedule, two weeks after the date set for each of the submittals by the 
Commonwealth to EPA. If the Commonwealth fails to make a submission by 
the required date, the offset sanction would go back into effect two 
weeks after the relevant milestone date, and the highway sanction clock 
would be reinstated at that time where it was halted on July 19, 1995 
(i.e., with approximately 6 months remaining). Sanctions or sanctions 
clocks would be stopped if the Commonwealth makes the relevant overdue 
submittal, if EPA affirmatively determines in writing that the actual 
material submitted by the Commonwealth contains the information 
necessary to enable EPA to determine whether the Commonwealth's 
submission complies with the pertinent milestone requirement. EPA shall 
make the determination, in writing, as to whether the submittal contains 
the necessary information within two weeks of the actual submission date 
by the Commonwealth. In the event the Commonwealth makes a required 
submittal by the pertinent milestone date, EPA shall, within two weeks 
of the milestone date, make a determination,

[[Page 408]]

in writing, as to whether the actual material submitted by the 
Commonwealth contains the information necessary to enable EPA to 
determine whether the Commonwealth's submission complies with the 
pertinent milestone requirement. If EPA determines that the material 
submitted to EPA by the Commonwealth fails to satisfy this minimum 
criterion, the offset sanction would be reinstated upon that 
determination by EPA and the highway sanction clock would be reinstated 
at that time where it was halted on July 19, 1995 (i.e., with 
approximately 6 months remaining). Sanctions or sanctions clocks would 
be stopped if the Commonwealth subsequently makes a submittal to cure 
the deficiencies identified by EPA, and if EPA affirmatively determines 
in writing that the material submitted by the Commonwealth cures the 
identified deficiencies. EPA shall make the determination as to the 
adequacy of the submittal within two weeks of the date of the actual 
submittal to EPA. Each of the determinations referred to in this 
subparagraph shall be made in writing, in a letter to the Secretary of 
the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and made 
publicly available. In those instances where EPA determines that the 
Commonwealth's submittal does not contain the information necessary to 
enable EPA to determine whether the Commonwealth's submission complies 
with the pertinent milestone requirement, EPA's letter so informing the 
Commonwealth will articulate the basis for EPA's determination, specify 
the remedy, and identify the actions necessary by the Commonwealth to 
remedy its submission to satisfy the relevant milestone. With respect to 
the 15 percent plan and contingency measure requirements that are being 
reinstated as of August 15, 1996, the FIP clock will be reinstated at 
that time, with one day less than six months to run. With respect to the 
elements of the attainment demonstration, the FIP clock will resume as 
to each element (the date on which the sanctions would be reinstated if 
the submissions were not made), with one day less than six months to 
run.
    (2) Determination--EPA has determined that, as of July 19, 1995, the 
Reading ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard and 
that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration 
requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 
172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to this area for so long as 
the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a 
violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Reading ozone 
nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.
    (c) VOC and NO<INF>X</INF> RACT determination for six emission units 
at U.S. Steel--Fairless: no. 3 blast furnace, no. 1 open hearth furnace, 
no. 1 soaking pits, no. 2 soaking pits (units 1-8), no. 2 soaking pits 
(units 9-16), 80 in. hot strip mill. The NO<INF>X</INF> RACT 
determination for all the soaking pits and the 80 in. hot strip mill is 
low excess air (LEA), which is expected to result in a 13.5% emission 
reduction. NO<INF>X</INF> RACT for the other sources is determined to be 
good operating practices to minimize NO<INF>X</INF> emissions. VOC RACT 
for all the above sources is determined to be good operating practices 
to minimize VOC emissions.

Sec. 52.2072  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Rhode Island's plan, as identified in Sec. 52.2070 of this 
subpart, for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards 
under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator 
finds the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title I, of the 
Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, 
continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone 
portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT 
requirements by January 1, 1981 for the sources covered by CTGs issued 
between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each 
subsequent January as additional RACT requirements for sources covered 
by CTGs issued by the previous January.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2073  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not provide for public availability of emission 
data.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data.
    (1) Information obtained from owner or operators of stationary 
sources pursuant to Sec. 52.2075 will be correlated with applicable 
emission limitations and other control regulations and will be made 
available for public inspection at the Rhode Island Department of 
Health, 204 Health Building, Providence, RI.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2074  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(e) of this chapter are not met. 
Authority to require recordkeeping is deficient to the extent that 
section 23-25-13 requires only those sources with an air pollution 
control program to keep records.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met. 
Authority to release emission data to the public is deficient in that 
section 23-25-6 requires that only records concerning investigations be 
available to the public. Further, section 23-25-5(g) and section 23-25-
13 may limit the State's authority to release emission data. Authority 
to require sources to install and maintain monitoring equipment is not 
provided and is therefore inadequate. Authority to require sources to 
periodically report is not provided and is therefore inadequate.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2075  Source surveillance.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.211 of this chapter are not met 
since the plan lacks adequate legal authority to require owners or 
operators of stationary sources to maintain records of, and periodically 
report information as may be necessary to enable the state to determine 
whether such sources are in compliance with applicable portions of the 
control strategy.
    (b) Regulation for source recordkeeping and reporting.
    (1) The owner or operator of all stationary sources which have the 
potential to emit a total of 100 tons or more per year of any one air 
contaminant for which there is a national standard shall maintain 
records of, and submit to the Director, data on operational processes, 
fuel usage, emission, stack parameters, boiler capacities, types of 
equipment generating air contaminants and air contaminant control 
devices that may be necessary to determine if the source is in 
compliance with applicable rules and regulations of the Department. Upon 
notification of the Administrator, or the Director of the Rhode Island 
Department of Health, sources with the potential to emit less than 100 
tons per year of any air contaminant shall also be subject to the 
requirements of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, 
potential emissions shall be calculated at the design load assuming no 
control equipment is in use and fuel having a sulfur content of 2.2 
percent by weight (dry basis) is being burned.
    (2) The information recorded by the owner or operator of a 
stationary source shall be summarized and reported to the Director of 
the Department of Health on forms furnished by him. They shall be 
submitted within 30 days following the end of the reporting period. 
Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of the 
summarizing reports submitted to the Director shall be retained by the 
owner or operator for two years after the date on which the pertinent 
report is submitted.

Sec. 52.2078  Enforcement.

    (a) Sections 23-25-5(h) and 23-25-8(a) of the General Laws of Rhode 
Island are disapproved insofar as they permit the Rhode Island Director 
of the Department of Health to issue abatement orders (1) that defer 
compliance with plan requirements beyond the dates required for 
attainment of the national standards, (2) without the approval of the 
Administrator, and (3) for reasons not permitted by the Clean Air Act.
    (b) Regulation limiting administrative abatement orders. (1) No 
order deferring compliance with a requirement of the Rhode Island 
Implementation Plan shall be issued by the Director of the Department of 
Health which does not meet the following requirements:
    (i) An order must require compliance with the plan requirement 
within the times and under the conditions specified in Sec. 51.261 (a) 
and (b) of this chapter.
    (ii) An order may not defer compliance beyond the last date 
permitted by section 110 of the Act for attainment of the national 
standard which the plan implements unless the procedures and conditions 
set forth in section 110(f) of the Act are met.
    (iii) An order shall not be effective until it has been submitted to 
and approved by the Administrator in accordance with Secs. 51.104, 
51.105, 51.261 and 51.262(a).
    (2) Notwithstanding the limitations of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this 
section, an order may be granted which provides for compliance beyond 
the statutory attainment date for a national standards where compliance 
is not possible because of breakdowns or malfunctions of equipment, acts 
of God, or other unavoidable occurrences. However, such order may not 
defer compliance for more than three (3) months unless the procedures 
and conditions set forth in section 110(f) of the Act are met.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2080  Revisions.

    (a) The revision procedures of the Rhode Island plan are not 
adequate since the plan does not expressly provide for revisions at the 
times and under the conditions set forth in Sec. 51.104 of this chapter.
    (b) Regulation for plan revisions. (1) The Rhode Island 
implementation plan shall be revised:
    (i) When necessary to take account of a revision of the national 
primary or secondary ambient air quality standard which it implements;

[[Page 422]]

    (ii) When improved or more expeditious methods of attaining a 
national standard which it implements become available;
    (iii) When the Administrator finds that the plan is substantially 
inadequate to attain or maintain the national standard which it 
implements and issues notice of such finding pursuant to Sec. 51.104 of 
this chapter.
    (2) The Rhode Island implementation plan may be revised from time to 
time to the extent such revisions are consistent with the requirements 
applicable to implementation plans set forth in this chapter and the 
Act.
    (3) No revisions shall be effective until the hearing requirements 
of Sec. 51.102 of this chapter have been satisfied.

Sec. 52.2083  Significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a) The Rhode Island plan, as submitted, is approved as meeting the 
requirements of Subpart 1, Part C, Title I, of the Clean Air Act.
[49 FR 27750, July 6, 1984]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2084  Rules and regulations.

    (a) Part D--Disapproval.
    (1) On November 5, 1985, the Rhode Island Department of 
Environmental Management submitted a revision to the Rhode Island State 
Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkwright Incorporated. This revision is 
an alternative reasonably available control technology determination for 
the control of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from three paper coating 
lines at Arkwright Incorporated's Fiskeville, Rhode Island facility. As 
a result of EPA's disapproval of this revision, the existing VOC rules 
applicable to Arkwright Incorporated and contained in the Rhode Island 
SIP remain in effect (Rhode Island Air Pollution Control Regulation No. 
19 as approved by EPA in 40 CFR 52.2080(c)(19)).
    (2) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the 
Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management on March 15, 1994. 
The revisions consist of the State's 15 Percent Plan and Contingency 
Plan. EPA is disapproving the following portions of these SIP 
submittals: 15 Percent Plan--Emission reductions claimed from motor 
vehicle inspection and maintenance program, non-CTG sources, air toxic 
sources, and plant closures (0.05 tons per day disapproved out of 0.84 
tons claimed). Contingency Plan--a portion of the credit claimed from 
consumer and commercial products (0.8 tons per day disapproved out of 
1.9 tons claimed), and a portion of the credit claimed from AIM coatings 
(0.5 tons per day disapproved out of 2.4 tons claimed).
    (b) Non-Part D--No Action-- EPA is neither approving nor 
disapproving the following elements of the revisions:
    (i) [Reserved]
    (ii) Consultation.
    (iii) Permit fees.
    (iv) Stack height requirements.
    (v) Public notification.

17, 1997]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2085  Stack height review.

    The State of Rhode Island has declared to the satisfaction of EPA 
that no existing emission limitations have been affected by stack height 
credits greater than good engineering practice or any other prohibited 
dispersion technique as defined in EPA's stack height regulations, as 
revised on July 8, 1985. Such declarations were submitted to EPA on 
March 27, 1986. The State has further declared, in letters from Thomas 
D. Getz, dated October 15, 1985 and March 27, 1986, that ``[R]hode 
Island will use the 8 July 1985 revised height regulations in 
administering section 9.18 of its new source review regulations.'' Thus, 
Rhode Island has satisfactorily demonstrated that its regulations meet 
40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.
[52 FR 49407, Dec. 31, 1987]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2086  Emission inventories.

    (a) The Governor's designee for the State of Rhode Island submitted 
the 1990 base year emission inventory for the Providence ozone 
nonattainment area on January 12, 1993 as a revision to the State 
Implementation Plan (SIP). The 1990 base year emission inventory 
requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 
1990, has been satisfied for this area.
    (b) The inventory is for the ozone precursors which are volatile 
organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventory 
covers point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic 
sources.
    (c) The Providence nonattainment area is classified as serious and 
includes the entire state of Rhode Island.

Sec. 52.2122  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves South Carolina's plans for the attainment and maintenance of 
the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. 
Furthermore the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all requirements 
of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as 
noted elsewhere in this subpart. In addition, continued satisfaction of 
the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on 
the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the 
sources covered by CTG's issued between January 1978 and January 1979 
and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT 
requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b) EPA disapproved South Carolina's generic bubble regulation 
submitted for approval into the State Implementation Plan (SIP) on June 
5, 1985.

operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or 
combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions 
of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance 
of a national air quality standard is not adequate.

approved.

[[Page 434]]

The State submitted these regulations to EPA for approval on September 
18, 1990. Sections I and II of Regulation 62.5 were intended to correct 
deficiencies cited in a letter calling for the State to revise its SIP 
for ozone from Mr. Greer C. Tidwell, the EPA Regional Administrator, to 
Governor Carroll A. Campbell on May 26, 1988, and clarified in a letter 
from Mr. Winston A. Smith, EPA Region IV, Air, Pesticides and Toxics 
Management Division, to Mr. Otto E. Pearson, former Director of the 
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control:
    (a) South Carolina's VOC regulations contain no method for 
determining capture efficiency. This deficiency must be corrected after 
EPA publishes guidance on the methods for determining capture efficiency 
before the SIP for ozone can be fully approved.

Sec. 52.2173  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met

of the South Dakota Air Pollution Control Program, which were submitted 
by the Governor's designee on September 25, 1991, are disapproved

which prohibits any state or EPA from granting a variance from any 
requirement of an applicable implementation plan with respect to a 
stationary source.

Sec. 52.2222  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Tennessee's plans for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds the plans thus far submitted satisfy all 
requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 
1977, except as noted below.

In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for 
the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of 
RACT requirements by July 1, 1980, for the sources covered by CTGs 
issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and on adoption and 
submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for 
sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
    (b) New source review permits issued pursuant to section 173 of the 
Clean Air Act will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of 
Section V of the emission offset interpretative rule (Appendix S of 40 
CFR part 51) are met.
    (c) EPA approves Nashville/Davidson County, Tennessee's VOC 
Regulation No. 7, Section 7-1(11), which replaces the definition of 
Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) with a definition for VOC that is 
consistent with the EPA approved definition. The EPA approved definition 
defines VOC as any organic compound that participates in atmospheric 
photochemical reactions. However, it excludes organic compounds which 
have negligible photochemical reactivity. These compounds are as 
follows: methane, ethane, methyl chloroform (1,1,1-trichloroethane), 
CFC-113 (trichlorotrifluoroethane), methylene chloride, CFC 11 
(trichlorofluoromethane), CFC-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), CFC-22 
(chlorodifluoromethane), FC-23 (trifluoromethane), CFC-114 
(dichlorotetrafluoroethane), CFC-115 (chloropentafluoroethane). It is 
also our understanding that by adopting the EPA approved definition, 
Nashville/Davidson County, Tennessee will use EPA approved test methods 
for VOC.

Sec. 52.2224  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not provide the legal authority for controlling 
motor vehicles during air pollution emergency episodes.
    (b) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met 
since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or 
operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or 
combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions 
of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance 
of a national air quality standard is not adequate.
    (c)(1) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(b) of this chapter are not 
met since the definition of person set forth in the Tennessee Air 
Quality Act and in the State implementation plan does not include 
facilities owned or operated by the State. Therefore, section 53-3409(f) 
of the Tennessee Code Annotated and section 30 of Chapter II of the 
Tennessee Air Pollution Control Regulations are disapproved.
    (2) Definition of person. For the purposes of the plan, person shall 
mean any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company, 
corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, State-
owned or operated facility, State agency, political subdivision, or any 
other legal entity, or their legal representatives, agents, or assigns.
    (d) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(b) of this chapter are not met 
since the State lacks legal authority, as a result of the enactment of 
House Bill 1490 by the 1974 Tennessee legislature, to control emissions 
from the quarrying and processing of agricultural limestone. Therefore, 
section 53-3424 of the Tennessee Code Annotated is disapproved.
    (e) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(b) of this chapter are not met 
since the State lacks legal authority, as a result of the enactment of 
House Bill 1845 by the 1974 Tennessee legislature, to control emissions 
from air contaminant sources which use woodwaste only as fuel. 
Therefore, the last sentence of

[[Page 475]]

section 53-3422 of the Tennessee Code Annotated is disapproved.

Sec. 52.2225  VOC rule deficiency correction.

    (a) Revisions to sections 7-3, 7-13, and 7-24 of the Tennessee 
regulations are approved. These amendments are in response to the Clean 
Air Act section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement to submit RACT rules correcting 
deficiencies in the existing SIP in accordance with EPA's pre-amendment 
guidance. These deficiencies were first noted in a letter from Greer 
Tidwell, the EPA Region IV Administrator, to Governor McWherter on May 
26, 1988, and clarified in a letter dated June 10, 1988, from Winston 
Smith, EPA Region IV Air Division Director, to Paul Bontrager, Director 
of the Air Pollution Control Division of the Metropolitan Health 
Department for Nashville/Davidson County, and were further identified in 
EPA guidance including the Blue Book and the proposed Post-87 policy. 
The following deficiency in the Tennessee Regulations, however, has not 
been corrected.
    (1) Section 7-25, ``Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements'' 
Nashville/Davidson County committed in a letter dated May 7, 1991, to 
include a separate provision that requires records to be maintained for 
at least two years. This additional provision, which is scheduled for a 
July 15, 1992, public hearing, will be submitted to EPA shortly after 
that date and will be acted upon separately.
    (2) In Section 7-3, Petition for Alternative Controls, the words 
``as applied'' should be added to the term ``VOC/gallon solids'' as a 
clarification.
    (3) The term ``vapor-tight'' should be defined in section 7-13.
    (4) ``Once-in/always-in'' is missing from the applicability section 
of the individual rules.
    (5) Section 7-25, ``Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements'' 
should be revised to include additional requirements that would contain: 
units of compliance consistent with the performance requirements; 
applicable time periods for data entries; and a clear, separate 
provision that requires records to be kept.

Sec. 52.2226  Extensions.

    The Administrator hereby extends for 18 months (until July 1, 1980) 
the statutory deadline for submittal of a plan to attain the secondary 
SO<INF>2</INF> standard in Copperhill.
    (a) [Reserved]
    (b) The Administrator hereby extends for 18 months (until July 1, 
1980) the statutory timetable for submittal of Tennessee's plans to 
attain and maintain the secondary ambient standard for particulate 
matter in the Chattanooga, Columbia, Kingsport, Memphis, and Nashville 
nonattainment areas (40 CFR 81.343).

<R05>
Sec. 52.2227  Prevention of air pollution emergency episodes.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.152(a) of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not provide for the enforcement of emission control 
actions for mobile sources during air pollution emergency episodes.

Sec. 52.2228  Review of new sources and modifications.

    (a) Part D--Conditional approval. The Nashville-Davidson County 
regulation for the review of new sources and modifications in 
nonattainment areas is approved on condition that the State by October 
31, 1984, submit a revision limiting source shutdown credit for offsets 
to replacement units, and, in the interim, assure implementation of the 
regulation in conformity with Federal requirements.
    (b) Section 123--Conditional approval. The plan's provision for 
implementation of the requirements of section 123 of the Clean Air Act 
in Nashville-Davidson County is approved on condition

[[Page 476]]

that the State by October 31, 1984, submit:
    (1) Definitions in the local regulation of nearby and excessive 
concentration and
    (2) Provision in the local regulation for public notification and 
opportunity for hearing in cases where stack heights in excess of normal 
good engineering practice are proposed on the basis of fluid modeling 
demonstrations, and, in the interim, assure implementation of the local 
regulation in conformity with Federal requirements.
    (c) The State of Tennessee proposed to delete section 1200-3-18-.03 
``Standard for New Sources'' from the Tennessee State Implementation 
Plan (SIP) and the Memphis-Shelby County portion of the Tennessee SIP. 
EPA is disapproving the deletion of this rule for the Tennessee SIP 
because Tennessee does not have federally approved New Source Review 
(NSR) regulations which apply to some of the sources in this chapter. 
EPA is approving the deletion of this rule for the Memphis submittal 
because the federally approved TN NSR applies to the Memphis-Shelby 
County area.
    (d) The State of Tennessee proposed to delete rule 1200-3-18-.03 
``Standard for New Sources'' from the Tennessee State Implementation 
Plan (SIP). In paragraph (e) of this section, EPA disapproved the 
deletion of this rule because Tennessee did not have federally approved 
New Source Review (NSR) regulations that applied to some of the sources 
in this chapter. EPA is hereby approving the deletion of section 1200-3-
18-.03 of the Tennessee SIP, and is deleting EPA's earlier disapproval 
in paragraph (e) of this section.

Sec. 52.2229  Rules and regulations.

    (a) The following portions of the revised Memphis and Shelby County 
regulations submitted on July 7, 1986, are disapproved because they are 
inconsistent with EPA policy and requirements:

Sec. 52.2231  Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.

    (a) Part D conditional approval. The Chattanooga primary TSP plan's 
provisions for review of new sources and modifications in the 
nonattainment area are approved on condition that the State submit by 
December 31, 1987, a definition of the term Federally enforceable and 
provisions for making Federally enforceable all limitations, conditions, 
and offsets, including permit restrictions, relied upon under the plan, 
and in the interim, implement these provisions in a manner consistent 
with EPA requirements.
    (b) In letters dated March 9 and April 15, 1988, the Tennessee 
Department of Health and Environment certified that no emission limits 
in the State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by 
EPA's stack height rules. This certification does not apply to: Dupont 
(43-07-02); Tennessee Valley Authority--Johnsonville (43-11-1 thru 10); 
Tennessee Chemical Company (70-04-21); Tennessee Eastman (82-03-15-19);

<R05>
Sec. 52.2233  Significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a)(1) Paragraph 1200-3-9-.01(4)-(0)-2. of Tennessee's regulations 
is disapproved because it does not require that the consent of the 
Governor(s) of affected states be obtained when innovative technology 
waivers are granted. EPA retains permitting authority for sources 
requesting innovative technology waivers which would significantly 
impact air quality in adjacent states.
    (2) Tennessee's definition of stationary source specifically 
excludes the activities of any Vessel. This exclusion is not currently 
approvable and EPA is deferring action on it pending final rulemaking on 
the issue. EPA retains authority for permits which involve vessel 
emissions where a source is not willing to include all vessel emissions 
in the definition of source.
    (b) The requirements of 52.21 (b) through (w) are hereby 
incorporated by reference and made part of the applicable SIP for the 
State of Tennessee for the following purposes:
    (1) Permitting of sources requesting innovative technology waivers 
which would significantly impact air quality in adjacent states.
    (2) Permitting of sources involving vessel emissions where the 
source is unwilling to include all vessel emissions in the definition of 
source.
    (c) (1) All applications and other information required pursuant to 
Sec. 52.21 of this part from sources located or to be located in the 
State of Tennessee shall be submitted to the Division of Air Pollution 
Control, Tennessee Department of Public Health, 256 Capitol Hill 
Building, Nashville, Tennessee 37219.

Sec. 52.2234  Visibility protection.

    (a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not 
met because the plan does not include approvable procedures meeting the 
requirements of 40 CFR 51.305 and 51.307 for protection of visibility in 
mandatory Class I Federal areas.
    (b) Regulations for visibility monitoring and new source review. The 
provisions of Secs. 52.26, 52.27, and 52.28 are hereby incorporated and 
made part of the applicable plan for the State of Tennessee.
    (c) Long-term strategy. The provisions of Sec. 52.29 are hereby 
incorporated and made part of the applicable plan for the State of 
Tennessee.

Sec. 52.2235  Control strategy: Ozone.

    (a) Determination--EPA is determining that, as of August 8, 1995, 
the Nashville ozone nonattainment area has attained the ozone standard 
and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration 
requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 
172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the area for so long as 
the area does not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a 
violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Nashville ozone 
nonattainment area, these determinations shall no longer apply.
    (b) Nonregulatory provisions for the implementation of a basic I/M 
program in Rutherford, Sumner, Williamson, and Wilson Counties, 
submitted on July 13, 1994, were approved by EPA on September 26, 1995.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2236  Control strategy; lead.

    The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation has 
submitted revisions to the Tennessee SIP on October 6, 1994. These 
revisions address the requirements necessary to change an lead 
nonattainment area to attainment. The maintenance plan for the Fayette 
County area near Rossville, Tennessee is comprised of a maintenance 
demonstration and NSR/PSD program. For areas where the only lead source 
has shut down, these components are sufficient for an approvable 
maintenance plan. The State's maintenance plan is complete and satisfies 
all of the requirements of section 175(A) of the CAA.

Sec. 52.2237  NO<INF>X</INF> RACT and NO<INF>X</INF> conformity exemption.

    Approval. EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control technology (RACT) and 
NO<INF>X</INF> conformity exemption request submitted by the Tennessee 
Department of Environment and Conservation on March 21, 1995, for the 
five county middle Tennessee (Nashville) ozone moderate nonattainment 
area. This approval exempts the area from implementing federal 
NO<INF>X</INF> RACT on major sources of NO<INF>X</INF> and exempts 
Tennessee from NO<INF>X</INF> conformity. This approval does not exempt 
sources from any State required or State Implementation Plan (SIP) 
approved NO<INF>X</INF> controls. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS 
occurs in the area, the exemption from the requirement of section 182(f) 
of the CAA in the applicable area shall not apply.

Paso, and SEDUE will continue a cooperative effort to study the PM-10 
air quality in the El Paso/Juarez air basin. Based on the availability 
of enhanced emissions and monitoring data, as well as more sophisticated 
modeling techniques (e.g., Urban Airshed Model), future studies will 
attempt to better define the relative contributions of El Paso and 
Juarez to the PM-10 problem in the basin. At that time, a contingency 
plan can more appropriately be developed in a cooperative effort with 
Mexico.''

    (103) Revisions to the Texas SIP addressing VOC RACT Negative 
Declarations. A revision to the Texas SIP was submitted on January 10, 
1996, which included negative declarations for various categories. 
Section 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires 
nonattainment areas to adopt, at a minimum, the reasonably available 
control technology (RACT) to reduce emissions from existing sources. 
Pursuant to section 182(b)(2) of the Act, for moderate and above ozone 
nonattainment areas, the EPA has identified 13 categories for such 
sources and developed the Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) or 
Alternate Control Techniques (ACTs) documents to implement RACT at those 
sources. When no major volatile organic compound (VOC) sources for a 
source category exist in a nonattainment area, a State may submit a 
negative declaration for that category. Texas submitted negative 
declarations for the areas and source categories listed in this 
paragraph (c)(103). For the Beaumont/Port Arthur region, negative 
declarations were submitted for the following eight categories: clean-up 
solvents, aerospace coatings, shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, 
plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, 
autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For Dallas/Fort Worth, 
negative declarations were submitted for six categories: industrial 
wastewater, clean-up solvents, shipbuilding and repair, autobody 
refinishing, plastic part coatings-business machines, and offset 
lithography. For the Houston/Galveston area, negative declarations were 
submitted for seven categories: clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, 
wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part 
coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For El 
Paso, negative declarations were submitted for nine categories: 
industrial wastewater, clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, 
shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business 
machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset 
lithography. This submittal satisfies section 182(b)(2) of the Clean Air 
Act Amendments of 1990 for these particular CTG/ACT source categories 
for the Texas ozone nonattainment areas stated in this paragraph 
(c)(103).
    (i) Incorporation by reference. The letter dated January 10, 1996, 
from the Governor of Texas to the Regional Administrator, submitting the 
Post-1996 Rate of Progress Plan as a revision to the SIP, which included 
VOC RACT negative declarations.

Sec. 52.2308  Area-wide nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X</INF>) exemptions.

    (a) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) 
submitted to the EPA on June 17, 1994, a petition requesting that the 
Dallas ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the NO<INF>X</INF> 
control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as 
amended in 1990. The Dallas nonattainment area consists of Dallas, 
Tarrant, Denton, and Collin counties. The exemption request was based on 
a photochemical grid modeling which shows that the Dallas nonattainment 
area would attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 
ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the 
additional NO<INF>X</INF> controls required under section 182(f). On 
November 21, 1994, the EPA conditionally approved this exemption 
request, conditioned upon the EPA approving the modeling portion of the 
Dallas attainment demonstration SIP.
    (b) The TNRCC submitted to the EPA on June 17, 1994, a petition 
requesting that the El Paso ozone nonattainment area be exempted from 
the NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements of section 182(f) of the Clean 
Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990. The El Paso nonattainment area 
consists of El Paso county, and shares a common airshed with Juarez, 
Mexico. The exemption request was based on a photochemical grid modeling 
which shows that the El Paso nonattainment area would attain the NAAQS 
for ozone by the CAA mandated deadline without the implementation of the 
additional NO<INF>X</INF> controls required under section 182(f), but 
for emissions emanating from Mexico. On November 21, 1994, the EPA 
conditionally approved this exemption request, conditioned upon the EPA 
approving the modeling portion of the El Paso attainment demonstration 
SIP.
    (c) The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission submitted to 
the EPA on May 4, 1994, a petition requesting that the Victoria County 
incomplete data ozone nonattainment area be exempted from the 
requirement to meet the NO<INF>X</INF> provisions of the Federal 
transportation conformity rule. The exemption request was based on 
monitoring data which demonstrated that the National Ambient Air Quality 
Standard for ozone had been attained in this area for the 35 months 
prior to the petition, with the understanding that approval of the 
State's request would be contingent upon the collection of one 
additional month of data. The required additional month of verified data 
was submitted later and, together with the data submitted with the 
State's petition, demonstrated attainment of the NAAQS for 36 
consecutive months. The EPA approved this exemption request on March 2, 
1995.
    (d) The TNRCC submitted to the EPA on August 17, 1994, with 
supplemental information submitted on August 31, 1994, and September 9, 
1994, a petition requesting that the Houston and Beaumont ozone 
nonattainment areas be temporarily exempted from the NO<INF>X</INF> 
control requirements of section 182(f) of the CAA. The Houston 
nonattainment area consists of Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, 
Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller

[[Page 513]]

counties. The Beaumont nonattainment area consists of Hardin, Jefferson, 
and Orange counties. The exemption request was based on photochemical 
grid modeling which shows that reductions in NO<INF>X</INF> would not 
contribute to attaining the ozone NAAQS. On April 12, 1995, the EPA 
approved the State's request for a temporary exemption. Approval of the 
temporary exemption waives the federal requirements for NO<INF>X</INF> 
Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT), New Source Review (NSR), 
conformity, and vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) for the period 
of the temporary exemption. The temporary exemption automatically 
expires on December 31, 1996, without further notice from the EPA. Based 
on the rationale provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking on this 
action, upon the expiration of the temporary exemption, the requirements 
pertaining to NO<INF>X</INF> RACT, NSR, conformity, and I/M will again 
become applicable, except that the NO<INF>X</INF> RACT implementation 
date applicable to the Houston and Beaumont nonattainment areas under 
section 182(f) shall be as expeditious as practicable but no later than 
May 31, 1997, unless the State has received a permanent NO<INF>X</INF> 
exemption from the EPA prior to that time.
    (e) The TNRCC submitted to EPA on March 6, 1996, a petition 
requesting that the Houston/Galveston and Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone 
nonattainment areas be granted an extension to a previously-granted 
temporary exemption from the NO<INF>X</INF> control requirements of 
sections 182(f) and 182(b) of the Clean Air Act. The temporary exemption 
was granted on April 19, 1995. The current petition is based on the need 
for more time to complete UAM to confirm the need for, and the extent 
of, NO<INF>X</INF> controls required. On May 23, 1997, EPA approved the 
State's request for an extension to the temporary exemption. The 
temporary extension automatically expires on December 31, 1997, without 
further notice from EPA. Upon expiration of the extension, the 
requirements pertaining to NO<INF>X</INF> RACT, NSR, I/M, general and 
transportation conformity will become applicable, except that the 
NO<INF>X</INF> RACT compliance date shall be implemented as 
expeditiously as practicable, but no later than May 31, 1999, unless the 
State has received a contingent NO<INF>X</INF> exemption from the EPA 
prior to that time.
    (f) The extension of the temporary exemption from NO<INF>X</INF> 
control requirements of sections 182(f) and 182(b) of the Clean Air Act 
for the Houston/Galveston and Beaumont/Port Arthur ozone nonattainment 
areas granted on May 23, 1997, expired December 31, 1997. Upon 
expiration of the extension, the requirements pertaining to 
NO<INF>X</INF> RACT, NSR, I/M, general and transportation conformity 
will become applicable and the State is expected to implement the 
requirements as expeditiously as possible.

Sec. 52.2310  Conditional approval.

    The State of Texas' March 14, 1996, submittal for an motor vehicle 
inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, is conditionally approved 
based on certain contingencies, for an interim period to last eighteen 
months. If the State of Texas fails to fully start its program by 
November 15, 1997, at the latest, this conditional approval will convert 
to a disapproval after EPA sends a letter to the State. If the State of 
Texas fails to satisfy the following conditions within 12 months of 
August 11, 1997, this conditional approval will automatically convert to 
a disapproval as explained under section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act. 
The conditions for approvability are as follows: Texas must obtain all 
of the legal authority needed to implement its program. The specific 
authority needed was outlined in EPA's proposed approval action and was 
identified in a February 27, 1996, Governor's Executive Order that was 
submitted as part of the Texas I/M SIP. The legal authority identified 
in the Executive Order includes: The denial of registration of vehicles 
that have not complied with I/M program requirements; the establishment 
of a class C misdemeanor penalty for operating a gross polluting vehicle 
in a nonattainment area; and the requirement for an inspection within 60 
days of resale and prior to transfer of title to nonfamily member 
consumers in Dallas, Tarrant, or Harris counties (or regarding the third 
major condition, the removal of the test-on-resale program element from 
the SIP). Texas has committed to support additional needed legislation 
in Texas' 75th Legislative Session. Should Texas fail to fulfill these 
conditions by the end of the 75th Legislative Session, this approval 
will convert to a disapproval. Texas must also fully start its I/M 
program by November 15, 1997, or this action will convert to a 
disapproval.

Sec. 52.2311  Motor vehicle antitampering.

    The State of Texas submitted revisions to the State Implementation 
Plan for 30 TAC Chapter 114, sections 114.1 ``Maintenance and Operation 
of Air Pollution Control Systems or Devices Used to Control Emissions 
from Motor Vehicles'' and 114.5 ``Exclusions and Exceptions'' on 
February 24, 1989, and September 6, 1990, and July 13, 1993. The EPA 
disapproved these revisions that relate to Statewide antitampering 
provisions and exemptions to antitampering provisions for motor vehicles 
or motor vehicle engine emission control systems because the State's 
antitampering rules are not consistent with the Act, section 203(a)(3) 
and EPA's tampering prohibitions as outlined in EPA's antitampering 
enforcement policy, Mobile Source Enforcement Memorandum No. 1A.

Sec. 52.2372  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Vermont's plan as identified in Sec. 52.2370 for the attainment 
and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean 
Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plans satisfy all 
requirements of Part D, Title I, of the Clean Air Act, as amended in

[[Page 527]]

1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the 
requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the 
adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the 
sources covered by CTGs issued between January, 1978 and January, 1979 
and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT 
requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
[45 FR 10782, Feb. 19, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2373  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met. 
Vermont does not have the authority to make emissions data available to 
the public since 10 V.S.A. section 363 would require the data to be held 
confidential if a source certified that it related to production or 
sales figures, unique processes, or would tend to affect adversely the 
competitive position of the owner.
[37 FR 10899, May 31, 1972, as amended at 51 FR 40676, Nov. 7, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2374  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met 
since the plan does not provide for public availability of emission 
data.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

    (3) Stack height requirements.
    (4) Interstate pollution notification requirements.
    (5) Conflict of interest requirements.

Sec. 52.2383  Visibility protection.

    (a) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not

<R05>
Sec. 52.2384  Stack height review.

    The State of Vermont has declared to the satisfaction of EPA that no 
existing emission limitations have been affected by stack height credits 
greater than good engineering practice or any other prohibited 
dispersion techniques as defined in EPA's stack height regulations, as 
revised on July 8, 1985. This declaration was submitted to EPA on March 
21, 1986. The State has further declared in a letter from Harold T. 
Garabedian, dated March 21, 1986, that, ``[T]he State concludes that our 
present rule 5-502(4)(d) is adequate to insure that new emission sources 
will not be able to use credits from modeling ambient impacts at greater 
than `good engineering practice' stack height or from using `other 
dispersion techniques.' '' Thus, Vermont has satisfactorily demonstrated 
that its regulations meet 40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.

Sec. 52.2422  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2423  Approval status.

    (a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Virginia's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the 
national standards. The State included a provision dealing with open 
burning in its submittal of August 10, 1973.This provision was included 
for information purposes only and was not to be considered a part of the 
plan to implement national standards. Accordingly, this additional 
provision is not considered a part of the applicable plan.
    (b)-(c)  [Reserved]
    (d) The portion of the January 11, 1979 SIP submittal pertaining to 
Smyth County is not approved, pending a possible redesignation of the 
area to attainment status.
    (e) The requirements of Sec. 51.22 are not met with respect to 
section 4.55(b) of the Virginia regulations, because the regulation is 
not adequately enforceable. Therefore, section 4.55(b) is disapproved.
    (f) Section 120-04-02.A.3. of the Virginia Regulations for the 
Control and Abatement of Air Pollution is not considered part of the 
applicable plan because it contradicts a previously approved section of 
the SIP.
    (g) Section 4.31(d)(3) of Part IV of the Virginia Regulations for 
the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution is not considered part of the 
applicable plan because the substitute criteria, listed in section 
4.31(d)(3), contain inherent variations in quality control which do not 
present an accurate representation of collection efficiency.
    (h) In an April 19, 1991 request submitted by the Virginia 
Department of Air Pollution Control, the source-specific emission 
limitation for James River Paper which EPA had approved on August 18, 
1983 is deleted. James River Paper Co. (now known as Custom Papers 
Group--Richmond, Inc.) located in Richmond, Virginia is now required to 
comply with the applicable Virginia SIP paper coating regulation.
    (i) Pursuant to an October 31, 1991 request submitted by the 
Virginia Department of Air Pollution Control, the source-specific 
Alternate Control Program (bubble) for J.W. Fergusson & Sons, Inc. which 
EPA had approved on March 4, 1983, is removed from the plan. J.W. 
Fergusson & Sons, Inc. located in Richmond, Virginia is required to 
comply with the Virginia SIP graphic arts RACT regulation approved by 
EPA on January 25, 1984 (see 40 CFR 52.2420 (c)(48) and (c)(74)).
    (j) Letter of January 25, 1993, from the Commonwealth of Virginia 
transmitting a commitment to adopt either the Federal clean fuel fleet 
program or an alternative substitute program by May 15, 1994.
    (k) The maintenance plan SIP revision, and request to redesignate 
the Richmond moderate ozone nonattainment area to attainment were 
submitted on November 12, 1992, by the Department of Environmental 
Quality. These requests are disapproved because review of the 1993 
ambient air quality data monitored during the 1993 ozone season 
indicated that a violation of the ozone NAAQS occurred at the Charles 
City monitor in the Richmond nonattainment area . Because of the 
registered violation during the 1993 ozone season, the underlying basis 
of the Commonwealth's November 12, 1992,

maintenance plan's demonstration is no longer valid.
    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) EPA approves as part of the Virginia State Implementation Plan 
the documents listed in Appendix M, Sections II.A. through II.E and 
Section II.G. of the Virginia Regulations for the Control and Abatement 
of Air Pollution submitted by the Virginia Department of Air Pollution 
Control on April 12, 1989.
    (n) EPA approves as part of the Virginia State Implementation Plan 
the revised references to the documents listed in Appendix M, Sections 
II.A. and II.B. of the Virginia Regulations for the Control and 
Abatement of Air Pollution submitted by the Virginia Department of Air 
Pollution Control on February 12, 1993.
    (o) EPA approves the revised confidentiality of information 
provisions of Sections 120-02-30, submitted by the Virginia Department 
of Air Pollution Control on March 18, 1993, as revisions to the Virginia 
SIP. However, should Virginia submit a SIP revision request on behalf of 
a source, which contains information that has been judged confidential 
under the provisions of Section 120-02-30, Virginia must request EPA to 
consider confidentiality according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 2. 
EPA is obligated to keep such information confidential only if the 
criteria of 40 CFR part 2 are met.
    (p) EPA disapproves the revised public participation provisions of 
Sections 120-08-01G.1 and 120-08-01G.4.b, submitted by the Virginia 
Department of Air Pollution Control on March 29, 1993, as revisions to 
the Virginia SIP. These revised provisions do not meet the requirements 
of 40 CFR 51.160 and 51.161. In its place, EPA retains the SIP 
provisions of Section 120-08-01C.1.a and 01C.4.b through d. as 
originally approved at Secs. 52.2420(c)(69) [SIP section 2.33(a)(5)(ii)] 
and subsequently revised, due to format changes, at 
Secs. 52.2420(c)(89)(i)(B)(7) [SIP section 120-08-01C.4.b].

Sec. 52.2428  Control Strategy: Carbon monoxide and ozone.

    Determination--EPA has determined that, as of November 5, 1997, the 
Richmond ozone nonattainment area, which consists of the counties of 
Chesterfield, Hanover, Henrico, and part of Charles City County, and of 
the cities of Richmonds, Colonial Heights and Hopewell, has attained the 
1-hour .12 ppm ozone standard based on three years of air quality data 
for 1993, 1994 and 1995. EPA has further determined that the reasonable 
further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 
182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air 
Act do not apply to the Richmond area for so long as the area does not 
monitor any violations of the 1-hour .12ppm ozone standard, or until the 
area is no longer designated nonattainment. If a violation of the ozone 
NAAQS is monitored in the Richmond ozone nonattainment area while the 
area is designated nonattainment, these determinations shall no longer 
apply.

Sec. 52.2450  Conditional approval.

    (a) Virginia's September 28, 1994 SIP submittal of a Consent Order 
and Agreement (Order) between the Department of Environmental Quality of 
the Commonwealth of Virginia and Philip Morris, Inc. establishing 
reasonably available control technology (RACT) for the Manufacturing 
Center located in Richmond, Virginia is conditionally approved based on 
certain contingencies. The condition for approval is to revise and 
resubmit the Order as a SIP revision within one year of September 29, 
1995 according to one of the following: Eliminate the exemption to use 
non-ethanol-based flavorings in lieu of add-on controls; restrict the 
applicability of the exemption to the use of non-VOC based flavorings; 
or impose monitoring and reporting requirements sufficient to determine 
net increases or decreases in emissions on a mass basis relative to the 
emissions that would have occurred using add-on controls on an average 
not to exceed thirty days.
    (b) The Commonwealth of Virginia's March 27, 1996 submittal for an 
enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program is 
conditionally approved based on certain contingencies, for an interim 
period to last eighteen months. If the Commonwealth fails to start its 
program according to

[[Page 556]]

the schedule it provided, or by November 15, 1997 at the latest, this 
conditional approval will convert to a disapproval after EPA sends a 
letter to the state. If the Commonwealth fails to satisfy the following 
conditions within 12 months of this rulemaking, this conditional 
approval will automatically convert to a disapproval as explained under 
section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act. The conditions for approvability 
are as follows:
    (1) The Commonwealth must perform and submit the new modeling 
demonstration that illustrated how its program will meet the relevant 
enhanced performance standard by June 16, 1998. The Commonwealth's 
revised modeling must correspond to the actual I/M program 
configuration, including actual test methods and start dates for all I/M 
program tests, actual cutpoints to be in-place for the evaluation year, 
and all other program assumptions as they exist in the SIP. EPA expects 
that Virginia's new modeling demonstration will be done using an 
approved EPA model in order to meet this condition. Virginia should 
refer to EPA's guidance on modeling to determine which version of the 
model is appropriate and suitable for Virginia's use in meeting this 
commitment.
    (2) The Commonwealth must submit to EPA as a SIP amendment, by 
November 30, 1998, the final Virginia I/M program evaluation regulation 
requiring an approve alternative sound evaluation methodology to be 
performed on a minimum of 0.1 percent of the subject fleet each year as 
per 40 CFR 51.353(c)(3) and which meets the program evaluation elements 
as specified in 40 CFR 51.353(c).
    (3) By June 16, 1998, Virginia must adopt and submit a final 
Virginia I/M regulation which requires and which specifies detailed, 
approvable test procedures and equipment specifications for all of the 
evaporative and exhaust tests to be used in the enhanced I/M program. 
The Commonwealth has committed to adopt approvable test procedures, 
standards and specifications for its two-mode ASM test. The draft 
regulations submitted to EPA with the commitment letter, containing the 
two-mode ASM procedures and specifications do not comply in all respects 
with EPA's ASM technical guidance EPA-AA-RSPD-IM-96-2. EPA expects that 
Virginia will remedy any remaining discrepancies between its regulation 
and approved EPA specifications by the September 15, 1997 date.
    (c) In addition to the above conditions for approval, the 
Commonwealth must correct several minor, or de minimus deficiencies 
related to CAA requirements for enhanced I/M. Although satisfaction of 
these deficiencies does not affect the conditional approval status of 
the Commonwealth's rulemaking granted under the authority of Sec. 110 of 
the Clean Air Act, these deficiencies must be corrected in the final I/M 
SIP revision prior to the end of the 18-month interim period granted 
under the National Highway Safety Designation Act of 1995:
    (1) The SIP lacks a detailed description of the elements to satisfy 
the test frequency requirements required under 40 CFR 51.355(a), 
particularly regarding scheduling of vehicles for testing and the 
selection scheme for the biennial program inspections, as well as a 
description of how test frequency will be integrated with the 
registration denial motorist enforcement process;
    (2) The SIP does not fully account for all exceptions from testing 
in the emissions reductions analysis. The state must account for testing 
exceptions and account for them in their performance standard modeling 
demonstration, per 40 CFR 51.356(b)(2);
    (3) Virginia must develop quality control procedures, test equipment 
specifications, quality control procedures manual, or other ordinance or 
documents to satisfy all the quality control requirements of 40 CFR 
51.359;
    (4) Virginia must amend its regulation to allow that waivers be 
issued only by a single contractor or by the Commonwealth, per 40 CFR 
51.360(c)(1);
    (5) The final SIP submittal must include the procedures document 
that adequately addresses the means by which the Commonwealth will 
comply with all the motorist compliance enforcement program oversight 
requirements set forth at 40 CFR 51.362;
    (6) Virginia must complete and submit as a SIP revision to EPA 
procedures manuals for use by the Commonwealth's quality assurance 
auditors to

[[Page 557]]

conduct covert and overt audits for program oversight purposes, per 40 
CFR 51.363(e);
    (7) The Commonwealth must adopt, and submit as a SIP revision, a 
penalty schedule for inspectors and inspection stations, per 40 CFR 
51.364 (a) and (d);
    (8) Virginia's SIP, either the regulation or the test equipment 
specifications, must require that the specific data elements identified 
in 40 CFR 51.365(a) be collected and reported to the Commonwealth on a 
real-time basis;
    (9) Virginia must finalize and submit the final ``Public Information 
Plan'' described in the SIP, to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 
51.368 (a) and (b);
    (10) Virginia must formally submit the procedures and criteria to be 
used in meeting the repair performance monitoring requirements set forth 
in 40 CFR 51.369(b) and a description of the repair technician training 
resources available in the community (when available), per 40 CFR 
51.369(c);
    (11) Virginia must submit detailed recall compliance procedures and 
a commitment to annually report recall compliance information to EPA, 
per the requirements of 40 CFR 51.370;
    (12) Virginia must amend the SIP to include information regarding 
resource allocation for the on-road testing program, as well as methods 
for analyzing and reporting the results of on-road testing, per 40 CFR 
51.371. This may entail submittal of an on-road testing procedures 
manual or the request for proposals (RFP) for the contractor to be hired 
to operate the on-road testing program;
    (13) Virginia must list in its schedule of implementation milestones 
deadlines by which all procedures documents not yet part of the SIP are 
to be finalized and submitted to EPA.
    (d) EPA is also approving this Enhanced I/M SIP revision under 
section 110(k), for its strengthening effect on the plan.
    (e) The Commonwealth of Virginia's May 15, 1995 submittal for the 15 
Percent Rate of Progress Plan (15% plan) for the Northern Virginia 
portion of the Metropolitan Washington D.C. ozone nonattainment area, is 
conditionally approved based on certain contingencies, for an interim 
period. The conditions for approvability are as follows:
    (1) Virginia's 15% plan must be revised to account for growth in 
point sources from 1990-1996.
    (2) Virginia must meet the conditions listed in the November 6, 1996 
proposed conditional interim Inspection and Maintenance Plan (I/M) 
rulemaking notice, remodel the I/M reductions using the following two 
EPA guidance memos: ``Date by which States Need to Achieve all the 
Reductions Needed for the 15 Percent Plan from I/M and Guidance for 
Recalculation,'' note from John Seitz and Margo Oge, dated August 13, 
1996, and ``Modeling 15 Percent VOC Reductions from I/M in 1999--
Supplemental Guidance'', memorandum from Gay MacGregor and Sally Shaver, 
dated December 23, 1996.
    (3) Virginia must remodel to determine affirmatively the creditable 
reductions from RFG, and Tier 1 in accordance with EPA guidance.
    (4) Virginia must submit a SIP revision amending the 15% plan with a 
demonstration using appropriate documentation methodologies and credit 
calculations that the 54.5 tons/day reduction, supported through 
creditable emission reduction measures in the submittal, satisfies 
Virginia's 15% ROP requirement for the Metropolitan Washington D.C. 
nonattainment area.

Virginia, under common control by Merck & Co., Inc., and its successors 
in ownership, known as the Stonewall site.
    (c) Authority to issue permit. The permitting authority may issue to 
the site a permit which complies with the requirements of paragraphs (d) 
through (n) of this section. The Administrator may delegate, in whole or 
in part, pursuant to paragraph (o) of this section, the authority to 
administer the requirements of this section to a State air pollution 
control agency, or other agency authorized by the Administrator.
    (d) Site-wide emissions caps. The permit shall establish site-wide 
emissions caps as provided in this paragraph.
    (1) Initial site-wide emissions caps. The initial site-wide 
emissions caps shall be based on the site's actual emissions during a 
time period, within five years of the date of permit issuance, which 
represents normal site operation. The permitting authority may allow the 
use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more 
representative of normal source operation. Actual site-wide emissions 
shall be calculated using the actual operating hours, production rates, 
and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the 
selected time period.
    (i) Total criteria pollutant emissions cap. The permit shall 
establish a total criteria pollutant emissions cap (total emissions 
cap). The criteria pollutants included in the total emissions cap are 
the following: carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone (using volatile 
organic compounds as surrogate), particulate matter with an aerodynamic 
diameter less than 10 microns, and sulfur dioxide.
    (ii) Individual pollutant caps. The permit shall establish 
individual pollutant caps for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and 
PM<INF>10</INF>.
    (2) Adjustments to the site-wide emissions caps. (i) The permit 
shall require that upon completion of the powerhouse conversion, the 
site shall reduce the site-wide emissions caps as follows:
    (A) The total emissions cap shall be reduced by 20 percent from the 
initial site-wide emissions cap established pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(1)(i) of this section.

initial site-wide emissions cap established pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (C) The nitrogen oxide cap shall be reduced by 10 percent from the 
initial site-wide emissions cap established pursuant to paragraph 
(d)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) The permit may specify other reasons for adjustment of the 
site-wide emissions caps.
    (e) Operating under the site-wide emissions caps. (1) The permit 
shall require that the site's actual emissions of criteria pollutants 
shall not exceed the total emissions cap established pursuant to 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) The permit shall require that the site's actual emissions of 
sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and PM<INF>10</INF> shall not exceed the 
respective individual pollutant cap established pursuant to paragraph 
(d) of this section.
    (3) Compliance with the total emissions cap and individual pollutant 
caps shall be determined by comparing the respective cap to the 12-month 
rolling total for that cap. Compliance with the total emissions cap and 
individual pollutant caps shall be determined within one month of the 
end of each month based on the prior 12 months. The permit shall set 
forth the emission calculation techniques which the site shall use to 
calculate site-wide actual criteria pollutant emissions.
    (4) Installation of controls for significant modifications and 
significant new installations. (i) This paragraph applies to significant 
modifications and significant new installations. Significant 
modifications for the purposes of this section are defined as changes to 
an existing process unit that result in an increase of the potential 
emissions of the process unit, after consideration of existing controls, 
of more than the significance levels listed in paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of 
this section. Significant new installations for the purposes of this 
section are defined as new process units with potential emissions before 
controls that exceed the significance levels listed in paragraph 
(e)(4)(ii) of

[[Page 560]]

this section. For purposes of this section, potential emissions means 
process unit point source emissions that would be generated by the 
process unit operating at its maximum capacity.
    (ii) The significance levels for determining significant 
modifications and significant new installations are: 100 tons per year 
of carbon monoxide; 40 tons per year of nitrogen oxides; 40 tons per 
year of sulfur dioxide; 40 tons per year of volatile organic compounds; 
and 15 tons per year of PM<INF>10</INF>.
    (iii) For any significant modification or significant new 
installation, the permit shall require that the site install, at the 
process unit, emission controls, pollution prevention or other 
technology that represents good environmental engineering practice in 
the pharmaceutical or batch processing industry, based on the emission 
characteristics (such as flow, variability, pollutant properties) of the 
process unit.
    (f) Operation of control equipment. The permit shall require that 
the site shall continue to operate the emissions control equipment that 
was previously subject to permit requirements at the time of issuance of 
a permit pursuant to this section. This equipment shall be operated in a 
manner which minimizes emissions, considering the technical and physical 
operational aspects of the equipment and associated processes. This 
operation shall include an operation and maintenance program based on 
manufacturers' specifications and good engineering practice.
    (g) Powerhouse conversion. The permit shall require that the site 
convert the steam-generating powerhouse from burning coal as the primary 
fuel to burning natural gas as the primary fuel and either No. 2 fuel 
oil or propane as backup fuel.
    (1) The new boilers shall be equipped with low nitrogen oxides 
technology.
    (2) The site shall complete the powerhouse conversion (completion of 
the powerhouse conversion) no later than 30 months after the effective 
date of the permit.
    (h) Monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting. (1) The permit shall 
set forth monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements 
sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the site-wide emissions caps. 
The monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements shall be 
structured in a tiered system, such that the requirements become more 
stringent as the site's emissions approach the total emissions cap.
    (2) At a minimum, the permit shall require that the site submit to 
the permitting authority semi-annual reports of the site-wide criteria 
pollutant emissions (expressed as a 12-month rolling total) for each 
month covered by the report. These reports shall include a calculation 
of the total emissions cap, as well as, the emissions of sulfur dioxide, 
nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and 
PM<INF>10</INF>.
    (3) Any reports required by the permit to be submitted on an annual 
or semi-annual basis shall contain a certification by the site's 
responsible official that to his belief, based on reasonable inquiry, 
the information submitted in the report is true, accurate, and complete.
    (4) Any records required by the permit shall be retained on site for 
at least five years.
    (i) Air quality analysis. The permittee shall demonstrate, prior to 
permit issuance and on a periodic basis which shall be specified in the 
permit, that emissions from construction or operation of the site will 
not cause or contribute to air pollution in excess of any:
    (1) Maximum allowable increase or maximum allowable concentration 
for any pollutant, pursuant to section 165 of the Act;
    (2) National ambient air quality standard or;
    (3) Other applicable emission standard or standard of performance 
under the Act.
    (j) Termination. (1) The permit may be terminated as provided in 
this paragraph for reasons which shall include the following, as well as 
any other termination provisions specified in the permit:
    (i) If the Administrator or the permitting authority determines that 
continuation of the permit is an imminent and substantial endangerment 
to public health or welfare, or the environment;
    (ii) If the permittee knowingly falsifies emissions data;

[[Page 561]]

    (iii) If the permittee fails to implement the powerhouse conversion 
pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section;
    (iv) If the permittee receives four consent orders or two judgments 
adverse to the site arising from non-compliance with this permit in a 
five year period that are deemed material by the Administrator or the 
permitting authority; or
    (v) If the total emissions cap is exceeded.
    (2) In the event of termination, the Administrator or the permitting 
authority shall provide the permittee with written notice of its intent 
to terminate the permit. Within 30 calendar days of the site's receipt 
of this notice, the site may take corrective action to remedy the cause 
of the termination. If this remedy, which may include a corrective 
action plan and schedule, is deemed acceptable by the Administrator or 
the permitting authority (whichever agency provided written notice of 
its intent to terminate the permit), the action to terminate the permit 
shall be withdrawn. Otherwise, the permit shall be terminated in 
accordance with procedures specified in the permit.
    (3) Termination of the permit does not waive the site's obligation 
to complete any corrective actions relating to non-compliance under the 
permit.
    (k) Inspection and entry. (1) Upon presentation of credentials and 
other documents as may be required by law, the site shall allow 
authorized representatives of the Administrator and the permitting 
authority to perform the following:
    (i) Enter upon the site;
    (ii) Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that 
must be kept under the conditions of the permit;
    (iii) Have access at reasonable times to batch and other plant

during operating hours, for the purpose of assuring permit compliance or 
as otherwise authorized by the Act.
    (2) No person shall obstruct, hamper, or interfere with any such 
authorized representative while in the process of carrying out his 
official duties. Refusal of entry or access may constitute grounds for 
permit violation and assessment of civil penalties.
    (3) Such site, facility and equipment access, and sampling and 
monitoring shall be subject to the site's safety and industrial hygiene 
procedures, and Food and Drug Administration Good Manufacturing Practice 
requirements (21 CFR parts 210 and 211) in force at the site.

Sec. 52.2472  Extensions.

    The Administrator, by authority delegated under section 188(d) of 
the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, extends for one year (until 
December 31, 1995) the attainment date for the Spokane, Washington, PM-
10 nonattainment area and the Wallula, Washington, PM-10 nonattainment 
area.

Sec. 52.2473  Approval status.

    With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator 
approves Washington's plan for the attainment and maintenance of 
National Standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. The 
regulations included in the SIP (See Table 52.2479) are applicable 
statewide unless otherwise noted in the regulation itself. Furthermore, 
the Administrator finds that the plan as identified in Sec. 52.2470 
satisfies requirements of Part D, Title 1, of the Clean Air act as 
amended in 1977, except as noted in the following sections. Continued 
satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the 
SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 
1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and 
January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of 
additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the 
previous January. New source review permits pursuant to section 173 of 
CAA will not be deemed valid by EPA unless the provisions of Section V 
of the emission offset interpretive rule published on January 16, 1979 
(44 FR 3274) are met.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2474  General requirements.

    (a) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1-June 30 and July 1-December 31.

[[Page 580]]

    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in 
the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

Sec. 52.2476  Discretionary authority.

    (a) This section applies to any variance, exception, exemption, 
alternative emission limitation, bubble, alternative sampling or testing 
method, compliance schedule revision, alternative compliance schedule, 
or any other substantial change to a provision of the state 
implementation plan, granted by the Department of Ecology, the 
Department of Natural Resources, the Energy Facility Site Evaluation 
Council, or a local air pollution control agency in accordance with any 
discretionary authority granted under its statutes or regulations, 
regardless of whether such statutes or regulations are part of the state 
implementation plan.
    (b) Any change to a provision of the state implementation plan 
described in paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted by the 
state for approval by EPA in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 
51.104.
    (c) Any change to a provision of the state implementation plan 
described in paragraph (a) of this section does not modify the 
requirements of the federally-approved state implementation plan or a 
federally-promulgated implementation plan until approved by EPA as a 
revision to the state implementation plan in accordance with section 110 
of the Clean Air Act.

    (42) On July 12, 1979, the State of Wisconsin submitted its new 
source review (NSR) regulations. Additional information was submitted on 
September 4, 1979, November 27, 1979, May 1, 1980, and February 18, 
1981. USEPA has previously approved these submittals as they relate to 
the NSR plan for nonattainment areas. See (c) (18). USEPA is now 
approving these submittals as they relate to the general NSR 
requirements for attainment and unclassified areas. USEPA is not 
approving these submittals with regard to the Prevention of Significant 
Deterioration (PSD) requirements, and USEPA's approval of Wisconsin's 
NSR rules should not be interpreted to apply to PSD. USEPA is approving 
Secs. 144.394(2) and 144.394(5) of the State Statutes provided that all 
variances (144.394(2)) and emission reduction options (144.394(5)) are 
submitted to USEPA as SIP revisions. On November 6, 1985, the State 
submitted a letter committing to: (1) Revise its regulations to conform 
with USEPA's July 8, 1985, rulemaking concerning stack height credits 
for air quality modeling; and (2) implement all air quality modeling 
analyses to conform with the July 8, 1985, rulemaking until the revised 
State regulations are enacted.

154.015, Department Review Times.
    (i) Incorporation by reference.
    (A) Letter from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, dated 
June 14, 1985, and section NR 154.015 of the Wisconsin Administrative 
Code as a revision to the Wisconsin SIP, effective on May 1, 1985. 
Section NR 154.015 is entitled ``Department Review Times'', and it 
establishes time limits for review and action by the Wisconsin 
Department of Natural Resources on three types of air permit 
applications.
    (50) On November 20, 1986, the State of Wisconsin submitted a 
revision to the Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance program (I/M) portion 
of its ozone/CO SIP. This was a revised rule Table 1 for NR 485.04, 
Wisconsin Administrative Code, plus State SIP Revision Certification.

    (51) [Reserved]
    (52) On December 1, 1987, the Wisconsin Department of Natural 
Resources (WDNR) submitted NR 418.06. NR 418.06 is an SO<INF>2</INF> 
rule which is only applicable to the Badger Paper Mills facility, 
located in the City of Peshtigo, Marinette County, Wisconsin.
    (i) Incorporation by reference. (A) Natural Resources (NR) 418.06,

    (53)-(54) [Reserved]
    (55) On January 28, 1985, Wisconsin submitted its Rothschild 
(Marathon County) SO<INF>2</INF> plan, which contains emission limits 
for sources in the City of Rothschild and the Town of Weston, 
specifically for the Weyerhaeuser Paper Company and the Reed-Lignin 
Company, respectively. USEPA is approving NR 418.08 because this 
revision meets the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act, 42 
U.S.C. 7501-7508. The Wisconsin SIP, however, contains additional 
existing requirements for SO<INF>2</INF>. Today's action on NR 418.08 
has been integrated within Wisconsin's existing SIP regulations, and 
does not eliminate a source's obligation to comply with all existing 
SO<INF>2</INF> SIP requirements. Specifically, today's action in no way 
affects the terms and conditions of a Federal Consent Decree entered 
into by USEPA and the Weyerhaeuser Company located in Rothschild, 
Wisconsin No. 89-C-0973-C (W.D. Wis., filed November 1, 1989). This 
Consent Decree resolves USEPA's enforcement action against Weyerhaeuser 
Company for violations of SIP rule NR 154.12(1) (now recodified as 
418.08). In that Decree, Weyerhaeuser committed to comply with NR 
154.12(1) by installing a desulfurization scrubber. August 15, 1989, the 
WDNR issued a construction permit to Weyerhaeuser which limit the 
combined emissions of Weyerhaeuser's acid plant and desulfurization 
scrubber to 28 pounds of SO<INF>2</INF> per hour. The conditions and 
terms of this construction permit and of the Consent Decree remain 
federally enforceable. On May 9, 1987, 18 months past the effective date 
of USEPA's designation of Marathon County as a primary SO<INF>2</INF> 
non-attainment area (October 9, 1985, (50 FR 41139)), a construction 
moratorium was imposed in Marathon County under section 110(a)(2)(I) of 
the Clean Air Act because the county did not have a USEPA approved plan 
which assured the attainment and maintenance of the SO<INF>2</INF> 
NAAQS. However, USEPA final approval of Rothschild's SO<INF>2</INF> SIP 
will lift the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban in Marathon County.

Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for forecasting VMT in the 
severe ozone nonattainment area of southeastern Wisconsin and 
demonstrated that Transportation Control Measures would not be necessary 
to offset growth in emissions.
    (h) Approval--On November 15, 1993, the Wisconsin Department of 
Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation 
Plan. The submittal pertained to a plan for forecasting VMT in the 
severe ozone nonattainment area of southeastern Wisconsin and 
demonstrated that Transportation Control Measures would not be necessary 
to meet the 15 percent Rate-of-Progress milestone.
    (i) Approval--EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen 
(NO<INF>X</INF>) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new 
source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general 
conformity exemptions for the moderate and above ozone nonattainment 
areas within Wisconsin as requested by the States of Illinois, Indiana, 
Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. This approval also 
covers the exemption of transportation and general conformity 
requirements of section 176(c) for the Door and Walworth marginal ozone 
nonattainment areas. Approval of these exemptions is contingent on the 
results of the final ozone attainment demonstration expected to be 
submitted in mid-1997. The approval will be modified if the final 
attainment demonstration demonstrates that NO<INF>X</INF> emission 
controls are needed in any of the nonattainment areas to attain the 
ozone standard in the Lake Michigan Ozone Study modeling domain.
    (j) Approval--On June 14, 1995, the Wisconsin Department of Natural 
Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. 
The submittal pertained to a plan for the implementation and enforcement 
of the Federal transportation conformity requirements at the State or 
local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 51, subpart T--Conformity to 
State or Federal Implementation Plans of

[[Page 624]]

Transportation Plans, Programs, and Projects Developed, Funded or 
Approved Under Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act.
    (k) Approval--On December 15, 1995, and May 15, 1996, the Wisconsin 
Department of Natural Resources submitted requests to redesignate 
Walworth County and Sheboygan and Kewaunee Counties, respectively, from 
nonattainment to attainment for ozone. The State also submitted 
maintenance plans as required by section 175A of the Clean Air Act, 42 
U.S.C. 7505a. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plans include 
attainment emission inventories for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC, 
demonstrations of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission 
inventories to the year 2007 for NO<INF>X</INF> and VOC, plans to verify 
continued attainment, and contingency plans. If a violation of the ozone 
NAAQS, determined to be caused by local sources is monitored, Wisconsin 
will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) contained 
in the contingency plan. Once a violation of the ozone NAAQS is 
recorded, the State will notify EPA and review the data for quality 
assurance. A plan to analyze the violation, including an analysis of 
meteorological conditions, will be submitted within 60 days to EPA-
Region 5 for approval. Within 14 months of the violation, Wisconsin will 
complete and public notice the analysis and submit it to EPA-Region 5 
for review. If the analysis shows that local sources caused the 
violation, Wisconsin will implement the contingency measures within 24 
months after the violation. The contingency measures to be implemented 
in Walworth County are Stage II vapor recovery and non-Control 
Technology Guideline (non-CTG) Reasonably available control technology 
(RACT) limits. Contingency measures to be implemented in either Kewaunee 
or Sheboygan County are lower major source applicability thresholds for 
industrial sources and new gasoline standards which will lower VOC 
emissions. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the 
redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act, 
respectively.
    (l) Wisconsin's November 15, 1994 request for a temporary delay of 
the ozone attainment date for Manitowoc County from 1996 to 2007 and 
suspension of the automatic reclassification of Manitowoc County to 
serious nonattainment for ozone is approved, based on Wisconsin's 
demonstration through photochemical grid modeling that transport from 
upwind areas makes it ``practicably impossible'' for the County to 
attain the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard by its original 
attainment date.
    (m) Approval--On July 10, 1996, the Wisconsin Department of Natural 
Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan. 
The submittal pertained to a request to waive the Oxide of Nitrogen 
requirements for transportation conformity in the Milwaukee and 
Manitowoc ozone nonattainment areas.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2725  General requirements.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met, 
since section 2.4 of the Puerto Rico Regulation for Control of 
Atmospheric Pollution could, in some circumstances, prohibit the 
disclosure of emission data to the public. Therefore, section 2.4 is 
disapproved.
    (b) Regulation for public availability of emission data. (1) Any 
person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for 
making emission data available to the public, as specified in the 
applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to 
emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request 
that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such 
data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the 
Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such 
source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of 
emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the applicable plan.
    (2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional 
Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or 
operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts 
of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed 
necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source 
is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control 
measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be 
summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms 
furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 
45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are 
January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
    (3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this 
summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be 
retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which 
the pertinent report is submitted.
    (4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary 
sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and 
other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be 
available at the appropriate regional office and at other

[[Page 637]]

locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2726  Legal authority.

    (a) The requirements of Sec. 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, 
since Article 17 of Puerto Rico Act 9 could, in some circumstances, 
prohibit the disclosure of emission data to the public. Therefore, 
Article 17 is disapproved.

<R05>
Sec. 52.2729  Significant deterioration of air quality.

    (a) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air 
Act are not met, since the plan does not include approvable procedures 
for preventing the significant deterioration of air quality.
    (b) Regulations for preventing significant deterioration of air 
quality. The provisions of Sec. 52.21(b) through (w) are hereby 
incorporated and made a part of the applicable state plan for the State 
of Puerto Rico.

Sec. 52.2730  [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 52.2731  Control strategy and regulations: Sulfur oxides.

    (a) The requirements of subpart G of this chapter are not met since 
the Puerto Rico plan does not provide for attainment and maintenance of 
the national standards for sulfur oxides in the areas of Aguirre, 
Barceloneta, Trujillo Alto-Dorado and Ensenada.
    (b) Article 6, as submitted to EPA on January 3, 1975, of the Puerto 
Rico Regulations for Control of Atmospheric Pollution, as it applies to 
those areas listed in paragraph (a) of this section is disapproved for 
the following facilities: Puerto RicoWater Resources Authority--Aguirre 
Complex, Abbott, Merck and Company, Bristol Meyers, Pfizer, Union 
Carbide, Upjohn, located in the Barceloneta air basin, and Central 
Guanica, located in the Aquada air basin. Accordingly, these sources, 
with the exception of the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority--Aguirre 
Complex, are required to conform to the sulfur in fuel limitations 
contained in Article 6 of the Puerto Rico implementation plan as 
submitted to EPA on January 31, 1972.
    (c) On and after the effective date of this paragraph, the maximum 
allowable sulfur in fuel limitation, by weight, for the Puerto Rico 
Water Resources Authority Aguirre complex shall be 2.5 percent.
    (d) The requirements of section 110 of the Clean Air Act are not met 
since Article 6 of the Puerto Rico Regulation for Control of Atmospheric 
Pollution would permit the use of stack height increases in lieu of 
available methods for emission reduction. Therefore, Section H of 
Appendix A of Article 6 of the Puerto Rico Regulation for Control of 
Atmospheric Pollution is disapproved to the extent that it would permit 
increases in stack height in lieu of available methods of emission 
reduction.

    (3) The entire regulation excluding subsection (a)(2) as it applies 
to the remaining sources on the island of St. Croix.

Subsection (a)(2) of the regulation is not approved as it applies to the 
remaining sources on St. Croix because of the inadequacy of the control 
strategy demonstration noted in paragraph (a) of this section. 
Accordingly, all sources on St. Croix with the exception of the Virgin 
Islands Water and Power Authority's Christiansted Power Plant are 
required to conform to the sulfur-in-fuel-oil limitations contained in 
12 V.I.R. and R. 9:204-26 as originally submitted to EPA on January 31, 
1972.

and R. 9:204-26, as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as amended 
and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976, refers to the following approved 
limitations: (1) For the islands of St. Thomas and St. John, subsection 
(a)(2) of section 204-26 as submitted to EPA on January 21, 1976 and as 
amended and resubmitted to EPA on June 3, 1976; (2) for the island of

------------------------------------------------------------------------
<SUP>a Expressed as sum of absolute mean value plus 95 percent confidence
  interval of a series of tests.

    5. Performance Specification Test Procedures.
    The following test procedures shall be used to determine compliance 
with the requirements of paragraph 4:
    5.1  Calibration test.
    5.1.1  Analyze each calibration gas mixture (50 percent, 90 percent) 
for sulfur dioxide by the Reference method and record the results on the 
example sheet shown in Figure D-1. This step may be omitted for 
nonextractive

[[Page 647]]

monitors where dynamic calibration gas mixtures are not used (see 
section 5.1.2).
    5.1.2  Set up and calibrate the complete measurement system 
according to the manufacturer's written instructions. This may be 
accomplished either in the laboratory or in the field. Make a series of 
five nonconsecutive readings with span gas mixtures alternately at each 
concentration (example, 50 percent, 90 percent, 50 percent, 90 percent, 
50 percent). For nonextractive measurement systems, this test may be 
performed using procedures specified by the manufacturer and two or more 
calibration gases whose concentrations are certified by the manufacturer 
and differ by a factor of two or more. Convert the measurement system 
output readings to ppm and record the results on the example sheet shown 
in Figure D-2.
    5.2  Field Test for Accuracy (Relative), Zero Drift and Calibration 
Drift. Install and operate the measurement system in accordance with the 
manufacturer's written instructions and drawings as follows:
    5.2.1  Conditioning Period. Offset the zero setting at least 10 
percent of span so that negative zero drift may be quantified. Operate 
the system for an initial 168-hour conditioning period. During this 
period the system should measure the SO<INF>2</INF> content of the 
effluent in a normal operational manner.
    5.2.2  Operational Test Period. Operate the system for an additional 
168-hour period. The system shall be monitoring the source effluent at 
all times when not being zeroed, calibrated or backpurged.
    5.2.2.1  Field Test for Accuracy (Relative). The analyzer output for 
the following test shall be maintained between 20 percent and 90 percent 
of span. It is recommended that a calibrated gas mixture be used to 
verify the span setting utilized. During this 168-hour test period, make 
a minimum of nine (9) SO<INF>2</INF> concentration measurements using 
the Reference Method with a sampling period of one hour. If a 
measurement system operates across the stack or a portion of it, the 
Reference Method test shall make a four-point traverse over the 
measurement system operating path. Isokinetic sampling and analysis for 
SO<INF>3</INF> and H<INF>2</INF> SO<INF>4</INF> mist are not required. 
For measurement systems employing extractive sampling, place the 
measurement system and the Reference Method probe tips adjacent to each 
other in the duct. One test will consist of two simultaneous samples 
with not less than two analyses on each sample. Record the test data and 
measurement system concentrations on the example sheet shown in Figure 
D-3.
    5.2.2.2  Field Test for Zero Drift and Calibration Drift. Determine 
the values given by zero and span gas SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations at 
2-hour intervals until 15 sets of data are obtained. Alternatively, for 
nonextractive measurement systems, determine the values given by an 
electrically or mechanically produced zero condition, and by inserting a 
certified calibration gas concentration equivalent to not less than 20 
percent of span, into the measurement system. Record these readings on 
the example sheet shown in Figure D-4. These 2-hour periods need not be 
consecutive but may not overlap. If the analyzer span is set at the 
expected maximum concentration for the tests performed under section 
5.2.2, then the zero and span determinations to be made under this 
paragraph may be made concurrent with the tests under section 5.2.2.1. 
Zero and calibration corrections and adjustments are allowed only at 24-
hour intervals (except as required under section 5.2.2) or at such 
shorter intervals as the manufacturer's written instructions specify. 
Automatic corrections made by the measurement system without operator 
intervention or initiation are allowable at any time. During the entire 
168-hour test period, record the values given by zero and span gas 
SO<INF>2</INF> concentrations before and after adjustment at 24-hour 
intervals in the example sheet shown in Figure D-5.
    5.3  Field Test for Response Time.
    5.3.1  This test shall be accomplished using the entire measurement 
system as installed including sample transport lines if used. Flow 
rates, line diameters, pumping rates, pressures (do not allow the 
pressurized calibration gas to change the normal operating pressure in 
the sample line), etc., shall be at the nominal values for normal 
operation as specified in the manufacturer's written instructions. In 
the case of cyclic analyzers, the response time test shall include one 
cycle.
    5.3.2  Introduce a zero concentration of SO<INF>2</INF> into the 
measurement system sampling interface or as close to the sampling 
interface as possible. When the system output reading has stabilized, 
switch quickly to a known concentration of SO<INF>2</INF> at 70 to 90 
percent of span. Record the time from concentration switching to final 
stable response. After the system response has stabilized at the upper 
level, switch quickly to a zero concentration of SO<INF>2</INF>. Record 
the time from concentration switching to final stable response. 
Alternatively, for nonextractive monitors, a calibration gas 
concentration equivalent to 20 percent of span or more may be switched 
into and out of the sample path and response times recorded. Perform 
this test sequence three (3) times. For each test record the results on 
the example sheet shown in Figure D-6.

    The values in this table are already corrected for n-1 degrees of 
freedom. Use n equal to the number of samples as data points.
    6.2  Data Analysis and Reporting.
    6.2.1  Accuracy (Relative). For each of the nine reference method 
testing periods, determine the average sulfur dioxide concentration 
reported by the continuous measurement system. These average 
concentrations shall be determined from the measurement system data 
recorded under section 5.2.2.1 by integrating the pollutant 
concentrations over each of the time intervals concurrent with each 
reference method test, then dividing by the cumulative time of each 
applicable reference method testing period. Before proceeding to the 
next step, determine the basis (wet or dry) of the measurement system 
data and reference method test data concentrations.
    If the bases are not consistent, apply a moisture correction to 
either the referenced method concentrations or the measurement system 
concentrations, as appropriate. Determine the correction factor by 
moisture tests concurrent with the reference method testing periods. 
Report the moisture test method and the correction procedure employed. 
For each of the nine test runs, subtract the Reference Method test 
concentrations from the continuous monitoring system average 
concentrations. Using these data, compute the mean difference and the 95 
percent confidence interval using equations D-1 and D-2. Accuracy is 
reported as the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and the 
95 percent confidence interval expressed as a percentage of the mean 
reference method value. Use the example sheet shown in Figure D-3.
    6.2.2  Calibration Error. Using the data from section 5.1 of this 
appendix, subtract the measured SO<INF>2</INF> value determined under 
section 5.1.1 (Figure D-1) from the value shown by the measurement 
system for each of the 5 readings at each concentration measured under 
section 5.1.2 (Figure D-2). Calculate the mean of these difference 
values and the 95 percent confidence intervals according to equations D-
1 and D-2. The calibration error is reported as the sum of absolute 
value of the mean difference and the 95 percent confidence interval as a 
percentage of each respective calibration gas concentration. Use example 
sheet shown in Figure D-2.
    6.2.3  Zero Drift (2-hour). Using the zero concentration values 
measured each two hours during the field test, calculate the differences 
between consecutive two-hour readings expressed in ppm. Calculate the 
mean difference and the confidence interval using Equations D-1 and D-2. 
Report the zero drift as the sum of the absolute mean value and the 
confidence interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use 
example sheet shown in Figure D-4.
    6.2.4  Zero Drift (24-hour). Using the zero concentration values 
measured every 24 hours during the field test, calculate the differences 
between the zero point after zero adjustment and the zero value 24 hours 
later just prior to zero adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these 
points and the confidence interval using Equations D-1 and D-2. Report 
the zero drift as the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval 
as a percentage of the emission standard. Use example sheet shown in 
Figure D-5.
    6.2.5  Calibration Drift (2-hour). Using the calibration values 
obtained at two-hour intervals during the field test, calculate the 
differences between consecutive two-hour readings expressed as ppm. 
These values should be corrected for the corresponding zero drift during 
that two-hour period. Calculate the mean and confidence interval of 
these corrected difference values using Equations D-1 and D-2. Do not 
use the differences between non-consecutive readings. Report the 
calibration drift as the sum of the absolute mean and confidence 
interval as a percentage of the emission standard. Use the example sheet 
shown in Figure D-4.
    6.2.6  Calibration Drift (24-hour). Using the calibration values 
measured every 24 hours

[[Page 649]]

during the field test, calculate the differences between the calibration 
concentration reading after zero and calibration adjustment and the 
calibration concentration reading 24 hours later after zero adjustment 
but before calibration adjustment. Calculate the mean value of these 
differences and the confidence interval using equations D-1 and D-2. 
Report the sum of the absolute mean and confidence interval as a 
percentage of the emission standard. Use the example sheet shown in 
Figure D-5.
    6.2.7  Response Time. Using the charts from section 5.3 of this 
Appendix, calculate the time interval from concentration switching to 95 
percent to the final stable value for all upscale and downscale tests. 
Report the mean of the three upscale test times and the mean of the 
three downscale test times. For nonextractive instruments using a 
calibration gas cell to determine response time, the observed times 
shall be extrapolated to 90 percent of full scale response time. For 
example, if the observed time for a 20 percent of span gas cell is one 
minute, this would be equivalent to a 4\1/2\-minute response time when 
extrapolated to 90 percent of span. The two average times should not 
differ by more than 15 percent of the slower time. Report the slower 
time as the system response time. Use the example sheet shown in Figure 
D-6.
    6.2.8  Operational Period. During the 168-hour performance and 
operational test period, the measurement system shall not require any 
corrective maintenance, repair, replacement, or adjustment other than 
that clearly specified as required in the operation and maintenance 
manuals as routine and expected during a one-week period. If the 
measurement system operates within the specified performance parameters 
and does not require corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or 
adjustment other than specified above, during the 168-hour test period, 
the operational period will be successfully concluded. Failure of the 
measurement to meet this requirement shall call for a repetition of the 
168-hour test period. Portions of the test which were satisfactorily 
completed need not be repeated. Failure to meet any performance 
specifications shall call for a repetition of the one-week performance 
test period and that portion of the testing which is related to the 
failed specification. All maintenance and adjustments required shall be 
recorded. Output readings shall be recorded before and after all 
adjustments.
    6.2.9  Performance Specifications Testing Frequency. In the event 
that significant repair work is performed in the system, the company 
shall demonstrate to the Administrator that the system still meets the 
performance specifications listed in Table I of this appendix. The 
Administrator may require a performance test at any time he determines 
that such test is necessary to verify the performance of the measurement 
system.

  Appendix E to Part 52--Performance Specifications and, Specification 
     Test Procedures for Monitoring Systems for Effluent Stream Gas 
                          Volumetric Flow Rate

    1. Principle and applicability.
    1.1  Principle. Effluent stream gas volumetric flow rates are 
sampled and analyzed by a continuous measurement system. To verify the 
measurement system performance, values obtained from the measurement 
system are compared against simultaneous values obtained using the 
reference method. These comparison tests will be performed to determine 
the relative accuracy, and drift of the measurement system over the 
range of operating conditions expected to occur during normal operation 
of the source. If the measurement system is such that the specified 
tests in section 5.1 for drift do not apply, those test procedures shall 
be disregarded.
    1.2  Applicability. This method is applicable to subparts which 
require continuous gas volumetric flow rate measurement. Specifications 
are given in terms of performance. Test procedures are given for 
determining compliance with performance specifications.
    2. Apparatus.
    2.1  Continuous measurement system for determining stack gas 
volumetric flow rate.
    2.2  Equipment for measurement of stack gas volumetric flow rate as 
specified in the reference method.
    3. Definitions.
    3.1  Measurement system. The total equipment required for the 
determination of the gas volumetric flow rate in a duct or stack. The 
system consists of three major subsystems:
    3.1.1  Sampling interface. That portion of the measurement system 
that performs one or more of the following operations: Delineation, 
acquisition, transportation, and conditioning of a signal from the stack 
gas and protection of the analyzer from any hostile aspects of the 
source environment.
    3.1.2  Analyzer. That portion of the measurement system which senses 
the stack gas flow rate or velocity pressure and generates a signal 
output that is a function of the flow rate or velocity of the gases.
    3.1.3  Data presentation. That portion of the measurement system 
that provides a display of the output signal in terms of volumetric flow 
rate units, or other units which are convertible to volumetric flow rate 
units.
    3.2  Span. The value of gas volumetric flow rate at which the 
measurement system is set to produce the maximum data display output. 
For the purposes of this method, the span shall be set at 1.5 times the 
maximum volumetric flow rate expected under varying operating conditions 
of the source.
    3.3  Zero drift. The change in measurement system output over a 
stated period of time of normal continuous operation when gas volumetric 
flow rate at the time of the measurements is zero.
    3.4  Calibration drift. The change in measurement system output over 
a stated time period of normal continuous operation when the gas 
volumetric flow rate at the time of the measurement is 67 percent of the 
span value.
    3.5  Operation period. A minimum period of time over which a 
measurement system is expected to operate within certain performance 
specifications without unscheduled maintenance, repair, or adjustment.
    3.6  Orientation sensitivity. The angular tolerance to which the 
sensor can be misaligned from its correct orientation to measure the 
flow rate vector before a specified error occurs in the indicated flow 
rate compared to the reference flow rate.
    3.7  Reference method. Method 2 as delineated in 40 CFR Part 60.
    4. Measurement system performance specifications. A measurement 
system must meet the performance specifications in Table E-1 to be 
considered acceptable under this method.

                                Table E-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
               Parameter                          Specifications
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accuracy (relative)....................  <10 percent of mean reference
                                          value (paragraph 6.3.1).
Zero drift (24 hours)..................  < 3 percent of span (paragraph
                                          6.3.2).
Calibration drift (24 hours)...........  < 3 percent of span (paragraph
                                          6.3.3).
Operational period.....................  < 168 hours minimum.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    5. Test procedures.
    5.1  Field test for accuracy, zero drift, calibration drift, and 
operation period.
    5.1.1  System conditioning. Set up and operate the measurement 
system in accordance with the manufacturer's written instructions and 
drawings. Offset the zero point of the chart recorder so that negative 
values up to 5 percent of the span value may be registered. Operate the 
system for an initial 168-hour conditioning period. During this initial 
period, the system should measure the gas

[[Page 653]]

stream volumetric flow rate in a normal operational manner. After 
completion of this conditioning period, the formal 168-hour performance 
and operational test period shall begin.
    5.1.2  Field test for accuracy and operational period. During the 
168-hour test period, the system should be continuously measuring gas 
volumetric flow rate at all times. During this period make a series of 
14 volumetric flow rate determinations simultaneously using the 
reference method and the measurement system. The 14 determinations can 
be made at any time interval at least one hour apart during the 168-hour 
period except that at least one determination on five different days 
must be made with one determination on the last day of such period. The 
determinations shall be conducted over the range of volumetric flow 
rates expected to occur during normal operation of the source. The 
measurement system volumetric flow rate reading corresponding to the 
period of time during which each reference method run was made may be 
obtained by continuous integration of the measurement system signal over 
the test interval. Integration may be by use of mechanical integration 
of electrical units on the chart recorder or use of a planimeter on the 
strip chart recorder. The location and orientation of the reference 
method measurement device and the measurement system should be as close 
as practical without interference, but no closer than 1.3 cm (0.5 inch) 
to each other and shall be such that dilution air or other interferences 
cannot be interjected into the stack or duct between the pitot tube and 
the measurement system. Be careful not to locate the reference method 
pitot tube directly up or down stream of the measurement system sensor.
    5.1.3  Field test for calibration drift and zero drift. At 24-hour 
intervals, but more frequently if recommended by the manufacturer, 
subject the measurement system to the manufacturer's specified zero and 
calibration procedures, if appropriate. Record the measurement system 
output readings before and after adjustment. Automatic corrections made 
by the system without operator intervention are allowable at anytime.
    5.1.4  Field test for orientation sensitivity. If a velocity 
measurement system is either a single point measurement device or a 
pressure sensor or any other device such as pitot tube which uses the 
flow direction of the test gas, then the following test shall be 
followed and a performance specification of <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>10 
degrees device orientation sensitivity for <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>4 
percent flow rate determination accuracy must be met in order for the 
measurement system to be considered acceptable under this method. This 
is in addition to the performance specifications given in paragraph 4 of 
this appendix. During a period of relatively steady state gas flow, 
perform the following orientation test using the measurement system. The 
system should be continuously measuring gas velocity at all times. 
Rotate the measurement 10 deg. on each side of the direction of flow in 
increments of 5 deg.. Perform this test three times each at:
    (1) Maximum operating velocity (<SUP>plus-minus</SUP>15 percent);
    (2) 67 percent <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>7.5 percent of the maximum 
operating velocity; and
    (3) 33 percent <SUP>plus-minus</SUP>7.5 percent of the maximum 
operating velocity if (2) and (3) are normal operating practices.
    6. Calculations data analysis and reporting.
    6.1  Procedure for determination of stack gas volumetric flow rate. 
Calculate the reference stack gas velocity and corresponding stack gas 
volumetric flow rate with the calibrated type S pitot tube measurements 
by the reference method. Calculate the measurement system stack gas 
volumetric flow rate as specified by the manufacturer's written 
instructions. Record the volumetric flow rates for each in the 
appropriate tables.
    6.2  Procedure for determination of mean values and 95 percent 
confidence intervals.
    6.2.1  Mean value. The mean value of a data set is calculated 
according to Equation E-1.

The values in this table are already corrected for n-1 degrees of

equal to the number of samples as data points.
    6.3  Data analysis and reporting.
    6.3.1  Accuracy (relative). First, calculate the mean reference 
value (Equation E-1) of the 14 average volumetric flow rates calculated 
by the reference method. Second, from the 14 pairs of average volumetric 
flow rates calculated by the reference method and measurement system 
volumetric flow rate readings, calculate the mean value (Equation E-1) 
of the differences of the 14 paired readings. Calculate the 95 percent 
confidence interval (Equation E-2) using the differences of fourteen 
paired readings. To calculate the values in the second part of this 
section substitute d<INF>i</INF> for x<INF>i</INF> and d for x in 
Equations E-1 and E-2 where d<INF>i</INF> equals the difference of each 
paired reading and d equals the mean value of the fourteen paired 
differences. Third, report the sum of the absolute mean value of the 
differences of the fourteen paired readings and the 95 percent 
confidence interval of the differences of value calculated in the first 
part of the section. Divide this total by the mean reference value and 
report the result as a percentage. This percentage is the relative 
accuracy.
    6.3.2  Zero drift (24 hour). From the zero values measured each 24 
hours during the field test, calculate the differences between 
successive readings expressed in volumetric flow rate units. Calculate 
the mean value of these differences and the confidence interval of these 
differences using Equations E-1 and E-2. Report the sum of the absolute 
value of the mean difference and the confidence interval as a percentage 
of the measurement system span. This percentage is the zero drift.
    6.3.3  Calibration drift (24 hour). From the calibration values 
measured every 24 hours during the field test calculate the differences 
between: (1) The calibration reading after zero and calibration 
adjustment, and (2) the calibration reading 24 hours later after zero 
adjustment but before calibration adjustment. Calculate the mean value 
of these differences and the confidence interval using Equations E-1 and 
E-2. Report the sum of the absolute value of the mean difference and 
confidence interval as a percentage of the measurement system span. This 
percentage is the calibration drift.
    6.3.4  Operation period. Other than that clearly specified as 
required in the operation and maintenance manual, the measurement system 
shall not require any corrective maintenance, repair, replacement or 
adjustment during the 168-hour performance and operational test period. 
If the measurement system operates within the specified performance 
parameters and does not require corrective maintenance, repair, 
replacement or adjustment other than as specified above during the 168-
hour test period, the operational period will be successfully concluded. 
Failure of the measurement to meet this requirement shall call for a 
repetition of the 168-hour test period. Portions of the test, except for
