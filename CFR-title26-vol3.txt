                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1
    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 1997), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

  Editorial Note: IRS published a document at 45 FR 6088, Jan. 25, 1980, 
deleting statutory sections from their regulations. In Chapter I, cross 
references to the deleted material have been changed to the 
corresponding sections of the IRS Code of 1954 or to the appropriate 
regulations sections. When either such change produced a redundancy, the 
cross reference has been deleted. For further explanation, see 45 FR 
20795, March 31, 1980.

[T.D. 7207, 37 FR 20767, Oct. 5, 1972]


<R05>
Sec. 1.170-1   Charitable, etc., contributions and gifts; allowance of deduction (before amendment by Tax Reform Act of 1969).

    (a) In general--(1) General rule. Any charitable contribution (as 
defined in section 170(c)) actually paid during the taxable year is 
allowable as a deduction in computing taxable income, regardless of the 
method of accounting employed or when pledged. In addition, 
contributions by corporations may under certain circumstances be 
deductible even though not paid during the taxable year (see Sec. 1.170-
3), and subject to the provisions of section 170(b)(5) and paragraph (g) 
of Sec. 1.170-2, certain excess charitable contributions made by 
individuals in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, shall be 
treated as paid in certain succeeding taxable years. The deduction is 
subject to the limitations of section 170(b) (see Secs. 1.170-2 and 
1.170-3) and is subject to verification by the district director. For 
rules relating to the determination of, and the deduction for, amounts 
paid to maintain certain students as members of the taxpayer's household 
and treated under section 170(d) as paid for the use of an organization 
described in section 170(c) (2), (3), or (4), see paragraph (f) of 
Sec. 1.170-2. For a special rule relating to the computation of the 
amount of the deduction with respect to a contribution of section 1245 
or section 1250 property, see section 170(e).
    (2) Information required in support of deductions for taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 1964. In connection with claims for 
deductions for charitable contributions paid in taxable years beginning 
before January 1, 1964, taxpayers shall state in their income tax 
returns the name and address of each organization to which a 
contribution was made and the amount and approximate date of the actual 
payment of each contribution. Any deduction for charitable contribution 
must be substantiated, when required by the district director, by a 
statement from the organization to which the contribution was made 
indicating whether the organization is a domestic organization, the name 
and address of the contributor, the amount of the contribution, and the 
date of its actual payment, and by such other information as the 
district director may deem necessary.
    (3) Information required in support of deductions for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1963--(i) In general. In connection with 
claims for deductions for charitable contributions paid in taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1963, taxpayers shall state in their income 
tax returns the name of each organization to which a contribution was 
made and the amount and date of the actual payment of each contribution. 
If a contribution is made in property other than money, the taxpayer 
shall state the kind of property contributed (for example, used 
clothing, paintings, securities) and shall

[[Page 10]]

state the method utilized in determining the fair market value of the 
property at the time the contribution was made. In any case in which a 
taxpayer makes numerous cash contributions to an organization during the 
taxable year, the taxpayer may state the total cash payments made to 
such organization during the taxable year in lieu of listing each cash 
contribution and the date of payment.
    (ii) Contribution by individual of property other than money. If an 
individual taxpayer makes a charitable contribution of an item of 
property other than money and claims a deduction in excess of $200 in 
respect of his contribution of such item, he shall attach to his income 
tax return a statement setting forth the following information with 
respect to such item:
    (a) The name and address of the organization to which the 
contribution was made.
    (b) The date of the actual contribution.
    (c) A description of the property in sufficient detail to identify 
the particular property contributed including, in the case of tangible 
property, the physical condition of the property at the time of 
contribution. In the case of securities, the name of the issuer, the 
type of security, and whether or not such security is regularly traded 
on a stock exchange or in an over-the-counter market.
    (d) The manner (for example, by purchase, gift, bequest, 
inheritance, exchange, etc.) and the approximate date of acquisition of 
the property by the taxpayer. If the property was created, produced, or 
manufactured by the taxpayer, the approximate date the property was 
substantially completed.
    (e) The fair market value of the property at the time the 
contribution was made, showing the method utilized in determining the 
fair market value. (If the valuation was determined by appraisal, a copy 
of the signed report of the appraiser should be submitted.)
    (f) In the case of property (not including securities) held by the 
taxpayer for a period less than five years immediately preceding the 
date on which the contribution was made, the cost or other basis, 
adjusted as provided by section 1016. If available, the cost or other 
basis, adjusted as provided by section 1016, of property (not including 
securities) held for a period of five years or more prior to the time of 
contribution should be submitted.
    (g) In the case of section 1245 or section 1250 property, the 
reduction by reason of section 170(e) in the amount of the charitable 
contribution taken into account under section 170.
    (h) The terms of any agreement or understanding entered into by or 
on behalf of the taxpayer relating to the use, sale, or disposition of 
the property contributed. For example, there must be attached to the 
income tax return of an individual taxpayer the terms of any agreement 
or understanding which restricts the donee's right to dispose of the 
donated property (either temporarily or permanently) or which reserves 
to, or confers upon, anyone other than the donee organization (or an 
organization participating with such organization in cooperative fund 
raising) any right to the income from such property, to the possession 
of the property (including the right to vote securities), to acquire 
such property by purchase or otherwise, or to designate who shall have 
such income, possession, or right to acquire. Notwithstanding the above, 
it will not be necessary to set forth the terms of any agreement or 
understanding which merely earmarks contributed property for a 
particular charitable use, such as the use of donated furniture in the 
reading room of the donee organization's library.
    (i) The total amount claimed as a deduction for the taxable year due 
to the contribution of the property. If less than the entire interest in 
the property is contributed during the taxable year, the amount claimed 
as a deduction in any prior year or years for contributions of other 
interests in such property, the name and address of each organization to 
which any such contribution was made, the place where the property (if 
tangible property) is located or kept and the name of the person having 
actual possession of the property, if other than the organization to 
which the property giving rise to the deduction was contributed.

[[Page 11]]

    (iii) Statement from donee organization. Any deduction for a 
charitable contribution must be substantiated, when required by the 
district director, by a statement from the organization to which the 
contribution was made indicating whether the organization is a domestic 
organization, the name and address of the contributor, the amount of the 
contribution, the date of actual receipt of the contribution, and such 
other information as the district director may deem necessary. If the 
contribution includes an item of property (other than money or 
securities which are regularly traded on a stock exchange or in an over-
the-counter market) which the donee deems to have a fair market value in 
excess of $200 at the time of receipt, such statement shall also 
indicate for each such item its location if retained by the 
organization, the amount received by the organization on any sale of the 
property and the date of sale, or in case of other disposition of the 
property, the method of disposition.
    (b) Time of making contribution. Ordinarly a contribution is made at 
the time delivery is effected. In the case of a check, the unconditional 
delivery (or mailing) of a check which subsequently clears in due course 
will constitute an effective contribution on the date of delivery (or 
mailing). If a taxpayer unconditionally delivers (or mails) a properly 
endorsed stock certificate to a charitable donee or the donee's agent, 
the gift is completed on the date of delivery (or mailing, provided that 
such certificate is received in the ordinary course of the mails). If 
the donor delivers the certificate to his bank or broker as the donor's 
agent, or to the issuing corporation or its agent, for transfer into the 
name of the donee, the gift is completed on the date the stock is 
transferred on the books of the corporation. For rules relating to a 
contribution consisting of a future interest in tangible personal 
property, see paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (c) Contribution in property--(1) General rules. If a contribution 
is made in property other than money, the amount of the deduction is 
determined by the fair market value of the property at the time of the 
contribution. The fair market value is the price at which the property 
would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither 
being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable 
knowledge of relevant facts. If the contribution is made in property of 
a type which the taxpayer sells in the course of his business, the fair 
market value is the price which the taxpayer would have received if he 
had sold the contributed property in the lowest usual market in which he 
customarily sells, at the time and place of the contribution (and in the 
case of a contribution of goods in quantity, in the quantity 
contributed). The usual market of a manufacturer or other producer 
consists of the wholesalers or other distributors to or through whom he 
customarily sells, unless he sells only at retail in which event it is 
his retail customers. If a donor makes a charitable contribution of, for 
example, stock in trade at a time when he could not reasonably have been 
expected to realize its usual selling price, the value of the gift is 
not the usual selling price but is the amount for which the quantity of 
merchandise contributed would have been sold by the donor at the time of 
the contribution. Costs and expenses incurred in the year of 
contribution in producing or acquiring the contributed property are not 
deductible and are not a part of the cost of goods sold. Similarly, to 
the extent that costs and expenses incurred in a prior taxable year in 
producing or acquiring the contributed property are reflected in the 
cost of goods sold in the year of contribution, cost of goods sold must 
be reduced by such costs and expenses. Transfers of property to an 
organization described in section 170(c) which bear a direct 
relationship to the taxpayer's business and which are made with a 
reasonable expectation of financial return commensurate with the amount 
of the transfer may constitute allowable deductions as trade or business 
expenses rather than as charitable contributions. See section 162 and 
the regulations thereunder.
    (2) Reduction for certain interest. (i) With respect to charitable 
contributions made after December 31, 1957, section 170(b)(4) requires 
that the amount of the charitable deduction be reduced

[[Page 12]]

for certain interest to the extent necessary to avoid the reduction of 
the same amount both as an interest deduction under section 163 and as a 
deduction for charitable contributions under section 170. The reduction 
is to be determined in accordance with subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of 
this subparagraph.
    (ii) With respect to charitable contributions made after December 
31, 1957, in determining the amount to be taken into account as a 
charitable contribution for purposes of section 170, the amount 
determined without regard to section 170(b)(4) or this subparagraph 
shall be reduced by the amount of interest which has been paid (or is to 
be paid) by the taxpayer, which is attributable to any liability 
connected with the contribution, and which is attributable to any period 
of time after the making of the contribution. The deduction otherwise 
allowable for charitable contributions under section 170 is required to 
be reduced pursuant to section 170(b)(4) only if, in connection with a 
charitable contribution, a liability is assumed by the recipient of the 
contribution or by any other person, or if the charitable contribution 
is of property which is subject to a liability. Thus, if the 
contribution is made in property and the transfer is conditioned upon 
the assumption of a liability by the donee or by some other person, any 
interest paid (or to be paid) by the taxpayer, attributable to the 
liability, and with respect to a period after the making of the 
contribution, will serve to reduce the amount that may be taken into 
account as a charitable contribution for purposes of section 170. The 
adjustment referred to in this subdivision must also be made where the 
contributed property is subject to a liability and the value of the 
property reflects the payment by the donor of interest with respect to a 
period of time after the making of the contribution.
    (iii) If, in connection with the charitable contribution, after 
December 31, 1957, of a bond, a liability is assumed by the recipient or 
by any other person, or if the bond is subject to a liability, then, in 
determining the amount to be taken into account as a charitable 
contribution under section 170, the amount determined without regard to 
section 170(b)(4) or this subparagraph shall, without regard to whether 
any reduction may be required by subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, 
also be reduced for interest which has been paid (or is to be paid) by 
the taxpayer on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry 
such bond, and which is attributable to any period before the making of 
the contribution. However, the reduction referred to in this subdivision 
shall be made only to the extent that such reduction does not exceed the 
interest (including bond discount and other interest equivalent) 
receivable on the bond, and attributable to any period before the making 
of the contribution which is not, by reason of the taxpayer's method of 
accounting, includible in the taxpayer's gross income for any taxable 
year. For purposes of section 170(b)(4) and this subdivision the term 
bond means any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence 
of indebtedness.
    (iv) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. A, an individual using the cash receipts and 
disbursements method of accounting, on January 1, 1960, contributed to a 
charitable organization real estate having a fair market value of 
$10,000. In connection with the contribution the charitable organization 
assumed an indebtedness of $8,000 which A had incurred. A has prepaid 
two years' interest on that indebtedness (for 1960 and 1961) amounting 
to $960, and has taken an interest deduction of $960 for such amount. 
The amount of the gift, determined without regard to this subparagraph, 
is $2,960 ($10,000 less $8,000, the outstanding indebtedness, plus $960, 
the amount of prepaid interest). In determining the amount of the 
deduction for charitable contributions, the value of the gift ($2,960) 
must be reduced by $960 to eliminate from the computation of such 
deduction that portion thereof for which A has been allowed an interest 
deduction.
    Example 2. On January 1, 1960, B, an individual using the cash 
receipts and disbursements method of accounting, purchased for $9,600 a 
5 1/2 percent $10,000, 20-year M Corporation bond, the interest on which 
was payable semiannually on June 30 and December 31. The M Corporation 
had issued the bond on January 1, 1950, at a discount of $720 from the 
principal amount. On December 1,

[[Page 13]]

1960, B donated the bond to a charitable organization, and, in 
connection with the contribution, the charitable organization assumed an 
indebtedness of $7,000 which B had incurred to purchase and carry the 
bond. During the calendar year 1960 B paid accrued interest of $330 on 
the indebtedness for the period from January 1 to December 1, 1960, and 
has taken an interest deduction of $330 for such amount. No portion of 
the bond discount of $36 a year ($720 divided by 20 years) has been 
included in B's income, and of the $550 of annual interest receivable on 
the bond, he included in income only the June 30 payment of $275. The 
market value of the bond on the date of the contribution was $9,902. 
Such value reflects a proportionate part of the original bond discount 
($9,280 plus $393, or $9,673) and of interest receivable of $229 which 
had accrued from July 1 to December 1, 1960. The amount of the 
charitable contribution determined without regard to this subparagraph 
is $2,902 ($9,902, the value of the property on the date of gift, less 
$7,000, the amount of the liability assumed by the charitable 
organization). In determining the amount of the allowable deduction for 
charitable contributions, the value of the gift ($2,902) must be reduced 
to eliminate from the deduction that portion thereof for which B has 
been allowed an interest deduction. Although the amount of such interest 
deduction was $330, the reduction required by this subparagraph is 
limited to $262, since the reduction is not in excess of the amount of 
interest income on the bond ($229 of accrued interest plus $33, the 
amount of bond discount attributable to the eleven-month period B held 
the bond).

    (3) Reduction for depreciable property. (i) With respect to a 
charitable contribution of section 1245 property (as defined in section 
1245(a)(3)), or section 1250 property (as defined in section 1250(c)), 
section 170(e) requires that the amount of the charitable contribution 
taken into account under section 170 shall be reduced by the amount 
which would have been treated (but was not actually treated) as gain to 
which section 1245(a)(1) or 1250(a) (relating to gain from dispositions 
of depreciable property) applies if the property contributed had been 
sold at its fair market value (determined at the time of such 
contribution).
    (ii) Section 170(e) applies to charitable contributions of section 
1245 property in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, except 
that in respect of section 1245 property which is an elevator or 
escalator section 170(e) applies to charitable contributions after 
December 31, 1963. Section 170(e) applies to charitable contributions of 
section 1250 property after December 31, 1963.
    (iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. Jones contributes to a charitable organization section 1245 
property which has an adjusted basis of $10,000, a recomputed basis (as 
defined in section 1245 (a)(2)) of $14,000, and a fair market value of 
$17,000. If Jones had instead sold the property at its fair market 
value, he would have recognized gain under section 1245(a)(1) of $4,000. 
See paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1245-1. Under section 170(e), the amount of 
the charitable contribution taken into account under section 170 is 
reduced by $4,000. Accordingly, the amount of the charitable 
contribution is $13,000 ($17,000 minus $4,000).

    (d) Transfers of income and future interests--(1) In general. A 
deduction may be allowed for a contribution of an interest in the income 
from property or an interest in the remainder (but see subparagraph (2) 
of this paragraph for rules relating to transfers, after December 31, 
1963, of future interests in tangible personal property). The income or 
remainder interest shall be valued according to the tables referred to 
in paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.170-2. For rules with respect to certain 
transfers to a trust, see paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.170-2.
    (2) Future interests in tangible personal property. (i) Except as 
otherwise provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph, a 
contribution consisting of a transfer, after December 31, 1963, in a 
taxable year ending after such date, of a future interest in tangible 
personal property shall be treated as made only when:
    (a) All intervening interests in, and rights to the actual 
possession or enjoyment of, the property have expired, or
    (b) Are held by persons other than the taxpayer or those standing in 
a relationship to the taxpayer described in section 267(b) and the 
regulations thereunder (relating to losses, expenses, and interest with 
respect to transactions between related taxpayers).

Section 170(f) and this subparagraph have no application in respect of a

[[Page 14]]

transfer of an undivided present interest in property. For example, a 
contribution of an undivided one-quarter interest in a painting with 
respect to which the donee is entitled to possession during three months 
of each year shall be treated as made upon the receipt by the donee of a 
formally executed and acknowledged deed of gift. Section 170(f) and this 
subparagraph have no application in respect of a transfer of a future 
interest in intangible personal property or in real property. However, a 
fixture which is intended to be severed from real property shall be 
treated as tangible personal property. For example, a contribution of a 
future interest in a chandelier which is attached to a building is 
considered a contribution which consists of a future interest in 
tangible personal property if the transferor intends that it be detached 
from the building at or prior to the time when the charitable 
organization's right to possession or enjoyment of the chandelier is to 
commence. For purposes of section 170(f) and this subparagraph, the term 
future interest has generally the same meaning as it has when used in 
section 2503, relating to taxable gifts, see Sec. 25.2503-3 of Part 25 
of this chapter (Gift Tax Regulations), and such term includes 
reversions, remainders, and other interests or estates, whether vested 
or contingent, and whether or not supported by a particular interest or 
estate, which are limited to commence in use, possession or enjoyment at 
some future date or time. The term future interest includes situations 
in which a donor purports to give tangible personal property to a 
charitable organization, but has an understanding, arrangement, 
agreement, etc. (whether written or oral) with the charitable 
organization which has the effect of reserving to, or retaining in, such 
donor a right to the use, possession, or enjoyment of the property.
    (ii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. On December 31, 1964, A, an individual who reports his 
income on the calendar year basis, conveys by deed of gift to a museum 
title to a painting, but reserves to himself the right to the use, 
possession, and enjoyment of the painting during his lifetime. At the 
time of the gift the value of the painting is $90,000. Since the 
contribution consists of a future interest in tangible personal property 
in which the donor has retained an intervening interest, no contribution 
is considered as having been made in 1964.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that on 
December 31, 1965, A relinquishes all of his right to the use, 
possession, and enjoyment of the painting and delivers the painting to 
the museum. Assuming that the value of the painting has increased to 
$95,000, A is treated as having made a charitable contribution of 
$95,000 in 1965.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as Example (1) except A dies 
without relinquishing his right to the use, possession, and enjoyment of 
the painting. Since A did not relinquish his right to the use, 
possession, and enjoyment of the property during his life, A is treated 
as not having made a charitable contribution of the painting for income 
tax purposes.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except A, on 
December 31, 1965, transfers his interest in the painting to his son, B. 
Since the relationship between A and B is one described in section 
267(b), no contribution of the remainder interest in the painting is 
considered as having been made in 1965.
    Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example (4). Also assume that 
on December 31, 1966, B conveys the interest measured by A's life to the 
museum. B has made a charitable contribution of the present interest in 
the painting conveyed to the museum (i.e., the life interest measured by 
A's life expectancy in 1966 valued according to paragraph (f), Table 1, 
of Sec. 20.2031-7 of Part 20 of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations)). 
In addition, since all intervening interests in, and rights to the 
actual possession or enjoyment of the property, have expired, a 
charitable contribution of the remainder interest is treated as having 
been made by A in 1966. Such remainder interest shall also be valued 
according to paragraph (f), Table 1, of Sec. 20.2031-7 of Part 20 of 
this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations)).

    (iii) Section 209(f)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1964 (78 Stat. 47) 
provides an exception to the rule set forth in section 170(f). Pursuant 
to the exception, section 170(f) and subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph shall not apply in the case of a transfer of a future 
interest in tangible personal property made after December 31, 1963, and 
before July 1, 1964, where:
    (a) The sole intervening interest or right is a nontransferable life 
interest reserved by the donor, or

[[Page 15]]

    (b) In the case of a joint gift by husband and wife, the sole 
intervening interest or right is a nontransferable life interest 
reserved by the donors which expires not later than the death of 
whichever of such donors dies later.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the right to make a transfer of 
the reserved life interest to the donee of the future interest shall not 
be treated as making a life interest transferable.
    (e) Transfers subject to a condition or a power. If as of the date 
of a gift a transfer for charitable purposes is dependent upon the 
performance of some act or the happening of a precedent event in order 
that it might become effective, no deduction is allowable unless the 
possibility that the charitable transfer will not become effective is so 
remote as to be negligible. If an interest passes to or is vested in 
charity on the date of the gift and the interest would be defeated by 
the performance of some act or the happening of some event, the 
occurrence of which appeared to have been highly improbable on the date 
of the gift, the deduction is allowable. The deduction is not allowed in 
the case of a transfer in trust conveying a present interest in income 
if by reason of all the conditions and circumstances surrounding the 
transfer it appears that the charity may not receive the beneficial 
enjoyment of the interest. For example, assume that assets placed in 
trust consist of stock in a corporation the fiscal policies of which are 
controlled by the donor and his family, that the trustees and 
remaindermen are likewise members of the donor's family, and that the 
governing instrument contains no adequate guarantee of the requisite 
income to the charitable organization. Under such circumstances, no 
deduction will be allowed. Similarly, if the trustees were not members 
of the donor's family but had no power to sell or otherwise dispose of 
closely held stock, or otherwise insure the requisite enjoyment of 
income to the charitable organization, no deduction would be allowed.
    (f) Exceptions. (1) This section does not apply to contributions by 
estates and trusts (see section 642(c)). For disallowance of certain 
charitable deductions otherwise allowable under section 170, see 
sections 503(e) and 681(b)(5) (relating to organizations engaged in 
prohibited transactions). For disallowance of deductions for 
contributions to or for the use of communist controlled organizations, 
see section 11(a) of the Internal Security Act of 1950, as amended (50 
U.S.C. 790). For denial of deduction for charitable contributions as 
trade or business expenses and rules with respect to treatment of 
payments to organizations other than those described in section 170(c), 
see section 162 and the regulations thereunder.
    (2) No deduction shall be allowed under section 170 for amounts paid 
to an organization:
    (i) A substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on 
propaganda, or otherwise attempting, to influence legislation, or
    (ii) Which participates in or intervenes in any political campaign 
on behalf of any candidate for public office.

For purposes of determining whether an organization is attempting to 
influence legislation or is engaging in political activities, see 
section 501(c)(3) and the regulations thereunder. Moreover, no deduction 
shall be allowed under section 170 for expenditures for lobbying 
purposes, promotion or defeat of legislation, etc. See also the 
regulations under section 162.
    (3) No deduction for charitable contributions is allowed in 
computing the taxable income of a common trust fund or of a partnership. 
See sections 584(d) and 703(a)(2)(D). However, a partner's distributive 
share of charitable contributions actually paid by a partnership during 
its taxable year may be allowed as a deduction in the partner's separate 
return for his taxable year with or within which the taxable year of the 
partnership ends, to the extent that the aggregate of his share of the 
partnership contributions and his own contributions does not exceed the 
limitations in section 170 (b). In the case of a nonresident alien 
individual, or a citizen of the United States entitled to the benefits 
of section 931, see sections 873(c), 876, and 931.

<R05>
Sec. 1.170-2   Charitable deductions by individuals; limitations (before amendment by Tax Reform Act of 1969).

    (a) In general. (1) A deduction is allowable to an individual under 
section 170 only for charitable contributions actually paid during the 
taxable year, regardless of when pledged and regardless of the method of 
accounting employed by the taxpayer in keeping his books and records. A 
contribution to an organization described in section 170(c) is 
deductible even though some portion of the funds of the organization may 
be used in foreign countries for charitable or educational purposes. The 
deduction by an individual for charitable contributions under section 
170 is limited generally to 20 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross 
income (computed without regard to any net operating loss carryback to 
the taxable year under section 172). If a husband and wife make a joint 
return, the deduction for contributions is the aggregate of the 
contributions made by the spouses, and the limitation in section 170(b) 
is based on the aggregate adjusted gross income of the spouses. The 20-
percent limitation applies to amounts contributed during the taxable 
year ``to or for the use of'' those recipients described in section 
170(c), including amounts treated under section 170(d) as paid for the 
use of an organization described in section 170(c) (2), (3), or (4). See 
paragraph (f) of this section. The limitation is computed without regard 
to contributions qualifying for the additional 10-percent deduction. For 
examples of the application of the 10- and 20-percent limitation, see 
paragraph (b)(5) of this section. For special rules reducing amount of 
certain charitable deductions, see paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.170-1.
    (2) No deduction is allowable for contribution of services. However, 
unreimbursed expenditures made incident to the rendition of services to 
an organization contributions to which are deductible may constitute a 
deductible contribution. For example, the cost of a uniform without 
general utility which is required to be worn in performing donated 
services is deductible. Similarly, out-of-pocket transportation expenses 
necessarily incurred in rendering donated services are deductible. 
Reasonable expenditures for meals and lodging necessarily incurred while 
away from home in the course of rendering donated services also are 
deductible. For the purposes of this section, the phrase while away from 
home has the same meaning as that phrase is used for purposes of section 
162.
    (3)(i) In the case of an annuity or portion thereof purchased from 
an organization described in section 170(c), there shall be allowed as a 
deduction the excess of the amount paid over the value at the time of 
purchase of the annuity or portion purchased.
    (ii) The value of the annuity or portion is the value of the annuity 
determined in accordance with section 101(b) and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (b) Additional 10-percent deduction--(1) In general. In addition to 
the deduction which may be allowed for contributions subject to the 
general 20-percent limitation, an individual may deduct charitable 
contributions made during the taxable year to the organizations 
specified in section 170(b)(1)(A) to the extent that such contributions 
in the aggregate do not exceed 10 percent of his adjusted gross income 
(computed without regard to any net operating loss carryback to the 
taxable year under section 172). The additional 10-percent deduction may 
be allowed with respect to contributions to:
    (i) A church or a convention or association of churches,
    (ii) An educational organization referred to in section 503(b)(2) 
and defined in subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph,
    (iii) A hospital referred to in section 503(b)(5) and defined in 
subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph,
    (iv) Subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in 
subparagraph (4)(ii) of this paragraph, and for taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1955, a medical research organization referred to in 
section 503(b)(5),
    (v) Subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in 
subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph, and for taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1960, an organization referred to in section 
503(b)(3) which is organized and operated for the benefit of certain 
State

[[Page 17]]

and municipal colleges and universities,
    (vi) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, a 
governmental unit referred to in section 170(c)(1), and
    (vii) Subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in 
subparagraph (5) of this paragraph, and for taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1963, an organization referred to in section 
170(c)(2).

To qualify for the additional 10-percent deduction the contributions 
must be made ``to'', and not merely ``for the use of'', one of the 
specified organizations. A contribution to an organization referred to 
in section 170(c)(2) (other than an organization specified in 
subdivisions (i) through (vi) of this subparagraph) which, for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1963, is not ``publicly supported'' 
under the rules of subparagraph (5) of this paragraph will not qualify 
for the additional 10-percent deduction even though such organization 
makes the contribution available to an organization which is specified 
in section 170(b)(1)(A). The computation of this additional deduction is 
not necessary unless the total contributions paid during the taxable 
year are in excess of the general 20-percent limitation. Where the total 
contributions exceed the 20-percent limitation, the taxpayer should 
first ascertain the amount of charitable contributions subject to the 
10-percent limitation, and any excess over the 10-percent limitation 
should then be added to all other contributions and limited by the 20-
percent limitation. For provisions relating to a carryover of certain 
charitable contributions made by individuals, see paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (2) Church. For definition of church, see the regulations under 
section 511.
    (3) Educational organization and organizations for the benefit of 
certain State and municipal colleges and universities--(i) Educational 
organization. An educational organization within the meaning of section 
170(b)(1)(A) is one whose primary function is the presentation of formal 
instruction and which normally maintains a regular faculty and 
curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled body of pupils or 
students in attendance at the place where its educational activities are 
regularly carried on. The term, therefore, includes institutions such as 
primary, secondary, preparatory, or high schools, and colleges and 
universities. It includes Federal, State, and other public-supported 
schools which otherwise come within the definition. It does not include 
organizations engaged in both educational and noneducational activities 
unless the latter are merely incidental to and growing out of the 
educational activities. A recognized university which incidentally 
operates a museum or sponsors concerts is an educational organization. 
However, the operation of a school by a museum does not necessarily 
qualify the museum as an educational organization. A gift to an 
educational institution through an alumni association or a class 
organization, which acts simply as a fund-raising or collection agency 
through which gifts may be made currently to the institution, is a gift 
to the educational organization if the entire gift inures to its 
benefit, but not if any part of it inures to the general or operating 
fund of the agency. Similarly, a gift to one or more educational 
institutions through an association of educational institutions will be 
considered a gift to the institutions if it inures entirely to their 
benefit.
    (ii) Organizations for the benefit of certain State and municipal 
colleges and universities. (a) For taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1960, gifts made to an organization referred to in section 
503(b)(3) organized and operated exclusively to receive, hold, invest, 
and administer property and to make expenditures to or for the benefit 
of certain colleges and universities, may be taken into account in 
computing the additional 10-percent limitation. The phrase expenditures 
to or for the benefit of certain colleges and universities includes 
expenditures made for any one or more of the normally accepted functions 
of colleges and universities, for example, for the acquisition and 
maintenance of real property comprising part of the campus area, the 
erection of or participation in the erection of college or university 
buildings, scholarships, libraries, student loans, and the acquisition 
and maintenance of equipment and furnishings used for or in

[[Page 18]]

conjunction with normally accepted functions of colleges and 
universities.
    (b) The recipient organization must be one which normally receives a 
substantial portion of its support from the United States or any State 
or political subdivision thereof or from direct or indirect 
contributions from the general public, or from a combination of two or 
more of such sources. An example of an indirect contribution from the 
public would be the receipt by the organization of its share of the 
proceeds of an annual collection campaign of a community chest, 
community fund, or united fund.
    (c) The college or university (including land grant colleges and 
universities) to be benefited must be an educational organization 
referred to in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) and subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph; and must be an agency or instrumentality of a State or 
political subdivision thereof, or must be owned or operated by a State 
or political subdivision thereof or by an agency or instrumentality of 
one or more States or political subdivisions.
    (4) Hospital and medical research organization--(i) Hospital. The 
term hospital, as used in section 170(b)(1)(A), means an organization 
the principal purposes or functions of which are the providing of 
hospital or medical care. The term includes Federal and State hospitals 
otherwise coming within the definition but does not include medical 
education organizations, or medical research organizations. See, 
however, subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, relating to 
contributions to certain medical research organizations for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1955. A rehabilitation institution or 
an outpatient clinic may qualify as a hospital if its principal purposes 
or functions are the providing of hospital or medical care. The term 
hospital does not include convalescent homes or homes for children or 
the aged, nor does the term include institutions whose principal 
purposes or functions are to train handicapped individuals to pursue 
some vocation.
    (ii) Certain medical research organizations. (a) For taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1955, certain charitable contributions made 
to certain medical research organizations may be taken into account in 
computing the additional 10-percent limitation. To be so taken into 
account the charitable contribution must be made to a medical research 
organization that is directly engaged in the continuous active conduct 
of medical research in conjunction with a hospital (as defined in 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph), and, during the calendar year in 
which the contribution is made, the organization must be committed to 
spend the contribution for such active conduct of medical research 
before January 1 of the fifth calendar year beginning after the date the 
contribution is made.
    (b) As used in section 170(b)(1)(A) and this subparagraph, the term 
medical research organization means an organization the principal 
purpose or function of which is to engage in medical research. Medical 
research may be defined as the conduct of investigations, experiments, 
and studies to discover, develop, or verify knowledge relating to the 
causes, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, or control of physical or 
mental diseases and impairments of man. To qualify as a medical research 
organization, the organization must have the appropriate equipment and 
professional personnel necessary to carry out its principal function.
    (c) The organization must, at the time of the contribution, be 
directly engaged in the continuous active conduct of medical research in 
conjunction with a hospital described in subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph. The organization need not be formally affiliated with a 
hospital to be considered engaged in the active conduct of medical 
research in conjunction with a hospital, but it must be physically 
connected, or closely associated, with a hospital. In any case, there 
must be a joint effort on the part of the research organization and the 
hospital pursuant to an understanding that the two organizations shall 
maintain continuing close cooperation in the active conduct of medical 
research. For example, the necessary joint effort will normally be found 
to exist if the activities of the medical research organization are 
carried on in space located within or adjacent to a hospital provided 
that the organization is permitted to utilize the

[[Page 19]]

facilities (including equipment, case studies, etc.) of the hospital on 
a continuing basis in the active conduct of medical research. A medical 
research organization which is closely associated, in the manner 
described above, with a particular hospital or particular hospitals, may 
be considered to be pursuing research in conjunction with a hospital if 
the necessary joint effort is supported by substantial evidence of the 
close cooperation of the members of the research organization and the 
staff of the particular hospital or hospitals. The active participation 
in medical research by the staff of the particular hospital or hospitals 
will be considered as evidence of the requisite joint effort. If the 
organization's primary purpose is to disburse funds to other 
organizations for the conduct of research by them, or, if the 
organization's primary purpose is to extend research grants or 
scholarships to others, it is not directly engaged in the active conduct 
of medical research, and contributions to such an organization may not 
be taken into account for purposes of the additional 10-percent 
limitation.
    (d) A charitable contribution to a medical research organization may 
be taken into account in computing the additional 10-percent limitation 
only if the organization is committed to spend such contribution for 
medical research in conjunction with a hospital on or before the first 
day of the fifth calendar year which begins after the date the 
contribution is made. The organization's commitment that the 
contribution will be spent within the prescribed time only for the 
prescribed purposes must be legally enforceable. A promise in writing to 
the donor in consideration of his making a contribution that such 
contribution will be so spent within the prescribed time will constitute 
a commitment. The expenditure of contributions received for plant, 
facilities, or equipment, used solely for medical research purposes 
shall ordinarily be considered to be an expenditure for medical research 
for purposes of section 170(b) and this section. If a contribution is 
made in other than money, it shall be considered spent for medical 
research if the funds from the proceeds of a disposition thereof are 
spent by the organization within the five-year period for medical 
research; or, if such property is of such a kind that it is used on a 
continuing basis directly in connection with such research, it shall be 
considered spent for medical research in the year in which it is first 
so used.
    (5) Corporation, trust, or community chest, fund, or foundation--(i) 
In general. (a) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, 
gifts made to a corporation, trust, or community chest, fund, or 
foundation, referred to in section 170(c)(2) (other than an organization 
specified in subparagraph (1) (i) through (vi) of this paragraph), may 
be taken into account in computing the additional 10-percent limitation, 
provided the organization is a ``publicly supported'' organization. For 
purposes of this subparagraph, an organization is ``publicly supported'' 
if it normally receives a substantial part of its support from a 
governmental unit referred to in section 170(c)(1) or from direct or 
indirect contributions from the general public.
    (b) An important factor in determining whether an organization 
normally receives a substantial part of its support from ``direct or 
indirect contributions from the general public'' is the extent to which 
the organization derives its support from or through voluntary 
contributions made by persons representing the general public. Except in 
unusual situations (particularly in the case of newly created 
organizations), an organization is not ``publicly supported'' if it 
receives contributions only from the members of a single family or from 
a few individuals.
    (ii) Special rules and meaning of terms. (a) For purposes of this 
subparagraph, the term support, except as otherwise provided in (b) of 
this subdivision (ii), means all forms of support including (but not 
limited to) contributions received by the organization, investment 
income (such as, interest, rents, royalties, and dividends), and net 
income from unrelated business activities whether or not such activities 
are carried on regularly as a trade or business.
    (b) The term support does not include:
    (1) Any amounts received from the exercise or performance by an 
organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose or 
function constituting

[[Page 20]]

the basis for its exemption under section 501(a). In general, such 
amounts include amounts received from any activity the conduct of which 
is substantially related to the furtherance of such purpose or function 
(other than through the production of income).
    (2) Any gain upon the sale or exchange of property which would be 
considered under any section of the Code as gain from the sale or 
exchange of a capital asset.
    (3) Contributions of services for which a deduction is not 
allowable.
    (c) The term support from a governmental unit includes:
    (1) Any amounts received from a governmental unit including 
donations or contributions and amounts received in connection with a 
contract entered into with a governmental unit for the performance of 
services or in connection with a government research grant, provided 
such amounts are not excluded from the term support under (b) of this 
subdivision (ii). For purposes of (b)(1) of this subdivision (ii), an 
amount paid by a governmental unit to an organization is not received 
from the exercise or performance of its charitable, educational, or 
other purpose or function constituting the basis for its exemption under 
section 501(a) if the purpose of the payment is to enable the 
organization to provide a service to, or maintain a facility for, the 
direct benefit of the public, as, for example, the maintenance of 
library facilities which are open to the public.
    (2) Tax revenues levied for the benefit of the organization and 
either paid to or expended on behalf of the organization.
    (3) The value of services or facilities (exclusive of services or 
facilities generally furnished, without charge, to the public) furnished 
by a governmental unit to the organization without charge, as, for 
example, where a city pays the salaries of personnel used to guard a 
museum, art gallery, etc., or provides, rent free, the use of a 
building. However, the term does not include the value of any exemption 
from Federal, State, or local tax or any similar benefit.
    (d) The term indirect contributions from the general public includes 
contributions received by the organization from organizations which 
normally receive a substantial part of their support from direct 
contributions from the general public.
    (iii) Determination of whether organization is ``publicly 
supported''--(a) In general. No single test which would be appropriate 
in every case may be prescribed for determining whether a corporation, 
trust, or community chest, fund, or foundation, referred to in section 
170(c)(2), is ``publicly supported''. For example, since the statutory 
test is whether the organization normally receives a substantial part of 
its support from the prescribed sources, a test which would be 
appropriate in the case of an organization which has been in operation 
for a number of years would not necessarily be appropriate in the case 
of a newly established organization. The determination of whether an 
organization is ``publicly supported'' depends on the facts and 
circumstances in each case. Thus, although a ``mechanical test'' is set 
forth in (b) of this subdivision (iii), such test is not an exclusive 
test. Accordingly, an organization which does not qualify as a 
``publicly supported'' organization by application of the ``mechanical 
test'' may qualify as a ``publicly supported'' organization on the basis 
of the facts and circumstances in its case. For provisions relating to 
the facts and circumstances test, see (c) of this subdivision (iii).
    (b) Mechanical test. An organization will be considered to be a 
``publicly supported'' organization for its current taxable year and the 
taxable year immediately succeeding its current year, if, for the four 
taxable years immediately preceding the current taxable year, the total 
amount of the support which the organization receives from governmental 
units, from donations made directly or indirectly by the general public, 
or from a combination of these sources equals 33\1/3\ percent or more of 
the total support of the organization for such four taxable years. The 
rule in the preceding sentence does not apply if there are substantial 
changes in the organization's character, purposes, or methods of 
operation in the current year, and does not apply in respect of the 
immediately succeeding taxable year if such changes occur in

[[Page 21]]

such year. In determining whether the 33\1/3\-percent-of-support test is 
met, contributions by an individual, trust, or corporation shall be 
taken into account only to the extent that the total amount of the 
contributions by any such individual, trust, or corporation during the 
four-taxable-year period does not exceed 1 percent of the organization's 
total support for such four taxable years. In applying the 1-percent 
limitation, all contributions made by a donor and by any person or 
persons standing in a relationship to the donor which is described in 
section 267(b) and the regulations thereunder shall be treated as made 
by one person. The 1-percent limitation shall not apply to support from 
governmental units referred to in section 170(c)(1) or to contributions 
from ``publicly supported'' organizations. A national organization which 
carries out its purposes through local chapters with which it has an 
identity of aims and purposes may, for purposes of determining whether 
the organization and the local chapters meet the mechanical test, make 
the computation on an aggregate basis.

    Example. For the years 1964 through 1967, X, an organization 
referred to in section 170(c)(2), received support (as defined in 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) of $600,000 from the following 
sources:

Investment income...........................................    $300,000
City Y (a governmental unit referred to in section                      
 170(c)(1)).................................................      40,000
United Fund (an organization referred to in section                     
 170(c)(2) which is ``publicly supported'').................      40,000
Contributions...............................................     220,000
                                                             -----------
        Total support.......................................     600,000
                                                                        

For the years 1964 through 1967, X received in excess of 33\1/3\ percent 
of its support from a governmental unit referred to in section 170(c)(1) 
and from direct and indirect contributions from the general public 
computed as follows:

33\1/3\ percent of total support............................    $200,000
                                                             ===========
Support from a governmental unit referred to in section                 
 170(c)(1)..................................................      40,000
Indirect contributions from the general public (United Fund)      40,000
Contributions by various donors (no one donor having made               
 contributions which total in excess of $6,000--1 percent of            
 total support).............................................      50,000
12 contributions (each in excess of $6,000--1 percent of                
 total support) 12 x $6,000.................................      72,000
                                                             -----------
                                                                 202,000
                                                             ===========
                                                                        

Since the amount of X's support from governmental units referred to in 
section 170 (c)(1) and from direct and indirect contributions from the 
general public in the years 1964 through 1967 is in excess of 33\1/3\ 
percent of X's total support for such four taxable years, X is 
considered a ``publicly supported'' organization with respect to 
contributions made to it during 1968 and 1969 without regard to whether 
X receives 33\1/3\ percent of its support during 1968 or 1969 from such 
sources (assuming that there are no substantial changes in X's 
character, purposes, or methods of operation).

    (c) Facts and circumstances test. (1) A corporation, trust, or 
community chest, fund or foundation referred to in section 170(c)(2) 
which does not qualify as a ``publicly supported'' organization under 
the mechanical test described in (b) of this subdivision (iii) 
(including an organization which has not been in existence for a 
sufficient length of time to make such test applicable) may be a 
``publicly supported'' organization on the basis of the facts and 
circumstances in its case.
    (2) The facts and circumstances which are relevant and the weight to 
be accorded such facts and circumstances may differ in certain cases 
depending, for example, on the nature of the organization and the period 
of time it has been in existence. However, under no circumstances will 
an organization which normally receives substantially all of its 
contributions (directly or indirectly) from the members of a single 
family or from a few individuals qualify as a ``publicly supported'' 
organization.
    (3) For purposes of the facts and circumstances test the most 
important consideration is the organization's source of support. An 
organization will be considered a ``publicly supported'' organization if 
it is constituted so as to attract substantial support from 
contributions, directly or indirectly, from a representative number of 
persons in the community or area in which it operates. In determining 
what is a ``representative number of persons,'' consideration must be 
given to the type of organization and whether or not the organization 
limits its activities to a special field which can be expected to appeal 
to a limited number of persons. An organization is so constituted if, 
for example, it establishes

[[Page 22]]

that it does in fact receive substantial support from contributions from 
a representative number of persons; that pursuant to its organizational 
structure and method of operation it makes bona fide solicitations for 
broad based public support, or, in the case of a newly created 
organization, that its organizational structure and method of operation 
are such as to require bona fide solicitations for broad based public 
support; that it receives substantial support from a community chest or 
similar public federated fund raising organization, such as a United 
Fund or United Appeal; or that it has a substantial number of members 
(in relation to the community it serves, the nature of its activities, 
and its total support) who pay annual membership dues.
    (4) Although primary consideration will be given to the source of an 
organization's support, other relevant factors may be taken into account 
in determining whether or not the organization is of a public nature, 
such as:
    (i) Whether the organization has a governing body (whether 
designated in the organization's bylaws, certificate of incorporation, 
deed of trust, etc., as a Board of Directors, Board of Trustees, etc.) 
which is comprised of public officials, of individuals chosen by public 
officials acting in their capacity as such, or of citizens broadly 
representative of the interests and views of the public. This 
characteristic does not exist if the membership of an organization's 
governing body is such as to indicate that it represents the personal or 
private interests of a limited number of donors to the organization (or 
persons standing in a relationship to such donors which is described in 
section 267(b) and the regulations thereunder), rather than the 
interests of the community or the general public.
    (ii) Whether the organization annually or more frequently makes 
available to the public financial reports or, in the case of a newly 
created organization, is constituted so as to require such reporting. 
For this purpose an information or other return made pursuant to a 
requirement of a governmental unit shall not be considered a financial 
report. An organization shall be considered as making financial reports 
of its operations available to the public if it publishes a financial 
report in a newspaper which is widely circulated in the community in 
which the organization operates or if it makes a bona fide dissemination 
of a brochure containing a financial report.
    (iii) If the organization is of a type which generally holds open to 
the public its buildings (as in the case of a museum) or performances 
conducted by it (as in the case of a symphonic orchestra), whether the 
organization actually follows such practice, or, in the case of a newly 
created organization, is so organized as to require that its facilities 
be open to the public.
    (5) The application of this subdivision (c) may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. M, a community trust, is an organization referred to in 
section 170(c)(2). In 1950, M was organized in the X Community by 
several leading trusts and financial institutions with the purpose of 
serving permanently the educational and charitable needs of the X 
Community by providing a means by which the public may establish funds 
or make gifts of various amounts to established funds which are 
administered as an aggregate fund with provision for distribution of 
income and, in certain cases, principal for educational or charitable 
purposes by a single impartial committee. The M Organization, by 
distribution of pamphlets to the public through participating trustee 
banks, actively solicits members of the X Community and other concerned 
parties to establish funds within the trust or to contribute to 
established funds within the trust. Under the declaration of trust, a 
contributor to a fund may suggest or request (but not require) that his 
contribution be used in respect of his preferred charitable, 
educational, or other benevolent purpose, and distributions of the 
income from the fund, and in certain cases the principal, will be made 
by the Distribution Committee with regard to such request unless 
changing conditions make such purpose unnecessary, undesirable, 
impractical, or impossible in which case income and (where the 
contributor has so specified) principal will be distributed by the 
Distribution Committee in order to promote the public welfare more 
effectively. Where a contributor has not expressed a desire as to a 
charitable, educational, or other benevolent purpose, the Distribution 
Committee will distribute the entire annual income from the fund to such 
a purpose agreed upon by such committee. The Distribution Committee is 
composed of representatives of the community chosen one each by the X 
Bar Association, the X Medical Society, the mayor of X Community, the 
judge of the highest X

[[Page 23]]

Court, and the president of the X College, and two representatives 
chosen by the participating trustee banks. There are a number of 
separate funds within the trust administered by several participating 
banks. M has consistently distributed or used its entire annual income 
for projects with purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) from which 
members of the public may benefit or to other organizations described in 
section 170(b)(1)(A) which so distribute or use such income. Through its 
participating trustee banks, M annually makes available to the public a 
brochure containing a financial statement of its operations including a 
list of all receipts and disbursements. Under the facts and 
circumstances, M is a ``publicly supported'' organization.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that M has 
been in existence for only one year and only two contributors have 
established funds within the trust. The Distribution Committee has been 
chosen and is required by the governing declaration of trust to make 
annual distribution of the entire income of the trust to projects with 
purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B) from which members of the 
public may benefit or to other organizations described in section 
170(b)(1)(A) which so distribute or use such income. The declaration of 
trust and other governing instruments require (1) that the M Community 
Trust actively solicit contributions from members of the X Community 
through dissemination of literature and other public appeals, and (2) 
that it make available to the members of the X Community, annual 
financial reports of its operations. Under the facts and circumstances, 
M is a ``publicly supported'' organization.
    Example 3. N, an art museum, is an organization referred to in 
section 170(c)(2). In 1930, N was founded in Y City by the members of a 
single family to collect, preserve, interpret, and display to the public 
important works of art. N is governed by a self-perpetuating Board of 
Trustees limited by the governing instruments to a maximum membership of 
20 individuals. The original board consisted almost entirely of members 
of the founding family. Since 1945, members of the founding family or 
persons standing in a relationship to the members of such family 
described in section 267(b) have annually constituted less than one-
fifth of the Board of Trustees. The remaining board members are citizens 
of Y City from a variety of professions and occupations who represent 
the interests and views of the people of Y City in the activities 
carried on by the organization rather than the personal or private 
interests of the founding family. N solicits contributions from the 
general public and for each of its four most recent taxable years has 
received total contributions in small sums (less than $100) in excess of 
$10,000. For N's four most recent taxable years, investment income from 
several large endowment funds has constituted 75 percent of its total 
support. N normally expends a substantial part of its annual income for 
purposes described in section 170(c)(2)(B). N has, for the entire period 
of its existence, been open to the public and more than 300,000 people 
(from the Y City and elsewhere) have visited the museum in each of its 
four most recent taxable years. N annually publishes a financial report 
of its operation in the Y City newspaper. Under the facts and 
circumstances, N museum is a ``publicly supported'' organization.
    Example 4. In 1960, the O Philharmonic Orchestra was organized in Z 
City through the combined efforts of a local music society and a local 
women's club to present to the public a wide variety of musical programs 
intended to foster music appreciation in the community. O is an 
organization referred to in section 170(c)(2). The orchestra is composed 
of professional musicians who are paid by the association. Twelve 
performances, open to the public, are scheduled each year. The admission 
charge for each of these performances is $3. In addition, several 
performances are staged annually without charge. In each of its four 
most recent taxable years, O has received separate contributions of 
$10,000 from A, B, C, and D (not members of a single family) and support 
of $5,000 from the Z Community Chest, a public federated fund raising 
organization operating in Z City. O is governed by a Board of Directors 
comprised of five individuals. A faculty member of a local college, the 
president of a local music society, the head of a local banking 
institution, a prominent doctor, and a member of the governing body of 
the local Chamber of Commerce currently serve on the Board and represent 
the interests and views of the community in the activities carried on by 
O. O annually files a financial report with Z City which makes such 
report available for public inspection. Under the facts and 
circumstances, O is a ``publicly supported'' organization.
    Example 5. P is a newly created organization of a type referred to 
in section 170 (c)(2). P's charter requires that its governing body be 
selected by public officials and by public organizations representing 
the community in which it operates. Pursuant to P's charter, a 
continuing fund raising campaign which will encompass the entire 
community has been planned. P's charter requires that its entire annual 
income be distributed to or used for projects with purposes described in 
section 170(c)(2)(B) and that it make available to the public annual 
financial reports of its operations. By reason of the express provisions 
of P's charter relating to its organizational structure and prescribed 
methods of operation, P is a ``publicly supported'' organization.

    (6) Examples. The application of the special 10-percent limitation 
and the general 20-percent limitation on contributions by individuals 
may be illustrated by the following examples:

basis and for the year 1957 has an adjusted gross income of $10,000. 
During 1957 he made the following charitable contributions:

    (c) Unlimited deduction for individuals--(1) In general. (i) The 
deduction for charitable contributions made by an individual is not 
subject to the 10- and 20-percent limitations of section 170(b) if in 
the taxable year and each of 8 of the 10 preceding taxable years the sum 
of his charitable contributions paid during the year, plus his payments 
during the year on account of Federal income taxes, is more than 90 
percent of his taxable income for the year (or net income, in years 
governed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). In determining the 
applicability of the 10- and 20-percent limitations of section 170(b) 
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, there may be 
substituted, in lieu of the amount of income tax paid during any year, 
the amount of income tax paid in respect of such year, provided that any 
amount

[[Page 25]]

so included for the year in respect of which payment was made shall not 
be included for any other year. For the purpose of the first sentence of 
this paragraph, taxable income under the 1954 Code is determined without 
regard to the deductions for charitable contributions under section 170, 
for personal exemptions under section 151, or for a net operating loss 
carryback under section 172. On the other hand, for this purpose net 
income under the 1939 Code is computed without the benefit only of the 
deduction for charitable contributions. See section 120 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1939. The term income tax as used in section 
170(b)(1)(C) means only Federal income taxes, and does not include the 
taxes imposed on self-employment income, on employees under the Federal 
Insurance Contributions Act, and on railroad employees and their 
representatives under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act by Chapters 2, 21, 
and 22, respectively, or corresponding provisions of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1939. For purposes of section 170(b)(1)(C) and this 
paragraph, the amount of income tax paid during a taxable year shall be 
determined (except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) 
by including all payments made by the taxpayer during such taxable year 
on account of his Federal income taxes (whether for the taxable year or 
for preceding taxable years). Such payments would include any amount 
paid during the taxable year as estimated tax (exclusive of any portion 
of such amount for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, 
which is attributable to the self-employment tax imposed by chapter (2) 
for that year, payment of the final installment of estimated tax 
(exclusive of any portion of such installment, for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1966, which is attributable to the self-
employment tax imposed by chapter 2) for the preceding taxable year, 
final payment for the preceding taxable year, and any payment of a 
deficiency for an earlier taxable year, to the extent that such payments 
do not exceed the tax for the taxable year for which payment is made. 
Any payment of income tax with respect to which the taxpayer receives a 
refund or credit shall be reduced by the amount of such refund or 
credit. Any such refund or credit shall be applied against the most 
recent payments for the taxable year in respect of which the refund or 
credit arose.
    (ii) For any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, the 
applicability of the 10- and 20-percent limitations of section 170(b) 
may be determined either with reference to the income tax paid during 
the year or any prior year, or with reference to the income tax paid in 
respect of any such year or prior years. The 90-percent test of section 
170(b)(1)(C) may be applied for the taxable year, or for any one or more 
of the preceding 10 taxable years, by taking into account the income 
taxes paid in respect of that year or years, and for the balance of the 
10 years by taking into account the income tax payments made during 
those years. Thus, a taxable year which qualifies under either of the 
two permissible methods shall be considered as a qualifying year 
irrespective of whether the taxable year begins before or after December 
31, 1957. However, a particular income tax payment may only be taken 
into account once, either with respect to the year of liability or for 
the year of payment.
    (2) Joint returns--(i) Joint return for current taxable year. If a 
husband and wife make a joint return for any taxable year, their 
deduction for charitable contributions is not subject to the 10- and 20-
percent limitations of section 170(b), if, under the rules of 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, in the taxable year and in each of 8 
of the 10 preceding taxable years (regardless of whether separate or 
joint returns were filed), the aggregate charitable contributions of 
both spouses paid during the year, plus their aggregate payments during 
the year on account of Federal income taxes (or, if the taxable year 
begins after December 31, 1957, the aggregate tax paid in respect of 
such taxable year or any preceding taxable year) exceed 90 percent of 
their aggregate taxable incomes for the year.
    (ii) Separate return by spouse or by unremarried widow or widower. 
If a spouse, or the unremarried widow or widower of a deceased spouse, 
makes a separate return for any taxable year,

[[Page 26]]

his deduction for charitable contributions is not subject to the 10- and 
20-percent limitations of section 170(b), if, under the rules of 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, in the taxable year and each of 8 of 
the 10 preceding taxable years:
    (a) For which the taxpayer filed a joint return with his spouse, 
either their aggregate charitable contributions and payments of Federal 
income taxes made during the taxable year (or if the taxable year begins 
after December 31, 1957, made in respect of such taxable year or any 
preceding taxable year) exceed 90 percent of their aggregate taxable 
income for that year, or the taxpayer's separate charitable 
contributions and payments of Federal income taxes allocable to his 
separate income and made during the taxable year (or if the taxable year 
begins after December 31, 1957, made in respect of such taxable year or 
any preceding taxable year) exceed 90 percent of his separate taxable 
income for that year, and (b) For which the taxpayer did not file a 
joint return with his spouse, the aggregate of his charitable 
contributions and payments of Federal income taxes made during the 
taxable year (or, if the taxable year begins after December 31, 1957, 
the payments of income taxes made in respect of such taxable year or any 
preceding taxable year) exceeds 90 percent of his taxable income for 
that year.

For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the word spouse does not 
include a spouse from whom the taxpayer has been divorced.
    (iii) Joint return with former spouse for prior taxable year. A 
divorced or remarried taxpayer who filed a joint return for a prior 
taxable year with a former spouse shall, for purposes of applying this 
paragraph, be treated in the same manner as if he had filed a separate 
return for such prior taxable year, and as if his Federal income tax 
liability and taxable income for such prior taxable year were his 
allocable portions of the joint tax liability and combined taxable 
income, respectively, for such year.
    (iv) Allocation. Whenever it is necessary to allocate the joint tax 
liability or the combined taxable income, or both, for a taxable year 
for which a joint return was filed, a computation shall be made for the 
taxpayer and for his spouse or former spouse showing for each of them 
the Federal income taxes and taxable income which would be determined if 
separate returns had been filed by them for such taxable year. The joint 
tax liability and conbined taxable income for such taxable year shall 
then be allocated proportionately to the income taxes and taxable 
income, respectively, so computed. Whenever it is necessary to determine 
the separate payments made by a taxpayer in respect of a joint tax 
liability, the amount paid by him during the taxable year as estimated 
tax (exclusive of any portion of such amount for taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1966, which is attributable to the self-employment 
tax imposed by Chapter 2) for that year shall be included to the extent 
it does not exceed his allocable portion of the joint tax under Chapter 
1 (exclusive of tax under section 56) for the taxable year, and any 
amount paid by him for a prior year (whether as the final installment of 
estimated tax--exclusive of any portion of such installment, for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1966, which is attributable to the 
self-employment tax imposed by Chapter 2--for the preceding taxable 
year, or a final payment for the preceding year, or the payment of a 
deficiency for an earlier year) shall be included to the extent such 
amount, when added to amounts previously paid by him for such prior 
year, does not exceed his allocable portion of the joint tax liability 
for the prior year.
    (d) Denial of deduction in case of certain transfers in trust--(1) 
Reversionary interest in grantor. No charitable deduction will be 
allowed for the value of any interest in property transferred to a trust 
after March 9, 1954, if the grantor at the time of the transfer has a 
reversionary interest in the corpus or income and the value of such 
reversionary interest exceeds 5 percent of the total value on which the 
charitable deduction would, but for section 170(b)(1)(D), be determined. 
For purposes of this paragraph, the term reversionary interest means a 
possibility that after the possession or enjoyment of

[[Page 27]]

property or its income has been obtained by a charitable donee, the 
property or its income may revest in the grantor or his estate, or may 
be subject to a power exercisable by the grantor or a nonadverse party 
(within the meaning of section 672 (b)), or both, to revest in, or 
return to or for the benefit of, the grantor or his estate the property 
or income therefrom. An interest of the grantor which, in any event, 
will terminate before the ripening of the assured charitable gift for 
which a deduction is claimed is not considered a reversionary interest 
for purposes of this section. For example, assume that a taxpayer 
conveyed property to a trust under the terms of which the income is 
payable to the taxpayer's wife for her life, and, if she predeceases 
him, to him for his life, and after the death of both the property is to 
be transferred to a charitable organization.
    (2) Valuation of interests. The present value of the remainder 
interest in the property, taking into account the value of the life 
estates reserved to the taxpayer and his wife, may be allowed as a 
charitable deduction. Where the corpus of the trust is to return to the 
grantor after a number of years certain, the value of the reversionary 
interest at the time of the transfer may be computed by the use of 
tables showing the present value at 3 1/2 percent a year, compuounded 
annually, of $1 payable at the end of a number of years certain. See 
paragraph (f), Table II, of Sec. 20.2031-7 of this chapter (Estate Tax 
Regulations). Where the value of a reversionary interest is dependent 
upon the continuation or termination of the life of one or more persons, 
it must be determined on the basis of Table 38 of United States Life 
Tables and Actuarial Tables 1939-1941, published by the United States 
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, and interest at the rate 
of 3 1/2 percent a year, compounded annually. See paragraph (f), Table 
I, of Sec. 20.2031-7 of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) for 
valuations based on one life, and ``Actuarial Values for Estate and Gift 
Tax`` (Internal Revenue Service Publication No. 11, Rev. 5-59) for 
values based on more than one life. In an actual case (not merely 
hypothetical), the grantor or his legal representative may, upon 
request, obtain the information necessary to determine such a value from 
the district director with whom the grantor files his return. The 
request must be accompanied by a statement showing the date of birth of 
each person the duration of whose life may affect the value of the 
reversionary interest and by copies of the instruments relevant to the 
transfer.
     (e) Fiscal years and short taxable years ending after March 9, 
1954, subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. Pursuant to section 
7851(a)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the regulations 
prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section, to the extent that they 
relate to transfers in trust occurring after March 9, 1954, shall apply 
to all taxable years ending after March 9, 1954, even though those years 
may be subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
    (f) Amounts paid to maintain certain students as members of the 
taxpayer's household--(1) In General. (i) For taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1959, the term charitable contribution includes 
amounts paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year to maintain certain 
students as members of his household which, under the provisions of 
section 170(d) and this paragraph, are treated as amounts paid for the 
use of an organization described in section 170(c) (2), (3), or (4), and 
such amounts, to the extent they do not exceed the limitations under 
section 170(d)(2) and paragraph (f)(2) of this section, are deductible 
contributions under section 170. In order for such amounts to be so 
treated, the student must be an individual who is neither a dependent 
(as defined in section 152) of the taxpayer nor related to the taxpayer 
in a manner described in any of the paragraphs (1) through (8) of 
section 152(a), and such individual must be a member of the taxpayer's 
household pursuant to a written agreement between the taxpayer and an 
organization described in section 170(c) (2), (3), or (4) to implement a 
program of the organization to provide educational opportunities for 
pupils or students placed in private homes by such organization. 
Furthermore, such amounts must be paid to maintain such individual 
during the period in the taxable year he is a member of the taxpayer's 
household and is

[[Page 28]]

a full-time pupil or student in the twelfth or any lower grade at an 
educational institution (as defined in section 151(e)(4)) located in the 
United States. Amounts paid outside of the period (but within the 
taxable year) for expenses necessary for the maintenance of the student 
during the period will qualify for the charitable deduction if the other 
limitation requirements of the section are met.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (i) of this section, amounts treated 
as charitable contributions include only those amounts actually paid by 
the taxpayer during the taxable year which are directly attributable to 
the maintenance of the student while he is a member of the taxpayer's 
household and is attending school on a full-time basis. This would 
include amounts paid to ensure the well-being of the individual and to 
carry out the purpose for which the individual was placed in the 
taxpayer's home. For example, a deduction would be allowed for amounts 
paid for books, tuition, food, clothing, transportation, medical and 
dental care, and recreation for the individual. Amounts treated as 
charitable contributions under this paragraph do not include amounts 
which the taxpayer would have expended had the student not been in the 
household. They would not include, for example, amounts paid in 
connection with the taxpayer's home for taxes, insurance, interest on a 
mortgage, repairs, etc. Moreover, such amounts do not include any 
depreciation sustained by the taxpayer in maintaining such student or 
students in his household, nor do they include the value of any services 
rendered on behalf of such student or students by the taxpayer or any 
member of the taxpayer's household.
    (iii) For purposes of section 170(d) and this paragraph, an 
individual will be considered to be a full-time pupil or student at an 
educational institution only if he is enrolled for a course of study 
(prescribed for a full-time student) at such institution and is 
attending classes on a full-time basis. Nevertheless, such individual 
may be absent from school due to special circumstances and still be 
considered to be in full-time attendance. Periods during the regular 
school term when the school is closed for holidays, such as Christmas 
and Easter, and for periods between semesters are treated as periods 
during which the pupil or student is in full-time attendance at the 
school. Also, absences during the regular school term due to illness of 
such individual shall not prevent him from being considered as a full-
time pupil or student. Similarly, absences from the taxpayer's household 
due to special circumstances will not disqualify the student as a member 
of the household. Summer vacations between regular school terms are not 
considered periods of school attendance.
    (iv) As in the case of other charitable deductions, any deduction 
claimed for amounts described in section 170(d) and this paragraph which 
are treated as charitable contributions under section 170(c) is subject 
to verification by the district director. When claiming a deduction for 
such amounts, the taxpayer should submit a copy of his agreement with 
the organization sponsoring the individual placed in the taxpayer's 
household together with a summary of the various items for which amounts 
were paid to maintain such individual, and a statement as to the date 
the individual became a member of the household and the period of his 
attendance at school and the name and location of such school. 
Substantiation of amounts claimed must be supported by adequate records 
of the amounts actually paid. Due to the nature of certain items, such 
as food, a record of amounts spent for all members of the household, 
with an equal portion thereof allocated to each member, will be 
acceptable.
    (2) Limitations. Section 170(d) and this paragraph shall apply to 
amounts paid during the taxable year only to the extent that the amounts 
paid in maintaining each pupil or student do not exceed $50 multiplied 
by the number of full calendar months in the taxable year that the pupil 
or student is maintained in accordance with the provisions of this 
paragraph. For purposes of such limitation, if 15 or more days of a 
calendar month fall within the period to which the maintenance of such 
pupil or student relates, such month is considered as a full calendar 
month. To the extent that such amounts qualify

[[Page 29]]

as charitable contributions under section 170(c), the aggregate of such 
amounts plus other contributions made during the taxable year is 
deductible under section 170, subject to the 20-percent limitation 
provided in section 170(b)(1)(B). Also, see Sec. 1.170-2(a)(1).
    (3) Compensation or reimbursement. Amounts paid during the taxable 
year to maintain a pupil or student as a member of the taxpayer's 
household, as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, shall not be 
taken into account under section 170(d) of this paragraph, if the 
taxpayer receives any money or other property as compensation or 
reimbursement for any portion of such amounts. The taxpayer will not be 
denied the benefits of section 170(d) if he prepays an extraordinary or 
nonrecurring expense, such as a hospital bill or vacation trip, at the 
request of the individual's parents or the sponsoring organization and 
is reimbursed for such prepayment. The value of services performed by 
the pupil or student in attending to ordinary chores of the household 
will not generally be considered to constitute compensation or 
reimbursement. However, if the pupil or student is taken into the 
taxpayer's household to replace a former employee of the taxpayer or 
gratuitously to perform substantial services for the taxpayer, the facts 
and circumstances may warrant a conclusion that the taxpayer received 
reimbursement for maintaining the pupil or student.
    (4) No other amount allowed as deduction. Except to the extent that 
amounts described in section 170(d) and this paragraph are treated as 
charitable contributions under section 170(c) and, therefore, deductible 
under section 170(a), no deduction is allowed for any amount paid to 
maintain an individual, as a member of the taxpayer's household, in 
accordance with the provisions of section 170(d) and this paragraph.
    (5) Examples. Application of the provisions of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. The X organization is an organization described in 
section 170(c)(2) and is engaged in a program under which a number of 
European children are placed in the homes of United States residents in 
order to further the children's high school education. In accordance 
with the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the taxpayer, 
A, who reports his income on the calendar year basis, agreed with X to 
take two of the children, and they were placed in the taxpayer's home on 
January 2, 1960, where they remained until January 21, 1961, during 
which time they were fully maintained by the taxpayer. The children 
enrolled at the local high school for the full course of study 
prescribed for tenth grade students and attended the school on a full-
time basis for the spring semester starting January 18, 1960, and ending 
June 3, 1960, and for the fall semester starting September 1, 1960, and 
ending January 13, 1961. The total cost of food paid by A in 1960 for 
himself, his wife, and the two children amounted to $1,920, or $40 per 
month for each member of the household. Since the children were actually 
full-time students for only 8 1/2 months during 1960, the amount paid 
for food for each child during that period amounted to $340. Other 
amounts paid during the 8 1/2 month period for each child for laundry, 
lights, water, recreation, and school supplies amounted to $160. Thus, 
the amounts treated under section 170(d) and this paragraph as paid for 
the use of X would, with respect to each child, total $500 ($340+$160), 
or a total for both children of $1,000, subject to the limitations of 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. Since, for purposes of such 
limitations, the children were full-time students for only 8 full 
calendar months during 1960 (less than 15 days in January 1960), the 
taxpayer may treat only $800 as a charitable contribution made in 1960, 
that is, $50 multiplied by the 8 full calendar months, or $400 paid for 
the maintenance of each child. Neither the excess payments nor amounts 
paid to maintain the children during the period before school opened and 
for the period in summer between regular school terms is taken into 
account by reason of section 170(d). Also, because the children were 
full-time students for less than 15 days in January 1961 (although 
maintained in the taxpayer's household for 21 days), amounts paid to 
maintain the children during 1961 would not qualify as a charitable 
contribution.
    Example 2. A religious organization described in section 170(c)(2) 
has a program for providing educational opportunities for children it 
places in private homes. In order to implement the program, the 
taxpayer, H, who resides with his wife, son, and daughter of high school 
age in a town in the United States, signs an agreement with the 
organization to maintain a girl sponsored by the organization as a 
member of his household while the child attends the local high school 
for the regular 1960-61 school year. The child is a full-time student at 
the school during the school year starting September 6, 1960, and ending 
June 6, 1961, and is a member of the taxpayer's household during that 
period.

[[Page 30]]

Although the taxpayer pays $200 during the school period falling in 
1960, and $240 during the school period falling in 1961, to maintain the 
child, he cannot claim either amount as a charitable contribution 
because the child's parents, from time to time during the school year, 
send butter, eggs, meat, and vegetables to H to help defray the expenses 
of maintaining the child. This is considered property received as 
reimbursement under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Had her parents 
not contributed the food, the fact that the child, in addition to the 
normal chores she shared with the taxpayer's daughter, such as cleaning 
their own rooms and helping with the shopping and cooking, was 
responsible for the family laundry and for the heavy cleaning of the 
entire house while the taxpayer's daughter had no comparable 
responsibilities would also preclude a claim for a charitable deduction. 
These substantial gratuitous services are considered property received 
as reimbursement under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
    Example 3. A taxpayer resides with his wife in a city in the eastern 
United States. He agrees, in writing, with a fraternal society described 
in section 170(c)(4) to accept a child selected by the society for 
maintenance by him as a member of his household during 1961 in order 
that the child may attend the local grammar school as a part of the 
society's program to provide elementary education for certain children 
selected by it. The taxpayer maintains the child, who has as his 
principal place of abode the home of the taxpayer, and is a member of 
the taxpayer's household, during the entire year 1961. The child is a 
full-time student at the local grammar school for 9 full calendar months 
during the year. Under the agreement, the society pays the taxpayer $30 
per month to help maintain the child. Since the $30 per month is 
considered as compensation or reimbursement to the taxpayer for some 
portion of the maintenance paid on behalf of the child, no amounts paid 
with respect to such maintenance can be treated as amounts paid in 
accordance with section 170(d). In the absence of the $30 per month 
payments, if the child qualifies as a dependent of the taxpayer under 
section 152(a)(9), that fact would also prevent the maintenance payments 
from being treated as charitable contributions paid for the use of the 
fraternal society.

    (g) Charitable contributions carryover of individuals--(1) 
Computation of excess charitable contributions made in contribution 
year. Subject to certain conditions and limitations, the excess of:
    (i) The amount of the charitable contributions made by an individual 
in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963 (hereinafter in this 
paragraph referred to as the ``contribution year''), to organizations 
specified in section 170(b)(1)(A) (see paragraph (b) of this section), 
over
    (ii) Thirty percent of his adjusted gross income (computed without 
regard to any net operating loss carryback to such year under section 
172) for such contribution year, shall be treated as a charitable 
contribution paid by him to an organization specified in section 
170(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section, relating to the 
additional 10-percent deduction, in each of the 5 taxable years 
immediately succeeding the contribution year in order of time. (For 
provisions requiring a reduction of such excess, see subparagraph (5) of 
this paragraph.) The provisions of this subparagraph apply even though 
the taxpayer elects under section 144 to take the standard deduction in 
the contribution year instead of itemizing the deductions (other than 
those specified in sections 62 and 151) allowable in computing taxable 
income for the contribution year. No excess charitable contribution 
carryover shall be allowed with respect to contributions ``for the use 
of'' rather than ``to'' organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) 
and paragraph (b) of this section or with respect to contributions made 
``to'' or ``for the use of'' organizations which are not described in 
such sections. The provisions of section 170(b)(5) and this paragraph 
are not applicable in the case of estates or trusts, see section 642(c), 
relating to deductions for amounts paid or permanently set aside for a 
charitable purpose, and the regulations thereunder. The provisions of 
this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Assume that H and W (husband and wife) have adjusted 
gross income for 1964 of $50,000 and for 1965 of $40,000 and file a 
joint return for each year. Assume further that in 1964 they contribute 
$16,500 to a church and $1,000 to X (an organization not referred to in 
section 170(b)(1)(A)) and in 1965 contribute $11,000 to the church and 
$400 to X. They may claim a charitable contribution deduction of $15,000 
in 1964, and the excess of $16,500 (contribution to the church) over 
$15,000 (30 percent of adjusted gross income) or $1,500 constitutes a 
charitable contribution carryover which shall be treated as a charitable 
contribution paid by them to an organization referred to in section 
170(b)(1)(A) in each of the 5 succeeding taxable years in order of time. 
No carryover is

[[Page 31]]

allowed with respect to the $1,000 contribution made to X in 1964. Since 
30 percent of their adjusted gross income for 1965 ($12,000) exceeds the 
charitable contributions of $11,000 made by them in 1965 to 
organizations referred to in section 170(b)(1)(A) (computed without 
regard to section 170(b)(5) and this paragraph) the portion of the 1964 
carryover equal to such excess of $1,000 ($12,000 minus $11,000) is 
treated, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph, as paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1965; the 
remaining $500 constitutes an unused charitable contribution carryover. 
No carryover is allowed with respect to the $400 contribution made to X 
in 1965.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that H and 
W have adjusted gross income for 1965 of $42,000. Since 30 percent of 
their adjusted gross income for 1965 ($12,600) exceeds by $1,600 the 
charitable contribution of $11,000 made by them in 1965 to organizations 
referred to in section 170(b)(1)(A) (computed without regard to section 
170(b)(5) and this paragraph), the full amount of the 1964 carryover of 
$1,500 is treated, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (2) of 
this paragraph, as paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1965. 
They may also claim a charitable contribution of $100 ($12,600 -$12,500 
($11,000+$1,500)) with respect to the gift to X in 1965. No carryover is 
allowed with respect to the $300 ($400-$100) of the contribution to X 
which is not deductible in 1965.

    (2) Determination of amount treated as paid in taxable years 
succeeding contribution year. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the amount of the excess computed in 
accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (5) of this 
paragraph which is to be treated as paid in any one of the 5 taxable 
years immediately succeeding the contribution year to an organization 
specified in section 170(b)(1)(A) shall not exceed the lesser of the 
amount computed under subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph:
    (i) The amount by which (a) 30 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted 
gross income for such succeeding taxable year (computed without regard 
to any net operating loss carryback to such succeeding taxable year 
under section 172) exceeds (b) the sum of (1) the charitable 
contributions actually made (computed without regard to the provisions 
of section 170(b)(5) and this paragraph) by the taxpayer in such 
succeeding taxable year to organizations referred to in section 
170(b)(1)(A), and (2) the charitable contributions made to organizations 
referred to in section 170(b)(1)(A) in taxable years (excluding any 
taxable year beginning before January 1, 1964) preceding the 
contribution year which, pursuant to the provisions of section 170(b)(5) 
and this paragraph, are treated as having been paid to an organization 
referred to in section 170(b)(1)(A) in such succeeding year.
    (ii) In the case of the first taxable year succeeding the 
contribution year, the amount of the excess charitable contribution in 
the contribution year, computed under subparagraphs (1) and (5) of this 
paragraph. In the case of the second, third, fourth, and fifth 
succeeding taxable years, the portion of the excess charitable 
contribution in the contribution year (computed under subparagraphs (1) 
and (5) of this paragraph) which has not been treated as paid to a 
section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in a year intervening between the 
contribution year and such succeeding taxable year.
If a taxpayer, in any one of the four taxable years succeeding a 
contribution year, elects under section 144 to take the standard 
deduction in the amount provided for in section 141 instead of itemizing 
the deductions (other than those specified in sections 62 and 151) 
allowable in computing taxable income, there shall be treated as paid 
(but not allowable as a deduction) in the standard deduction year the 
amount determined under subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph, 
whichever is the lesser. The provisions of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Assume that B has adjusted gross income for 1966 of 
$20,000 and for 1967 of $30,000. Assume further that in 1966 B 
contributed $8,000 to a church and in 1967 he contributes $7,500 to the 
church. B may claim a charitable contribution deduction of $6,000 in 
1966, and the excess of $8,000 (contribution to the church) over $6,000 
(30 percent of B's adjusted gross income) or $2,000 constitutes a 
charitable contribution carryover which shall be treated as a charitable 
contribution paid by B to an organization referred to in section 
170(b)(1)(A) in the 5 taxable years succeeding 1966 in order of time. (B 
made no excess contributions in 1964 or 1965 which should be treated as 
paid in years succeeding 1964 or 1965.) B may claim a charitable 
contribution deduction of $9,000 in 1967. Such $9,000 consists of the 
$7,500 contribution to

the church in 1967 and $1,500 carried over from 1966 and treated as a 
charitable contribution paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 
1967. The $1,500 contribution treated as paid in 1967 is computed as 
follows:

If the excess contributions made by B in 1966 had been $1,000 instead of 
$2,000, then, for purposes of this example, the amount of the 1966 
excess treated as paid in 1967 would be $1,000 rather than $1,500.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), and, in 
addition, that B has adjusted gross income for 1968 of $10,000 and for 
1969 of $20,000. Assume further with respect to 1968 that B elects under 
section 144 to take the standard deduction in computing taxable income 
and that his actual contributions to organizations specified in section 
170(b)(1)(A) are $300. Assume further with respect to 1969, that B 
itemizes his deductions which include a $5,000 contribution to a church. 
B's deductions for 1968 are not increased by reason of the $500 
available as a charitable contribution carryover from 1966 (excess 
contributions made in 1966 ($2,000) less the amount of such excess 
treated as paid in 1967 ($1,500)) since B elected to take the standard 
deduction in 1968. However, for purposes of determining the amount of 
the excess charitable contributions made in 1966 which is available as a 
carryover to 1969, B is required to treat such $500 as a charitable 
contribution paid in 1968--the lesser of $500 or $2,700 (30 percent of 
adjusted gross income ($3,000) over contributions actually made in 1968 
to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations ($300)). Therefore, even though 
the $5,000 contribution made by B in 1969 to a church does not amount to 
30 percent of B's adjusted gross income for 1969 (30 percent of 
$20,000=$6,000), B may claim a charitable contribution deduction of only 
the $5,000 actually paid in 1969 since the entire excess charitable 
contribution made in 1966 ($2,000) has been treated as paid in 1967 
($1,500) and 1968 ($500).
    Example 3. Assume the following factual situation for C who itemizes 
his deductions in computing taxable income for each of the years set 
forth in the example:

Since C's contributions in 1967 and 1968 to section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organizations are less than 30 percent of his adjusted gross income for 
such years, the excess contributions for 1964, 1965, and 1966 are 
treated as having been paid to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations in 
1967 and 1968 as follows:

    (3) Effect of net operating loss carryback to contribution year. The 
amount of the excess contribution for a contribution year (computed as 
provided in subparagraphs (1) and (5) of this paragraph) shall not be 
increased because a net operating loss carryback is available as a 
deduction in the contribution year. In addition, in determining (under 
the provisions of section 172(b)(2)) the amount of the net operating 
loss for any year subsequent to the contribution year which is a 
carryback or carryover to taxable years succeeding the contribution 
year, the amount of contributions made to organizations referred to in 
section 170(b)(1)(A) shall be limited to the amount of such 
contributions which did not exceed 30 percent of the donor's adjusted 
gross income (computed without regard to any net operating loss 
carryback or any of the modifications referred to in section 172(d)) for 
the contribution year.
    (4) Effect of net operating loss carryback to taxable years 
succeeding the contribution year. The amount of the charitable 
contribution from a preceding taxable year which is treated as paid (as 
provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) in a current taxable 
year (hereinafter referred to in this subparagraph as the ``deduction 
year'') shall not be reduced because a net operating loss carryback is 
available as a deduction in the deduction year. In addition, in 
determining (under the provisions of section 172(b)(2)) the amount of 
the net operating loss for any year subsequent to the deduction year 
which is a carryback or carryover to taxable years succeeding the 
deduction year, the amount of contributions made to organizations 
referred to in section 170(b)(1)(A) in the deduction year shall be 
limited to the amount of such contributions which were actually made in 
such year and those which were treated as paid in such year which did 
not exceed 30 percent of the donor's adjusted gross income (computed 
without regard to any net operating loss carryback or any of the 
modifications referred to in section 172(d)) for the deduction year.
    (5) Reduction of excess contributions. An individual having a net 
operating loss carryover from a prior taxable year which is available as 
a deduction in a contribution year must apply the special rule of 
section 170(b)(5)(B) and this subparagraph in computing the excess 
described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for such contribution 
year. In determining the amount of excess charitable contributions that 
shall be treated as paid in each of the 5 taxable years succeeding the 
contribution year, the excess charitable contributions described in such 
subparagraph (1) must be reduced by the amount by which such excess 
reduces taxable income (for purposes of determining the

[[Page 34]]

portion of a net operating loss which shall be carried to taxable years 
succeeding the contribution year under the second sentence of section 
172(b)(2)) and increases the net operating loss which is carried to a 
succeeding taxable year. In reducing taxable income under the second 
sentence of section 172(b)(2), an individual who has made charitable 
contributions in the contribution year to both organizations specified 
in section 170(b)(1)(A) (see paragraph (b) of this section) and to 
organizations not so specified must first deduct contributions made to 
the section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations from his adjusted gross income 
computed without regard to his net operating loss deduction before any 
of the contributions made to organizations not specified in section 
170(b)(1)(A) may be deducted from such adjusted gross income. Thus, if 
the excess of the contributions made in the contribution year to 
organizations specified in section 170(b)(1)(A) over the amount 
deductible in such contribution year is utilized to reduce taxable 
income (under the provisions of section 172 (b)(2)) for such year, 
thereby serving to increase the amount of the net operating loss 
carryover to a succeeding year or years, no part of the excess 
charitable contributions made in such contribution year shall be treated 
as paid in any of the 5 immediately succeeding taxable years. If only a 
portion of the excess charitable contributions is so used, the excess 
charitable contributions will be reduced only to that extent. The 
provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. B, an individual, reports his income on the calendar year 
basis and for the year 1964 has adjusted gross income (computed without 
regard to any net operating loss deduction) of $50,000. During 1964 he 
made charitable contributions in the amount of $20,000 all of which were 
to organizations specified in section 170(b)(1)(A). B has a net 
operating loss carryover from 1963 of $50,000. In the absence of the net 
operating loss deduction B would have been allowed a deduction for 
charitable contributions of $15,000. After the application of the net 
operating loss deduction, B is allowed no deduction for charitable 
contributions, and there is (before applying the special rule of section 
170(b)(5)(B) and this subparagraph) a tentative excess charitable 
contribution of $20,000. For purposes of determining the net operating 
loss which remains to be carried over to 1965, B computes his taxable 
income for his prior taxable year, 1964, under section 172(b)(2) by 
deducting the $15,000 charitable contribution. After the $50,000 net 
operating loss carryover is applied against the $35,000 of taxable 
income for 1964 (computed in accordance with section 172(b)(2), assuming 
no deductions other than the charitable contribution deduction are 
applicable in making such computation), there remains a $15,000 net 
operating loss carryover to 1965. Since the application of the net 
operating loss carryover of $50,000 from 1963 reduces the 1964 adjusted 
gross income (for purposes of determining 1964 tax liability) to zero, 
no part of the $20,000 of charitable contributions in that year is 
deductible under section 170(b)(1). However, in determining the amount 
of the excess charitable contributions which shall be treated as paid in 
taxable years 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, the $20,000 must be reduced 
by the portion thereof ($15,000) which was used to reduce taxable income 
for 1964 (as computed for purposes of the second sentence of section 
172(b)(2)) and which thereby served to increase the net operating loss 
carryover to 1965 from zero to $15,000.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that B's 
total contributions of $20,000 made during 1964 consisted of $15,000 to 
organizations specified in section 170(b)(1)(A) and $5,000 to 
organizations not so specified. Under these facts there is a tentative 
excess charitable contribution of $15,000, rather than $20,000 as in 
Example (1). For purposes of determining the net operating loss which 
remains to be carried over to 1965, B computes his taxable income for 
his prior taxable year, 1964, under section 172(b)(2) by deducting the 
$15,000 of charitable contributions made to organizations specified in 
section 170(b)(1)(A). Since the excess charitable contribution of 
$15,000 determined in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
was used to reduce taxable income for 1964 (as computed for purposes of 
the second sentence of section 172(b)(2)) and thereby served to increase 
the net operating loss carryover to 1965 from zero to $15,000, no part 
of such excess charitable contributions made in the contribution year 
shall be treated as paid in any of the five immediately succeeding 
taxable years. No carryover is allowed with respect to the $5,000 of 
charitable contributions made in 1964 to organizations not specified in 
section 170(b)(1)(A).

    (6) Change in type of return filed--(i) From joint return to 
separate returns. If a husband and wife--
    (a) Make a joint return for a contribution year and compute an 
excess charitable contribution for such year in accordance with the 
provisions of

[[Page 35]]

subparagraphs (1) and (5) of this paragraph, and
    (b) Make separate returns for one or more of the 5 taxable years 
immediately succeeding such contribution year, any excess charitable 
contribution for the contribution year which is unused at the beginning 
of the first such taxable year for which separate returns are filed 
shall be allocated between the husband and wife. For purposes of the 
allocation, a computation shall be made of the amount of any excess 
charitable contribution which each spouse would have computed in 
accordance with subparagraphs (1) and (5) of this paragraph if separate 
returns (rather than a joint return) had been filed for the contribution 
year. The portion of the total unused excess charitable contribution for 
the contribution year allocated to each spouse shall be an amount which 
bears the same ratio to such unused excess charitable contribution as 
such spouse's excess contribution (based on the separate return 
computation) bears to the total excess contributions of both spouses 
(based on the separate return computation). To the extent that a portion 
of the amount allocated to either spouse in accordance with the 
foregoing provisions of this subdivision is not treated in accordance 
with the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph as a 
charitable contribution paid to an organization specified in section 
170(b)(1)(A) in the taxable year in which a separate return or separate 
returns are filed, each spouse shall for purposes of subparagraph (2) of 
this paragraph treat his respective unused portion as the available 
charitable contributions carryover to the next succeeding taxable year 
in which the joint excess charitable contribution may be treated as paid 
in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. If such husband 
and wife make a joint return in one of the five taxable years 
immediately succeeding the contribution year with respect to which a 
joint excess charitable contribution is computed and following the first 
succeeding year in which such husband and wife filed a separate return 
or separate returns, the amounts allocated to each spouse in accordance 
with this subdivision for such first year reduced by the portion of such 
amounts treated as paid to an organization specified in section 
170(b)(1)(A) in such first year and in any taxable year intervening 
between such first year and the succeeding taxable year in which the 
joint return is filed shall be aggregated for purposes of determining 
the amount of the available charitable contributions carryover to such 
succeeding taxable year. The provisions of this subdivision (i) may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. H and W file joint returns for 1964, 1965, and 1966, and in 
1967 they file separate returns. In each such year H and W itemize their 
deductions in computing taxable income. Assume the following factual 
situation with respect to H and W for 1964:

                                  1964                                  
                                                                        
                                                                  Joint 
                                                H         W      return 
                                                                        
Adjusted gross income.....................   $50,000   $40,000   $90,000

Excess contributions for taxable year to

 taxable years............................    12,000     8,000    20,000
                                           =============================
                                                                        

The joint excess charitable contribution of $20,000 is to be treated as 
having been paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in the five 
succeeding taxable years. Assume that in 1965, the portion of such 
excess treated as paid by H and W is $3,000 and that in 1966, the 
portion of such excess treated as paid is $7,000. Thus, the unused 
portion of the excess charitable contribution made in the contribution 
year is $10,000 ($20,000 less $3,000 (amount treated as paid in 1965) 
and $7,000 (amount treated as paid in 1966)). Since H and W file 
separate returns in 1967, $6,000 of such $10,000 is allocable to H and 
$4,000 is allocable to W. Such allocation is computed as follows:

[[Page 36]]

$12,000 (excess charitable contributions made by H (based on separate 
return computation) in 1964)/$20,000 (total excess charitable 
contributions made by H and W (based on separate return computation) in 
1964) x $10,000=$6,000
$8,000 (excess charitable contributions made by W (based on separate 
return computation) in 1964)/$20,000 (total excess charitable 
contributions made by H and W (based on separate return computation) in 
1964) x $10,000=$4,000
In 1967 H has adjusted gross income of $70,000 and he contributes 
$14,000 to an organization specified in section 170(b)(1)(A). In 1967 W 
has adjusted gross income of $50,000, and she contributes $10,000 to an 
organization specified in section 170(b)(1)(A). H may claim a charitable 
contribution deduction of $20,000 in 1967, and W may claim a charitable 
contribution deduction of $14,000 in 1967. H's $20,000 deduction 
consists of the $14,000 contribution to the section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization in 1967 and $6,000 carried over from 1964 and treated as a 
charitable contribution paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 
1967. W's $14,000 deduction consists of the $10,000 contribution made to 
a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1967 and $4,000 carried over from 
1964 and treated as a charitable contribution paid to a section 
170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1967. The $6,000 contribution treated as 
paid in 1967 by H, and the $4,000 contribution treated as paid in 1967 
by W are computed as follows:

    (ii) From separate returns to joint return and remarried taxpayers. 
If in the case of a husband and wife:
    (a) Either or both of the spouses make a separate return for a 
contribution year and compute an excess charitable contribution for such 
year in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (5) of 
this paragraph, and
    (b) Such husband and wife make a joint return for one or more of the 
taxable years immediately succeeding such contribution year, the excess 
charitable contribution of the husband and wife for the contribution 
year which is unused at the beginning of the first taxable year for 
which a joint return is filed shall be aggregated for purposes of 
determining the portion of such unused charitable contribution which 
shall be treated in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph 
as a charitable contribution paid to an organization specified in 
section 170(b)(1)(A). The provisions of this subdivision are also 
applicable in the case of two single individuals who are subsequently 
married and file a joint return. A remarried taxpayer who filed a joint 
return with a former spouse in a contribution year with respect to which 
an excess charitable contribution was computed and who in any one of the 
five taxable years immediately succeeding such contribution year files a 
joint return with his (or her) present spouse shall treat the unused 
portion of such excess charitable contribution allocated to him (or her) 
in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph in the same 
manner as the unused portion of an excess charitable contribution 
computed in a contribution year in which he filed a separate return for 
purposes of determining the amount which in accordance with subparagraph 
(2) of this paragraph shall be treated as paid to an organization 
specified in section 170(b)(1)(A) in such succeeding year.
    (iii) Unused excess charitable contribution of deceased spouse. In 
case of the death of one spouse, any unused portion of an excess 
charitable contribution which is allocable (in accordance with 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) to such spouse shall not be 
treated as paid in the taxable year in which such death occurs or in any 
subsequent taxable year except on a separate return made for the 
deceased

[[Page 37]]

spouse by a fiduciary for the taxable year which ends with the date of 
death or on a joint return for the taxable year in which such death 
occurs. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. Assume the same facts as in the example in subdivision (i) 
of this subparagraph except that H dies in 1966 and W files a separate 
return for 1967. W made a joint return for herself and H for 1966. In 
that example, the unused excess charitable contribution as of January 1, 
1967, was $10,000, $6,000 of which was allocable to H and $4,000 to W. 
No portion of the $6,000 allocable to H may be treated as paid by W or 
any other person in 1967 or any subsequent year.

    (7) Information required in support of a deduction of an amount 
treated as paid. If, in a taxable year, a deduction is claimed in 
respect of an excess charitable contribution which, in accordance with 
the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, is treated (in 
whole or in part) as paid in such taxable year, the taxpayer shall 
attach to his return a statement showing:
    (i) The year (or years) in which the excess charitable contributions 
were made (the contribution year or years),
    (ii) The excess charitable contributions made in each contribution 
year,
    (iii) The portion of such excess (or each such excess) treated as 
paid in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph in any 
taxable year intervening between the contribution year and the taxable 
year for which the return is made, and
    (iv) Such other information as the return or the instructions 
relating thereto may require.

<R05>
Sec. 1.170-3   Contributions or gifts by corporations (before amendment by Tax Reform Act of 1969).

    (a) In general. The deduction by a corporation in any taxable year 
for charitable contributions, as defined in section 170(c), is limited 
to 5 percent of its taxable income for the year computed without regard 
to:
    (1) The deduction for charitable contributions,
    (2) The special deductions for corporations allowed under part VIII 
(except section 248), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code,
    (3) Any net operating loss carryback to the taxable year under 
section 172,
    (4) The special deduction for Western Hemisphere trade corporations 
under section 922, and
    (5) Any capital loss carryback to the taxable year under section 
1212(a)(1).

A contribution by a corporation to a trust, chest, fund, or foundation 
organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, 
scientific, literary, or educational purposes or for the prevention of 
cruelty to children or animals is deductible only if the contribution is 
to be used in the United States or its possessions for those purposes. 
See section 170(c)(2). For the purposes of section 170, amounts excluded 
from the gross income of a corporation under section 114 (relating to 
sports programs conducted for the American National Red Cross) are not 
to be considered contributions or gifts. For reduction or disallowance 
of certain charitable, etc., deductions, see paragraphs (c)(2), (e), and 
(f) of Sec. 1.170-1.
    (b) Election by corporations on an accrual method. A corporation 
reporting its taxable income on an accrual method may elect to have a 
charitable contribution (as defined in section 170 (c)) considered as 
paid during the taxable year, if payment is actually made on or before 
the fifteenth day of the third month following the close of the year and 
if, during the year, the board of directors authorized the contribution. 
The election must be made at the time the return for the taxable year is 
filed, by reporting the contribution on the return. There shall be 
attached to the return when filed a written declaration that the 
resolution authorizing the contribution was adopted by the board of 
directors during the taxable year, and the declaration shall be verified 
by a statement signed by an officer authorized to sign the return that 
it is made under the penalties of perjury. There shall also be attached 
to the return when filed a copy of the resolution of the board of 
directors authorizing the contribution.

[[Page 38]]

    (c) Charitable contributions carryover of corporations--(1) 
Contributions made in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962. 
Subject to the rules set forth in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, 
any contributions made by a corporation in a taxable year (hereinafter 
in this paragraph referred to as the contribution year) subject to the 
Code beginning before January 1, 1962, in excess of the amount 
deductible in such contribution year under the 5-percent limitation of 
section 170(b)(2) are deductible in each of the two succeeding taxable 
years in order of time, but only to the extent of the lesser of the 
following amounts:
    (i) The excess of the maximum amount deductible for the succeeding 
year under the 5-percent limitation of section 170(b)(2) over the 
contributions made in that year; and
    (ii) In the case of the first taxable year succeeding the 
contribution year, the amount of the excess contributions; and, in the 
case of the second taxable year succeeding the contribution year, the 
portion of the excess contributions not deductible in the first 
succeeding taxable year.

The application of the rules in this subparagraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. A corporation which reports its income on the calendar year 
basis makes a charitable contribution of $10,000 in June 1961, 
anticipating taxable income for 1961 of $200,000. Its actual taxable 
income (without regard to any deduction for charitable contributions) 
for 1961 is only $50,000 and the charitable deduction for that year is 
limited to $2,500 (5 percent of $50,000). The excess charitable 
contribution not deductible in 1961 ($7,500) represents a carryover 
potentially available as a deduction in the two succeeding taxable 
years. The corporation has taxable income (without regard to any 
deduction for charitable contributions) of $150,000 in 1962 and makes a 
charitable contribution of $2,500 in that year. For 1962, the 
corporation may deduct as a charitable contribution the amount of $7,500 
(5 percent of $150,000). This amount consists first of the $2,500 
contribution made in 1962, and $5,000 of the $7,500 carried over from 
1961. The remaining $2,500 carried over from 1961 and not allowable as a 
deduction in 1962 because of the 5-percent limitation may be carried 
over to 1963. The corporation has taxable income (without regard to any 
deduction for charitable contributions) of $100,000 in 1963 and makes a 
charitable contribution of $3,000. For 1963, the corporation may deduct 
under section 170 the amount of $5,000 (5 percent of $100,000). This 
amount consists first of the $3,000 contributed in 1963, and $2,000 of 
the $2,500 carried over from 1961 to 1963. The remaining $500 of the 
carryover from 1961 is not allowable as a deduction in any year because 
of the 2-year limitation with respect to excess contributions made in 
taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962.

    (2) Contributions made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 
1961. Subject to the rules set forth in subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph, any contributions made by a corporation in a taxable year 
(hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the contribution year) 
beginning after December 31, 1961, in excess of the amount deductible in 
such contribution year under the 5-percent limitation of section 
170(b)(2) are deductible in each of the five succeeding taxable years in 
order of time, but only to the extent of the lesser of the following 
amounts:
    (i) The excess of the maximum amount deductible for such succeeding 
taxable year under the 5-percent limitation of section 170(b)(2) over 
the sum of the contributions made in that year plus the aggregate of the 
excess contributions which were made in taxable years before the 
contribution year and which are deductible under this paragraph in such 
succeeding taxable year; or
    (ii) In the case of the first taxable year succeeding the 
contribution year, the amount of the excess contributions, and in the 
case of the second, third, fourth, or fifth taxable years succeeding the 
contribution year, the portion of the excess contributions not 
deductible under this subparagraph for any taxable year intervening 
between the contribution year and such succeeding taxable year.

The application of the rules of this subparagraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. A corporation which reports its income on the calendar year 
basis makes a charitable contribution of $20,000 in June 1964, 
anticipating taxable income for 1964 of $400,000. Its actual taxable 
income (without regard to any deduction for charitable contributions) 
for 1964 is only $100,000 and the charitable deduction for that year is 
limited to $5,000 (5 percent of $100,000). The excess charitable 
contribution not deductible in

[[Page 39]]

1964 ($15,000) represents a carryover potentially available as a 
deduction in the five succeeding taxable years. The corporation has 
taxable income (without regard to any deduction for charitable 
contributions) of $150,000 in 1965 and makes a charitable contribution 
of $5,000 in that year. For 1965 the corporation may deduct as a 
charitable contribution the amount of $7,500 (5 percent of $150,000). 
This amount consists first of the $5,000 contribution made in 1965, and 
$2,500 carried over from 1964. The remaining $12,500 carried over from 
1964 and not allowable as a deduction for 1965 because of the 5-percent 
limitation may be carried over to 1966. The corporation has taxable 
income (without regard to any deduction for charitable contributions) of 
$200,000 in 1966 and makes a charitable contribution of $5,000. For 
1966, the corporation may deduct the amount of $10,000 (5 percent of 
$200,000). This amount consists first of the $5,000 contributed in 1966, 
and $5,000 of the $12,500 carried over from 1964 to 1966. The remaining 
$7,500 of the carryover from 1964 is available for purposes of computing 
the charitable contributions carryover from 1964 to 1967, 1968, and 
1969.

    (3) Reduction of excess contributions. A corporation having a net 
operating loss carryover (or carryovers) must apply the special rule of 
section 170(b)(3) and this subparagraph before computing under 
subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph the charitable contributions 
carryover for any taxable year subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954. In determining the amount of charitable contributions that may be 
deducted in accordance with the rules set forth in subparagraph (1) or 
(2) of this paragraph in taxable years succeeding the contribution year, 
the excess of contributions made by a corporation in the contribution 
year over the amount deductible in such year must be reduced by the 
amount by which such excess reduces taxable income (for purposes of 
determining the net operating loss carryover under the second sentence 
of section 172(b)(2) and increases a net operating loss carryover to a 
succeeding taxable year. Thus, if the excess of the contributions made 
in a taxable year over the amount deductible in the taxable year is 
utilized to reduce taxable income (under the provisions of section 
172(b)(2)) for such year, thereby serving to increase the amount of the 
net operating loss carryover to a succeeding year or years, no 
charitable contributions carryover will be allowed. If only a portion of 
the excess charitable contributions is so used, the charitable 
contributions carryover. will be reduced only to that extent. The 
application of the rules of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. A corporation which reports its income on the calendar year 
basis makes a charitable contribution of $10,000 during the taxable year 
1960. Its taxable income for 1960 is $80,000 (computed without regard to 
any net operating loss deduction and computed in accordance with section 
170(b)(2) without regard to any deduction for charitable contributions). 
The corporation has a net operating loss carryover from 1959 of $80,000. 
In the absence of the net operating loss deduction the corporation would 
have been allowed a deduction for charitable contributions of $4,000 (5 
percent of $80,000). After the application of the net operating loss 
deduction the corporation is allowed no deduction for charitable 
contributions, and there is a tentative charitable contribution 
carryover of $10,000. For purposes of determining the net operating loss 
carryover to 1961 the corporation computes its taxable income for its 
prior taxable year 1960 under section 172(b)(2) by deducting the $4,000 
charitable contribution. Thus, after the $80,000 net operating loss 
carryover is applied against the $76,000 of taxable income for 1960 
(computed in accordance with section 172(b)(2)), there remains a $4,000 
net operating loss carryover to 1961. Since the application of the net 
operating loss carryover of $80,000 from 1959 reduces the taxable income 
for 1960 to zero, no part of the $10,000 of charitable contributions in 
that year is deductible under section 170(b)(2). However, in determining 
the amount of the allowable charitable contributions carryover to the 
taxable years 1961 and 1962, the $10,000 must be reduced by the portion 
thereof ($4,000) which was used to reduce taxable income for 1960 (as 
computed for purposes of the second sentence of section 172(b)(2)) and 
which thereby served to increase the net operating loss carryover to 
1961 from zero to $4,000.

    (4) Year contribution is made. For purposes of this paragraph, 
contributions made by a corporation in a contribution year include 
contributions which, in accordance with the provisions of section 
170(a)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section, are considered as paid 
during such contribution year.
    (5) Effect of net operating loss carryback to contribution year. The 
amount of the excess contribution for a contribution year (computed as 
provided in this paragraph) shall not be increased because a net 
operating loss

[[Page 40]]

carryback is available as a deduction in the contribution year. In 
addition, in determining (under the provisions of section 172(b)(2)) the 
amount of the net operating loss for any year subsequent to the 
contribution year which is a carryback or carryover to taxable years 
succeeding the contribution year, the amount of contributions shall be 
limited to the maximum amount deductible under the 5-percent limitation 
of section 170(b)(2) (computed without regard to any net operating loss 
carryback or any of the modifications referred to in section 172(d)) for 
the contribution year.
    (6) Effect of net operating loss carryback to taxable years 
succeeding the contribution year. The amount of the charitable 
contribution from a preceding taxable year which is deductible (as 
provided in this paragraph) in a current taxable year (hereinafter 
referred to in this subparagraph as the ``deduction year'') shall not be 
reduced because a net operating loss carryback is available as a 
deduction in the deduction year. In addition, in determining (under the 
provisions of section 172(b)(2)) the amount of the net operating loss 
for any year subsequent to the deduction year which is a carryback or a 
carryover to taxable years succeeding the deduction year, the amount of 
contributions shall be limited to the maximum amount deductible under 
the 5-percent limitation of section 170(b)(2) (computed without regard 
to any net operating loss carryback or any of the modifications referred 
to in section 172(d)) for the deduction year.

Sec. 1.170A-1  Charitable, etc., contributions and gifts; allowance of deduction.

    (a) Allowance of deduction. Any charitable contribution, as defined 
in section 170(c), actually paid during the taxable year is allowable as 
a deduction in computing taxable income irrespective of the method of 
accounting employed or of the date on which the contribution is pledged. 
However, charitable contributions by corporations may under certain 
circumstances be deductible even though not paid during the taxable year 
as provided in section 170(a)(2) and Sec. 1.170A-11. For rules relating 
to recordkeeping and return requirements in support of deductions for 
charitable contributions (whether by an itemizing or nonitemizing 
taxpayer) see Sec. 1.170A-13. The deduction is subject to the 
limitations of section 170(b) and Sec. 1.170A-8 or Sec. 1.170A-11. 
Subject to the provisions of section 170(d) and Secs. 1.170A-10 and 
1.170A-11, certain excess charitable contributions made by individuals 
and corporations shall be treated as paid in certain succeeding taxable 
years. For provisions relating to direct charitable deductions under 
section 63 by nonitemizers, see section 63 (b)(1)(C) and (i) and section 
170(i). For rules relating to the detemination of, and the deduction 
for, amounts paid to maintain certain students as members of the 
taxpayer's household and treated under section 170(g) as paid for the 
use of an organization described in section 170(c) (2), (3), or (4), see 
Sec. 1.170A-2. For the reduction of any charitable contributions for 
interest on certain indebtedness, see section 170(f)(5) and Sec. 1.170A-
3. For a special rule relating to the computation of the amount of the 
deduction with respect to a charitable contribution of certain ordinary 
income or capital gain property, see section 170(e) and Secs. 1.170A-4 
and 1.170A-4A. For rules for postponing the time for deduction of a 
charitable contribution of a future interest in tangible personal 
property, see section 170(a)(3) and Sec. 1.170A-5. For rules with 
respect to transfers in trust and of partial interests in property, see 
section 170(e), section 170(f) (2) and (3), Secs. 1.170A-4, 1.170A-6, 
and 1.170A-7. For definition of the term section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization, see Sec. 1.170A-9. For valuation of a remainder interest 
in real property, see section 170(f)(4) and the regulations thereunder. 
The deduction for charitable contributions is subject to verification by 
the district director.
    (b) Time of making contribution. Ordinarily, a contribution is made 
at the time delivery is effected. The unconditional delivery or mailing 
of a check which subsequently clears in due course will constitute an 
effective contribution on the date of delivery or mailing. If a taxpayer 
unconditionally

[[Page 41]]

delivers or mails a properly endorsed stock certificate to a charitable 
donee or the donee's agent, the gift is completed on the date of 
delivery or, if such certificate is received in the ordinary course of 
the mails, on the date of mailing. If the donor delivers the stock 
certificate to his bank or broker as the donor's agent, or to the 
issuing corporation or its agent, for transfer into the name of the 
donee, the gift is completed on the date the stock is transferred on the 
books of the corporation. For rules relating to the date of payment of a 
contribution consisting of a future interest in tangible personal 
property, see section 170(a)(3) and Sec. 1.170A-5.
    (c) Value of a contribution in property. (1) If a charitable 
contribution is made in property other than money, the amount of the 
contribution is the fair market value of the property at the time of the 
contribution reduced as provided in section 170(e)(1) and paragraph (a) 
of Sec. 1.170A-4, or section 170(e)(3) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.170A-
4A.
    (2) The fair market value is the price at which the property would 
change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being 
under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge 
of relevant facts. If the contribution is made in property of a type 
which the taxpayer sells in the course of his business, the fair market 
value is the price which the taxpayer would have received if he had sold 
the contributed property in the usual market in which he customarily 
sells, at the time and place of the contribution and, in the case of a 
contribution of goods in quantity, in the quantity contributed. The 
usual market of a manufacturer or other producer consists of the 
wholesalers or other distributors to or through whom he customarily 
sells, but if he sells only at retail the usual market consists of his 
retail customers.
    (3) If a donor makes a charitable contribution of property, such as 
stock in trade, at a time when he could not reasonably have been 
expected to realize its usual selling price, the value of the gift is 
not the usual selling price but is the amount for which the quantity of 
property contributed would have been sold by the donor at the time of 
the contribution.
    (4) Any costs and expenses pertaining to the contributed property 
which were incurred in taxable years preceding the year of contribution 
and are properly reflected in the opening inventory for the year of 
contribution must be removed from inventory and are not a part of the 
cost of goods sold for purposes of determining gross income for the year 
of contribution. Any costs and expenses pertaining to the contributed 
property which are incurred in the year of contribution and would, under 
the method of accounting used, be properly reflected in the cost of 
goods sold for such year are to be treated as part of the costs of goods 
sold for such year. If costs and expenses incurred in producing or 
acquiring the contributed property are, under the method of accounting 
used, properly deducted under section 162 or other section of the Code, 
such costs and expenses will be allowed as deductions for the taxable 
year in which they are paid or incurred whether or not such year is the 
year of the contribution. Any such costs and expenses which are treated 
as part of the cost of goods sold for the year of contribution, and any 
such costs and expenses which are properly deducted under section 162 or 
other section of the Code, are not to be treated under any section of 
the Code as resulting in any basis for the contributed property. Thus, 
for example, the contributed property has no basis for purposes of 
determining under section 170(e)(1)(A) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.170A-
4 the amount of gain which would have been recognized if such property 
had been sold by the donor at its fair market value at the time of its 
contribution. The amount of any charitable contribution for the taxable 
year is not to be reduced by the amount of any costs or expenses 
pertaining to the contributed property which was properly deducted under 
section 162 or other section of the Code for any taxable year preceding 
the year of the contribution. This subparagraph applies only to property 
which was held by the taxpayer for sale in the course of a trade or 
business. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:


[[Page 42]]


    Example 1. In 1970, A, an individual using the calendar year as the 
taxable year and the accrual method of accounting, contributed to a 
church property from inventory having a fair market value of $600. The 
closing inventory at the end of 1969 properly included $400 of costs 
attributable to the acquisition of such property, and in 1969 A properly 
deducted under section 162 $50 of administrative and other expenses 
attributable to such property. Under section 170(e)(1)(A) and paragraph 
(a) of Sec. 1.170A-4, the amount of the charitable contribution allowed 
for 1970 is $400 ($600-[$600-$400]). Pursuant to this subparagraph, the 
cost of goods sold to be used in determining gross income for 1970 may 
not include the $400 which was included in opening inventory for that 
year.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that the 
contributed property was acquired in 1970 at a cost of $400. The $400 
cost of the property is included in determining the cost of goods sold 
for 1970, and $50 is allowed as a deduction for that year under section 
162. A is not allowed any deduction under section 170 for the 
contributed property, since under section 170(e)(1)(A) and paragraph (a) 
of Sec. 1.170A-4 the amount of the charitable contribution is reduced to 
zero ($600-[$600-$0]).
    Example 3. In 1970, B, an individual using the calendar year as the 
taxable year and the accrual method of accounting, contributed to a 
church property from inventory having a fair market value of $600. Under 
Sec. 1.471-3(c), the closing inventory at the end of 1969 properly 
included $450 costs attributable to the production of such property, 
including $50 of administrative and other indirect expenses which, under 
his method of accounting, was properly added to inventory rather than 
deducted as a business expense. Under section 170(e)(1)(A) and paragraph 
(a) of Sec. 1.170A-4, the amount of the charitable contribution allowed 
for 1970 is $450 ($600-[$600-$450]). Pursuant to this subparagraph, the 
cost of goods sold to be used in determining gross income for 1970 may 
not include the $450 which was included in opening inventory for that 
year.
    Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example (3) except that the 
contributed property was produced in 1970 at a cost of $450, including 
$50 of administrative and other indirect expenses. The $450 cost of the 
property is included in determining the cost of goods sold for 1970. B 
is not allowed any deduction under section 170 for the contributed 
property, since under section 170(e)(1)(A) and paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 1.170A-4 the amount of the charitable contribution is reduced to 
zero ($600-[$600-$0]).
    Example 5. In 1970, C, a farmer using the cash method of accounting 
and the calendar year as the taxable year, contributed to a church a 
quantity of grain which he had raised having a fair market value of 
$600. In 1969, C paid expenses of $450 in raising the property which he 
properly deducted for such year under section 162. Under section 
170(e)(1)(A) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.170A-4, the amount of the 
charitable contribution in 1970 is reduced to zero ($600-[$600-$0]). 
Accordingly, C is not allowed any deduction under section 170 for the 
contributed property.
    Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example (5) except that the 
$450 expenses incurred in raising the contributed property were paid in 
1970. The result is the same as in Example (5), except the amount of 
$450 is deductible under section 162 for 1970.

    (5) Transfers of property to an organization described in section 
170(c) which bear a direct relationship to the taxpayer's trade or 
business and which are made with a reasonable expectation of financial 
return commensurate with the amount of the transfer may constitute 
allowable deductions as trade or business expenses rather than as 
charitable contributions. See section 162 and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (d) Purchase of an annuity. (1) In the case of an annuity or portion 
thereof purchased from an organization described in section 170(c), 
there shall be allowed as a deduction the excess of the amount paid over 
the value at the time of purchase of the annuity or portion purchased.
    (2) The value of the annuity or portion is the value of the annuity 
determined in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iii) (b)(2) of 
Sec. 1.101-2.
    (3) For determining gain on any such transaction constituting a 
bargain sale, see section 1011(b) and Sec. 1.1011-2.
    (e) Transfers subject to a condition or power. If as of the date of 
a gift a transfer for charitable purposes is dependent upon the 
performance of some act or the happening of a precedent event in order 
that it might become effective, no deduction is allowable unless the 
possibility that the charitable transfer will not become effective is so 
remote as to be negligible. If an interest in property passes to, or is 
vested in, charity on the date of the gift and the interest would be 
defeated by the subsequent performance of some act or the happening of 
some event, the possibility of occurrence of which appears on the date 
of the gift to be so remote as to be negligible, the deduction is 
allowable. For example, A transfers land to

[[Page 43]]

a city government for as long as the land is used by the city for a 
public park. If on the date of the gift the city does plan to use the 
land for a park and the possibility that the city will not use the land 
for a public park is so remote as to be negligible, A is entitled to a 
deduction under section 170 for his charitable contribution.
    (f) Special rules applicable to certain contributions. (1) See 
section 14 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Pub. L. 90-542, 82 Stat. 
918) for provisions relating to the claim and allowance of the value of 
certain easements as a charitable contribution under section 170.
    (2) For treatment of gifts accepted by the Secretary of State or the 
Secretary of Commerce, for the purpose of organizing and holding an 
international conference to negotiate a Patent Corporation Treaty, as 
gifts to or for the use of the United States, see section 3 of joint 
resolution of December 24, 1969 (Pub. L. 91-160, 83 Stat. 443).
    (3) For treatment of gifts accepted by the Secretary of the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, for the purpose of aiding 
or facilitating the work of the Department, as gifts to or for the use 
of the United States, see section 7(k) of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535), as added by section 905 of Pub. 
L. 91-609 (84 Stat. 1809).
    (g) Contributions of services. No deduction is allowable under 
section 170 for a contribution of services. However, unreimbursed 
expenditures made incident to the rendition of services to an 
organization contributions to which are deductible may constitute a 
deductible contribution. For example, the cost of a uniform without 
general utility which is required to be worn in performing donated 
services is deductible. Similarly, out-of-pocket transportation expenses 
necessarily incurred in performing donated services are deductible. 
Reasonable expenditures for meals and lodging necessarily incurred while 
away from home in the course of performing donated services also are 
deductible. For the purposes of this paragraph, the phrase while away 
from home has the same meaning as that phrase is used for purposes of 
section 162 and the regulations thereunder.
    (h) Payment in exchange for consideration--(1) Burden on taxpayer to 
show that all or part of payment is a charitable contribution or gift. 
No part of a payment that a taxpayer makes to or for the use of an 
organization described in section 170(c) that is in consideration for 
(as defined in Sec. 1.170A-13(f)(6)) goods or services (as defined in 
Sec. 1.170A-13(f)(5)) is a contribution or gift within the meaning of 
section 170(c) unless the taxpayer--
    (i) Intends to make a payment in an amount that exceeds the fair 
market value of the goods or services; and
    (ii) Makes a payment in an amount that exceeds the fair market value 
of the goods or services.
    (2) Limitation on amount deductible--(i) In general. The charitable 
contribution deduction under section 170(a) for a payment a taxpayer 
makes partly in consideration for goods or services may not exceed the 
excess of--
    (A) The amount of any cash paid and the fair market value of any 
property (other than cash) transferred by the taxpayer to an 
organization described in section 170(c); over
    (B) The fair market value of the goods or services the organization 
provides in return.
    (ii) Special rules. For special limits on the deduction for 
charitable contributions of ordinary income and capital gain property, 
see section 170(e) and Secs. 1.170A-4 and 1.170A-4A.
    (3) Certain goods or services disregarded. For purposes of section 
170(a) and paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section, goods or 
services described in Sec. 1.170A-13(f)(8)(i) or Sec. 1.170A-13(f)(9)(i) 
are disregarded.
    (4) Donee estimates of the value of goods or services may be treated 
as fair market value--(i) In general. For purposes of section 170(a), a 
taxpayer may rely on either a contemporaneous written acknowledgment 
provided under section 170(f)(8) and Sec. 1.170A-13(f) or a written 
disclosure statement provided under section 6115 for the fair market 
value of any goods or services provided to the taxpayer by the donee 
organization.
    (ii) Exception. A taxpayer may not treat an estimate of the value of 
goods or services as their fair market value if the taxpayer knows, or 
has reason to

[[Page 44]]

know, that such treatment is unreasonable. For example, if a taxpayer 
knows, or has reason to know, that there is an error in an estimate 
provided by an organization described in section 170(c) pertaining to 
goods or services that have a readily ascertainable value, it is 
unreasonable for the taxpayer to treat the estimate as the fair market 
value of the goods or services. Similarly, if a taxpayer is a dealer in 
the type of goods or services provided in consideration for the 
taxpayer's payment and knows, or has reason to know, that the estimate 
is in error, it is unreasonable for the taxpayer to treat the estimate 
as the fair market value of the goods or services.
    (5) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this 
paragraph (h).

    Example 1. Certain goods or services disregarded. Taxpayer makes a 
$50 payment to Charity B, an organization described in section 170(c), 
in exchange for a family membership. The family membership entitles 
Taxpayer and members of Taxpayer's family to certain benefits. These 
benefits include free admission to weekly poetry readings, discounts on 
merchandise sold by B in its gift shop or by mail order, and invitations 
to special events for members only, such as lectures or informal 
receptions. When B first offers its membership package for the year, B 
reasonably projects that each special event for members will have a cost 
to B, excluding any allocable overhead, of $5 or less per person 
attending the event. Because the family membership benefits are 
disregarded pursuant to Sec. 1.170A-13(f)(8)(i), Taxpayer may treat the 
$50 payment as a contribution or gift within the meaning of section 
170(c), regardless of Taxpayer's intent and whether or not the payment 
exceeds the fair market value of the goods or services. Furthermore, any 
charitable contribution deduction available to Taxpayer may be 
calculated without regard to the membership benefits.
    Example 2. Treatment of good faith estimate at auction as the fair 
market value. Taxpayer attends an auction held by Charity C, an 
organization described in section 170(c). Prior to the auction, C 
publishes a catalog that meets the requirements for a written disclosure 
statement under section 6115(a) (including C's good faith estimate of 
the value of items that will be available for bidding). A representative 
of C gives a copy of the catalog to each individual (including Taxpayer) 
who attends the auction. Taxpayer notes that in the catalog C's estimate 
of the value of a vase is $100. Taxpayer has no reason to doubt the 
accuracy of this estimate. Taxpayer successfully bids and pays $500 for 
the vase. Because Taxpayer knew, prior to making her payment, that the 
estimate in the catalog was less than the amount of her payment, 
Taxpayer satisfies the requirement of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this 
section. Because Taxpayer makes a payment in an amount that exceeds that 
estimate, Taxpayer satisfies the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of 
this section. Taxpayer may treat C's estimate of the value of the vase 
as its fair market value in determining the amount of her charitable 
contribution deduction.
    Example 3. Good faith estimate not in error. Taxpayer makes a $200 
payment to Charity D, an organization described in section 170(c). In 
return for Taxpayer's payment, D gives Taxpayer a book that Taxpayer 
could buy at retail prices typically ranging from $18 to $25. D provides 
Taxpayer with a good faith estimate, in a written disclosure statement 
under section 6115(a), of $20 for the value of the book. Because the 
estimate is within the range of typical retail prices for the book, the 
estimate contained in the written disclosure statement is not in error. 
Although Taxpayer knows that the book is sold for as much as $25, 
Taxpayer may treat the estimate of $20 as the fair market value of the 
book in determining the amount of his charitable contribution deduction.

    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Exceptions and other rules. (1) The provisions of section 170 do 
not apply to contributions by an estate; nor do they apply to a trust 
unless the trust is a private foundation which, pursuant to section 
642(c)(6) and Sec. 1.642(c)-4, is allowed a deduction under section 170 
subject to the provisions applicable to individuals.
    (2) No deduction shall be allowed under section 170 for a charitable 
contribution to or for the use of an organization or trust described in 
section 508(d) or 4948(c)(4), subject to the conditions specified in 
such sections and the regulations thereunder.
    (3) For disallowance of deductions for contributions to or for the 
use of communist controlled organizations, see section 11(a) of the 
Internal Security Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. 790).
    (4) For denial of deductions for charitable contributions as trade 
or business expenses and rules with respect to treatment of payments to 
organizations other than those described in section 170(c), see section 
162 and the regulations thereunder.

[[Page 45]]

    (5) No deduction shall be allowed under section 170 for amounts paid 
to an organization:
    (i) Which is disqualified for tax exemption under section 501(c)(3) 
by reason of attempting to influence legislation, or
    (ii) Which participates in, or intervenes in (including the 
publishing or distribution of statements), any political campaign on 
behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office.
For purposes of determining whether an organization is attempting to 
influence legislation or is engaging in political activities, see 
sections 501(c)(3), 501(h), 4911 and the regulations thereunder.
    (6) No deduction shall be allowed under section 170 for expenditures 
for lobbying purposes, the promotion or defeat of legislation, etc. See 
also the regulations under sections 162 and 4945.
    (7) No deduction for charitable contributions is allowed in 
computing the taxable income of a common trust fund or of a partnership. 
See sections 584(d)(3) and 703(a)(2)(D). However, a partner's 
distributive share of charitable contributions actually paid by a 
partnership during its taxable year may be allowed as a deduction in the 
partner's separate return for his taxable year with or within which the 
taxable year of the partnership ends, to the extent that the aggregate 
of his share of the partnership contributions and his own contributions 
does not exceed the limitations in section 170(b).
    (8) For charitable contributions paid by a nonresident alien 
individual or a foreign corporation, see Sec. 1.170A-4(b)(5) and 
sections 873, 876, 877, and 882(c), and the regulations thereunder.
    (9) For charitable contributions paid by a citizen of the United 
States or a domestic corporation entitled to the benefits of section 931 
(relating to income from sources within possessions of the United 
States), see section 931(d) and the regulations thereunder.
    (10) For carryover of excess charitable contributions in certain 
corporate acquisitions, see section 381(c)(19) and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (11) No deduction shall be allowed under section 170 for out-of-
pocket expenditures on behalf of an eligible organization (within the 
meaning of Sec. 1.501(h)-2(b)(1)) if the expenditure is made in 
connection with influencing legislation (within the meaning of section 
501(c)(3) or Sec. 56.4911-2), or in connection with the payment of the 
organization's tax liability under section 4911. For the treatment of 
similar expenditures on behalf of other organizations see paragraph 
(h)(6) of this section.
    (k) Effective date. In general this section applies to contributions 
made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969. Paragraph 
(j)(11) of this section, however, applies only to out-of-pocket 
expenditures made in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976. In 
addition, paragraph (h) of this section applies only to payments made on 
or after December 16, 1996. However, taxpayers may rely on the rules of 
paragraph (h) of this section for payments made on or after January 1, 
1994.

Sec. 1.170A-2   Amounts paid to maintain certain students as members of the taxpayer's household.

    (a) In general. (1) The term charitable contributions includes 
amounts paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year to maintain certain 
students as members of his household which, under the provisions of 
section 170(h) and this section, are treated as amounts paid for the use 
of an organization described in section 170(c) (2), (3), or (4), and 
such amounts, to the extent they do not exceed the limitations under 
section 170(h)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section, are contributions 
deductible under section 170. In order for such amounts to be so 
treated, the student must be an individual who is neither a dependent 
(as defined in section 152) of the taxpayer nor related to the taxpayer 
in a manner described in any of the paragraphs (1) through (8) of 
section 152(a), and such individual must be a member of the taxpayer's 
household

[[Page 46]]

pursuant to a written agreement between the taxpayer and an organization 
described in section 170(c) (2), (3), or (4) to implement a program of 
the organization to provide educational opportunities for pupils or 
students placed in private homes by such organization. Furthermore, such 
amounts must be paid to maintain such individual during the period in 
the taxable year he is a member of the taxpayer's household and is a 
full-time pupil or student in the 12th or any lower grade at an 
educational institution, as defined in section 151(e)(4) and Sec. 1.151-
3, located in the United States. Amounts paid outside of such period, 
but within the taxable year, for expenses necessary for the maintenance 
of the student during the period will qualify for the charitable 
contributions deduction if the other limitation requirements of the 
section are met.
    (2) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, amounts 
treated as charitable contributions include only those amounts actually 
paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year which are directly 
attributable to the maintenance of the student while he is a member of 
the taxpayer's household and is attending an educational institution on 
a full-time basis. This would include amounts paid to insure the well-
being of the individual and to carry out the purpose for which the 
individual was placed in the taxpayer's home. For example, a deduction 
under section 170 would be allowed for amounts paid for books, tuition, 
food, clothing, transportation, medical and dental care, and recreation 
for the individual. Amounts treated as charitable contributions under 
this section do not include amounts which the taxpayer would have 
expended had the student not been in the household. They would not 
include, for example, amounts paid in connection with the taxpayer's 
home for taxes, insurance, interest on a mortgage, repairs, etc. 
Moreover, such amounts do not include any depreciation sustained by the 
taxpayer in maintaining such student or students in his household, nor 
do they include the value of any services rendered on behalf of such 
student or students by the taxpayer or any member of the taxpayer's 
household.
    (3) For purposes of section 170(h) and this section, an individual 
will be considered to be a full-time pupil or student at an educational 
institution only if he is enrolled for a course of study prescribed for 
a full-time student at such institution and is attending classes on a 
full-time basis. Nevertheless, such individual may be absent from school 
due to special circumstances and still be considered to be in full-time 
attendance. Periods during the regular school term when the school is 
closed for holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, and for periods 
between semesters are treated as periods during which the pupil or 
student is in full-time attendance at the school. Also, absences during 
the regular school term due to illness of such individual shall not 
prevent him from being considered as a full-time pupil or student. 
Similarly, absences from the taxpayer's household due to special 
circumstances will not disqualify the student as a member of the 
household. Summer vacations between regular school terms are not 
considered periods of school attendance.
    (4) When claiming a deduction for amounts described in section 
170(h) and this section, the taxpayer must submit with his return a copy 
of his agreement with the organization sponsoring the individual placed 
in the taxpayer's household, together with a summary of the various 
items for which amounts were paid to maintain such individual, and a 
statement as to the date the individual became a member of the household 
and the period of his full-time attendance at school and the name and 
location of such school. Substantiation of amounts claimed must be 
supported by adequate records of the amounts actually paid. Due to the 
nature of certain items, such as food, a record of amount spent for all 
members of the household, with an equal portion thereof allocated to 
each member, will be acceptable.
    (b) Limitations. Section 170(h) and this section shall apply to 
amounts paid during the taxable year only to the extent that the amounts 
paid in maintaining each pupil or student do not exceed $50 multiplied 
by the number of full calendar months in the taxable

[[Page 47]]

year that the pupil or student is maintained in accordance with the 
provisions of this section. For purposes of such limitation if 15 or 
more days of a calendar month fall within the period to which the 
maintenance of such pupil or student relates, such month is considered 
as a full calendar month. To the extent that such amounts qualify as 
charitable contributions under section 170(c), the aggregate of such 
amounts plus other contributions made during the taxable year for the 
use of an organization described in section 170(c) is deductible under 
section 170 subject to the limitation provided in section 170(b)(1)(B) 
and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.170A-8.
    (c) Compensation or reimbursement. Amounts paid during the taxable 
year to maintain a pupil or student as a member of the taxpayer's 
household as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, shall not be 
taken into account under section 170(h) and this section, if the 
taxpayer receives any money or other property as compensation or 
reimbursement for any portion of such amounts. The taxpayer will not be 
denied the benefits of section 170(h) if he prepays an extraordinary or 
nonrecurring expense such as a hospital bill or vacation trip, at the 
request of the individual's parents or the sponsoring organization and 
is reimbursed for such prepayment. The value of services performed by 
the pupil or student in attending to ordinary chores of the household 
will generally not be considered to constitute compensation or 
reimbursement. However, if the pupil or student is taken into the 
taxpayer's household to replace a former employee of the taxpayer or 
gratuitously to perform substantial services for the taxpayer, the facts 
and circumstances may warrant a conclusion that the taxpayer received 
reimbursement for maintaining the pupil or student.
    (d) No other amount allowed as deduction. Except to the extent that 
amounts described in section 170(h) and this section are treated as 
charitable contributions under section 170(c) and, therefore, deductible 
under section 170(a), no deduction is allowed for any amount paid to 
maintain an individual, as a member of the taxpayer's household, in 
accordance with the provisions of section 170(h) and this section.
    (e) Illustrations. The application of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. The X organization is an organization described in 
section 170(c)(2) and is engaged in a program under which a number of 
European children are placed in the homes of U.S. residents in order to 
further the children's high school education. In accordance with 
paragraph (a) of this section, the taxpayer, A, who reports his income 
on the calendar year basis, agreed with X to take two of the children, 
and they were placed in the taxpayer's home on January 2, 1970, where 
they remained until January 21, 1971, during which time they were fully 
maintained by the taxpayer. The children enrolled at the local high 
school for the full course of study prescribed for 10th grade students 
and attended the school on a full-time basis for the spring semester 
starting January 18, 1970, and ending June 3, 1970, and for the fall 
semester starting September 1, 1970, and ending January 13, 1971. The 
total cost of food paid by A in 1970 for himself, his wife, and the two 
children amounted to $1,920, or $40 per month for each member of the 
household. Since the children were actually full-time students for only 
8 1/2 months during 1970, the amount paid for food for each child during 
that period amounted to $340. Other amounts paid during the 8 1/2 -month 
period for each child for laundry, lights, water, recreation, and school 
supplies amounted to $160. Thus, the amounts treated under section 
170(h) and this section as paid for the use of X would, with respect to 
each child, total $500 ($340+$160), or a total for both children of 
$1,000, subject to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section. 
Since, for purposes of such limitations, the children were full-time 
students for only 8 full calendar months during 1970 (less than 15 days 
in January 1970), the taxpayer may treat only $800 as a charitable 
contribution made in 1970, that is, $50 multiplied by the 8 full 
calendar months, or $400 paid for the maintenance of each child. Neither 
the excess payments nor amounts paid to maintain the children during the 
period before school opened and for the period in summer between regular 
school terms is taken into account by reason of section 170(h). Also, 
because the children were full-time students for less than 15 days in 
January 1971 (although maintained in the taxpayer's household for 21 
days), amounts paid to maintain the children during 1971 would not 
qualify as a charitable contribution.
    Example 2. A religious organization described in section 170(c)(2) 
has a program for providing educational opportunities for children it 
places in private homes. In order to

[[Page 48]]

implement the program, the taxpayer, H, who resides with his wife, son, 
and daughter of high school age in a town in the United States, signs an 
agreement with the organization to maintain a girl sponsored by the 
organization as a member of his household while the child attends the 
local high school for the regular 1970-71 school year. The child is a 
full-time student at the school during the school year starting 
September 6, 1970, and ending June 6, 1971, and is a member of the 
taxpayer's household during that period. Although the taxpayer pays $200 
during the school period falling in 1970, and $240 during the school 
period falling in 1971, to maintain the child, he cannot claim either 
amount as a charitable contribution because the child's parents, from 
time to time during the school year, send butter, eggs, meat, and 
vegetables to H to help defray the expenses of maintaining the child. 
This is considered property received as reimbursement under paragraph 
(c) of this section. Had her parents not contributed the food, the fact 
that the child, in addition to the normal chores she shared with the 
taxpayer's daughter, such as cleaning their own rooms and helping with 
the shopping and cooking, was responsible for the family laundry and for 
the heavy cleaning of the entire house while the taxpayer's daughter had 
no comparable responsibilities would also preclude a claim for a 
charitable contributions deduction. These substantial gratuitous 
services are considered property received as reimbursement under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    Example 3. A taxpayer resides with his wife in a city in the eastern 
United States. He agrees, in writing, with a fraternal society described 
in section 170(c)(4) to accept a child selected by the society for 
maintenance by him as a member of his household during 1971 in order 
that the child may attend the local grammar school as a part of the 
society's program to provide elementary education for certain children 
selected by it. The taxpayer maintains the child, who has as his 
principal place of abode the home of the taxpayer, and is a member of 
the taxpayer's household, during the entire year 1971. The child is a 
full-time student at the local grammar school for 9 full calendar months 
during the year. Under the agreement, the society pays the taxpayer $30 
per month to help maintain the child. Since the $30 per month is 
considered as compensation or reimbursement to the taxpayer for some 
portion of the maintenance paid on behalf of the child, no amounts paid 
with respect to such maintenance can be treated as amounts paid in 
accordance with section 170(h). In the absence of the $30 per month 
payments, if the child qualifies as a dependent of the taxpayer under 
section 152(a)(9), that fact would also prevent the maintenance payments 
from being treated as charitable contributions paid for the use of the 
fraternal society.

    (f) Effective date. This section applies only to contributions paid 
in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.

Sec. 1.170A-3   Reduction of charitable contribution for interest on certain indebtedness.

    (a) In general. Section 170(f)(5) requires that the amount of a 
charitable contribution be reduced for certain interest to the extent 
necessary to avoid the deduction of the same amount both as an interest 
deduction under section 163 and as a deduction for charitable 
contributions under section 170. The reduction is to be determined in 
accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Interest attributable to postcontribution period. In determining 
the amount to be taken into account as a charitable contribution for 
purposes of section 170, the amount determined without regard to section 
170(f)(5) or this section shall be reduced by the amount of interest 
which has been paid, or is to be paid, by the taxpayer, which is 
attributable to any liability connected with the contribution, and which 
is attributable to any period of time after the making of the 
contribution. The deduction otherwise allowable for charitable 
contributions under section 170 is required to be reduced pursuant to 
section 170(f)(5) and this section only if, in connection with a 
charitable contribution, a liability is assumed by the recipient of the 
contribution or by any other person or if the charitable contribution is 
of property which is subject to a liability. Thus, if a charitable 
contribution is made in property and the transfer is conditioned upon 
the assumption of a liability by the donee or by some other person, the 
contribution must be reduced by the amount of any interest which has 
been paid, or will be paid, by the taxpayer, which is attributable to 
the liability, and which is attributable to any period after the making 
of the contribution. The adjustment referred to in this paragraph must 
also be made where the contributed property is subject to a liability 
and the value of the property reflects the payment by the

[[Page 49]]

donor of interest with respect to a period of time after the making of 
the contribution.
    (c) Interest attributable to precontribution period. If, in 
connection with the charitable contribution of a bond, a liability is 
assumed by the recipient or by any other person, or if the bond is 
subject to a liability, then, in determining the amount to be taken into 
account as a charitable contribution under section 170, the amount 
determined without regard to section 170(f)(5) and this section shall, 
without regard to whether any reduction may be required by paragraph (b) 
of this section, also be reduced for interest which has been paid, or is 
to be paid, by the taxpayer on indebtedness incurred or continued to 
purchase or carry such bond, and which is attributable to any period 
before the making of the contribution. However, the reduction referred 
to in this paragraph shall be made only to the extent that such 
reduction does not exceed the interest (including bond discount and 
other interest equivalent) receivable on the bond, and attributable to 
any period before the making of the contribution which is not, by reason 
of the taxpayer's method of accounting, includible in the taxpayer's 
gross income for any taxable year. For purposes of section 170(f)(5) and 
this section the term bond means any bond, debenture, note, or 
certificate or other evidence of indebtedness.
    (d) Illustrations. The application of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. On January 1, 1970, A, a cash basis taxpayer using the 
calendar year as the taxable year, contributed to a charitable 
organization real estate having a fair market value and adjusted basis 
of $10,000. In connection with the contribution the charitable 
organization assumed an indebtedness of $8,000 which A had incurred. On 
December 31, 1969, A prepaid one year's interest on that indebtedness 
for 1970, amounting to $960, and took an interest deduction of $960 for 
such amount. The amount of the gift, determined without regard to this 
section, is $2,960 ($10,000 less $8,000, the outstanding indebtedness, 
plus $960, the amount of prepaid interest). In determining the amount of 
the deduction for the charitable contribution, the value of the gift 
($2,960) must be reduced by $960 to eliminate from the computation of 
such deduction that portion thereof for which A has been allowed an 
interest deduction.
    Example 2. (a) On January 1, 1970, B, an individual using the cash 
receipts and disbursements method of accounting, purchased for $9,950 a 
5 1/2 percent $10,000, 20-year M Corporation bond, the interest on which 
was payable semiannually on June 30 and December 31. The M Corporation 
had issued the bond on January 1, 1960, at a discount of $720 from the 
principal amount. On December 1, 1970, B donated the bond to a 
charitable organization, and, in connection with the contribution, the 
charitable organization assumed an indebtedness of $7,000 which B had 
incurred to purchase and carry the bond.
    (b) During the calendar year 1970 B paid accrued interest of $330 on 
the indebtedness for the period from January 1, 1970, to December 1, 
1970, and has taken an interest deduction of $330 for such amount. No 
portion of the bond discount of $36 a year ($720 divided by 20 years) 
has been included in B's income, and of the $550 of annual interest 
receivable on the bond, he included in income only the June 30, 1970, 
payment of $275.
    (c) The market value of the bond on December 1, 1970, was $9,902. 
Such value includes $229 of interest receivable which had accrued from 
July 1 to December 1, 1970.
    (d) The amount of the charitable contribution determined without 
regard to this section is $2,902 ($9,902, the value of the property on 
the date of gift, less $7,000, the amount of the liability assumed by 
the charitable organization). In determining the amount of the allowable 
deduction for charitable contributions, the value of the gift ($2,902) 
must be reduced to eliminate from the deduction that portion thereof for 
which B has been allowed an interest deduction. Although the amount of 
such interest deduction was $330, the reduction required by this section 
is limited to $262, since the reduction is not in excess of the amount 
of interest income on the bond ($229 of accrued interest plus $33, the 
amount of bond discount attributable to the 11-month period B held the 
bond).

    (e) Effective date. This section applies only to contributions paid 
in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.

Sec. 1.170A-4   Reduction in amount of charitable contributions of certain appreciated property.

    (a) Amount of reduction. Section 170(e)(1) requires that the amount 
of the charitable contribution which would be taken into account under 
section 170(a) without regard to section 170(e) shall be reduced before 
applying

[[Page 50]]

the percentage limitations under section 170(b):
    (1) In the case of a contribution by an individual or by a 
corporation of ordinary income property, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section, by the amount of gain (hereinafter in this section 
referred to as ordinary income) which would have been recognized as gain 
which is not long-term capital gain if the property had been sold by the 
donor at its fair market value at the time of its contribution to the 
charitable organization,
    (2) In the case of a contribution by an individual of section 170(e) 
capital gain property, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
by 50 percent of the amount of gain (hereinafter in this section 
referred to as long-term capital gain) which would have been recognized 
as long-term capital gain if the property had been sold by the donor at 
its fair market value at the time of its contribution to the charitable 
organization, and
    (3) In the case of a contribution by a corporation of section 170(e) 
capital gain property, as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
by 62 1/2 percent of the amount of gain (hereinafter in this section 
referred to as long-term capital gain) which would have been recognized 
as long-term capital gain if the property had been sold by the donor at 
its fair market value at the time of its contribution to the charitable 
organization.

Section 170(e)(1) and this paragraph do not apply to reduce the amount 
of the charitable contribution where, by reason of the transfer of the 
contributed property, ordinary income or capital gain is recognized by 
the donor in the same taxable year in which the contribution is made. 
Thus, where income or gain is recognized under section 453(d) upon the 
transfer of an installment obligation to a charitable organization, or 
under section 454(b) upon the transfer of an obligation issued at a 
discount to such an organization, or upon the assignment of income to 
such an organization, section 170(e)(1) and this paragraph do not apply 
if recognition of the income or gain occurs in the same taxable year in 
which the contribution is made. Section 170(e)(1) and this paragraph 
apply to a charitable contribution of an interest in ordinary income 
property or section 170(e) capital gain property which is described in 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-6, or paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-7. For 
purposes of applying section 170(e)(1) and this paragraph it is 
immaterial whether the charitable contribution is made ``to'' the 
charitable organization or whether it is made ``for the use of'' the 
charitable organization. See Sec. 1.170A-8(a)(2).
    (b) Definitions and other rules. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Ordinary income property. The term ordinary income property 
means property any portion of the gain on which would not have been long 
term capital gain if the property had been sold by the donor at its fair 
market value at the time of its contribution to the charitable 
organization. Such term includes, for example, property held by the 
donor primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his 
trade or business, a work of art created by the donor, a manuscript 
prepared by the donor, letters and memorandums prepared by or for the 
donor, a capital asset held by the donor for not more than 1 year (6 
months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable 
years beginning in 1977), and stock described in section 306(a), 341(a), 
or 1248(a) to the extent that, after applying such section, gain on its 
disposition would not have been long-term capital gain. The term does 
not include an income interest in respect of which a deduction is 
allowed under section 170(f)(2)(B) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.170A-6.
    (2) Section 170(e) capital gain property. The term section 170(e) 
capital gain property means property any portion of the gain on which 
would have been treated as long-term capital gain if the property had 
been sold by the donor at its fair market value at the time of its 
contribution to the charitable organization and which:
    (i) Is contributed to or for the use of a private foundation, as 
defined in section 509(a) and the regulations thereunder, other than a 
private foundation described in section 170(b)(1)(E),
    (ii) Constitutes tangible personal property contributed to or for 
the use of a charitable organization, other than a private foundation to 
which

[[Page 51]]

subdivision (i) of this subparagraph applies, which is put to an 
unrelated use by the charitable organization within the meaning of 
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, or
    (iii) Constitutes property not described in subdivision (i) or (ii) 
of this subparagraph which is 30-percent capital gain property to which 
an election under paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.170A-8 applies.

For purposes of this subparagraph a fixture which is intended to be 
severed from real property shall be treated as tangible personal 
property.
    (3) Unrelated use--(i) In general. The term unrelated use means a 
use which is unrelated to the purpose or function constituting the basis 
of the charitable organization's exemption under section 501 or, in the 
case of a contribution of property to a governmental unit, the use of 
such property by such unit for other than exclusively public purposes. 
For example, if a painting contributed to an educational institution is 
used by that organization for educational purposes by being placed in 
its library for display and study by art students, the use is not an 
unrelated use; but if the painting is sold and the proceeds used by the 
organization for educational purposes, the use of the property is an 
unrelated use. If furnishings contributed to a charitable organization 
are used by it in its offices and buildings in the course of carrying 
out its functions, the use of the property is not an unrelated use. If a 
set or collection of items of tangible personal property is contributed 
to a charitable organization or governmental unit, the use of the set or 
collection is not an unrelated use if the donee sells or otherwise 
disposes of only an insubstantial portion of the set or collection. The 
use by a trust of tangible personal property contributed to it for the 
benefit of a charitable organization is an unrelated use if the use by 
the trust is one which would have been unrelated if made by the 
charitable organization.
    (ii) Proof of use. For purposes of applying subparagraph (2)(ii) of 
this paragraph, a taxpayer who makes a charitable contribution of 
tangible personal property to or for the use of a charitable 
organization or governmental unit may treat such property as not being 
put to an unrelated use by the donee if:
    (a) He establishes that the property is not in fact put to an 
unrelated use by the donee, or
    (b) At the time of the contribution or at the time the contribution 
is treated as made, it is reasonable to anticipate that the property 
will not be put to an unrelated use by the donee. In the case of a 
contribution of tangible personal property to or for the use of a 
museum, if the object donated is of a general type normally retained by 
such museum or other museums for museum purposes, it will be reasonable 
for the donor to anticipate, unless he has actual knowledge to the 
contrary, that the object will not be put to an unrelated use by the 
donee, whether or not the object is later sold or exchanged by the 
donee.
    (4) Property used in trade or business. For purposes of applying 
subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, property which is used in 
the trade or business, as defined in section 1231(b), shall be treated 
as a capital asset, except that any gain in respect of such property 
which would have been recognized if the property had been sold by the 
donor at its fair market value at the time of its contribution to the 
charitable organization shall be treated as ordinary income to the 
extent that such gain would have constituted ordinary income by reason 
of the application of section 617 (d)(1), 1245(a), 1250(a), 1251(c), 
1252(a), or 1254(a).
    (5) Nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations. The 
reduction in the case of a nonresident alien individual or a foreign 
corporation shall be determined by taking into account the gain which 
would have been recognized and subject to tax under chapter 1 of the 
Code if the property had been sold or disposed of within the United 
States by the donor at its fair market value at the time of its 
contribution to the charitable organization. However, the amount of such 
gain which would have been subject to tax under section 871(a) or 881 
(relating to gain not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade 
or business within the United States) if there had been a sale or other 
disposition within the United States shall be treated as long-term 
capital gain.

[[Page 52]]

Thus, a charitable contribution by a nonresident alien individual or a 
foreign corporation of property the sale or other disposition of which 
within the United States would have resulted in gain subject to tax 
under section 871(a) or 881 will be reduced only as provided in section 
170(e)(1)(B) and paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section, but only if 
the property contributed is described in subdivision (i), (ii), or (iii) 
of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. A charitable contribution by a 
nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation of property the 
sale or other disposition of which within the United States would have 
resulted in gain subject to tax under section 871(a) or 881 will in no 
case be reduced under section 170(e)(1)(A) and paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section.
    (c) Allocation of basis and gain--(1) In general. Except as provided 
in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph:
    (i) If a taxpayer makes a charitable contribution of less than his 
entire interest in appreciated property, whether or not the transfer is 
made in trust, as, for example, in the case of a transfer of appreciated 
property to a pooled income fund described in section 642(c)(5) and 
Sec. 1.642(c)-5, and is allowed a deduction under section 170 for a 
portion of the fair market value of such property, then for purposes of 
applying the reduction rules of section 170(e)(1) and this section to 
the contributed portion of the property the taxpayer's adjusted basis in 
such property at the time of the contribution shall be allocated under 
section 170(e)(2) between the contributed portion of the property and 
the noncontributed portion.
    (ii) The adjusted basis of the contributed portion of the property 
shall be that portion of the adjusted basis of the entire property which 
bears the same ratio to the total adjusted basis as the fair market 
value of the contributed portion of the property bears to the fair 
market value of the entire property.
    (iii) The ordinary income and the long-term capital gain which shall 
be taken into account in applying section 170(e)(1) and paragraph (a) of 
this section to the contributed portion of the property shall be the 
amount of gain which would have been recognized as ordinary income and 
long-term capital gain if such contributed portion had been sold by the 
donor at its fair market value at the time of its contribution to the 
charitable organization.
    (2) Bargain sale. (i) Section 1011(b) and Sec. 1.1011-2 apply to 
bargain sales of property to charitable organizations. For purposes of 
applying the reduction rules of section 170(e)(1) and this section to 
the contributed portion of the property in the case of a bargain sale, 
there shall be allocated under section 1011(b) to the contributed 
portion of the property that portion of the adjusted basis of the entire 
property that bears the same ratio to the total adjusted basis as the 
fair market value of the contributed portion of the property bears to 
the fair market value of the entire property. For purposes of applying 
section 170(e)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section to the contributed 
portion of the property in such a case, there shall be allocated to the 
contributed portion the amount of gain that is not recognized on the 
bargain sale but that would have been recognized if such contributed 
portion had been sold by the donor at its fair market value at the time 
of its contribution to the charitable organization.
    (ii) The term bargain sale, as used in this subparagraph, means a 
transfer of property which is in part a sale or exchange of the property 
and in part a charitable contribution, as defined in section 170(c), of 
the property.
    (3) Ratio of ordinary income and capital gain. For purposes of 
applying subparagraphs (1)(iii) and (2)(i) of this paragraph, the amount 
of ordinary income (or long-term capital gain) which would have been 
recognized if the contributed portion of the property had been sold by 
the donor at its fair market value at the time of its contribution shall 
be that amount which bears the same ratio to the ordinary income (or 
long-term capital gain) which would have been recognized if the entire 
property had been sold by the donor at its fair market value at the time 
of its contribution as (i) the fair market value of the contributed 
portion at such time bears to (ii) the fair market value of the entire 
property at such time. In the case of a bargain sale,

[[Page 53]]

the fair market value of the contributed portion for purposes of 
subdivision (i) is the amount determined by subtracting from the fair 
market value of the entire property the amount realized on the sale.
    (4) Donee's basis of property acquired. The adjusted basis of the 
contributed portion of the property, as determined under subparagraph 
(1) or (2) of this paragraph, shall be used by the donee in applying to 
the contributed portion such provisions as section 514(a)(1), relating 
to adjusted basis of debt-financed property; section 1015(a), relating 
to basis of property acquired by gift; section 4940(c)(4), relating to 
capital gains and losses in determination of net investment income; and 
section 4942(f)(2)(B), relating to net short-term capital gain in 
determination of tax on failure to distribute income. The fair market 
value of the contributed portion of the property at the time of the 
contribution shall not be used by the donee as the basis of such 
contributed portion.
    (d) Illustrations. The application of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. (a) On July 1, 1970, C, an individual, makes the 
following charitable contributions, all of which are made to a church 
except in the case of the stock (as indicated):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) After making the reductions required by paragraph (a) of this 
section, the amount of charitable contributions allowed (before 
application of section 170(b) limitations) is as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         Fair

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordinary income property.............   $50,000    $15,000     $35,000  
Property which, if sold, would

  (1) Stock contributed to:..........

    Total............................   102,000     20,500      81,500  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) If C were a corporation, rather than an individual, the amount 
of charitable contributions allowed (before application of section 
170(b) limitation) would be as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         Fair

                                         value                 allowed  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordinary income property.............   $50,000    $15,000     $35,000  
Property which, if sold, would                                          
 produce long-term capital gain:                                        
  (1) Stock contributed to:..........                                   
    (i) The church...................    25,000  .........      25,000

  (2) Tangible personal property.....    12,000      3,750       8,250  
                                      ----------------------------------
    Total............................   102,000     21,875      80,125  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Example 2. On March 1, 1970, D, an individual, contributes to a 
church intangible property to which section 1245 applies which has a 
fair market value of $60,000 and an adjusted basis of $10,000. At the 
time of the contribution D has used the property in his business for 
more than 6 months. If the property had been sold by D at its fair 
market value at the time of its contribution, it is assumed that under 
section 1245 $20,000 of the gain of $50,000 would have been treated as 
ordinary income and $30,000 would have been long-term capital gain. 
Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, D's contribution of $60,000 is 
reduced by $20,000.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (2) except that the 
property is contributed to a private foundation not described in section 
170(b)(1)(E). Under paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section, D's 
contribution is reduced by $35,000 (100 percent of the ordinary income 
of $20,000 and 50 percent of the long-term capital gain of $30,000).
    Example 4. (a) In 1971, E, an individual calendar-year taxpayer, 
contributes to a church stock held for more than 6 months which has a 
fair market value of $90,000 and an adjusted basis of $10,000. In 1972, 
E also contributes to a church stock held for more than 6 months which 
has a fair market value of $20,000 and an adjusted basis of $10,000. E's 
contribution base for 1971 is $200,000; and for 1972, is

[[Page 54]]

$150,000. E makes no other charitable contributions for these 2 taxable 
years.
    (b) For 1971 the amount of the contribution which may be taken into 
account under section 170(a) is limited by section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) to 
$60,000 ($200,000 x 30%), and A is allowed a deduction for $60,000. 
Under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii), E has a $30,000 carryover to 1972 of 30-
percent capital gain property, as defined in paragraph (d)(3) of 
Sec. 1.170A-8. For 1972 the amount of the charitable contributions 
deduction is $45,000 (total contributions of $50,000 [$30,000+$20,000] 
but not to exceed 30% of $150,000).
    (c) Assuming, however, that in 1972 E elects under section 
170(b)(1)(D)(iii) and paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.170A-8 to have section 
170(e)(1)(B) apply to his contributions and carryovers of 30-percent 
capital gain property, he must apply section 170(d)(1) as if section 
170(e)(1)(B) had applied to the contribution for 1971. If section 170 
(e)(1)(B) had applied in 1971 to his contributions of 30-percent capital 
gain property, E's contribution would have been reduced from $90,000 to 
$50,000, the reduction of $40,000 being 50 percent of the gain of 
$80,000 ($90,000-$10,000) which would have been recognized as long-term 
capital gain if the property had been sold by E at its fair market value 
at the time of its contribution to the church. Accordingly, by taking 
the election into account, E has no carryover of 30-percent capital gain 
property to 1972 since the charitable contributions deduction of $60,000 
allowed for 1971 in respect of that property exceeds the reduced 
contribution of $50,000 for 1971 which may be taken into account by 
reason of the election. The charitable contributions deduction of 
$60,000 allowed for 1971 is not reduced by reason of the election.
    (d) Since by reason of the election E is allowed under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section a charitable contributions deduction for 1972 of 
$15,000 ($20,000-[($20,000- $10,000) x 50%]) and since the $30,000 
carryover from 1971 is eliminated, it would not be to E's advantage to 
make the election under section 170(b)(1)(D)(iii) in 1972.
    Example 5. In 1970, F, an individual calendar-year taxpayer, sells 
to a church for $4,000 ordinary income property with a fair market value 
of $10,000 and an adjusted basis of $4,000. F's contribution base for 
1970 is $20,000, and F makes no other charitable contributions in 1970. 
Thus, F makes a charitable contribution to the church of $6,000 
($10,000-$4,000 amount realized), which is 60% of the value of the 
property. The amount realized on the bargain sale is 40% ($4,000/
$10,000) of the value of the property. In applying section 1011(b) to 
the bargain sale, adjusted basis in the amount of $1,600 ($4,000 
adjusted basis  x  40%) is allocated under Sec. 1.1011-2(b) to the 
noncontributed portion of the property, and F recognizes $2,400 ($4,000 
amount realized less $1,600 adjusted basis) of ordinary income. Under 
paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(2)(i) of this section, F's contribution of 
$6,000 is reduced by $3,600 ($6,000 - [$4,000 adjusted basis  x  60%]) 
(i.e., the amount of ordinary income that would have been recognized on 
the contributed portion had the property been sold). The reduced 
contribution of $2,400 consists of the portion ($4,000  x  60%) of the 
adjusted basis not allocated to the noncontributed portion of the 
property. That is, the reduced contribution consists of the portion of 
the adjusted basis allocated to the contributed portion. Under sections 
1012 and 1015(a) the basis of the property to the church is $6,400 
($4,000 + $2,400).
    Example 6. In 1970, G, an individual calendar-year taxpayer, sells 
to a church for $6,000 ordinary income property with a fair market value 
of $10,000 and an adjusted basis of $4,000. G's contribution base for 
1970 is $20,000, and G makes no other charitable contributions in 1970. 
Thus, G makes a charitable contribution to the church of $4,000 ($10,000 
- $6,000 amount realized), which is 40% of the value of the property. 
The amount realized on the bargain sale is 60% ($6,000/$10,000) of the 
value of the property. In applying section 1011(b) to the bargain sale, 
adjusted basis in the amount of $2,400 ($4,000 adjusted basis  x  60%) 
is allocated under Sec. 1.1011-2(b) to the noncontributed portion of the 
property, and G recognizes $3,600 ($6,000 amount realized less $2,400 
adjusted basis) of ordinary income. Under paragraphs (a)(1) and 
(c)(2)(i) of this section, G's contribution of $4,000 is reduced by 
$2,400 ($4,000 - [$4,000 adjusted basis  x  40%]) (i.e., the amount of 
ordinary income that would have been recognized on the contributed 
portion had the property been sold). The reduced contribution of $1,600 
consist of the portion ($4,000 x 40%) of the adjusted basis not 
allocated to the noncontributed portion of the property. That is, the 
reduced contribution consists of the portion of the adjusted basis 
allocated to the contributed portion. Under sections 1012 and 1015(a) 
the basis of the property to the church is $7,600 ($6,000+$1,600).
    Example 7. In 1970, H, an individual calendar-year taxpayer, sells 
to a church for $2,000 stock held for not more than 6 months which has 
an adjusted basis of $4,000 and a fair market value of $10,000. H's 
contribution base for 1970 is $20,000, and H makes no other charitable 
contributions in 1970. Thus, H makes a charitable contribution to the 
church of $8,000 ($10,000-$2,000 amount realized), which is 80% of the 
value of the property. The amount realized on the bargain sale is 20% 
($2,000/$10,000) of the value of the property. In applying section 
1011(b) to the bargain sale, adjusted basis in the amount of $800 
($4,000 adjusted basis  x  20%) is allocated under Sec. 1.1011-2(b) to 
the noncontributed portion of the property, and H recognizes $1,200 
($2,000 amount realized less $800 adjusted

[[Page 55]]

basis) of ordinary income. Under paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(2)(i) of this 
section, H's contribution of $8,000 is reduced by $4,800 ($8,000 - 
[$4,000 adjusted basis x 80%]) (i.e., the amount of ordinary income that 
would have been recognized on the contributed portion had the property 
been sold). The reduced contribution of $3,200 consists of the portion 
($4,000 x 80%) of the adjusted basis not allocated to the noncontributed 
portion of the property. That is, the reduced contribution consists of 
the portion of the adjusted basis allocated to the contributed portion. 
Under sections 1012 and 1015(a) the basis of the property to the church 
is $5,200 ($2,000+$3,200).
    Example 8. In 1970, F, an individual calendar-year taxpayer, sells 
for $4,000 to a private foundation not described in section 170(b)(1)(E) 
property to which section 1245 applies which has a fair market value of 
$10,000 and an adjusted basis of $4,000. F's contribution base for 1970 
is $20,000, and F makes no other charitable contributions in 1970. At 
the time of the bargain sale, F has used the property in his business 
for more than 6 months. Thus F makes a charitable contribution of $6,000 
($10,000-$4,000 amount realized), which is 60% of the value of the 
property. The amount realized on the bargain sale is 40% ($4,000/
$10,000) of the value of the property. If the property had been sold by 
F at its fair market value at the time of its contribution, it is 
assumed that under section 1245 $4,000 of the gain of $6,000 
($10,000-$4,000 adjusted basis) would have been treated as ordinary 
income and $2,000 would have been long-term capital gain. In applying 
section 1011(b) to the bargain sale, adjusted basis in the amount of 
$1,600 ($4,000 adjusted basis  x  40%) is allocated under Sec. 1.1011-
2(b) to the noncontributed portion of the property, and F's recognized 
gain of $2,400 ($4,000 amount realized less $1,600 adjusted basis) 
consists of $1,600 ($4,000 x 40%) of ordinary income and $800 
($2,000 x 40%) of long-term capital gain. Under paragraphs (a) and 
(c)(2)(i) of this section, F's contribution of $6,000 is reduced by 
$3,000 (the sum of $2,400 ($4,000 x 60%) of ordinary income and $600 
([$2,000 x 60%]  x  50%) of long-term capital gain) (i.e., the amount of 
gain that would have been recognized on the contributed portion had the 
property been sold). The reduced contribution of $3,000 consists of 
$2,400 ($4,000 x 60%) of adjusted basis and $600 ([$2,000 x 60%]  x  
50%) of long-term capital gain not used as a reduction under paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section. Under sections 1012 and 1015(a) the basis of the 
property to the private foundation is $6,400 ($4,000+$2,400).
    Example 9. On January 1, 1970, A, an individual, transfers to a 
charitable remainder annuity trust described in section 664 (d)(1) stock 
which he has held for more than 6 months and which has a fair market 
value of $250,000 and an adjusted basis of $50,000, an irrevocable 
remainder interest in the property being contributed to a private 
foundation not described in section 170(b)(1)(E). The trusts provides 
that an annuity of $12,500 a year is payable to A at the end of each 
year for 20 years. By reference to Sec. 20.2031-7A(c) of this chapter 
(Estate Tax Regulations) the figure in column (2) opposite 20 years is 
11.4699. Therefore, under Sec. 1.664-2 the fair market value of the gift 
of the remainder interest to charity is $106,626.25 ($250,000 - 
[$12,500 x 11.4699]). Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the 
adjusted basis allocated to the contributed portion of the property is 
$21,325.25 ($50,000 x $106,626.25/$250,000). Under paragraphs (a)(2) and 
(c)(1) of this section, A's contribution is reduced by $42,650.50 (50 
percent  x  [$106,626.25-$21,325.25]) to $63,975.75 
($106,626.25-$42,650.50). If, however, the irrevocable remainder 
interest in the property had been contributed to a section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization, A's contribution of $106,626.25 would not be reduced under 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    Example 10. (a) On July 1, 1970, B, a calendar-year individual 
taxpayer, sells to a church for $75,000 intangible property to which 
section 1245 applies which has a fair market value of $250,000 and an 
adjusted basis of $75,000. Thus, B makes a charitable contribution to 
the church of $175,000 ($250,000-$75,000 amount realized), which is 70% 
($175,000/$250,000) of the value of the property, the amount realized on 
the bargain sale is 30% ($75,000/$250,000) of the value of the property. 
At the time of the bargain sale, B has used the property in his business 
for more than 6 months. B's contribution base for 1970 is $500,000, and 
B makes no other charitable contributions in 1970. If the property had 
been sold by B at its fair market value at the time of its contribution, 
it is assumed that under section 1245 $105,000 of the gain of $175,000 
($250,000-$75,000 adjusted basis) would have been treated as ordinary 
income and $70,000 would have been long-term capital gain. In applying 
section 1011(b) to the bargain sale, adjusted basis in the amount of 
$22,500 ($75,000 adjusted basis  x  30%) is allocated under Sec. 1.1011-
2(b) to the noncontributed portion of the property and B's recognized 
gain of $52,500 ($75,000 amount realized less $22,500 adjusted basis) 
consists of $31,500 ($105,000 x 30%) of ordinary income and $21,000 
($70,000 x 30%) of long term capital gain.
    (b) Under paragraphs (a)(1) and (c)(2)(i) of this section B's 
contribution of $175,000 is reduced by $73,500 ($105,000 x 70%) (i.e., 
the amount of ordinary income that would have been recognized on the 
contributed portion had the property been sold). The reduced 
contribution of $101,500 consists of $52,500 [$75,000 x 70%] of adjusted 
basis allocated to the contributed portion of the property and $49,000 
[$70,000 x 70%] of long-term capital gain allocated to the contributed 
portion. Under

[[Page 56]]

sections 1012 and 1015(a) the basis of the property to the church is 
$127,500 ($75,000+$52,500).

    (e) Effective date. This section applies only to contributions paid 
after December 31, 1969, except that, in the case of a charitable 
contribution of a letter, memorandum, or property similar to a letter or 
memorandum, it applies to contributions paid after July 25, 1969.

Sec. 1.170A-4A  Special rule for the deduction of certain charitable contributions of inventory and other property.

    (a) Introduction. Section 170(e)(3) provides a special rule for the 
deduction of certain qualified contributions of inventory and certain 
other property. To be treated as a ``qualified contribution'', a 
contribution must meet the restrictions and requirements of section 
170(e)(3)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section describes the corporations whose contributions may be subject to 
this section, the exempt organizations to which these contributions may 
be made, and the kinds of property which may be contributed. Under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the use of the property must be 
related to the purpose or function constituting the ground for the 
exemption of the organization to which the contribution is made. Also, 
the property must be used for the care of the ill, needy, or infants. 
Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the recipient organization may 
not, except as there provided, require or receive in exchange money, 
property, or services for the transfer or use of property contributed 
under section 170(e)(3). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the 
recipient organization must provide the contributing taxpayer with a 
written statement representing that the organization intends to comply 
with the restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of this 
section on the use and transfer of the property. Under paragraph (b)(5) 
of this section, the contributed property must conform to any applicable 
provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as amended), and 
the regulations thereunder, at the date of contribution and for the 
immediately preceding 180 days. Paragraph (c) of this section provides 
the rules for determining the amount of reduction of the charitable 
contribution under section 170(e)(3). In general, the amount of the 
reduction is equal to one-half of the amount of gain (other than gain 
described in paragraph (d) of this section) which would not have been 
long-term capital gain if the property had been sold by the donor-
taxpayer at fair market value at the date of contribution. If, after 
this reduction, the amount of the deduction would be more than twice the 
basis of the contributed property, the amount of the deduction is 
accordingly further reduced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The 
basis of contributed property which is inventory is determined under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and the donor's cost of goods sold for 
the year of contribution must be adjusted under paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section. Under paragraph (d) of this section, a deduction is not allowed 
for any amount which, if the property had been sold by the donor-
taxpayer, would have been gain to which the recapture provisions of 
section 617, 1245, 1250, 1251, or 1252 would have applied. For purposes 
of section 170(e)(3) the rules of Sec. 1.170A-4 apply where not 
inconsistent with the rules of this section.
    (b) Qualified contributions--(1) In general. A contribution of 
property qualifies under section 170(e)(3) of this section only if it is 
a charitable contribution:
    (i) By a corporation, other than a corporation which is an electing 
small business corporation within the meaning of section 1371(b);
    (ii) To an organization described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt 
under section 501(a), other than a private foundation, as defined in 
section 509(a), which is not an operating foundation, as defined in 
section 4942(j)(e);
    (iii) Of property described in section 1221 (1) or (2);
    (iv) Which contribution meets the restrictions and requirements of 
paragraph (b) (2) through (5) of this section.
    (2) Restrictions on use of contributed property. In order for the 
contribution

[[Page 57]]

to qualify under this section, the contributed property is subject to 
the following restrictions in use. If the transferred property is used 
or transferred by the donee organization (or by any subsequent 
transferee that furnished to the donee organization the written 
statement described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) in a manner 
inconsistent with the requirements of subdivision (i) or (ii) of this 
paragraph (b)(2) or the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, the donor's deduction is reduced to the amount allowable under 
section 170 of the regulations thereunder, determined without regard to 
section 170(e)(3) of this section. If, however, the donor establishes 
that, at the time of the contribution, the donor reasonably anticipated 
that the property would be used in a manner consistent with those 
requirements, then the donor's deduction is not reduced.
    (i) Requirement of use for exempt purpose. The use of the property 
must be related to the purpose or function constituting the ground for 
exemption under section 501(c)(3) of the organization to which the 
contribution is made. The property may not be used in connection with 
any activity which gives rise to unrelated trade or business income, as 
defined in sections 512 and 513 and the regulations thereunder.
    (ii) Requirement of use for care of the ill, needy, or infants--(A) 
In general. The property must be used for the care of the ill, needy, or 
infants, as defined in this subdivision (ii). The property itself must 
ultimately either be transferred to (or for the use of) the ill, needy, 
or infants for their care or be retained for their care. No other person 
may use the contributed property except as incidental to primary use in 
the care of the ill, needy, or infants. The organization may satisfy the 
requirement of this subdivision by transferring the property to a 
relative, custodian, parent or guardian of the ill or needy individual 
or infant, or to any other individual if it makes a reasonable effort to 
ascertain that the property will ultimately be used primarily for the 
care of the ill or needy individual, or infant, and not for the primary 
benefit of any other person. The recipient organization may transfer the 
property to another exempt organization within the jurisdiction of the 
United States which meets the description contained in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section, or to an organization not within the 
jurisdiction of the United States that, but for the fact that it is not 
within the jurisdiction of the United States, would be described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. If an organization transfers the 
property to another organization, the transferring organization must 
obtain a written statement from the transferee organization as set forth 
in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. If the property is ultimately 
transferred to, or used for the benefit of, ill or needy persons, or 
infants, not within the jurisdiction of the United States, the 
organization which so transfers the property outside the jurisdiction of 
the United States must necessarily be a corporation. See section 
170(c)(2) and Sec. 1.170A-11(a). For purposes of this subdivision, if 
the donee-organization charges for its transfer of contributed property 
(other than a fee allowed by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section), the 
requirement of this subdivision is not met. See paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section.
    (B) Definition of the ill. An ill person is a person who requires 
medical care within the meaning of Sec. 1.213-1(e). Examples of ill 
persons include a person suffering from physical injury, a person with a 
significant impairment of a bodily organ, a person with an existing 
handicap, whether from birth or later injury, a person suffering from 
malnutrition, a person with a disease, sickness, or infection which 
significantly impairs physical health, a person partially or totally 
incapable of self-care (including incapacity due to old age). A person 
suffering from mental illness is included if the person is hospitalized 
or institutionalized for the mental disorder, or, although the person is 
nonhospitalized or noninstitutionalized, if the person's mental illness 
constitutes a significant health impairment.
    (C) Definition of care of the ill. Care of the ill means alleviation 
or cure of an existing illness and includes care of the physical, 
mental, or emotional needs of the ill.

[[Page 58]]

    (D) Definition of the needy. A needy person is a person who lacks 
the necessities of life, involving physical, mental, or emotional well-
being, as a result of poverty or temporary distress. Examples of needy 
persons include a person who is financially impoverished as a result of 
low income and lack of financial resources, a person who temporarily 
lacks food or shelter (and the means to provide for it), a person who is 
the victim of a natural disaster (such as fire or flood), a person who 
is the victim of a civil disaster (such as a civil disturbance), a 
person who is temporarily not self-sufficient as a result of a sudden 
and severe personal or family crisis (such as a person who is the victim 
of a crime of violence or who has been physically abused), a person who 
is a refugee or immigrant and who is experiencing language, cultural, or 
financial difficulties, a minor child who is not self-sufficient and who 
is not cared for by a parent or guardian, and a person who is not self-
sufficient as a result of previous institutionalization (such as a 
former prisoner or a former patient in a mental institution).
    (E) Definition of care of the needy. Care of the needy means 
alleviation or satisfaction of an existing need. Since a person may be 
needy in some respects and not needy in other respects, care of the 
needy must relate to the particular need which causes the person to be 
needy. For example, a person whose temporary need arises from a natural 
disaster may need temporary shelter and food but not recreational 
facilities.
    (F) Definition of infant. An infant is a minor child (as determined 
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the child resides).
    (G) Definition of care of an infant. Care of an infant means 
performance of parental functions and provision for the physical, 
mental, and emotional needs of the infant.
    (3) Restrictions on Transfer of contributed property--(i) In 
general. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this 
paragraph (b)(3), a contribution will not qualify under this section, if 
the donee-organization or any transferee of the donee-organization 
requires or receives any money, property, or services for the transfer 
or use of property contributed under section 170(e)(3). For example, if 
an organization provides temporary shelter for a fee, and also provides 
free meals to ill or needy individuals, or infants using food 
contributed under this section the contribution of food is subject to 
this section (if the other requirements of this section are met). 
However, the fee charged by the organization for the shelter may not be 
increased merely because meals are served to the ill or needy 
individuals or infants.
    (ii) Exception. A contribution may qualify under this section if the 
donee-organization charges a fee to another organization in connection 
with its transfer of the donated property, if:
    (A) The fee is small or nominal in relation to the value of the 
transferred property and is not determined by this value; and
    (B) The fee is designed to reimburse the donee-organization for its 
administrative, warehousing, or other similar costs.

For example, if a charitable organization (such as a food bank) accepts 
surplus food to distribute to other charities which give the food to 
needy persons, a small fee may be charged to cover administrative, 
warehousing, and other similar costs. This fee may be charged on the 
basis of the total number of pounds of food distributed to the 
transferee charity but not on the basis of the value of the food 
distributed. The provisions of this subdivision (ii) do not apply to a 
transfer of donated property directly from an organization to ill or 
needy individuals, or infants.
    (4) Requirement of a written statement--(i) Furnished to taxpayer. 
In the case of any contribution made on or after March 3, 1982, the 
donee-organization must furnish to the taxpayer a written statement 
which:
    (A) Describes the contributed property, stating the date of its 
receipt;
    (B) Represents that the property will be used in compliance with 
section 170(e)(3) and paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section;
    (C) Represents that the donee-organization meets the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section; and
    (D) Represents that adequate books and records will be maintained, 
and

[[Page 59]]

made available to the Internal Revenue Service upon request.

The written statement must be furnished within a reasonable period after 
the contribution, but not later than the date (including extensions) by 
which the donor is required to file a United States corporate income tax 
return for the year in which the contribution was made. The books and 
records described in (D) of this subdivision (i) need not trace the 
receipt and disposition of specific items of donated property if they 
disclose compliance with the requirements by reference to aggregate 
quantities of donated property. The books and records are adequate if 
they reflect total amounts received and distributed (or used), and 
outline the procedure used for determining that the ultimate recipient 
of the property is an ill or needy individual, or infant. However, the 
books and records need not reflect the names of the ultimate individual 
recipients or the property distributed to (or used by) each one.
    (ii) Furnished to transferring organization. If an organization that 
received a contribution under this section transfers the contributed 
property to another organization on or after March 3, 1982, the 
transferee organization must furnish to the transferring organization a 
written statement which contains the information required in paragraph 
(b)(4)(i) (A), (B) and (D) of this section. The statement must also 
represent that the transferee organization meets the requirements of 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section (or, in the case of a transferee 
organization which is a foreign organization not within the jurisdiction 
of the United States, that, but for such fact, the organization would 
meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section). The 
written statement must be furnished within a reasonable period after the 
transfer.
    (5) Requirement of compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act--(i) In general. With respect to property contributed under 
this section which is subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (as amended), and regulations thereunder, the contributed property 
must comply with the applicable provisions of that Act and regulations 
thereunder at the date of the contribution and for the immediately 
preceding 180 days. In the case of specific items of contributed 
property not in existence for the entire period of 180 days immediately 
preceding the date of contribution, the requirement of this paragraph 
(b)(5) is considered met if the contributed property complied with that 
Act and the regulations thereunder during the period of its existence 
and at the date of contribution and if, for the 180 day period prior to 
contribution other property (if any) held by the taxpayer at any time 
during that period, which property was fungible with the contributed 
property, complied with that Act and the regulations thereunder during 
the period held by the taxpayer.
    (ii) Example. The rule of this paragraph (b)(5) may be illustrated 
by the following example.

    Example. Corporation X a grocery store, contributes 12 crates of 
navel oranges. The oranges were picked and placed in the grocery store's 
stock two weeks prior to the date of contribution. The contribution 
satisfies the requirements of this paragraph (b)(5) if X complied with 
the Act and regulations thereunder for 180 days prior to the date of 
contribution with respect to all navel oranges in stock during that 
period.

    (c) Amount of reduction--(1) In general. Section 170(e)(3)(B) 
requires that the amount of the charitable contribution subject to this 
section which would be taken into account under section 170(a), without 
regard to section 170(e), must be reduced before applying the percentage 
limitations under section 170(b). The amount of the first reduction is 
equal to one-half of the amount of gain which would not have been long-
term capital gain if the property had been sold by the donor-taxpayer at 
its fair market value on the date of its contribution, excluding, 
however, any amount described in paragraph (d) of this section. If the 
amount of the charitable contribution which remains after this reduction 
exceeds twice the basis of the contributed property, then the amount of 
the charitable contribution is reduced a second time to an amount which 
is equal to twice the amount of the basis of the property.
    (2) Basis of contributed property which is inventory. For the 
purposes of this section, notwithstanding the rules of

[[Page 60]]

Sec. 1.170A-1(c)(4), the basis of contributed property which is 
inventory must be determined under the donor's method of accounting for 
inventory for purposes of United States income tax. The donor must use 
as the basis of the contributed item the inventoriable carrying cost 
assigned to any similar item not included in closing inventory. For 
example, under the LIFO dollar value method of accounting for inventory, 
where there has been an invasion of a prior year's layer, the donor may 
choose to treat the item contributed as having a basis of the unit's 
cost with reference to the layer(s) of prior year(s) cost or with 
reference to the current year cost.
    (3) Adjustment to cost of goods sold. Notwithstanding the rules of 
Sec. 1.170A-1(c)(4), the donor of the property which is inventory 
contributed under this section must make a corresponding adjustment to 
cost of goods sold by decreasing the cost of goods sold by the lesser of 
the fair market value of the contributed item or the amount of basis 
determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
    (4) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (c) may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. During 1978 corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, 
makes a qualified contribution of women's coats which were section 
1221(1) property. The fair market value of the property at the date of 
contribution is $1,000, and the basis of the property is $200. The 
amount of the charitable contribution which would be taken into account 
under section 170(a) is the fair market value ($1,000). The amount of 
gain which would not have been long-term capital gain if the property 
had been sold is $800 ($1,000-$200). The amount of the contribution is 
reduced by one-half the amount which would not have been capital gain if 
the property had been sold ($800/2=-$400).
    After this reduction, the amount of the contribution which may be 
taken into account is $600 ($1,000-$400). A second reduction is made in 
the amount of the charitable contribution because this amount (as first 
reduced to $600) is more than $400 which is an amount equal to twice the 
basis of the property. The amount of the further reduction is $200 
[$600-(2 x $200)], and the amount of the contribution as finally reduced 
is $400 [$1,00-($400+$200)]. X would also have to decrease its cost of 
goods sold for the year of contribution by $200.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as set forth in Example (1) except 
that the basis of the property is $600. The amount of the first 
reduction is $200 (($1,000-$600)/2).
    As reduced, the amount of the contribution which may be taken into 
account is $800 ($1,000-$200). There is no second reduction because $800 
is less than $1,200 which is twice the basis of the property. However, X 
would have to decrease its cost of goods sold for the year of 
contribution by $600.

    (d) Recapture excluded. A deduction is not allowed under section 
170(e)(3) or this section for any amount which, if the property had been 
sold by the donor-taxpayer on the date of its contribution for an amount 
equal to its fair market value, would have been treated as ordinary 
income under section 617, 1245, 1250, 1251, or 1252. Thus, before making 
either reduction required by section 170(e)(3)(B) and paragraph (c) of 
this section, the fair market value of the contributed property must be 
reduced by the amount of gain that would have been recognized (if the 
property had been sold) as ordinary income under section 617, 1245, 
1250, 1251, or 1252.
    (e) Effective date. This section applies to qualified contributions 
made after October 4, 1976.

[T.D. 7807, 47 FR 4510, Feb. 1, 1982, as amended by T.D. 7962, 49 FR

<R05>
Sec. 1.170A-5   Future interests in tangible personal property.

    (a) In general. (1) A contribution consisting of a transfer of a 
future interest in tangible personal property shall be treated as made 
only when all intervening interests in, and rights to the actual 
possession or enjoyment of, the property:
    (i) Have expired, or
    (ii) Are held by persons other than the taxpayer or those standing 
in a relationship to the taxpayer described in section 267(b) and the 
regulations thereunder, relating to losses, expenses, and interest with 
respect to transactions between related taxpayers.
    (2) Section 170(a)(3) and this section have no application in 
respect of a transfer of an undivided present interest in property. For 
example, a contribution of an undivided one-quarter interest in a 
painting with respect to

[[Page 61]]

which the donee is entitled to possession during 3 months of each year 
shall be treated as made upon the receipt by the donee of a formally 
executed and acknowledged deed of gift. However, the period of initial 
possession by the donee may not be deferred in time for more than 1 
year.
    (3) Section 170(a)(3) and this section have no application in 
respect of a transfer of a future interest in intangible personal 
property or in real property. However, a fixture which is intended to be 
severed from real property shall be treated as tangible personal 
property. For example, a contribution of a future interest in a 
chandelier which is attached to a building is considered a contribution 
which consists of a future interest in tangible personal property if the 
transferor intends that it be detached from the building at or prior to 
the time when the charitable organization's right to possession or 
enjoyment of the chandelier is to commence.
    (4) For purposes of section 170(a)(3) and this section, the term 
future interest has generally the same meaning as it has when used in 
section 2503 and Sec. 25.2503-3 of this chapter (Gift Tax Regulations); 
it includes reversions, remainders, and other interests or estates, 
whether vested or contingent, and whether or not supported by a 
particular interest or estate, which are limited to commence in use, 
possession, or enjoyment at some future date or time. The term future 
interest includes situations in which a donor purports to give tangible 
personal property to a charitable organization, but has an 
understanding, arrangement, agreement, etc., whether written or oral, 
with the charitable organization which has the effect of reserving to, 
or retaining in, such donor a right to the use, possession, or enjoyment 
of the property.
    (5) In the case of a charitable contribution of a future interest to 
which section 170(a)(3) and this section apply the other provisions of 
section 170 and the regulations thereunder are inapplicable to the 
contribution until such time as the contribution is treated as made 
under section 170(a)(3).
    (b) Illustrations. The application of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. On December 31, 1970, A, an individual who reports his 
income on the calendar year basis, conveys by deed of gift to a museum 
title to a painting, but reserves to himself the right to the use, 
possession, and enjoyment of the painting during his lifetime. It is 
assumed that there was no intention to avoid the application of section 
170(f)(3)(A) by the conveyance. At the time of the gift the value of the 
painting is $90,000. Since the contribution consists of a future 
interest in tangible personal property in which the donor has retained 
an intervening interest, no contribution is considered to have been made 
in 1970.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that on 
December 31, 1971, A relinquishes all of his right to the use, 
possession, and enjoyment of the painting and delivers the painting to 
the museum. Assuming that the value of the painting has increased to 
$95,000, A is treated as having made a charitable contribution of 
$95,000 in 1971 for which a deduction is allowable without regard to 
section 170(f)(3)(A).
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except A dies 
without relinquishing his right to the use, possession, and enjoyment of 
the painting. Since A did not relinquish his right to the use, 
possession, and enjoyment of the property during his life, A is treated 
as not having made a charitable contribution of the painting for income 
tax purposes.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except A, on 
December 31, 1971, transfers his interest in the painting to his son, B, 
who reports his income on the calendar year basis. Since the 
relationship between A and B is one described in section 267(b), no 
contribution of the remainder interest in the painting is considered to 
have been made in 1971.
    Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example (4). Also assume that 
on December 31, 1972, B conveys to the museum the interest measured by 
A's life. B has made a charitable contribution of the present interest 
in the painting conveyed to the museum. In addition, since all 
intervening interests in, and rights to the actual possession or 
enjoyment of the property, have expired, a charitable contribution of 
the remainder interest is treated as having been made by A in 1972 for 
which a deduction is allowable without regard to section 170(f)(3)(A). 
Such remainder interest is valued according to Sec. 20.2031-7A(c) of 
this chapter (estate tax regulations), determined by subtracting the 
value of B's interest measured by A's life expectancy in 1972, and B 
receives a deduction in 1972 for

[[Page 62]]

the life interest measured by A's life expectancy and valued according 
to Table A(1) in such section.
    Example 6. On December 31, 1970, C, an individual who reports his 
income on the calendar year basis, transfers a valuable painting to a 
pooled income fund described in section 642(c)(5), which is maintained 
by a university. C retains for himself for life an income interest in 
the painting, the remainder interest in the painting being contributed 
to the university. Since the contribution consists of a future interest 
in tangible personal property in which the donor has retained an 
intervening interest, no charitable contribution is considered to have 
been made in 1970.
    Example 7. On January 15, 1972, D, an individual who reports his 
income on the calendar year basis, transfers a capital asset held for 
more than 6 months consisting of a valuable painting to a pooled income 
fund described in section 642(c)(5), which is maintained by a 
university, and creates an income interest in such painting for E for 
life. E is an individual not standing in a relationship to D described 
in section 267(b). The remainder interest in the property is contributed 
by D to the university. The trustee of the pooled income fund puts the 
painting to an unrelated use within the meaning of paragraph (b)(3) of 
Sec. 1.170A-4. Accordingly, D is allowed a deduction under section 170 
in 1972 for the present value of the remainder interest in the painting, 
after reducing such amount under section 170 (e)(1)(B)(i) and paragraph 
(a)(2) of Sec. 1.170A-4. This reduction in the amount of the 
contribution is required since under paragraph (b)(3) of that section 
the use by the pooled income fund of the painting is a use which would 
have been an unrelated use if it had been made by the university.

    (c) Effective date. This section applies only to contributions paid 
in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.

<R05>
Sec. 1.170A-6   Charitable contributions in trust.

    (a) In general. (1) No deduction is allowed under section 170 for 
the fair market value of a charitable contribution of any interest in 
property which is less than the donor's entire interest in the property 
and which is transferred in trust unless the transfer meets the 
requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section. If the donor's 
entire interest in the property is transferred in trust and is 
contributed to a charitable organization described in section 170(c), a 
deduction is allowed under section 170. Thus, if on July 1, 1972, 
property is transferred in trust with the requirement that the income of 
the trust be paid for a term of 20 years to a church and thereafter the 
remainder be paid to an educational organization described in section 
170(b)(1)(A), a deduction is allowed for the value of such property. See 
section 170(f)(2) and (3)(B), and paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.170A-7.
    (2) A deduction is allowed without regard to this section for a 
contribution of a partial interest in property if such interest is the 
taxpayer's entire interest in the property, such as an income interest 
or a remainder interest. If, however, the property in which such partial 
interest exists was divided in order to create such interest and thus 
avoid section 170(f)(2), the deduction will not be allowed. Thus, for 
example, assume that a taxpayer desires to contribute to a charitable 
organization the reversionary interest in certain stocks and bonds which 
he owns. If the taxpayer transfers such property in trust with the 
requirement that the income of the trust be paid to his son for life and 
that the reversionary interest be paid to himself and immediately after 
creating the trust contributes the reversionary interest to a charitable 
organization, no deduction will be allowed under section 170 for the 
contribution of the taxpayer's entire interest consisting of the 
reversionary interest in the trust.
    (b) Charitable contribution of a remainder interest in trust--(1) In 
general. No deduction is allowed under section 170 for the fair market 
value of a charitable contribution of a remainder interest in property 
which is less than the donor's entire interest in the property and which 
the donor transfers in trust unless the trust is:
    (i) A pooled income fund described in section 642(c)(5) and 
Sec. 1.642(c)-5,
    (ii) A charitable remainder annuity trust described in section 
664(d)(1) and Sec. 1.664-2, or
    (iii) A charitable remainder unitrust described in section 664(d)(2) 
and Sec. 1.664-3.
    (2) Value of a remainder interest. The fair market value of a 
remainder interest in a pooled income fund shall be

[[Page 63]]

computed under Sec. 1.642(c)-6. The fair market value of a remainder 
interest in a charitable remainder annuity trust shall be computed under 
Sec. 1.664-2. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a 
charitable remainder unitrust shall be computed under Sec. 1.664-4. 
However, in some cases a reduction in the amount of a charitable 
contribution of the remainder interest may be required. See section 
170(e) and Sec. 1.170A-4.
    (c) Charitable contribution of an income interest in trust--(1) In 
general. No deduction is allowed under section 170 for the fair market 
value of a charitable contribution of an income interest in property 
which is less than the donor's entire interest in the property and which 
the donor transfers in trust unless the income interest is either a 
guaranteed annuity interest or a unitrust interest, as defined in 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and the grantor is treated as the 
owner of such interest for purposes of applying section 671, relating to 
grantors and others treated as substantial owners. See section 
4947(a)(2) for the application to such income interests in trust of the 
provisions relating to private foundations and section 508(e) for rules 
relating to provisions required in the governing instruments.
    (2) Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) Guaranteed annuity interest. (A) An income interest is a 
``guaranteed annuity interest'', only if it is an irrevocable right 
pursuant to the governing instrument of the trust to receive a 
guaranteed annuity. A guaranteed annuity is an arrangement under which a 
determinable amount is paid periodically, but not less often than 
annually, for a specified term or for the life or lives of an individual 
or individuals, each of whom must be living at the date of transfer and 
can be ascertained at such date. For example, the annuity may be paid 
for the life of A plus a term of years. An amount is determinable if the 
exact amount which must be paid under the conditions specified in the 
governing instrument of the trust can be ascertained as of the date of 
transfer. For example, the amount to be paid may be a stated sum for a 
term, or for the life of an individual, at the expiration of which it 
may be changed by a specified amount, but it may not be redetermined by 
reference to a fluctuating index such as the cost of living index. In 
further illustration, the amount to be paid may be expressed in terms of 
a fraction or percentage of the cost of living index on the date of 
transfer.
    (B) An income interest is a guaranteed annuity interest only if it 
is a guaranteed annuity interest in every respect. For example, if the 
income interest is the right to receive from a trust each year a payment 
equal to the lesser of a sum certain or a fixed percentage of the net 
fair market value of the trust assets, determined annually, such 
interest is not a guaranteed annuity interest.
    (C) Where a charitable interest is in the form of a guaranteed 
annuity interest, the governing instrument of the trust may provide that 
income of the trust which is in excess of the amount required to pay the 
guaranteed annuity interest shall be paid to or for the use of a 
charitable organization. Nevertheless, the amount of the deduction under 
section 170(f)(2)(B) shall be limited to the fair market value of the 
guaranteed annuity interest as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section. For a rule relating to treatment by the grantor of any 
contribution made by the trust in excess of the amount required to pay 
the guaranteed annuity interest, see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this 
section.
    (D) If the present value on the date of transfer of all the income 
interests for a charitable purpose exceeds 60 percent of the aggregate 
fair market value of all amounts in the trust (after the payment of 
liabilities), the income interest will not be considered a guaranteed 
annuity interest unless the governing instrument of the trust prohibits 
both the acquisition and the retention of assets which would give rise 
to a tax under section 4944 if the trustee had acquired such assets. The 
requirement in this subdivision (D) for a prohibition in the governing 
instrument against the retention of assets which would give rise to a 
tax under section 4944 if the trustee had acquired the assets shall not 
apply to a transfer in trust made on or before May 21, 1972.

[[Page 64]]

    (E) An income interest consisting of an annuity transferred in trust 
after May 21, 1972, will not be considered a guaranteed annuity interest 
if any amount other than an amount in payment of a guaranteed annuity 
interest may be paid by the trust for a private purpose before the 
expiration of all the income interests for a charitable purpose, unless 
such amount for a private purpose is paid from a group of assets which, 
pursuant to the governing instrument of the trust, are devoted 
exclusively to private purposes and to which section 4947(a)(2) is 
inapplicable by reason of section 4947(a)(2)(B). The exception in the 
immediately preceding sentence with respect to any guaranteed annuity 
for a private purpose shall apply only if the obligation to pay the 
annuity for a charitable purpose begins as of the date of creation of 
the trust and the obligation to pay the guaranteed annuity for a private 
purpose does not precede in point of time the obligation to pay the 
annuity for a charitable purpose and only if the governing instrument of 
the trust does not provide for any preference or priority in respect of 
any payment of the guaranteed annuity for a private purpose as opposed 
to any payment of any annuity for a charitable purpose. For purposes of 
this subdivision (E), an amount is not paid for a private purpose if it 
is paid for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's 
worth. See Sec. 53.4947-1 (c) of this chapter (Foundation Excise Tax 
Regulations) for rules relating to the inapplicability of section 
4947(a)(2) to segregated amounts in a split-interest trust.

    Example. In 1975, E transfers $75,000 in trust with the requirement 
that an annuity of $5,000 a year, payable annually at the end of each 
year, be paid to B, an individual, for a period of 5 years and 
thereafter an annuity of $5,000 a year, payable annually at the end of 
each year, be paid to M Charity for a period of 5 years. The remainder 
is to be paid to C, an individual. No deduction is allowed under 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to the charitable 
annuity because it is not a ``guaranteed annuity interest'' within the 
meaning of this subdivision.

    (F) For rules relating to certain governing instrument requirements 
and to the imposition of certain excise taxes where the guaranteed 
annuity interest is in trust and for rules governing payment of private 
income interests by a split-interest trust, see section 4947(a)(2) and 
(b)(3)(A), and the regulations thereunder.
    (ii) Unitrust interest. (A) An income interest is a ``unitrust 
interest'' only if it is an irrevocable right pursuant to the governing 
instrument of the trust to receive payment, not less often than annually 
of a fixed percentage of the net fair market value of the trust assets, 
determined annually. In computing the net fair market value of the trust 
assets, all assets and liabilities shall be taken into account without 
regard to whether particular items are taken into account in determining 
the income of the trust. The net fair market value of the trust assets 
may be determined on any one date during the year or by taking the 
average of valuations made on more than one date during the year, 
provided that the same valuation date or dates and valuation methods are 
used each year. Where the governing instrument of the trust does not 
specify the valuation date or dates, the trustee shall select such date 
or dates and shall indicate his selection on the first return on Form 
1041 which the trust is required to file. Payments under a unitrust 
interest may be paid for a specified term or for the life or lives of an 
individual or individuals, each of whom must be living at the date of 
transfer and can be ascertained at such date. For example, the unitrust 
interest may be paid for the life of A plus a term of years.
    (B) An income interest is a unitrust interest only if it is a 
unitrust interest in every respect. For example, if the income interest 
is the right to receive from a trust each year a payment equal to the 
lesser of a sum certain or a fixed percentage of the net fair market 
value of the trust assets, determined annually, such interest is not a 
unitrust interest.
    (C) Where a charitable interest is in the form of a unitrust 
interest, the governing instrument of the trust may provide that income 
of the trust which is in excess of the amount required to pay the 
unitrust interest shall be paid to or for the use of a charitable 
organization. Nevertheless, the amount of the deduction under section 
170(f)(2)(B) shall be limited to the fair market

[[Page 65]]

value of the unitrust interest as determined under paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section. For a rule relating to treatment by the grantor of any 
contribution made by the trust in excess of the amount required to pay 
the unitrust interest, see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (D) An income interest in the form of a unitrust interest will not 
be considered a unitrust interest if any amount other than an amount in 
payment of a unitrust interest may be paid by the trust for a private 
purpose before the expiration of all the income interests for a 
charitable purpose, unless such amount for a private purpose is paid 
from a group of assets which, pursuant to the governing instrument of 
the trust, are devoted exclusively to private purposes and to which 
section 4947(a)(2) is inapplicable by reason of section 4947 (a)(2)(B). 
The exception in the immediately preceding sentence with respect to any 
unitrust interest for a private purpose shall apply only if the 
obligation to pay the unitrust interest for a charitable purpose begins 
as of the date of creation of the trust and the obligation to pay the 
unitrust interest for a private purpose does not precede in point of 
time the obligation to pay the unitrust interest for a charitable 
purpose and only if the governing instrument of the trust does not 
provide for any preference or priority in respect of any payment of the 
unitrust interest for a private purpose as opposed to any payments of 
any unitrust interest for a charitable purpose. For purposes of this 
subdivision (D), an amount is not paid for a private purpose if it is 
paid for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. 
See Sec. 53.4947-1(c) of this chapter (Foundation Excise Tax 
Regulations) for rules relating to the inapplicability of section 
4947(a)(2) to segregated amounts in a split-interest trust.
    (E) For rules relating to certain governing instrument requirements 
and to the imposition of certain excise taxes where the unitrust 
interest is in trust and for rules governing payment of private income 
interests by a split-interest trust, see section 4947(a)(2) and 
(b)(3)(A), and the regulations thereunder.
    (3) Valuation of income interest. (i) The deduction allowed by 
section 170(f)(2)(B) for a charitable contribution of a guaranteed 
annuity interest is limited to the fair market value of such interest on 
the date of contribution, as computed under Sec. 20.2031-7 or, for 
certain prior periods, 20.2031-7A of this chapter (Estate Tax 
Regulations).
    (ii) The deduction allowed under section 170(f)(2)(B) for a 
charitable contribution of a unitrust interest is limited to the fair 
market value of the unitrust interest on the date of contribution. The 
fair market value of the unitrust interest shall be determined by 
subtracting the present value of all interests in the transferred 
property other than the unitrust interest from the fair market value of 
the transferred property.
    (iii) If by reason of all the conditions and circumstances 
surrounding a transfer of an income interest in property in trust it 
appears that the charity may not receive the beneficial enjoyment of the 
interest, a deduction will be allowed under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section only for the minimum amount it is evident the charity will 
receive. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. In 1972, B transfers $20,000 in trust with the 
requirement that M Church be paid a guaranteed annuity interest (as 
defined in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph) of $4,000, payable 
annually at the end of each year for 9 years, and that the residue 
revert to himself. Since the fair market value of an annuity of $4,000 a 
year for a period of 9 years, as determined under Sec. 20.2031-7A(c) of 
this chapter, is $27,206.80 ($4,000  x  6.8017), it appears that M will 
not receive the beneficial enjoyment of the income interest. 
Accordingly, even though B is treated as the owner of the trust under 
section 673, he is allowed a deduction under subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph for only $20,000, which is the minimum amount it is evident M 
will receive.
    Example 2. In 1975, C transfers $40,000 in trust with the 
requirement that D, an individual, and X Charity be paid simultaneously 
guaranteed annuity interests (as defined in subparagraph (2)(i) of this 
paragraph) of $5,000 a year each, payable annually at the end of each 
year, for a period of 5 years and that the remainder be paid to C's 
children. The fair market value of two annuities of $5,000 each a year 
for a period of 5 years is $42,124 ([$5,000  x  4.2124]  x  2), as 
determined

[[Page 66]]

under Sec. 20.2031-7A(c) of this chapter. The trust instrument provides 
that in the event the trust fund is insufficient to pay both annuities 
in a given year, the trust fund will be evenly divided between the 
charitable and private annuitants. The deduction under subparagraph (1) 
of this paragraph with respect to the charitable annuity will be limited 
to $20,000, which is the minimum amount it is evident X will receive.
    Example 3. In 1975, D transfers $65,000 in trust with the 
requirement that a guaranteed annuity interest (as defined in 
subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph) of $5,000 a year, payable 
annually at the end of each year, be paid to Y Charity for a period of 
10 years and that a guaranteed annuity interest (as defined in 
subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph) of $5,000 a year, payable 
annually at the end of each year, be paid to W, his wife, aged 62, for 
10 years or until her prior death. The annuities are to be paid 
simultaneously, and the remainder is to be paid to D's children. The 
fair market value of the private annuity is $33,877 ($5,000  x  6.7754), 
as determined pursuant to Sec. 20.2031-7A(c) of this chapter and by the 
use of factors involving one life and a term of years as published in 
Publication 723A (12-70). The fair market value of the charitable 
annuity is $36,800.50 ($5,000  x  7.3601), as determined under 
Sec. 20.2031-7A(c) of this chapter. It is not evident from the governing 
instrument of the trust or from local law that the trustee would be 
required to apportion the trust fund between the wife and charity in the 
event the fund were insufficient to pay both annuities in a given year. 
Accordingly, the deduction under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with 
respect to the charitable annuity will be limited to $31,123 ($65,000 
less $33,877 [the value of the private annuity]), which is the minimum 
amount it is evident Y will receive.

    (iv) See paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.170A-4 for rule that the term 
ordinary income property for purposes of section 170(e) does not include 
an income interest in respect of which a deduction is allowed under 
section 170(f)(2)(B) and this paragraph.
    (4) Recapture upon termination of treatment as owner. If for any 
reason the donor of an income interest in property ceases at any time 
before the termination of such interest to be treated as the owner of 
such interest for purposes of applying section 671, as for example, 
where he dies before the termination of such interest, he shall for 
purposes of this chapter be considered as having received, on the date 
he ceases to be so treated, an amount of income equal to (i) the amount 
of any deduction he was allowed under section 170 for the contribution 
of such interest reduced by (ii) the discounted value of all amounts 
which were required to be, and actually were, paid with respect to such 
interest under the terms of trust to the charitable organization before 
the time at which he ceases to be treated as the owner of the interest. 
The discounted value of the amounts described in subdivision (ii) of 
this subparagraph shall be computed by treating each such amount as a 
contribution of a remainder interest after a term of years and valuing 
such amount as of the date of contribution of the income interest by the 
donor, such value to be determined under Sec. 20.2031-7 of this chapter 
consistently with the manner in which the fair market value of the 
income interest was determined pursuant to subparagraph (3)(i) of this 
paragraph. The application of this subparagraph will not be construed to 
disallow a deduction to the trust for amounts paid by the trust to the 
charitable organization after the time at which the donor ceased to be 
treated as the owner of the trust.
    (5) Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. On January 1, 1970, A contributes to a church in trust a 
9-year irrevocable income interest in property. Both A and the trust 
report income on a calendar year basis. The fair market value of the 
property placed in trust is $10,000. The trust instrument provides that 
the church will receive an annuity of $500, payable annually at the end 
of each year for 9 years. The income interest is a guaranteed annuity 
interest as defined in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph; upon 
termination of such interest the residue of the trust is to revert to A. 
By reference to Sec. 20.2031-7A(c) of this chapter, it is found that the 
figure in column (2) opposite 9 years is 6.8017. The present value of 
the annuity is therefore $3,400.85 ($500  x  6.8017). The present value 
of the income interest and A's charitable contribution for 1970 is 
$3,400.85.
    Example 2. (a) On January 1, 1970, B contributes to a church in 
trust a 9-year irrevocable income interest in property. Both B and the 
trust report income on a calendar year basis. The fair market value of 
the property placed in trust is $10,000. The trust instrument provides 
that the trust will pay to the church at the end of each year for 9 
years 5 percent of the fair market value of all property in the trust at 
the beginning of the year. The income interest is a unitrust interest as 
defined in subparagraph (2)(ii) of

[[Page 67]]

this paragraph; upon termination of such interest the residue of the 
trust is to revert to B.
    (b) By reference to Table F in Sec. 1.664-4 (b)(5), the adjusted 
payout rate is 4.717 percent (5 percent  x  0.943396). The present value 
of the reversion is $6,473.75, computed by reference to Table D in 
Sec. 1.664-4A(c), as follows:

    (c) The present value of the income interest and B's charitable 
contribution for 1970 is $3,526.25 ($10,000-$6,473.75).
    Example 3. (a) On January 1, 1970, C contributes to a church in 
trust a 9-year irrevocable income interest in property. Both C and the 
trust report income on a calendar year basis. The fair market value of 
the property placed in trust is $10,000. The trust instrument provides 
that the church will receive an annuity of $500, payable annually at the 
end of each year for 9 years. The income interest is a guaranteed 
annuity interest as defined in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph; 
upon termination of such interest the residue of the trust is to revert 
to C. C's charitable contribution for 1970 is $3,400.85, determined as 
provided in Example (1). The trust earns income of $600 in 1970, $400 in 
1971, and $500 in 1972, all of which is taxable to C under section 671. 
The church is paid $500 at the end of 1970, 1971, and 1972, 
respectively. On December 31, 1972, C dies and ceases to be treated as 
the owner of the income interest under section 673.
    (b) Pursuant to subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, the discounted 
value as of January 1, 1970, of the amounts paid to the church by the 
trust is $1,336.51, determined by reference to column (4) of 
Sec. 20.2031-7A(c) of this chapter, as follows:

    (d) For deduction by the trust for amounts paid to the church after 
December 31, 1972, see section 642(c)(1) and the regulations thereunder.

    (d) Denial of deduction for certain contributions by a trust. (1) If 
by reason of section 170(f)(2)(B) and paragraph (c) of this section a 
charitable contributions deduction is allowed under section 170 for the 
fair market value of an income interest transferred in trust, neither 
the grantor of the income interest, the trust, nor any other person 
shall be allowed a deduction under section 170 or any other section for 
the amount of any charitable contribution made by the trust with respect 
to, or in fulfillment of, such income interest.
    (2) Section 170(f)(2)(C) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
shall not be construed, however, to:
    (i) Disallow a deduction to the trust, pursuant to section 642(c)(1) 
and the regulations thereunder, for amounts paid by the trust after the 
grantor ceases to be treated as the owner of the income interest for 
purposes of applying section 671 and which are not taken into account in 
determining the amount of recapture under paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section, or
    (ii) Disallow a deduction to the grantor under section 671 and 
Sec. 1.671-2(c) for a charitable contribution made by the trust in 
excess of the contribution required to be made by the trust under the 
terms of the trust instrument with respect to, or in fulfillment of, the 
income interest.
    (3) Although a deduction for the fair market value of an income 
interest in property which is less than the donor's entire interest in 
the property and which the donor transfers in trust is disallowed under 
section 170 because

[[Page 68]]

such interest is not a guaranteed annuity interest, or a unitrust 
interest, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the donor may 
be entitled to a deduction under section 671 and Sec. 1.671-2(c) for any 
charitable contributions made by the trust if he is treated as the owner 
of such interest for purposes of applying section 671.
    (e) Effective date. This section applies only to transfers in trust 
made after July 31, 1969.

Sec. 1.170A-7   Contributions not in trust of partial interests in property.

    (a) In general. (1) In the case of a charitable contribution, not 
made by a transfer in trust, of any interest in property which consists 
of less than the donor's entire interest in such property, no deduction 
is allowed under section 170 for the value of such interest unless the 
interest is an interest described in paragraph (b) of this section. See 
section 170(f)(3)(A). For purposes of this section, a contribution of 
the right to use property which the donor owns, for example, a rent-free 
lease, shall be treated as a contribution of less than the taxpayer's 
entire interest in such property.
    (2)(i) A deduction is allowed without regard to this section for a 
contribution of a partial interest in property if such interest is the 
taxpayer's entire interest in the property, such as an income interest 
or a remainder interest. Thus, if securities are given to A for life, 
with the remainder over to B, and B makes a charitable contribution of 
his remainder interest to an organization described in section 170(c), a 
deduction is allowed under section 170 for the present value of B's 
remainder interest in the securities. If, however, the property in which 
such partial interest exists was divided in order to create such 
interest and thus avoid section 170(f)(3)(A), the deduction will not be 
allowed. Thus, for example, assume that a taxpayer desires to contribute 
to a charitable organization an income interest in property held by him, 
which is not of a type described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If 
the taxpayer transfers the remainder interest in such property to his 
son and immediately thereafter contributes the income interest to a 
charitable organization, no deduction shall be allowed under section 170 
for the contribution of the taxpayer's entire interest consisting of the 
retained income interest. In further illustration, assume that a 
taxpayer desires to contribute to a charitable organization the 
reversionary interest in certain stocks and bonds held by him, which is 
not of a type described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If the 
taxpayer grants a life estate in such property to his son and 
immediately thereafter contributes the reversionary interest to a 
charitable organization, no deduction will be allowed under section 170 
for the contribution of the taxpayer's entire interest consisting of the 
reversionary interest.
    (ii) A deduction is allowed without regard to this section for a 
contribution of a partial interest in property if such contribution 
constitutes part of a charitable contribution not in trust in which all 
interests of the taxpayer in the property are given to a charitable 
organization described in section 170(c). Thus, if on March 1, 1971, an 
income interest in property is given not in trust to a church and the 
remainder interest in the property is given not in trust to an 
educational organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A), a deduction 
is allowed for the value of such property.
    (3) A deduction shall not be disallowed under section 170(f)(3)(A) 
and this section merely because the interest which passes to, or is 
vested in, the charity may be defeated by the performance of some act or 
the happening of some event, if on the date of the gift it appears that 
the possibility that such act or event will occur is so remote as to be 
negligible. See paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.170A-1.
    (b) Contributions of certain partial interests in property for which 
a deduction is allowed. A deduction is allowed under section 170 for a 
contribution not in trust of a partial interest which is less than the 
donor's entire interest in

[[Page 69]]

property and which qualifies under one of the following subparagraphs:
    (1) Undivided portion of donor's entire interest. (i) A deduction is 
allowed under section 170 for the value of a charitable contribution not 
in trust of an undivided portion of a donor's entire interest in 
property. An undivided portion of a donor's entire interest in property 
must consist of a fraction or percentage of each and every substantial 
interest or right owned by the donor in such property and must extend 
over the entire term of the donor's interest in such property and in 
other property into which such property is converted. For example, 
assuming that in 1967 B has been given a life estate in an office 
building for the life of A and that B has no other interest in the 
office building, B will be allowed a deduction under section 170 for his 
contribution in 1972 to charity of a one-half interest in such life 
estate in a transfer which is not made in trust. Such contribution by B 
will be considered a contribution of an undivided portion of the donor's 
entire interest in property. In further illustration, assuming that in 
1968 C has been given the remainder interest in a trust created under 
the will of his father and C has no other interest in the trust, C will 
be allowed a deduction under section 170 for his contribution in 1972 to 
charity of a 20-percent interest in such remainder interest in a 
transfer which is not made in trust. Such contribution by C will be 
considered a contribution of an undivided portion of the donor's entire 
interest in property. If a taxpayer owns 100 acres of land and makes a 
contribution of 50 acres to a charitable organization, the charitable 
contribution is allowed as a deduction under section 170. A deduction is 
allowed under section 170 for a contribution of property to a charitable 
organization whereby such organization is given the right, as a tenant 
in common with the donor, to possession, dominion, and control of the 
property for a portion of each year appropriate to its interest in such 
property. However, for purposes of this subparagraph a charitable 
contribution in perpetuity of an interest in property not in trust where 
the donor transfers some specific rights and retains other substantial 
rights will not be considered a contribution of an undivided portion of 
the donor's entire interest in property to which section 170(f)(3)(A) 
does not apply. Thus, for example, a deduction is not allowable for the 
value of an immediate and perpetual gift not in trust of an interest in 
original historic motion picture films to a charitable organization 
where the donor retains the exclusive right to make reproductions of 
such films and to exploit such reproductions commercially.
    (ii) With respect to contributions made on or before December 17, 
1980, for purposes of this subparagraph a charitable contribution of an 
open space easement in gross in perpetuity shall be considered a 
contribution of an undivided portion of the donor's entire interest in 
property to which section 170(f)(3)(A) does not apply. For this purpose 
an easement in gross is a mere personal interest in, or right to use, 
the land of another; it is not supported by a dominant estate but is 
attached to, and vested in, the person to whom it is granted. Thus, for 
example, a deduction is allowed under section 170 for the value of a 
restrictive easement gratuitously conveyed to the United States in 
perpetuity whereby the donor agrees to certain restrictions on the use 
of his property, such as, restrictions on the type and height of 
buildings that may be erected, the removal of trees, the erection of 
utility lines, the dumping of trash, and the use of signs. For the 
deductibility of a qualified conservation contribution, see Sec. 1.170A-
14.
    (2) Partial interests in property which would be deductible in 
trust. A deduction is allowed under section 170 for the value of a 
charitable contribution not in trust of a partial interest in property 
which is less than the donor's entire interest in the property and which 
would be deductible under section 170(f)(2) and Sec. 1.170A-6 if such 
interest had been transferred in trust.
    (3) Contribution of a remainder interest in a personal residence. A 
deduction is allowed under section 170 for the value of a charitable 
contribution not in trust of an irrevocable remainder interest in a 
personal residence which is not the donor's entire interest in such

[[Page 70]]

property. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer contributes not in trust to 
an organization described in section 170(c) a remainder interest in a 
personal residence and retains an estate in such property for life or 
for a term of years, a deduction is allowed under section 170 for the 
value of such remainder interest not transferred in trust. For purposes 
of section 170(f)(3)(B)(i) and this subparagraph, the term personal 
residence means any property used by the taxpayer as his personal 
residence even though it is not used as his principal residence. For 
example, the taxpayer's vacation home may be a personal residence for 
purposes of this subparagraph. The term personal residence also includes 
stock owned by a taxpayer as a tenant-stockholder in a cooperative 
housing corporation (as those terms are defined in section 216(b) (1) 
and (2)) if the dwelling which the taxpayer is entitled to occupy as 
such stockholder is used by him as his personal residence.
    (4) Contribution of a remainder interest in a farm. A deduction is 
allowed under section 170 for the value of a charitable contribution not 
in trust of an irrevocable remainder interest in a farm which is not the 
donor's entire interest in such property. Thus, for example, if a 
taxpayer contributes not in trust to an organization described in 
section 170(c) a remainder interest in a farm and retains an estate in 
such farm for life or for a term of years, a deduction is allowed under 
section 170 for the value of such remainder interest not transferred in 
trust. For purposes of section 170(f)(3)(B)(i) and this subparagraph, 
the term farm means any land used by the taxpayer or his tenant for the 
production of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products or for the 
sustenance of livestock. The term livestock includes cattle, hogs, 
horses, mules, donkeys, sheep, goats, captive fur-bearing animals, 
chickens, turkeys, pigeons, and other poultry. A farm includes the 
improvements thereon.
    (5) Qualified conservation contribution. A deduction is allowed 
under section 170 for the value of a qualified conservation 
contribution. For the definition of a qualified conservation 
contribution, see Sec. 1.170A-14.
    (c) Valuation of a partial interest in property. Except as provided 
in Sec. 1.170A-14, the amount of the deduction under section 170 in the 
case of a charitable contribution of a partial interest in property to 
which paragraph (b) of this section applies is the fair market value of 
the partial interest at the time of the contribution. See Sec. 1.170A-
1(c). The fair market value of such partial interest must be determined 
in accordance with Sec. 20.2031-7, of this chapter (Estate Tax 
Regulations), except that, in the case of a charitable contribution of a 
remainder interest in real property which is not transferred in trust, 
the fair market value of such interest must be determined in accordance 
with section 170(f)(4) and Sec. 1.170A-12. In the case of a charitable 
contribution of a remainder interest in the form of a remainder interest 
in a pooled income fund, a charitable remainder annuity trust, or a 
charitable remainder unitrust, the fair market value of the remainder 
interest must be determined as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of 
Sec. 1.170A-6. However, in some cases a reduction in the amount of a 
charitable contribution of the remainder interest may be required. See 
section 170(e) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.170A-4.
    (d) Illustrations. The application of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, an individual owning a 10-story office building, 
donates the rent-free use of the top floor of the building for the year 
1971 to a charitable organization. Since A's contribution consists of a 
partial interest to which section 170(f)(3)(A) applies, he is not 
entitled to a charitable contributions deduction for the contribution of 
such partial interest.
    Example 2. In 1971, B contributes to a charitable organization an 
undivided one-half interest in 100 acres of land, whereby as tenants in 
common they share in the economic benefits from the property. The 
present value of the contributed property is $50,000. Since B's 
contribution consists of an undivided portion of his entire interest in 
the property to which section 170(f)(3)(B) applies, he is allowed a 
deduction in 1971 for his charitable contribution of $50,000.
    Example 3. In 1971, D loans $10,000 in cash to a charitable 
organization and does not require the organization to pay any interest 
for the use of the money. Since D's contribution consists of a partial 
interest to which section 170(f)(3)(A) applies, he is not entitled

[[Page 71]]

to a charitable contributions deduction for the contribution of such 
partial interest.

    (e) Effective date. This section applies only to contributions made 
after July 31, 1969. The deduction allowable under Sec. 1.170A-
7(b)(1)(ii) shall be available only for contributions made on or before 
December 17, 1980. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.170A-
14(g)(4)(ii), the deduction allowable under Sec. 1.170A-7(b)(5) shall be 
available for contributions made on or after December 18, 1980.

<R05>
Sec. 1.170A-8   Limitations on charitable deductions by individuals.

    (a) Percentage limitations--(1) In general. An individual's 
charitable contributions deduction is subject to 20-, 30-, and 50-
percent limitations unless the individual qualifies for the unlimited 
charitable contributions deduction under section 170(b)(1)(C). For a 
discussion of these limitations and examples of their application, see 
paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. If a husband and wife make a 
joint return, the deduction for contributions is the aggregate of the 
contributions made by the spouses, and the limitations in section 170(b) 
and this section are based on the aggregate contribution base of the 
spouses. A charitable contribution by an individual to or for the use of 
an organization described in section 170(c) may be deductible even 
though all, or some portion, of the funds of the organization may be 
used in foreign countries for charitable or educational purposes.
    (2) ``To'' or ``for the use of'' defined. For purposes of section 
170, a contribution of an income interest in property, whether or not 
such contributed interest is transferred in trust, for which a deduction 
is allowed under section 170(f)(2)(B) or (3)(A) shall be considered as 
made ``for the use of'' rather than ``to'' the charitable organization. 
A contribution of a remainder interest in property, whether or not such 
contributed interest is transferred in trust, for which a deduction is 
allowed under section 170(f)(2)(A) or (3)(A), shall be considered as 
made ``to'' the charitable organization except that, if such interest is 
transferred in trust and, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, 
the interest contributed is, upon termination of the predecessor estate, 
to be held in trust for the benefit of such organization, the 
contribution shall be considered as made ``for the use of'' such 
organization. Thus, for example, assume that A transfers property to a 
charitable remainder annuity trust described in section 664(d)(1) which 
is required to pay to B for life an annuity equal to 5 percent of the 
initial fair market value of the property transferred in trust. The 
trust instrument provides that after B's death the remainder interest in 
the trust is to be transferred to M Church or, in the event M Church is 
not an organization described in section 170(c) when the amount is to be 
irrevocably transferred to such church, to an organization which is 
described in section 170(c) at that time. The contribution by A of the 
remainder interest shall be considered as made ``to'' M Church. However, 
if in the trust instrument A had directed that after B's death the 
remainder interest is to be held in trust for the benefit of M Church, 
the contribution shall be considered as made ``for the use of'' M 
Church. This subparagraph does not apply to the contribution of a 
partial interest in property, or of an undivided portion of such partial 
interest, if such partial interest is the donor's entire interest in the 
property and such entire interest was not created to avoid section 
170(f)(2) or (3)(A). See paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.170A-6 and 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (b)(1) of Sec. 1.170A-7.
    (b) 50-percent limitation. An individual may deduct charitable 
contributions made during a taxable year to any one or more section 
170(b)(1)(A) organizations, as defined in Sec. 1.170A-9, to the extent 
that such contributions in the aggregate do not exceed 50 percent of his 
contribution base, as defined in section 170(b)(1)(F) and paragraph (e) 
of this section, for the taxable year. However, see paragraph (d) of 
this section for a limitation on the amount of charitable contributions 
of 30-percent capital gain property. To qualify for the 50-percent

[[Page 72]]

limitation the contributions must be made ``to,'' and not merely ``for 
the use of,'' one of the specified organizations. A contribution to an 
organization referred to in section 170(c)(2), other than a section 
170(b)(1)(A) organization, will not qualify for the 50-percent 
limitation even though such organization makes the contribution 
available to an organization which is a section 170 (b)(1)(A) 
organization. For provisions relating to the carryover of contributions 
in excess of 50-percent of an individual's contribution base see section 
170(d)(1) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-10.
    (c) 20-percent limitation. (1) An individual may deduct charitable 
contributions made during a taxable year:
    (i) To any one or more charitable organizations described in section 
170(c) other than section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations, as defined in 
Sec. 1.170A-9, and,
    (ii) For the use of any charitable organization described in section 
170(c), to the extent that such contributions in the aggregate do not 
exceed the lesser of the limitations under subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph.
    (2) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the 
limitations are:
    (i) 20 percent of the individual's contribution base, as defined in 
paragraph (e) of this section, for the taxable year, or
    (ii) The excess of 50 percent of the individual's contribution base, 
as so defined, for the taxable year over the total amount of the 
charitable contributions allowed under section 170(b)(1)(A) and 
paragraph (b) of this section, determined by first reducing the amount 
of such contributions under section 170(e)(1) and paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 1.170A-4 but without applying the 30-percent limitation under 
section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

However, see paragraph (d) of this section for a limitation on the 
amount of charitable contributions of 30-percent capital gain property. 
If an election under section 170(b)(1)(D)(iii) and paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section applies to any contributions of 30-percent capital gain 
property made during the taxable year or carried over to the taxable 
year, the amount allowed for the taxable year under paragraph (b) of 
this section with respect to such contributions for purposes of applying 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be the reduced amount of 
such contributions determined by applying paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (d) 30-percent limitation--(1) In general. An individual may deduct 
charitable contributions of 30-percent capital gain property, as defined 
in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, made during a taxable year to or 
for the use of any charitable organization described in section 170(c) 
to the extent that such contributions in the aggregate do not exceed 30-
percent of his contribution base, as defined in paragraph (e) of this 
section, subject, however, to the 50- and 20-percent limitations 
prescribed by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For purposes of 
applying the 50-percent and 20-percent limitations described in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, charitable contributions of 30-
percent capital gain property paid during the taxable year, and limited 
as provided by this subparagraph, shall be taken into account after all 
other charitable contributions paid during the taxable year. For 
provisions relating to the carryover of certain contributions of 30-
percent capital gain property in excess of 30-percent of an individual's 
contribution base, see section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (c) of 
Sec. 1.170A-10.
    (2) Election by an individual to have section 170(e)(1)(B) apply to 
contributions-- (i) In general. (a) An individual may elect under 
section 170(b)(1)(D)(iii) for any taxable year to have the reduction 
rule of section 170(e)(1)(B) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.170A-4 apply to 
all his charitable contributions of 30-percent capital gain property 
made during such taxable year or carried over to such taxable year from 
a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969. If such election is 
made such contributions shall be treated as contributions of section 
170(e) capital gain property in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of 
Sec. 1.170A-4. The election may be made with respect to contributions of 
30-percent capital gain property carried over to the taxable year even 
though the individual has not made any contribution of 30-percent 
capital gain property in such year. If such an election is made,

[[Page 73]]

section 170(b)(1)(D) (i) and (ii) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
shall not apply to such contributions made during such year. However, 
such contributions must be reduced as required under section 
170(e)(1)(B) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.170A-4.
    (b) If there are carryovers to such taxable year of charitable 
contributions of 30-percent capital gain property made in preceding 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, the amount of such 
contributions in each such preceding year shall be reduced as if section 
170(e)(1)(B) had applied to them in the preceding year and shall be 
carried over to the taxable year and succeeding taxable years under 
section 170(d)(1) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-10 as contributions 
of property other than 30-percent capital gain property. For purposes of 
applying the immediately preceding sentence, the percentage limitations 
under section 170(b) for the preceding taxable year and for any taxable 
years intervening between such year and the year of the election shall 
not be redetermined and the amount of any deduction allowed for such 
years under section 170 in respect of the charitable contributions of 
30-percent capital gain property in the preceding taxable year shall not 
be redetermined. However, the amount of the deduction so allowed under 
section 170 in the preceding taxable year must be subtracted from the 
reduced amount of the charitable contributions made in such year in 
order to determine the excess amount which is carried over from such 
year under section 170(d)(1). If the amount of the deduction so allowed 
in the preceding taxable year equals or exceeds the reduced amount of 
the charitable contributions, there shall be no carryover from such year 
to the year of the election.
    (c) An election under this subparagraph may be made for each taxable 
year in which charitable contributions of 30-percent capital gain 
property are made or to which they are carried over under section 
170(b)(1)(D)(ii). If there are also carryovers under section 170(d)(1) 
to the year of the election by reason of an election made under this 
subparagraph for a previous taxable year, such carryovers under section 
170(d)(1) shall not be redetermined by reason of the subsequent 
election.
    (ii) Husband and wife making joint return. If a husband and wife 
make a joint return of income for a contribution year and one of the 
spouses elects under this subparagraph in a later year when he files a 
separate return, or if a spouse dies after a contribution year for which 
a joint return is made, any excess contribution of 30-percent capital 
gain property which is carried over to the election year from the 
contribution year shall be allocated between the husband and wife as 
provided in paragraph (d)(4) (i) and (iii) of Sec. 1.170A-10. If a 
husband and wife file separate returns in a contribution year, any 
election under this subparagraph in a later year when a joint return is 
filed shall be applicable to any excess contributions of 30-percent 
capital gain property of either taxpayer carried over from the 
contribution year to the election year. The immediately preceding 
sentence shall also apply where two single individuals are subsequently 
married and file a joint return. A remarried individual who filed a 
joint return with his former spouse for a contribution year and 
thereafter files a joint return with his present spouse shall treat the 
carryover to the election year as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of 
Sec. 1.170A-10.
    (iii) Manner of making election. The election under subdivision (i) 
of this subparagraph shall be made by attaching to the income tax return 
for the election year a statement indicating that the election under 
section 170(b)(1)(D)(iii) and this subparagraph is being made. If there 
is a carryover to the taxable year of any charitable contributions of 
30-percent capital gain property from a previous taxable year or years, 
the statement shall show a recomputation, in accordance with this 
subparagraph and Sec. 1.170A-4, of such carryover, setting forth 
sufficient information with respect to the previous taxable year or any 
intervening year to show the basis of the recomputation. The statement 
shall indicate the district director, or the director of the internal 
revenue service center, with whom the return for the previous taxable 
year or years was filed, the name

[[Page 74]]

or names in which such return or returns were filed, and whether each 
such return was a joint or separate return.
    (3) 30-percent capital gain property defined. If there is a 
charitable contribution of a capital asset which, if it were sold by the 
donor at its fair market value at the time of its contribution, would 
result in the recognition of gain all, or any portion, of which would be 
long-term capital gain and if the amount of such contribution is not 
required to be reduced under section 170(e)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.170A-
4(a)(2), such capital asset shall be treated as ``30-percent capital 
gain property'' for purposes of section 170 and the regulations 
thereunder. For such purposes any property which is property used in the 
trade or business, as defined in section 1231(b), shall be treated as a 
capital asset. However, see paragraph (b)(4) of Sec. 1.170A-4. For the 
treatment of such property as section 170(e) capital gain property, see 
paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of Sec. 1.170A-4.
    (e) Contribution base defined. For purposes of section 170 the term 
contribution base means adjusted gross income under section 62, computed 
without regard to any net operating loss carryback to the taxable year 
under section 172. See section 170(b)(1)(F).
    (f) Illustrations. The application of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. B, an individual, reports his income on the calendar-year 
basis and for 1970 has a contribution base of $100,000. During 1970 he 
makes charitable contributions of $70,000 in cash, of which $40,000 is 
given to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations and $30,000 is given to 
other organizations described in section 170(c). Accordingly, B is 
allowed a charitable contributions deduction of $50,000 (50% of 
$100,000), which consists of the $40,000 contributed to section 
170(b)(1)(A) organizations and $10,000 of the $30,000 contributed to the 
other organizations. Under paragraph (c) of this section, only $10,000 
of the $30,000 contributed to the other organizations is allowed as a 
deduction since such contribution of $30,000 is allowed to the extent of 
the lesser of $20,000 (20% of $100,000) or $10,000 ([50% of 
$100,000]-$40,000 (contributions allowed under section 170(b)(1)(A) and 
paragraph (b) of this section)). Under section 170 (b)(1)(D)(ii) and 
(d)(1) and Sec. 1.170A-10, B is not allowed a carryover to 1971 or to 
any other taxable year for any of the $20,000 ($30,000-$10,000) not 
deductible under section 170(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of this section.
    Example 2. C, an individual, reports his income on the calendar-year 
basis and for 1970 has a contribution base of $100,000. During 1970 he 
makes charitable contributions of $40,000 in 30-percent capital gain 
property to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations and of $30,000 in cash to 
other organizations described in section 170(c). The 20-percent 
limitation in section 170(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of this section is 
applied before the 30-percent limitation in section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) and 
paragraph (d) of this section; accordingly section 170(b)(1)(B)(ii) 
limits the deduction for the $30,000 cash contribution to $10,000 ([50% 
of $100,000]- $40,000). The amount of the contribution of 30-percent 
capital gain property is limited by section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) and 
paragraph (d) of this section to $30,000 (30% of $100,000). Accordingly, 
C's charitable contributions deduction for 1970 is limited to $40,000 
($10,000+$30,000). Under section 170 (b)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (c) of 
Sec. 1.170A-10, C is allowed a carryover to 1971 of $10,000 
($40,000-$30,000) in respect of his contributions of 30-percent capital 
gain property. C is not allowed a carryover to 1971 or to any other 
taxable year for any of the $20,000 cash ($30,000-$10,000) not 
deductible under section 170(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of this section.
    Example 3. (a) D, an individual, reports his income on the calendar-
year basis and for 1970 has a contribution base of $100,000. During 1970 
he makes charitable contributions of $70,000 in cash, of which $40,000 
is given to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations and $30,000 is given to 
other organizations described in section 170(c). During 1971 D makes 
charitable contributions to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization of 
$12,000, consisting of cash of $1,000 and $11,000 in 30-percent capital 
gain property. His contribution base for 1971 is $10,000.
    (b) For 1970, D is allowed a charitable contributions deduction of 
$50,000 (50% of $100,000), which consists of the $40,000 contributed to 
section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations and $10,000 of the $30,000 
contributed to the other organizations. Under paragraph (c) of this 
section, only $10,000 of the $30,000 contributed to the other 
organizations is allowed as a deduction since such contribution of 
$30,000 is allowed to the extent of the lesser of $20,000 (20% of 
$100,000) or $10,000 ([50% of $100,000]-$40,000 (contributions allowed 
under section 170(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section)). D is not 
allowed a carryover to 1971 or to any other taxable year for any of the 
$20,000 ($30,000-$10,000) not deductible under section 170(b)(1)(B) and 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) For 1971, D is allowed a charitable contributions deduction of 
$4,000, consisting of $1,000 cash and $3,000 of the 30-percent capital 
gain property (30% of $10,000). Under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and 
paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.170A-10, D is allowed a carryover to 1972 of 
$8,000

[[Page 75]]

($11,000-$3,000) in respect of his contribution of 30-percent capital 
gain property in 1971.
    Example 4. (a) E, an individual, reports his income on the calendar-
year basis and for 1970 has a contribution base of $100,000. During 1970 
he makes charitable contributions of $70,000 in cash, of which $40,000 
is given to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations and $30,000 is given to 
other organizations described in section 170(c). During 1971 E makes 
charitable contributions to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization of 
$14,000 consisting of cash of $3,000 and $11,000 in 30-percent capital 
gain property. His contribution base for 1971 is $10,000.
    (b) For 1970, E is allowed a charitable contributions deduction of 
$50,000 (50% of $100,000), which consists of the $40,000 contributed to 
section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations and $10,000 of the $30,000 
contributed to the other organizations. Under paragraph (c) of this 
section, only $10,000 of the $30,000 contributed to the other 
organizations is allowed as a deduction since such contribution of 
$30,000 is allowed to the extent of the lesser of $20,000 (20% of 
$100,000) or ($10,000 ([50% of $100,000]-$40,000 (contributions allowed 
under section 170(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section)). E is not 
allowed a carryover to 1971 or to any other taxable year for any of the 
$20,000 ($30,000-$10,000) not deductible under section 170(b)(1)(B) and 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) For 1971, E is allowed a charitable contributions deduction of 
$5,000 (50% of $10,000), consisting of $3,000 cash and $2,000 of the 
$3,000 (30% of $10,000) 30-percent capital gain property which is taken 
into account. This result is reached because, as provided in section 
170(b)(1)(D)(i) and paragraph (d)(1) of this section, cash contributions 
are taken into account before charitable contributions of 30-percent 
capital gain property. Under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and (d)(1) and 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 1.170A-10, E is allowed a carryover of 
$9,000 ([$11,000-$3,000] plus [$6,000 -$5,000]) to 1972 in respect of 
his contribution of 30-percent capital gain property in 1971.
    Example 5. In 1970, C, a calendar-year individual taxpayer, 
contributes to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations the amount of $8,000, 
consisting of $3,000 in cash and $5,000 in 30-percent capital gain 
property. In 1970, C also makes charitable contributions of $8,500 in 30 
percent capital gain property to other organizations described in 
section 170(c). C's contribution base for 1970 is $20,000. The 20-
percent limitation in section 170(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of this 
section is applied before the 30-percent limitation in section 
170(b)(1)(D)(i) and paragraph (d) of this section; accordingly, section 
170(b)(1)(B)(ii) limits the deduction for the $8,500 of contributions to 
the other organizations described in section 170(c) to $2,000 ([50% of 
$20,000]-[$3,000+$5,000]). However, the total amount of contributions of 
30-percent capital gain property which is allowed as a deduction for 
1970 is limited by section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) and paragraph (d) of this 
section to $6,000 (30% of $20,000), consisting of the $5,000 
contribution to the section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations and $1,000 of the 
contributions to the other organizations described in section 170(c). 
Accordingly C is allowed a charitable contributions deduction for 1970 
of $9,000, which consists of $3,000 cash and $6,000 of the $13,500 of 
30-percent capital gain property. C is not allowed to carryover to 1971 
or any other year the remaining $7,500 because his contributions of 30-
percent capital gain property for 1970 to section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organizations amount only to $5,000 and do not exceed $6,000 (30% of 
$20,000). Thus, the requirement of section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) is not 
satisfied.
    Example 6. During 1971, D, a calendar-year individual taxpayer, 
makes a charitable contribution to a church of $8,000, consisting of 
$5,000 in cash and $3,000 in 30-percent capital gain property. For such 
year, D's contribution base is $10,000. Accordingly, D is allowed a 
charitable contributions deduction for 1971 of $5,000 (50% of $10,000) 
of cash. Under section 170(d)(1) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-10, D 
is allowed a carryover to 1972 of his $3,000 contribution of 30-percent 
capital gain property, even though such amount does not exceed 30 
percent of his contribution base for 1971.
    Example 7. In 1970, E, a calendar-year individual taxpayer, makes a 
charitable contribution to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in the 
amount of $10,000, consisting of $8,000 in 30-percent capital gain 
property and of $2,000 (after reduction under section 170(e)) in other 
property. E's contribution base of 1970 is $20,000. Accordingly, E is 
allowed a charitable contributions deduction for 1970 of $8,000, 
consisting of the $2,000 of property the amount of which was reduced 
under section 170(e) and $6,000 (30% of $20,000) of the 30-percent 
capital gain property. Under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (c) 
of Sec. 1.170A-10, E is allowed to carryover to 1971 $2,000 
($8,000-$6,000) of his contribution of 30-percent capital gain property.
    Example 8. (a) In 1972, F, calendar-year individual taxpayer, makes 
a charitable contribution to a church of $4,000, consisting of $1,000 in 
cash and $3,000 in 30-percent capital gain property. In addition, F 
makes a charitable contribution in 1972 of $2,000 in cash to an 
organization described in section 170(c)(4). F also has a carryover from 
1971 under section 170(d)(1) of $5,000 (none of which consists of 
contributions of 30-percent capital gain property) and a carryover from 
1971 under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) of $6,000 of contributions of 30-
percent capital gain property. F's contribution base for 1972 is 
$11,000.
    Accordingly, F is allowed a charitable contributions deduction for 
1972 of $5,500 (50% of

[[Page 76]]

$11,000), which consists of $1,000 cash contributed in 1972 to the 
church, $3,000 of 30-percent capital gain property contributed in 1972 
to the church, and $1,500 (carryover of $5,000 but not to exceed 
[$5,500-($1,000 +$3,000)]) of the carryover from 1971 under section 
170(d)(1).
    (b) No deduction is allowed for 1972 for the contribution in that 
year of $2,000 cash to the section 170(c)(4) organization since section 
170(b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (c) of this section limit the deduction 
for such contribution to $0([50% of $11,000]-[$1,000 +$1,500+$3,000]). 
Moreover, F is not allowed a carryover to 1973 or to any other year for 
any of such $2,000 cash contributed to the section 170(c)(4) 
organization.
    (c) Under section 170(d)(1) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-10, F 
is allowed a carryover to 1973 from 1971 of $3,500 ($5,000-$1,500) of 
contributions of other than 30-percent capital gain property. Under 
section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.170A-10, F is 
allowed a carryover to 1973 from 1971 of $6,000 ($6,000-$0 of such 
carryover treated as paid in 1972) of contributions of 30-percent 
capital gain property. The portion of such $6,000 carryover from 1971 
which is treated as paid in 1972 is $0 ([50% of $11,000]-[$4,000 
contributions to the church in 1972 plus $1,500 of section 170(d)(1) 
carryover treated as paid in 1972]).
    Example 9. (a) In 1970, A, a calendar-year individual taxpayer, 
makes a charitable contribution to a church of 30-percent capital gain 
property having a fair market value of $60,000 and an adjusted basis of 
$10,000. A's contribution base for 1970 is $50,000, and he makes no 
other charitable contributions in that year. A does not elect for 1970 
under paragraph (d)(2) of this section to have section 170(e)(1)(B) 
apply to such contribution. Accordingly, under section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) 
and paragraph (d) of this section, A is allowed a charitable 
contributions deduction for 1970 of $15,000 (30% of $50,000). Under 
section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.170A-10, A is 
allowed a carryover to 1971 of $45,000 ($60,000-$15,000) for his 
contribution of 30-percent capital gain property.
    (b) In 1971, A makes a charitable contribution to a church of 30-
percent capital gain property having a fair market value of $11,000 and 
an adjusted basis of $10,000. A's contribution base for 1971 is $60,000, 
and he makes no other charitable contributions in that year. A elects 
for 1971 under paragraph (d)(2) of this section to have section 
170(e)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.170A-4 apply to his contribution of $11,000 in 
that year and to his carryover of $45,000 from 1970. Accordingly, he is 
required to recompute his carryover from 1970 as if section 170(e)(1)(B) 
had applied to his contribution of 30-percent capital gain property in 
that year.
    (c) If section 170(e)(1)(B) had applied in 1970 to his contribution 
of 30-percent capital gain property, A's contribution would have been 
reduced from $60,000 to $35,000, the reduction of $25,000 being 50 
percent of the gain of $50,000 ($60,000-$10,000) which would have been 
recognized as long-term capital gain if the property had been sold by A 
at its fair market value at the time of the contribution in 1970. 
Accordingly, by taking the election under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section into account, A has a recomputed carryover to 1971 of $20,000 
($35,000- $15,000) of his contribution of 30-percent capital gain 
property in 1970. However, A's charitable contributions deduction of 
$15,000 allowed for 1970 is not recomputed by reason of the election.
    (d) Pursuant to the election for 1971, the contribution of 30-
percent capital gain property for 1971 is reduced from $11,000 to 
$10,500, the reduction of $500 being 50 percent of the gain of $1,000 
($11,000-$10,000) which would have been recognized as long-term capital 
gain if the property had been sold by A at its fair market value at the 
time of its contribution in 1971.
    (e) Accordingly, A is allowed a charitable contributions deduction 
for 1971 of $30,000 (total contributions of $30,500 [$20,000+ $10,500] 
but not to exceed 50% of $60,000).
    (f) Under section 170(d)(1) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-10, A 
is allowed a carryover of $500 ($30,500-$30,000) to 1972 and the 3 
succeeding taxable years. The $500 carryover, which by reason of the 
election is no longer treated as a contribution of 30-percent capital 
gain property, is treated as carried over under paragraph (b) of 
Sec. 1.170A-10 from 1970 since in 1971 current year contributions are 
deducted before contributions which are carried over from preceding 
taxable years.
    Example 10. The facts are the same as in Example (9) except that A 
also makes a charitable contribution in 1971 of $2,000 cash to a private 
foundation not described in section 170(b)(1)(E) and that A's 
contribution base for that year is $62,000, instead of $60,000. 
Accordingly, A is allowed a charitable contributions deduction for 1971 
of $31,000, determined in the following manner Under section 
170(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section, A is allowed a 
charitable contributions deduction for 1971 of $30,500, consisting of 
$10,500 of property contributed to the church in 1971 and of $20,000 
(carryover of $20,000 but not to exceed [($62,000 x 50%)-$10,500]) of 
contributions of property carried over to 1971 under section 170(d)(1) 
and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-10. Under section 170(b)(1)(B) and 
paragraph (c) of this section, A is allowed a charitable contributions 
deduction for 1971 of $500 ([50% of $62,000]-[$10,500+ $20,000]) of cash 
contributed to the private foundation in that year. A is not allowed a 
carryover to 1972 or to any other taxable year for any of the $1,500 
($2,000-$500) cash not deductible in 1971 under section 170(b)(1)(B) and 
paragraph (c) of this section.

[[Page 77]]

    Example 11. The facts are the same as in Example (9) except that A's 
contribution base for 1970 is $120,000. Thus, before making the election 
under paragraph (d)(2) of this section for 1971, A is allowed a 
charitable contributions deduction for 1970 of $36,000 (30% of $120,000) 
and is allowed a carryover to 1971 of $24,000 ($60,000-$36,000). By 
making the election for 1971, A is required to recompute the carryover 
from 1970, which is reduced from $24,000 to zero, since the charitable 
contributions deduction of $36,000 allowed for 1970 exceeds the reduced 
$35,000 contribution for 1970 which iay be taken into account by reason 
of the election for 1971. Accordingly, A is allowed a deduction for 1971 
of $10,500 and is allowed no carryover to 1972, since the reduced 
contribution for 1971 ($10,500) does not exceed the limitation of 
$30,000 (50% of $60,000) for 1971 which applies under section 170(d)(1) 
and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-10. A's charitable contributions 
deduction of $36,000 allowed for 1970 is not recomputed by reason of the 
election. Thus, it is not to A's advantage to make the election under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    Example 12. (a) B, an individual, reports his income on the 
calendar-year basis and for 1970 has a contribution base of $100,000. 
During 1970 he makes charitable contributions of $70,000, consisting of 
$50,000 in 30-percent capital gain property contributed to a church and 
$20,000 in cash contributed to a private foundation not described in 
section 170(b)(1)(E). For 1971, B's contribution base is $40,000, and in 
that year he makes a charitable contribution of $5,000 in cash to such 
private foundation. During the years involved B makes no other 
charitable contributions.
    (b) The amount of the contribution of 30-percent capital gain 
property which may be taken into account for 1970 is limited by section 
170(b)(1)(D)(i) and paragraph (d) of this section to $30,000 (30% of 
$100,000). Accordingly, under section 170(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of 
this section B is allowed a deduction for 1970 of $30,000 of 30-percent 
capital gain property (contribution of $30,000 but not to exceed $50,000 
[50% of $100,000]). No deduction is allowed for 1970 for the 
contribution in that year of $20,000 of cash to the private foundation 
since section 170(b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (c) of this section limit 
the deduction for such contribution to $0 ([50% of $100,000]- $50,000, 
the amount of the contribution of 30-percent capital gain property).
    (c) Under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.170A-
10, B is allowed a carryover to 1971 of $20,000 ($50,000-[30% of 
$100,000]) of his contribution in 1970 of 30-percent capital gain 
property. B is not allowed a carryover to 1971 or to any other taxable 
year for any of the $20,000 cash contribution in 1970 which is not 
deductible under section 170(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of this section.
    (d) The amount of the contribution of 30-percent capital gain 
property which may be taken into account for 1971 is limited by section 
170(b)(1)(D)(i) and paragraph (d) of this section to $12,000 (30% of 
$40,000).
    Accordingly, under section 170(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this 
section B is allowed a deduction for 1971 of $12,000 of 30-percent 
capital gain property (contribution of $12,000 but not to exceed $20,000 
[50% of $40,000]). No deduction is allowed for 1971 for the contribution 
in that year of $5,000 of cash to the private foundation, since section 
170(b)(1)(B)(ii) and paragraph (c) of this section limit the deduction 
for such contribution to $0 ([50% of $40,000] -$20,000 carryover of 30-
percent capital gain property from 1970).
    (e) Under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.170A-
10, B is allowed a carryover to 1972 of $8,000 ($20,000-[30% of 
$40,000]) of his contribution in 1970 of 30-percent capital gain 
property. B is not allowed a carryover to 1972 or to any other taxable 
year for any of the $5,000 cash contribution for 1971 which is not 
deductible under section 170(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of this section.
    Example 13. D, an individual, reports his income on the calendar-
year basis and for 1970 has a contribution base of $100,000. On March 1, 
1970, he contributes to a church intangible property to which section 
1245 applies which has a fair market value of $60,000 and an adjusted 
basis of $10,000. At the time of the contribution D has used the 
property in his business for more than 6 months. If the property had 
been sold by D at its fair market value at the time of its contribution, 
it is assumed that under section 1245 $20,000 of the gain of $50,000 
would have been treated as ordinary income and $30,000 would have been 
long-term capital gain. Since the property contributed is ordinary 
income property within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.170A-4, 
D's contribution of $60,000 is reduced under paragraph (a)(1) of such 
section to $40,000 ($60,000-$20,000 ordinary income). However, since the 
property contributed is also 30-percent capital gain property within the 
meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, D's deduction for 1970 is 
limited by section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) and paragraph (d) of this section to 
$30,000 (30% of $100,000). Under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph 
(c) of Sec. 1.170A-10, D is allowed to carry over to 1971 $10,000 
($40,000-$30,000) of his contribution of 30-percent capital gain 
property.
    Example 14. C, an individual, reports his income on the calendar-
year basis and for 1970 has a contribution base of $50,000. During 1970 
he makes charitable contributions to a church of $57,000, consisting of 
$2,000 cash and of 30-percent capital gain property with a fair market 
value of $55,000 and an adjusted basis of $15,000. In addition, C 
contributes $3,000 cash in 1970 to a private foundation not described in 
section 170(b)(1)(E). For 1970, C elects under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section

[[Page 78]]

to have section 170(e)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.170A-4(a) apply to his 
contribution of property to the church. Accordingly, for 1970 C's 
contribution of property to the church is reduced from $55,000 to 
$35,000, the reduction of $20,000 being 50 percent of the gain of 
$40,000 ($55,000 -$15,000) which would have been recognized as long-term 
capital gain if the property had been sold by C at its fair market value 
at the time of its contribution to the church. Under section 
170(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section, C is allowed a 
charitable contributions deduction for 1970 of $25,000 ([$2,000+$35,000] 
but not to exceed [$50,000 x 50%]). Under section 170(d)(1) and 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-10, C is allowed a carryover from 1970 to 
1971 of $12,000 ($37,000-$25,000). No deduction is allowed for 1970 for 
the contribution in that year of $3,000 cash to the private foundation 
since section 170(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of this section limit the 
deduction for such contribution to the smaller of $10,000 
($50,000 x 20%) or $0 ([$50,000 x 50%]-$25,000). C is not allowed a 
carryover from 1970 for any of the $3,000 cash contribution in that year 
which is not deductible under section 170(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of 
this section.
    Example 15. (a) D, an individual, reports his income on the 
calendar-year basis and for 1970 has a contribution base of $100,000. 
During 1970 he makes a charitable contribution to a church of 30-percent 
capital gain property with a fair market value of $40,000 and an 
adjusted basis of $21,000. In addition, he contributes $23,000 cash in 
1970 to a private foundation not described in section 170(b)(1)(E). For 
1970, D elects under paragraph (d)(2) of this section to have section 
170(e)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.170A-4(a) apply to his contribution of property 
to the church. Accordingly, for 1970 D's contribution of property to the 
church is reduced from $40,000 to $30,500, the reduction of $9,500 being 
50 percent of the gain of $19,000 ($40,000-$21,000) which would have 
been recognized as long-term capital gain if the property had been sold 
by D at its fair market value at the time of its contribution to the 
church. Under section 170(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section, D 
is allowed a charitable contributions deduction for 1970 of $30,500 for 
the property contributed to the church. In addition, under section 
170(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of this section D is allowed a deduction 
of $19,500 for the cash contributed to the private foundation, since 
such contribution of $23,000 is allowed to the extent of the lesser of 
$20,000 (20% of $100,000) or $19,500 ([$100,000 x 50%]-$30,500). D is 
not allowed a carryover to 1971 or to any other taxable year for any of 
the $3,500 ($23,000-$19,500) of cash not deductible under section 
170(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) If D had not made the election under paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section for 1970, his deduction for 1970 under section 170(a) for the 
$40,000 contribution of property to the church would have been limited 
by section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) and paragraph (d) of this section to $30,000 
(30% of $100,000), and under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (c) 
of Sec. 1.170A-10 he would have been allowed a carryover to 1971 of 
$10,000 ($40,000-$30,000) for his contribution of such property. In 
addition, he would have been allowed under section 170(b)(1)(B)(ii) and 
paragraph (c) of this section for 1970 a charitable contributions 
deduction of $10,000 ([$100,000 x 50%]-$40,000) for the cash contributed 
to the private foundation. In such case, D would not have been allowed a 
carryover to 1971 or to any other taxable year for any of the $13,000 
($23,000-$10,000) of cash not deductible under section 170(b)(1)(B) and 
paragraph (c) of this section.

    (g) Effective date. This section applies only to contributions paid 
in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.

<R05>
Sec. 1.170A-9  Definition of section 170(b)(1)(A) organization.

    The term section 170(b)(1)(A) organization as used in the 
regulations under section 170 means any organization described in 
paragraphs (a) through (i) of this section, effective with respect to 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, except as otherwise 
provided. Section 1.170-2(b) shall continue to be applicable with 
respect to taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1970. The term 
one or more organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (other than 
in clauses (vii) and (viii)) as used in sections 507 and 509 of the Code 
and the regulations thereunder means one or more organizations described 
in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, except as modified by the 
regulations under part II of subchapter F of chapter I or under chapter 
42.
    (a) Church or a convention or association of churches. An 
organization is described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(i) if it is a church 
or a convention or association of churches.
    (b) Educational organization and organizations for the benefit of 
certain State and municipal colleges and universities--(1) Educational 
organization. An educational organization is described in section 
170(b)(1)(A)(ii) if its primary function is the presentation of formal 
instruction and it normally maintains

[[Page 79]]

a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly enrolled 
body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its 
educational activities are regularly carried on. The term includes 
institutions such as primary, secondary, preparatory, or high schools, 
and colleges and universities. It includes Federal, State, and other 
public-supported schools which otherwise come within the definition. It 
does not include organizations engaged in both educational and 
noneducational activities unless the latter are merely incidental to the 
educational activities. A recognized university which incidentally 
operates a museum or sponsors concerts is an educational organization 
within the meaning of section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii). However, the operation 
of a school by a museum does not necessarily qualify the museum as an 
educational organization within the meaning of this subparagraph.
    (2) Organizations for the benefit of certain State and municipal 
colleges and universities. (i) An organization is described in section 
170(b)(1)(A)(iv) if it meets the support requirements of subdivision 
(ii) of this subparagraph and is organized and operated exclusively to 
receive, hold, invest, and administer property and to make expenditures 
to or for the benefit of a college or university which is an 
organization described in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. The 
phrase ``expenditures to or for the benefit of a college or university'' 
includes expenditures made for any one or more of the normal functions 
of colleges and universities such as the acquisition and maintenance of 
real property comprising part of the campus area; the erection of, or 
participation in the erection of, college or university buildings; the 
acquisition and maintenance of equipment and furnishings used for, or in 
conjunction with, normal functions of colleges and universities; or 
expenditures for scholarships, libraries and student loans.
    (ii) To qualify under section 170(b)(1)(A)(iv), the organization 
receiving the contribution must normally receive a substantial part of 
its support from the United States or any State or political subdivision 
thereof or from direct or indirect contributions from the general 
public, or from a combination of two or more of such sources. For such 
purposes, the term ``support'' does not include income received in the 
exercise or performance by the organization of its charitable, 
educational, or other purpose or function constituting the basis for its 
exemption under section 501(a). An example of an indirect contribution 
from the public is the receipt by the organization of its share of the 
proceeds of an annual collection campaign of a community chest, 
community fund, or united fund. In determining the amount of support 
received by such organization with respect to a contribution of property 
which is subject to reduction under section 170(e), the fair market 
value of the property shall be taken into account.
    (iii) The college or university (including a land grant college or 
university) to be benefited must be an educational organization referred 
to in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
which is an agency or instrumentality of a State or political 
subdivision thereof, or which is owned or operated by a State or 
political subdivision thereof or by an agency or instrumentality of one 
or more States or political subdivisions.
    (c) Hospitals and medical research organizations--(1) Hospitals. An 
organization (other than one described in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph) is described in section 170(b)(1)(a)(iii) if:
    (i) It is a hospital, and
    (ii) Its principal purpose or function is the providing of medical 
or hospital care or medical education or medical research.

The term hospital includes (A) Federal hospitals and (B) State, county, 
and municipal hospitals which are instrumentalities of governmental 
units referred to in section 170(c)(1) and otherwise come within the 
definition. A rehabilitation institution, outpatient clinic, or 
community mental health or drug treatment center may qualify as a 
``hospital'' within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph 
if its principal purpose or function is the providing of hospital or 
medical care. For purposes of this subdivision, the term ``medical 
care'' shall include the treatment of any physical or mental disability 
or condition, whether on an inpatient or outpatient basis, provided

[[Page 80]]

the cost of such treatment is deductible under section 213 by the person 
treated. An organization, all the accommodations of which qualify as 
being part of a ``skilled nursing facility'' within the meaning of 42 
U.S.C. 1395x(j), may qualify as a ``hospital'' within the meaning of 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph if its principal purpose or 
function is the providing of hospital or medical care. For taxable years 
ending after June 28, 1968, the term ``hospital'' also includes 
cooperative hospital service organizations which meet the requirements 
of section 501(e) and Sec. 1.501(e)-1. The term ``hospital'' does not, 
however, include convalescent homes or homes for children or the aged, 
nor does the term include institutions whose principal purpose or 
function is to train handicapped individuals to pursue some vocation. An 
organization whose principal purpose or function is the providing of 
medical education or medical research will not be considered a 
``hospital'' within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, 
unless it is also actively engaged in providing medical or hospital care 
to patients on its premises or in its facilities, on an inpatient or 
outpatient basis, as an integral part of its medical education or 
medical research functions. See, however, subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph with respect to certain medical research organizations.
    (2) Certain medical research organizations--(i) Introduction. A 
medical research organization is described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(iii) 
if the principal purpose or functions of such organization are medical 
research and if it is directly engaged in the continuous active conduct 
of medical research in conjunction with a hospital. In addition, for 
purposes of the 50 percent limitation of section 170(b)(1)(A) with 
respect to a contribution, during the calendar year in which the 
contribution is made such organization must be committed to spend such 
contribution for such research before January 1 of the fifth calendar 
year which begins after the date such contribution is made. An 
organization need not receive contributions deductible under section 170 
to qualify as a medical research organization and such organization need 
not be committed to spend amounts to which the limitation of section 
170(b)(1)(A) does not apply within the 5-year period referred to in this 
subdivision. However, the requirement of continuous active conduct of 
medical research indicates that the type of organization contemplated in 
this subparagraph is one which is primarily engaged directly in the 
continuous active conduct of medical research, as compared to an 
inactive medical research organization or an organization primarily 
engaged in funding the programs of other medical research organizations. 
As in the case of a hospital, since an organization is ordinarily not 
described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(iii) as a hospital unless it functions 
primarily as a hospital, similarly a medical research organization is 
not so described unless it is primarily engaged directly in the 
continuous active conduct of medical research in conjunction with a 
hospital. Accordingly, the rules of this subparagraph shall only apply 
with respect to such medical research organizations.
    (ii) General rule. An organization (other than a hospital described 
in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph) is described in section 
170(b)(1)(A)(iii) only if within the meaning of this subparagraph:
    (a) The principal purpose or functions of such organization are to 
engage primarily in the conduct of medical research, and
    (b) It is primarily engaged directly in the continuous active 
conduct of medical research in conjunction with a hospital which is (1) 
described in section 501(c)(3), (2) a federal hospital, or (3) an 
instrumentality of a governmental unit referred to in section 170(c)(1).

However, in order for a contribution to such organization to qualify for 
purposes of the 50 percent limitation of section 170(b)(1)(A), during 
the calendar year in which such contribution is made or treated as made, 
such organization must be committed (within the meaning of subdivision 
(viii) of this subparagraph) to spend such contribution for such active 
conduct of medical research before January 1 of the fifth calendar year 
beginning after the date such contribution is made. For the meaning of 
the term ``medical research'' see subdivision (iii) of this 
subparagraph. For the meaning of the

[[Page 81]]

term ``principal purpose or functions'' see subdivision (iv) of this 
subparagraph. For the meaning of the term ``primarily engaged directly 
in the continuous active conduct of medical research'' see subdivision 
(v) of this subparagraph. For the meaning of the term ``medical research 
in conjunction with a hospital'' see subdivision (vii) of this 
subparagraph.
    (iii) Definition of medical research. Medical research means the 
conduct of investigations, experiments, and studies to discover, 
develop, or verify knowledge relating to the causes, diagnosis, 
treatment, prevention, or control of physical or mental diseases and 
impairments of man. To qualify as a medical research organization, the 
organization must have or must have continuously available for its 
regular use the appropriate equipment and professional personnel 
necessary to carry out its principal function. Medical research 
encompasses the associated disciplines spanning the biological, social 
and behavioral sciences. Such disciplines include chemistry, 
(biochemistry, physical chemistry, bioorganic chemistry, etc.), 
behavioral sciences (psychiatry, physiological psychology, 
neurophysiology, neurology, neurobiology, and social psychology, etc.), 
biomedical engineering (applied biophysics, medical physics, and medical 
electronics, e.g., developing pacemakers and other medically related 
electrical equipment), virology, immunology, biophysics, cell biology, 
molecular biology, pharmacology, toxicology, genetics, pathology, 
physiology, microbiology, parasitology, endocrinology, bacteriology, and 
epidemiology.
    (iv) Principal purpose or functions. An organization must be 
organized for the principal purpose of engaging primarily in the conduct 
of medical research in order to be an organization meeting the 
requirements of this subparagraph. An organization will normally be 
considered to be so organized if it is expressly organized for the 
purpose of conducting medical research and is actually engaged primarily 
in the conduct of medical research. Other facts and circumstances, 
however, may indicate that an organization does not meet the principal 
purpose requirement of this subdivision even where its governing 
instrument so expressly provides. An organization that otherwise meets 
all of the requirements of this subparagraph (including this 
subdivision) to qualify as a medical research organization will not fail 
to so qualify solely because its governing instrument does not 
specifically state that its principal purpose is to conduct medical 
research.
    (v) Primarily engaged directly in the continuous active conduct of 
medical research. (a) In order for an organization to be primarily 
engaged directly in the continuous active conduct of medical research, 
the organization must either devote a substantial part of its assets to, 
or expend a significant percentage of its endowment for, such purposes, 
or both. Whether an organization devotes a substantial part of its 
assets to, or makes significant expenditures for, such continuous active 
conduct depends upon the facts and circumstances existing in each 
specific case. An organization will be treated as devoting a substantial 
part of its assets to, or expending a significant percentage of its 
endowment for, such purposes if it meets the appropriate test contained 
in paragraph (c)(2)(v)(b) of this section. If an organization fails to 
satisfy both of such tests, in evaluating the facts and circumstances, 
the factor given most weight is the margin by which the organization 
failed to meet such tests. Some of the other facts and circumstances to 
be considered in making such a determination are:
    (1) If the organization fails to satisfy the tests because it failed 
to properly value its assets or endowment, then upon determination of 
the improper valuation it devotes additional assets to, or makes 
additional expenditures for, such purposes, so that it satisfies such 
tests on an aggregate basis for the prior year in addition to such tests 
for the current year.
    (2) The organization acquires new assets or has a significant 
increase in the value of its securities after it had developed a budget 
in a prior year based on the assets then owned and the then current 
values.
    (3) The organization fails to make expenditures in any given year 
because of the interrelated aspects of its budget

[[Page 82]]

and long-term planning requirements, for example, where an organization 
prematurely terminates an unsuccessful program and because of long-term 
planning requirements it will not be able to establish a fully 
operational replacement program immediately.
    (4) The organization has as its objective to spend less than a 
significant percentage in a particular year but make up the difference 
in the subsequent few years, or to budget a greater percentage earlier 
year and a lower percentage in in a later year.
    (b) For purposes of this section, an organization which devotes more 
than one half of its assets to the continuous active conduct of medical 
research will be considered to be devoting a substantial part of its 
assets to such conduct within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(v)(a) of 
this section. An organization which expends funds equaling 3.5 percent 
or more of the fair market value of its endowment for the continuous 
active conduct of medical research will be considered to have expended a 
significant percentage of its endowment for such purposes within the 
meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(v)(a) of this section.
    (c) Engaging directly in the continuous active conduct of medical 
research does not include the disbursing of funds to other organizations 
for the conduct of research by them or the extending of grants or 
scholarships to others. Therefore, if an organization's primary purpose 
is to disburse funds to other organizations for the conduct of research 
by them or to extend grants or scholarships to others, it is not 
primarily engaged directly in the continuous active conduct of medical 
research.
    (vi) Special rules. The following rules shall apply in determining 
whether a substantial part of an organization's assets are devoted to, 
or its endowment is expended for, the continuous active conduct of 
medical research activities:
    (a) An organization may satisfy the tests of paragraph (c)(2)(v)(b) 
of this section by meeting such tests either for a computation period 
consisting of the immediately preceding taxable year, or for the 
computation period consisting of the immediately preceding four taxable 
years. In addition, for taxable years beginning in 1970, 1971, 1972, 
1973, and 1974, if an organization meets such tests for the computation 
period consisting of the first four taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1969, an organization will be treated as meeting such 
tests, not only for the taxable year beginning in 1974, but also for the 
preceding four taxable years. Thus, for example, if a calendar year 
organization failed to satisfy such tests for a computation period 
consisting of 1969, 1970, 1971, or 1972, but on the basis of a 
computation period consisting of the years 1970 through 1973, it 
expended funds equaling 3.5 percent or more of the fair market value of 
its endowment for the continuous active conduct of medical research, 
such organization will be considered to have expended a significant 
percentage of its endowment for such purposes for the taxable years 1970 
through 1974. In applying such tests for a four-year computation period, 
although the organization's expenditures for the entire four-year period 
shall be aggregated, the fair market value of its endowment for each 
year shall be summed, even though, in the case of an asset held 
throughout the four-year period, the fair market value of such an asset 
will be counted four times. Similarly, the fair market value of an 
organization's assets for each year of a four-year computation period 
shall be summed.
    (b) Any property substantially all the use of which is 
``substantially related'' (within the meaning of section 514(b)(1)(A)) 
to the exercise or performance of the organization's medical research 
activities will not be treated as part of its endowment.
    (c) The valuation of assets must be made with commonly accepted 
methods of valuation. A method of valuation made in accordance with the 
principles stated in the regulations under section 2031 constitutes an 
acceptable method of valuation. Assets may be valued as of any day in 
the organization's taxable year to which such valuation applies, 
provided the organization follows a consistent practice of valuing such 
asset as of such date in all taxable years. For purposes of paragraph 
(c)(2)(v) of this section, an asset held by the organization for part of 
a taxable year shall be taken into account by multiplying the fair 
market

[[Page 83]]

value of such asset by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number 
of days in such taxable year that the foundation held such asset and the 
denominator of which is the number of days in such taxable year.
    (vii) Medical research in conjunction with a hospital. The 
organization need not be formally affiliated with a hospital to be 
considered primarily engaged directly in the continuous active conduct 
of medical research in conjunction with a hospital, but in any event 
there must be a joint effort on the part of the research organization 
and the hospital pursuant to an understanding that the two organizations 
will maintain continuing close cooperation in the active conduct of 
medical research. For example, the necessary joint effort will normally 
be found to exist if the activities of the medical research organization 
are carried on in space located within or adjacent to a hospital, the 
organization is permitted to utilize the facilities (including 
equipment, case studies, etc.) of the hospital on a continuing basis 
directly in the active conduct of medical research, and there is 
substantial evidence of the close cooperation of the members of the 
staff of the research organization and members of the staff of the 
particular hospital or hospitals. The active participation in medical 
research by members of the staff of the particular hospital or hospitals 
will be considered to be evidence of such close cooperation. Because 
medical research may involve substantial investigation, experimentation 
and study not immediately connected with hospital or medical care, the 
requisite joint effort will also normally be found to exist if there is 
an established relationship between the research organization and the 
hospital which provides that the cooperation of appropriate personnel 
and the use of facilities of the particular hospital or hospitals will 
be required whenever it would aid such research.
    (viii) Commitment to spend contributions. The organization's 
commitment that the contribution will be spent within the prescribed 
time only for the prescribed purposes must be legally enforceable. A 
promise in writing to the donor in consideration of his making a 
contribution that such contribution will be so spent within the 
prescribed time will constitute a commitment. The expenditure of 
contributions received for plant, facilities, or equipment, used solely 
for medical research purposes (within the meaning of subdivision (ii) of 
this subparagraph), shall ordinarily be considered to be an expenditure 
for medical research. If a contribution is made in other than money, it 
shall be considered spent for medical research if the funds from the 
proceeds of a disposition thereof are spent by the organization within 
the five-year period for medical research; or, if such property is of 
such a kind that it is used on a continuing basis directly in connection 
with such research, it shall be considered spent for medical research in 
the year in which it is first so used. A medical research organization 
will be presumed to have made the commitment required under this 
subdivision with respect to any contribution if its governing instrument 
or by-laws require that every contribution be spent for medical research 
before January 1 of the fifth year which begins after the date such 
contribution is made.
    (ix) Organizational period for new organizations. A newly created 
organization, for its ``organizational'' period, shall be considered to 
be primarily engaged directly in the continuous active conduct of 
medical research in conjunction with a hospital within the meaning of 
subdivisions (v) and (vii) of this subparagraph if during such period 
the organization establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner 
that it reasonably can be expected to be so engaged by the end of such 
period. The information to be submitted shall include detailed plans 
showing the proposed initial medical research program, architectural 
drawings for the erection of buildings and facilities to be used for 
medical research in accordance with such plans, plans to assemble a 
professional staff and detailed projections showing the timetable for 
the expected accomplishment of the foregoing. The ``organizational'' 
period shall be that period which is appropriate to implement the 
proposed plans, giving effect to the proposed amounts involved and the 
magnitude

[[Page 84]]

and complexity of the projected medical research program, but in no 
event in excess of three years following organization.
    (x) Examples. The application of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. N, an organization referred to in section 170(c)(2), was 
created to promote human knowledge within the field of medical research 
and medical education. All of N's assets were contributed to it by A and 
consist of a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. N's endowment 
earns 3.5 percent annually, which N expends in the conduct of various 
medical research programs in conjunction with Y hospital. N is located 
adjacent to Y hospital, makes substantial use of Y's facilities and 
there is close cooperation between the staffs of N and Y. N is directly 
engaged in the continuous active conduct of medical research in 
conjunction with a hospital, meets the principal purpose test described 
in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, and is therefore an 
organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(iii).
    Example 2. O, an organization referred to in section 170(c)(2), was 
created to promote human knowledge within the field of medical research 
and medical education. All of O's assets consist of a diversified 
portfolio of stocks and bonds. O's endowment earns 3.5 percent annually, 
which O expends in the conduct of various medical research programs in 
conjunction with certain hospitals. However, in 1974, O receives a 
substantial bequest of additional stocks and bonds. O's budget for 1974 
does not take into account the bequest and as a result O expends only 
3.1 percent of its endowment in 1974. However, O establishes that it 
will expend at least 3.5 percent of its endowment for the active conduct 
of medical research for taxable years 1975 through 1978. O is therefore 
directly engaged in the continuous active conduct of medical research in 
conjunction with a hospital for taxable year 1975. Since O also meets 
the principal purpose test described in subdivision (iv) of this 
subparagraph, it is therefore an organization described in section 
170(b)(1)(A)(iii) for taxable year 1975.
    Example 3. M, an organization referred to in section 170(c)(2), was 
created to promote human knowledge within the field of medical research 
and medical education. M's activities consist of the conduct of medical 
research programs in conjunction with various hospitals. Under such 
programs, researchers employed by M engage in research at laboratories 
set aside for M within the various hospitals. Substantially all of M's 
assets consists of 100 percent of the stock of X corporation, which has 
a fair market value of approximately 100 million dollars. X pays M 
approximately 3.3 million dollars in dividends annually, which M expends 
in the conduct of its medical research programs. Since M expends only 
3.3 percent of its endowment, which does not constitute a significant 
percentage, in the active conduct of medical research, M is not an 
organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(iii) because M is not 
engaged in the continuous active conduct of medical research.

    (xi) Special rule for organizations with existing ruling. This 
subdivision shall apply to an organization that prior to January 1, 
1970, had received a ruling or determination letter which has not been 
expressly revoked holding the organization to be a medical research 
organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(iii) and with respect to 
which the facts and circumstances on which the ruling was based have not 
substantially changed. An organization to which this subdivision applies 
shall be treated as an organization described in section 
170(b)(1)(A)(iii) for a period not ending prior to 90 days after 
February 13, 1976 (or where appropriate, for taxable years beginning 
before such 90th day). In addition, with respect to a grantor or 
contributor under sections 170, 507, 545(b)(2), 556(b)(2), 642(c), 4942, 
4945, 2055, 2106(a)(2), and 2522, the status of an organization to which 
this subdivision applies will not be affected until notice of change of 
status under section 170(b)(1)(A)(iii) is made to the public (such as by 
publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin). The preceding sentence 
shall not apply if the grantor or contributor had previously acquired 
knowledge that the Internal Revenue Service had given notice to such 
organization that it would be deleted from classification as a section 
170(b)(1)(A)(iii) organization.
    (d) Governmental unit. A governmental unit is described in section 
170(b)(1)(A)(v) if it is referred to in section 170(c)(1).
    (e) Definition of section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) organization--(1) In 
general. An organization is described in section 170 (b)(1)(A)(vi) if it 
is:
    (i) A corporation, trust, or community chest, fund, or foundation, 
referred to in section 170(c)(2) (other than an organization 
specifically described in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section), 
and
    (ii) A ``publicly supported'' organization.


[[Page 85]]


For purposes of this paragraph, an organization is publicly supported if 
it normally receives a substantial part of its support from a 
governmental unit referred to in section 170(c)(1) or from direct or 
indirect contributions from the general public. An organization will be 
treated as being ``public supported'' if it meets the requirements of 
either subparagraph (2) or subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Types of 
organizations which, subject to the provisions of this paragraph, 
generally qualify under section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) as ``publicly 
supported'' are publicly or governmentally supported museums of history, 
art, or science, libraries, community centers to promote the arts, 
organizations providing facilities for the support of an opera, symphony 
orchestra, ballet, or repertory drama or for some other direct service 
to the general public, and organizations such as the American Red Cross 
or the United Givers Fund.
    (2) Determination whether an organization is ``publicly supported''; 
33\1/3\ percent-of-support test. An organization will be treated as a 
``publicly supported'' organization if the total amount of support which 
the organization ``normally'' (as defined in subparagraph (4) of this 
paragraph) receives from governmental units referred to in section 
170(c)(1), from contributions made directly or indirectly by the general 
public, or from a combination of these sources, equals at least 33 1/3 
percent of the total support ``normally'' received by the organization. 
See subparagraphs (6), (7), and (8) of this paragraph for the definition 
of ``support.'' The application of this test is illustrated by Example 1 
of subparagraph (9) of this paragraph.
    (3) Determination whether an organization is ``publicly supported''; 
facts and circumstances test for organizations failing to meet 33 1/3 
percent-of-support test. Even if an organization fails to meet the 33 1/
3 percent-of-support test described in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph, it will be treated as a ``publicly supported'' organization 
if it normally receives a substantial part of its support from 
governmental units, from direct or indirect contributions from the 
general public, or from a combination of these sources, and meets the 
other requirements of this subparagraph. In order to satisfy this 
subparagraph, an organization must meet the requirements of subdivisions 
(i) and (ii) of this subparagraph in order to establish, under all the 
facts and circumstances, that it normally receives a substantial part of 
its support from governmental units or from direct or indirect 
contributions from the general public, and it must be in the nature of a 
``publicly supported'' organization, taking into account the factors 
described in subdivisions (iii) through (vii) of this subparagraph. The 
requirements and factors referred to in the preceding sentence with 
respect to a ``publicly supported'' organization (other than one 
described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph) are:
    (i) Ten percent-of-support limitation. The percentage of support 
``normally'' (as defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) received 
by an organization from governmental units, from contributions made 
directly or indirectly by the general public, or from a combination of 
these sources, must be ``substantial.'' For purposes of this 
subparagraph, an organization will not be treated as ``normally'' 
receiving a ``substantial'' amount of governmental or public support 
unless the total amount of governmental and public support ``normally'' 
received equals at least 10 percent of the total support ``normally'' 
received by such organization. See subparagraphs (6), (7), and (8) of 
this paragraph for the definition of ``support.''
    (ii) Attraction of public support. An organization must be so 
organized and operated as to attract new and additional public or 
governmental support on a continuous basis. An organization will be 
considered to meet this requirement if it maintains a continuous and 
bona fide program for solicitation of funds from the general public, 
community, or membership group involved, or if it carries on activities 
designed to attract support from governmental units or other 
organizations described in section 170 (b)(1)(A)(i) through (vi). In 
determining whether an organization maintains a continuous and bona fide 
program for solicitation of funds from the general public or community, 
consideration will be given to whether the scope of its fundraising 
activities is

[[Page 86]]

reasonable in light of its charitable activities. Consideration will 
also be given to the fact that an organization may, in its early years 
of existence, limit the scope of its solicitation to persons deemed most 
likely to provide seed money in an amount sufficient to enable it to 
commence its charitable activities and expand its solicitation program.

In addition to the requirements set forth in subdivisions (i) and (ii) 
of this subparagraph which must be satisfied, all pertinent facts and 
circumstances, including the following factors, will be taken into 
consideration in determining whether an organization is ``publicly 
supported'' within the meaning of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. 
However, an organization is not generally required to satisfy all of the 
factors in subdivisions (iii) through (vii) of this subparagraph. The 
factors relevant to each case and the weight accorded to any one of them 
may differ depending upon the nature and purpose of the organization and 
the length of time it has been in existence.
    (iii) Percentage of financial support. The percentage of support 
received by an organization from public or governmental sources will be 
taken into consideration in determining whether an organization is 
``publicly supported.'' The higher the percentage of support above the 
10 percent requirement of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph from 
public or governmental sources, the lesser will be the burden of 
establishing the publicly supported nature of the organization through 
other factors described in this subparagraph, while the lower the 
percentage, the greater will be the burden. If the percentage of the 
organization's support from public or governmental sources is low 
because it receives a high percentage of its total support from 
investment income on its endowment funds, such fact will be treated as 
evidence of compliance with this subdivision if such endowment funds 
were originally contributed by a governmental unit or by the general 
public. However, if such endowment funds were originally contributed by 
a few individuals or members of their families, such fact will increase 
the burden on the organization of establishing compliance with the other 
factors described in this subparagraph.
    (iv) Sources of support. The fact that an organization meets the 
requirement of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph through support from 
governmental units or directly or indirectly from a representative 
number of persons, rather than receiving almost all of its support from 
the members of a single family, will be taken into consideration in 
determining whether an organization is ``publicly supported.'' In 
determining what is a ``representative number of persons,'' 
consideration will be given to the type of organization involved, the 
length of time it has been in existence, and whether it limits its 
activities to a particular community or region or to a special field 
which can be expected to appeal to a limited number of persons.
    (v) Representative governing body. The fact that an organization has 
a governing body which represents the broad interests of the public, 
rather than the personal or private interests of a limited number of 
donors (or persons standing in a relationship to such donors which is 
described in section 4946(a)(1)(C) through (G) ) will be taken into 
account in determining whether an organization is ``publicly 
supported.'' An organization will be treated as meeting this requirement 
if it has a governing body (whether designated in the organization's 
governing instrument or bylaws as a Board of Directors, Board of 
Trustees, etc.) which is comprised of public officials acting in their 
capacities as such; of individuals selected by public officials acting 
in their capacities as such; of persons having special knowledge or 
expertise in the particular field or discipline in which the 
organization is operating; of community leaders, such as elected or 
appointed officials, clergymen, educators, civic leaders, or other such 
persons representing a broad cross-section of the views and interests of 
the community; or, in the case of a membership organization, of 
individuals elected pursuant to the organization's governing instrument 
or bylaws by a broadly based membership.
    (vi) Availability of public facilities or services; public 
participation in programs or policies. (a) The fact that an organization 
is of the type which generally

[[Page 87]]

provides facilities or services directly for the benefit of the general 
public on a continuing basis (such as a museum or library which holds 
open its building and facilities to the public, a symphony orchestra 
which gives public performances, a conservation organization which 
provides educational services to the public through the distribution of 
educational materials, or an old age home which provides domiciliary or 
nursing services for members of the general public) will be considered 
evidence that such organization is ``publicly supported.''
    (b) The fact that an organization is an educational or research 
institution which regularly publishes scholarly studies that are widely 
used by colleges and universities or by members of the general public 
will also be considered evidence that such organization is ``publicly 
supported.''
    (c) Similarly, the following factors will also be considered 
evidence that an organization is ``publicly supported:''
    (1) The participation in, or sponsorship of, the programs of the 
organization by members of the public having special knowledge or 
expertise, public officials, or civic or community leaders;
    (2) The maintenance of a definitive program by an organization to 
accomplish its charitable work in the community, such as slum clearance 
or developing employment opportunities; and
    (3) The receipt of a significant part of its funds from a public 
charity or governmental agency to which it is in some way held 
accountable as a condition of the grant, contract, or contribution.
    (vii) Additional factors pertinent to membership organizations. The 
following are additional factors to be considered in determining whether 
a membership organization is ``publicly supported'':
    (a) Whether the solicitation for dues-paying members is designed to 
enroll a substantial number of persons in the community or area, or in a 
particular profession or field of special interest (taking into account 
the size of the area and the nature of the organization's activities);
    (b) Whether membership dues for individual (rather than 
institutional) members have been fixed at rates designed to make 
membership available to a broad cross section of the interested public, 
rather than to restrict membership to a limited number of persons; and
    (c) Whether the activities of the organization will be likely to 
appeal to persons having some broad common interest or purpose, such as 
educational activities in the case of alumni associations, musical 
activities in the case of symphony societies, or civic affairs in the 
case of parent-teacher associations.

See Examples (2) through (5) contained in subparagraph (9) of this 
paragraph for illustrations of this subparagraph.
    (4) Definition of ``normally''; general rule--(i) Normally; one-
third support test. For purposes of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, 
an organization will be considered as ``normally'' meeting the 33 1/3 
percent-of-support test for its current taxable year and the taxable 
year immediately succeeding its current year, if, for the 4 taxable 
years immediately preceding the current taxable year, the organization 
meets the 33 1/3 percent-of-support test described in subparagraph (2) 
of this paragraph on an aggregate basis.
    (ii) Normally; facts and circumstances test. For purposes of 
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, an organization will be considered 
as ``normally'' meeting the requirements of subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph for its current taxable year and the taxable year immediately 
succeeding its current year, if, for the 4 taxable years immediately 
preceding the current taxable year, the organization meets the 
requirements of subparagraph (3) (i) and (ii) of this paragraph on an 
aggregate basis and satisfies a sufficient combination of the factors 
set forth in subparagraph (3) (iii) through (vii) of this paragraph. In 
the case of subparagraph (3) (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph, facts 
pertinent to years preceding 4 taxable years immediately preceding the 
current taxable year may also be taken into consideration. The 
combination of factors set forth in subparagraph (3) (iii) through (vii) 
of this paragraph which an organization ``normally'' must meet does not 
have to be the same for each 4-year period so long

[[Page 88]]

as there exists a sufficient combination of factors to show compliance 
with subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
    (iii) Special rule. The fact that an organization has ``normally'' 
met the requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for a current 
taxable year, but is unable ``normally'' to meet such requirements for a 
succeeding taxable year, will not in itself prevent such organization 
from meeting the requirements of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for 
such succeeding taxable year.
    (iv) Illustration. The application of subdivisions (i), (ii), and 
(iii) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. X, an organization described in section 170(c)(2), meets 
the 33 1/3 percent-of-support test described in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph in taxable year 1975 on the basis of support received during 
taxable years 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1974. It therefore ``normally'' 
meets the requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for 1975 
and 1976, the taxable year immediately succeeding 1975 (the current 
taxable year). For the taxable year 1976, X is unable to meet the 33 1/3 
percent-of-support test described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph 
on the basis of support received during taxable years 1972, 1973, 1974, 
and 1975. If X can meet the requirements of subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph on the basis of taxable years 1972, 1973, 1974, and 1975, X 
will meet the requirements of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for 
1977 (the taxable year immediately succeeding 1976, the current taxable 
year) under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. However, if on the 
basis of both the taxable years 1972 through 1975 and 1973 through 1976, 
X, fails to meet the requirements of both subparagraphs (2) and (3) of 
this paragraph, X will not be described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) for 
1977. However, X will not be disqualified as a section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) 
organization for taxable year 1976, because it ``normally'' met the 
requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph on the basis of the 
taxable years 1971 through 1974, unless the provisions of subdivision 
(v) of this subparagraph become applicable.

    (v) Exception for material changes in sources of support--(a) In 
general. If for the current taxable year there are substantial and 
material changes in an organization's sources of support other than 
changes arising from unusual grants excluded under subparagraph (6)(ii) 
of this paragraph, then in applying subparagraph (2) or (3) of this 
paragraph, neither the 4-year computation period applicable to such year 
as an immediately succeeding taxable year or as a current taxable year 
shall apply, and in lieu of such computation periods there shall be 
applied a computation period consisting of the taxable year of 
substantial and material changes and the 4 taxable years immediately 
preceding such year. Thus, for example, if there are substantial and 
material changes in an organization's sources of support for taxable 
year 1976, then even though such organization meets the requirements of 
subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph based on a computation period 
of taxable years 1971-74 or 1972-75, such an organization will not meet 
the requirements of section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) unless it meets the 
requirements of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph for a 
computation period consisting of the taxable years 1972-76. See Example 
3 in Sec. 1.509(a)-3(c)(6) for an illustration of a similar rule. An 
example of a substantial and material change is the receipt of an 
unusually large contribution or bequest which does not qualify as an 
unusual grant under subparagraph (6)(ii) of this paragraph. See 
subparagraph (6)(iv)(b) of this paragraph as to the procedure for 
obtaining a ruling whether an unusually large grant may be excluded as 
an unusual grant.
    (b) Status of grantors and contributors. If as a result of (a) of 
this subdivision, an organization is not able to meet the requirements 
of either the 33 1/3 percent-of-support test described in subparagraph 
(2) of this paragraph, or the facts and circumstances test described in 
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for its current taxable year, its 
status (with respect to a grantor or contributor under sections 170, 
507, 545(b)(2), 556(b)(2), 642(c), 4942, 4945, 2055, 2106(a)(2), and 
2522) will not be affected until notice of change of status under 
section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) is made to the public (such as by publication 
in the Internal Revenue Bulletin). The preceding sentence shall not 
apply, however, if the grantor or contributor was responsible for, or 
was aware of, the substantial and material change referred to in (a) of 
this subdivision, or acquired knowledge that the Internal Revenue 
Service had given notice to

[[Page 89]]

such organization that it would be deleted from classification as a 
section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) organization.
    (c) Reliance by grantors and contributors. A grantor or contributor, 
other than one of the organization's founders, creators, or foundation 
managers (within the meaning of section 4946(b)) will not be considered 
to be responsible for, or aware of, the substantial and material change 
referred to in (a) of this subdivision, if such grantor or contributor 
has made such grant or contribution in reliance upon a written statement 
by the grantee organization that such grant or contribution will not 
result in the loss of such organization's classification as a publicly 
supported organization as described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi). Such 
statement must be signed by a responsible officer of the grantee 
organization and must set forth sufficient information, including a 
summary of the pertinent financial data for the 4 preceding years, to 
assure a reasonably prudent man that his grant or contribution will not 
result in the loss of the grantee organization's classification as a 
publicly supported organization as described in section 
170(b)(1)(A)(vi). If a reasonable doubt exists as to the effect of such 
grant or contribution, or if the grantor or contributor is one of the 
organizations' founders, creators, or foundation managers, the procedure 
set forth in subparagraph (6)(iv)(b) of this paragraph may be followed 
by the grantee organization for the protection of the grantor or 
contributor.
    (vi) Special rule for new organizations. If an organization has been 
in existence for at least 1 taxable year consisting of at least 8 
months, but for fewer than 5 taxable years, the number of years for 
which the organization has been in existence immediately preceding each 
current taxable year being tested will be substituted for the 4-year 
period described in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph to 
determine whether the organization ``normally'' meets the requirements 
of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph. However, if subdivision 
(v)(a) of this subparagraph applies, then the period consisting of the 
number of years for which the organization has been in existence (up to 
and including the current year) will be substituted for the 4-year 
period described in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph. An 
organization which has been in existence for at least 1 taxable year, 
consisting of 8 or more months, may be issued a ruling or determination 
letter if it ``normally'' meets the requirements of subparagraph (2) or 
(3) of this paragraph for the number of years described in this 
subdivision. Such an organization may apply for a ruling or 
determination letter under the provisions of this subparagraph, rather 
than under the provisions of subparagraph (5) of this paragraph. The 
issuance of a ruling or determination letter will be discretionary with 
the Commissioner. See subparagraph (5)(v) of this paragraph as to the 
initial determination of the status of a newly created organization. 
This subdivision shall not apply to those organizations receiving an 
extended advance ruling under subparagraph (5)(iv) of this paragraph.
    (vii) Special rule for organizations with existing ruling. This 
subdivision shall apply to an organization that prior to January 1, 
1970, had received a ruling or determination letter which has not been 
expressly revoked holding the organization to be a publicly supported 
organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) and with respect to 
which the facts and circumstances on which the ruling was based have not 
substantially changed. An organization to which this subdivision applies 
shall be treated as an organization described in section 
170(b)(1)(A)(vi) for a period not ending prior to 90 days after December 
29, 1972. In addition, with respect to a grantor or contributor under 
sections 170, 507, 545(b)(2), 556(b)(2), 642(c), 4942, 4945, 2055, 
2106(a)(2), and 2522, the status of an organization to which this 
subdivision applies will not be affected until notice of change of 
status under section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) is made to the public (such as by 
publication in the Internal Revenue Bulletin). The preceding sentence 
shall not apply if the grantor or contributor had previously acquired 
knowledge that the Internal Revenue Service had given notice to such 
organization that it would be deleted from classification as a section 
170(b)(1)(A)(vi) organization.

[[Page 90]]

    (viii) Termination of status. For the transitional rules applicable 
to an organization that is unable to meet the requirements of this 
paragraph for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969 
(as extended by Sec. 1.507-2(j)) and wishes to terminate its private 
foundation status, see Sec. 1.507-2(c) (2) and (3).
    (ix) Status of ruling. The provisions of this subparagraph do not 
require an organization to file a new application with the Internal 
Revenue Service every 2 years in order to maintain or reaffirm its 
status as a ``publicly supported'' organization described in section 
170(b)(1)(A)(vi).
    (5) Advance rulings to newly created organizations--(i) In general. 
A ruling or determination letter that an organization is described in 
section 170 (b)(1)(A)(vi) will not be issued to a newly created 
organization prior to the close of its first taxable year consisting of 
at least 8 months. However, such organization may request a ruling or 
determination letter that it will be treated as a section 
170(b)(1)(A)(vi) organization for its first 2 taxable years (or its 
first 3 taxable years, if its first taxable year consists of less than 8 
months). For purposes of this section, such 2- or 3-year period, 
whichever is applicable, shall be referred to as the advance ruling 
period. Such an advance ruling or determination letter may be issued if 
the organization can reasonably be expected to meet the requirements of 
subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph during the advance ruling 
period. The issuance of a ruling or determination letter will be 
discretionary with the Commissioner.
    (ii) Basic consideration. In determining whether an organization can 
reasonably be expected (within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph) to meet the requirements of subparagraph (2) or (3) of 
this paragraph for its advance ruling period or extended advance ruling 
period as provided in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, if 
applicable, the basic consideration is whether its organizational 
structure, proposed programs or activities, and intended method of 
operation are such as to attract the type of broadly based support from 
the general public, public charities, and governmental units which is 
necessary to meet such tests. The information to be considered for this 
purpose shall consist of all pertinent facts and circumstances relating 
to the requirements set forth in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
    (iii) Status of newly created organizations--(a) Advance ruling. 
This subdivision shall apply to a newly created organization which has 
received an advance ruling or determination letter under subdivision (i) 
of this subparagraph, or an extended advance ruling or determination 
letter under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, that it will be 
treated as a section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) organization for its advance or 
extended advance ruling period. So long as such an organization's ruling 
or determination letter has not been terminated by the Commissioner 
before the expiration of the advance or extended advance ruling period, 
then whether or not such organization has satisfied the requirements of 
subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph during such advance or 
extended advance ruling period, such an organization will be treated as 
an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) in accordance with 
(b) and (c) of this subdivision, both for purposes of the organization 
and any grantor or contributor to such organization.
    (b) Reliance period. Except as provided in (a) and (c) of this 
subdivision, an organization described in (a) of this subdivision will 
be treated as an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) for 
all purposes other than sections 507(d) and 4940 for the period 
beginning with its inception and ending 90 days after its advance or 
extended advance ruling period. Such period will be extended until a 
final determination is made of such an organization's status only if the 
organization submits, within the 90-day period, information needed to 
determine whether it meets the requirements of subparagraph (2) or (3) 
of this paragraph for its advance or extended advance ruling period 
(even if such organization fails to meet the requirements of such 
subparagraph (2) or (3) ). However, since this subparagraph does not 
apply to the tax

[[Page 91]]

imposed by section 4940, if it is subsequently determined that the 
organization was a private foundation from its inception, then the tax 
imposed by section 4940 shall be due without regard to the advance or 
extended advance ruling or determination letter. Consequently, if any 
amount of tax under section 4940 in such a case is not paid on or before 
the last date prescribed for payment, the organization is liable for 
interest in accordance with section 6601. However, since any failure to 
pay such tax during the period referred to in this subparagraph is due 
to reasonable cause, the penalty under section 6651 with respect to the 
tax imposed by section 4940 shall not apply.
    (c) Grantors or contributors. If a ruling or determination letter is 
terminated by the Commissioner prior to the expiration of the period 
described in (b) of this subdivision, for purposes of sections 170, 507, 
545(b)(2), 556(b)(2), 642(c), 4942, 4945, 2055, 2106(a)(2), and 2522, 
the status of grants or contributions with respect to grantors or 
contributors to such organizations will not be affected until notice of 
change of status of such organization is made to the public (such as by 
publication of the Internal Revenue Bulletin). The preceding sentence 
shall not apply however, if the grantor or contributor was responsible 
for, or aware of, the act or failure to act that resulted in the 
organization's loss of classification under section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) or 
acquired knowledge that the Internal Revenue Service had given notice to 
such organization that it would be deleted from such classification. 
Prior to the making of any grant or contribution which allegedly will 
not result in the grantee's loss of classification under section 
170(b)(1)(A)(vi), a potential grantee organization may request a ruling 
whether such grant or contribution may be made without such loss of 
classification. A request for such ruling may be filed by the grantee 
organization with the district director. The issuance of such ruling 
will be at the sole discretion of the Commissioner. The organization 
must submit all information necessary to make a determination on the 
factors referred to in subparagraph (6)(iii) of this paragraph. If a 
favorable ruling is issued, such ruling may be relied upon by the 
grantor or contributor of the particular contribution in question for 
purposes of sections 170, 507, 545(b)(2), 556(b)(2), 642(c), 4942, 4945, 
2055, 2106(a)(2), and 2522 and by the grantee organization for purposes 
of subparagraph (6)(ii) of this paragraph.
    (iv) Extension of advance ruling period. (a) The advance ruling 
period described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be 
extended for a period of 3 taxable years after the close of the 
unextended advance ruling period if the organization so requests, but 
only if such organization's request accompanies its request for an 
advance ruling and is filed with a consent under section 6501(c)(4) to 
the effect that the period of limitation upon assessment under section 
4940 for any taxable year within the extended advance ruling period 
shall not expire prior to 1 year after the date of the expiration of the 
time prescribed by law for the assessment of a deficiency for the last 
taxable year within the extended advance ruling period. An 
organization's extended advance ruling period is 5 taxable years if its 
first taxable year consists of at least 8 months, or is 6 years if its 
first taxable year is less than 8 months.
    (b) Notwithstanding (a) of this subdivision, an organization which 
has received or applied for an advance ruling prior to January 29, 1973, 
may file its request for the 3-year extension within 90 days from such 
date, but only if it files the consents required in this section.
    (c) See subdivision (v) of this subparagraph for the effect upon the 
initial determination of status of an organization which receives a 
ruling for an extended advance ruling period.
    (v) Initial determination of status. (a) The initial determination 
of status of a newly created organization is the first determination 
(other than by issuance of an advance ruling or determination letter 
under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph or an extended advance ruling 
or determination letter under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph) 
that the organization will be considered as ``normally'' meeting the 
requirements of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph for a period 
beginning with its first taxable year.

[[Page 92]]

    (b) In the case of a new organization whose first taxable year is at 
least 8 months, except as provided for in subdivision (v) (d) of this 
subparagraph, the initial determination of status shall be based on a 
computation period of either the first taxable year or the first and 
second taxable years.
    (c) In the case of a new organization whose first taxable year is 
less than 8 taxable months, except as provided for in subdivision (v) 
(d) of this subparagraph, the initial determination of status shall be 
based on a computation period of either the first and second taxable 
years or the first, second, and third taxable years.
    (d) In the case of an organization which has received a ruling or 
determination letter for an extended advance ruling period under 
subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, the initial determination of 
status shall be based on a computation period of all of the taxable 
years in the extended advance ruling period. However, where the ruling 
or determination letter for an extended advance ruling period under 
subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph is terminated by the Commissioner 
prior to the expiration of the relevant period described in subdivision 
(iii) (b) of this subparagraph, the initial determination of status 
shall be based on a computation period of the period provided in (b) or 
(c) of this subdivision or, if greater, the number of years to which the 
advance ruling applies.
    (e) An initial determination that an organization will be considered 
as ``normally'' meeting the requirements of subparagraph (2) or (3) of 
this paragraph shall be effective for each taxable year in the 
computation period plus (except as provided by subparagraph (4)(v)(a) of 
this paragraph, relating to material changes in sources of support) the 
2 taxable years immediately succeeding the computation period. 
Therefore, in the case of an organization referred to in (b) of this 
subdivision to which subparagraph (4)(v)(a) of this paragraph does not 
apply, with respect to its first, second, and third taxable years, such 
an organization shall be described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) if it 
meets the requirements of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph for 
either its first taxable year or for its first and second taxable years 
on an aggregate basis. In addition, if it meets the requirements of 
subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph for its first and second 
taxable years, it shall be described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) for its 
fourth taxable year. Once an organization is considered as ``normally'' 
meeting the requirements of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph 
for a period specified under this subdivision, subparagraph (4) (i), 
(ii), (v), or (vi) of this paragraph shall apply.
    (f) The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. X, a calendar year organization described in section 
501(c)(3), is created in February 1972. The support received from the 
public in 1972 by X will satisfy the one-third support test described in 
subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph over its first taxable year, 1972. 
X may therefore get an initial determination that it meets the 
requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for its first taxable 
year beginning in February 1972 and ending on December 31, 1972. This 
determination will be effective for taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that X 
also receives a substantial contribution from one individual in 1972 
which is not excluded from the denominator of the one-third support 
fraction described in subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph by reason of 
the unusual grant provision of subparagraph (6)(ii) of this paragraph. 
Because of this substantial contribution, X fails to satisfy the one-
third support test over its first taxable year, 1972. X also fails to 
satisfy the ``facts and circumstances'' test described in subparagraph 
(4)(ii) of this paragraph for its first taxable year, 1972. However, the 
support received from the public over X's first and second taxable years 
in the aggregate will satisfy the one-third support test. X may 
therefore get an initial determination that it meets the requirements of 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for its first and second taxable 
years in the aggregate beginning in February 1972 and ending on December 
31, 1973. This determination will be effective for taxable years 1972, 
1973, 1974, and 1975.
    Example 3. Y, a calendar year organization described in section 
501(c)(3), is created in July 1972. Y requests and receives an extended 
advance ruling period of 5 full taxable years plus its initial short 
taxable year of 6 months under subparagraph (5)(iv) of this paragraph. 
The extended advance ruling period begins in July 1972 and ends on 
December 31, 1977. The support received from the

[[Page 93]]

public over Y's first through sixth taxable years in the aggregate will 
satisfy the one-third support test described in subparagraph (4)(i) of 
this paragraph. Therefore, Y in 1978 may get an initial determination 
that it meets the requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph in 
the aggregate over all the taxable years in its extended advance ruling 
period beginning in July 1972 and ending on December 31, 1977. This 
determination will be effective for taxable years 1972 through 1979.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example (3) except that the 
ruling for the extended advance ruling period is terminated 
prospectively at the end of 1975, so that Y may not rely upon such 
ruling for 1976 or any succeeding year. The support received from the 
public over Y's first through fourth taxable years (1972 through 1975) 
will not satisfy either the one-third support test described in 
subparagraph (4)(i) of this paragraph, or the ``facts and 
circumstances'' test described in subparagraph (4)(ii) of this 
paragraph. Because the ruling was terminated the computation period for 
Y's initial determination of status is the period 1972 through 1975. 
Since Y has not met the requirements of either subparagraph (2) or (3) 
of this paragraph for such computation period, Y is not described in 
section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) for purposes of its initial determination of 
status. If Y is not described in section 170(b)(1)(A) (i) through (v) or 
section 509(a) (2), (3), or (4), then Y is a private foundation. As of 
1976, Y shall be treated as a private foundation for all purposes 
(except as provided in subdivision (iii)(c) of this subparagraph with 
respect to grantors and contributors), and as of July 1972 for purposes 
of the tax imposed by section 4940 and for purposes of section 507(d) 
(relating to aggregate tax benefit).

    (vi) Failure to obtain advance ruling. (a) Unless a newly created 
organization has obtained an advance ruling or determination letter 
under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, or an extended advance 
ruling or determination letter under subdivision (iv) of this 
subparagraph, that it will be treated as a section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) 
organization for its advance or extended advance ruling period, it 
cannot rely upon the possibility it will meet the requirements of 
subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph for a taxable year which 
begins before the close of either applicable computation period provided 
for in subdivision (v) (b) or (c) of this subparagraph. Therefore, such 
an organization, in order to avoid the risk of subsequently being 
determined to be a private foundation because of failure to qualify 
under section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) and therefore under section 509(a)(1), 
may comply with the rules applicable to private foundations and may pay, 
for example, the tax imposed by section 4940. In that event, if the 
organization subsequently meets the requirements of subparagraph (2) or 
(3) of this paragraph for either applicable computation period, it shall 
be treated as a section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) organization from its inception 
and, therefore, any tax imposed under chapter 42 shall be refunded and 
section 509(b) shall not apply.
    (b) If a newly created organization fails to obtain an advance 
ruling or determination letter under subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph, or an extended advance ruling or determination letter 
under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, and fails to meet the 
requirements of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph for the first 
applicable computation period provided for in subdivision (v) (b) or (c) 
of this subparagraph, see section 6651 for penalty for failure to file 
return and pay tax.
    (6) Definition of support; meaning of general public--(i) In 
general. In determining whether the 33 1/3 percent-of-support test 
described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph or the 10 percent-of-
support limitation described in subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph is 
``normally'' met, contributions by an individual, trust; or corporation 
shall be taken into account as ``support'' from direct or indirect 
contributions from the general public only to the extent that the total 
amount of the contributions by any such individual, trust, or 
corporation during the period described in subparagraph (4) (i), (ii), 
(v), or (vi) or (5)(v) of this paragraph does not exceed 2 percent of 
the organization's total support for such period, except as provided in 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. Therefore, any contribution by 
one individual will be included in full in the denominator of the 
fraction determining the 33 1/3 percent-of-support or the 10 percent-of-
support limitation, but will only be includible in the numerator of such 
fraction to the extent that such amount does not exceed 2 percent of the 
denominator. In applying the 2 percent limitation, all contributions 
made by a donor and by

[[Page 94]]

any person or persons standing in a relationship to the donor which is 
described in section 4946(a)(1) (C) through (G) and the regulations 
thereunder shall be treated as made by one person. The 2 percent 
limitation shall not apply to support received from governmental units 
referred to in section 170(c)(1) or to contributions from organizations 
described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi), except as provided in subdivision 
(v) of this subparagraph. For purposes of subparagraphs (2), (3)(i) and 
(7)(ii)(b) of this paragraph, the term ``indirect contributions from the 
general public'' includes contributions received by the organization 
from organizations (such as section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) organizations) 
which normally receive a substantial part of their support from direct 
contributions from the general public, except as provided in subdivision 
(v) of this subparagraph. See the examples in subparagraph (9) of this 
paragraph for the application of this subdivision.
    (ii) Exclusion of unusual grants. For purposes of applying the 2 
percent limitation described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to 
determine whether the 33 1/3 percent-of-support test in subparagraph (2) 
of this paragraph or the 10 percent-of-support limitation in 
subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph is satisfied, one or more 
contributions may be excluded from both the numerator and the 
denominator of the applicable percent-of-support fraction if such 
contributions meet the requirements of subdivision (iii) of this 
subparagraph. The exclusion provided by this subdivision is generally 
intended to apply to substantial contributions or bequests from 
disinterested parties which contributions or bequests:
    (a) Are attracted by reason of the publicly supported nature of the 
organization;
    (b) Are unusual or unexpected with respect to the amount thereof; 
and
    (c) Would, by reason of their size, adversely affect the status of 
the organization as normally being publicly supported for the applicable 
period described in subparagraph (4) or (5) of this paragraph.

In the case of a grant (as defined in Sec. 1.509(a)-3(g) ) which meets 
the requirements of this subdivision, if the terms of the granting 
instrument (whether executed before or after 1969) require that the 
funds be paid to the recipient organization over a period of years, the 
amount received by the organization each year pursuant to the terms of 
such grant may be excluded for such year. However, no item of gross 
investment income may be excluded under this subparagraph. The 
provisions of this subparagraph shall apply to exclude unusual grants 
made during any of the applicable periods described in subparagraph (4), 
(5), or (6) of this paragraph. See subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph 
as to reliance by a grantee organization upon an unusual grant ruling 
under this subparagraph.
    (iii) Determining factors. In determining whether a particular 
contribution may be excluded under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph 
all pertinent facts and circumstances will be taken into consideration. 
No single factor will necessarily be determinative. For some of the 
factors similar to the factors to be considered, see Sec. 1.509(a)-
3(c)(4).
    (iv) Grantors and contributors. (a) As to the status of grants and 
contributions which result in substantial and material changes in the 
organization (as described in subparagraph (4)(v)(a) of this paragraph) 
and which fail to meet the requirements for exclusion under subdivision 
(ii) of this subparagraph, see the rules prescribed in subparagraph 
(4)(v) (b) and (c) of this paragraph.
    (b) Prior to the making of any grant or contribution which will 
allegedly meet the requirements for exclusion under subdivision (ii) of 
this subparagraph, a potential grantee organization may request a ruling 
whether such grant or contribution may be so excluded. Requests for such 
ruling may be filed by the grantee organization with the district 
director. The issuance of such ruling will be at the sole discretion of 
the Commissioner. The organization must submit all information necessary 
to make a determination on the factors referred to in subdivision (iii) 
of this subparagraph. If a favorable ruling is issued, such ruling may 
be relied upon by the grantor or contributor of the particular 
contribution in question for purposes of sections 170, 507, 545(b)(2), 
556(b)(2), 642(c), 4942, 4945, 2055,

[[Page 95]]

2106(a)(2), and 2522 and by the grantee organization for purposes of 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph.
    (v) Grants from public charities. Pursuant to subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph, contributions received from a governmental unit or 
from a section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) organization are not subject to the 2 
percent limitation described in that subdivision unless such 
contributions represent amounts which have been expressly or impliedly 
earmarked by a donor to such governmental unit or section 
170(b)(1)(A)(vi) organization as being for, or for the benefit of, the 
particular organization claiming section 170 (b)(1)(A)(vi) status. See 
Sec. 1.509(a)-3 (j)(3) for examples illustrating the rules of this 
subdivision.
    (7) Definition of support; special rules and meaning of terms--(i) 
Definition of support. For purposes of this paragraph, the term support 
shall be as defined in section 509(d) (without regard to section 
509(d)(2)). The term ``support'' does not include:
    (a) Any amounts received from the exercise or performance by an 
organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose or 
function constituting the basis for its exemption under section 501(a). 
In general, such amounts include amounts received from any activity the 
conduct of which is substantially related to the furtherance of such 
purpose or function (other than through the production of income), or
    (b) Contributions of services for which a deduction is not 
allowable.

For purposes of the 33 1/3 percent-of-support test in subparagraph (2) 
of this paragraph and the 10 percent-of-support limitation in 
subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph, all amounts received which are 
described in (a) or (b) of this division are to be excluded from both 
the numerator and the denominator of the fractions determining 
compliance with such tests, except as provided in subdivision (ii) of 
this subparagraph.
    (ii) Organizations dependent primarily on gross receipts from 
related activities. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph, an organization will not be treated as satisfying the 
33 1/3 percent-of-support test in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph or 
the 10 percent-of-support limitation in subparagraph (3)(i) of this 
paragraph if it receives:
    (a) Almost all of its support (as defined in section 509(d) ) from 
gross receipts from related activities; and
    (b) An insignificant amount of its support from governmental units 
(without regard to amounts referred to in subdivision (i)(a) of this 
subparagraph) and contributions made directly or indirectly by the 
general public.

For example X, an organization described in section 501(c)(3), is 
controlled by A, its president. X received $500,000 during the 4 taxable 
years immediately preceding its current taxable year under a contract 
with the Department of Transportation, pursuant to which X has engaged 
in research to improve a particular vehicle used primarily by the 
Federal Government. During this same period, the only other support 
received by X consisted of $5,000 in small contributions primarily from 
X's employees and business associates. The $500,000 amount constitutes 
support under section 509(d)(2) and 509(d)(2)(a) of this subdivision. 
Under these circumstances, X meets the conditions of (a) and (b) of this 
subdivision and will not be treated as meeting the requirements of 
either subparagraph (2) or subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. As to the 
rules applicable to organizations which fail to qualify under section 
170(b)(1)(A)(vi) because of the provisions of this subdivision, see 
section 509(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder. For the distinction 
between gross receipts (as referred to in section 509(d)(2)) and gross 
investment income (as referred to in section 509(d)(4)), see 
Sec. 1.509(a)-3(m).
    (iii) Membership fees. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term 
``support'' shall include ``membership fees'' within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.509(a)-3(h) (that is, if the basic purpose for making a payment 
is to provide support for the organization rather than to purchase 
admissions, merchandise, services, or the use of facilities).
    (8) Support from a governmental unit. (i) For purposes of 
subparagraphs (2) and (3)(i) of this paragraph, the term ``support from 
a governmental unit'' includes any amounts received from a

[[Page 96]]

governmental unit, including donations or contributions and amounts 
received in connection with a contract entered into with a governmental 
unit for the performance of services or in connection with a Government 
research grant. However, such amounts will not constitute ``support from 
a governmental unit'' for such purposes if they constitute amounts 
received from the exercise or performance of the organization's exempt 
functions as provided in subparagraph (7)(i)(a) of this paragraph.
    (ii) For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, any 
amount paid by a governmental unit to an organization is not to be 
treated as received from the exercise or performance of its charitable, 
educational, or other purpose or function constituting the basis for its 
exemption under section 501(a) (within the meaning of subparagraph 
(7)(i)(a) of this paragraph) if the purpose of the payment is primarily 
to enable the organization to provide a service to, or maintain a 
facility for, the direct benefit of the public (regardless of whether 
part of the expense of providing such service or facility is paid for by 
the public), rather than to serve the direct and immediate needs of the 
payor. For example:
    (a) Amounts paid for the maintenance of library facilities which are 
open to the public.
    (b) Amounts paid under Government programs to nursing homes or homes 
for the aged in order to provide health care or domiciliary services to 
residents of such facilities, and
    (c) Amounts paid to child placement or child guidance organizations 
under Government programs for services rendered to children in the 
community, are considered payments the purpose of which is primarily to 
enable the recipient organization to provide a service or maintain a 
facility for the direct benefit of the public, rather than to serve the 
direct and immediate needs of the payor. Furthermore, any amount 
received from a governmental unit under circumstances such that the 
amount would be treated as a ``grant'' within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.509(a)-3(g) will generally constitute ``support from a 
governmental unit'' described in this subdivision, rather than an amount 
described in subparagraph (7)(i)(a) of this paragraph.
    (9) Examples. The application of subparagraphs (1) through (8) of 
this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. (a) M is an organization referred to in section 
170(c)(2). For the years 1970 through 1973 (the applicable period with 
respect to the taxable year 1974 under subparagraph (4) of this 
paragraph), M received support (as defined in subparagraphs (6) through 
(8) of this paragraph) of $600,000 from the following sources:

  Investment income..........................................   $300,000
  City Y (a governmental unit referred to in section                    
   170(c)(1))................................................     40,000
  United Fund (an organization referred to in section                   
   170(b)(1)(A)(vi)..........................................     40,000
  Contributions..............................................    220,000
                                                              ----------
        Total support........................................    600,000
                                                                        

    (b) With respect to the taxable year 1974, M ``normally'' received 
in excess of 33 1/3 percent of its support from a governmental unit 
referred to in section 170(c)(1) and from direct and indirect 
contributions from the general public (as defined in subparagraph (6) of 
this paragraph) computed as follows:

  33\1/3\ percent of total support...........................   $200,000
                                                              ==========
  Support from a governmental unit referred to in section               
   170(c)(1).................................................     40,000
  Indirect contributions from the general public (United                
   Fund).....................................................     40,000
  Contributions by various donors (no one having made                   
   contributions which total in excess of $12,000--2 percent            
   of total support).........................................     50,000
  Six contributions (each in excess of $12,000--2 percent               
   total support) 6 x $12,000................................     72,000
                                                              ----------
                                                                 202,000
                                                                        

    (c) Since the amount of X's support from governmental units referred 
to in section 170(c)(1) and from direct and indirect contributions from 
the general public with respect to the taxable year 1974 ``normally'' 
exceeds 33 1/3 percent of M's total support for the applicable period 
(1970-73), X meets the 33 1/3 percent-of-support test under subparagraph 
(2) of this paragraph and is therefore treated as satisfying the 
requirements for classification as a ``publicly supported'' organization 
under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for the taxable years 1974 and 
1975 (there being no substantial and material changes in the 
organization's character, purposes, methods of operation, or sources of 
support in these years).
    Example 2. N is an organization referred to in section 170(c)(2). It 
was created to maintain public gardens containing botanical specimens 
and displaying statuary and other

[[Page 97]]

art objects. The facilities, works of art, and a large endowment were 
all contributed by a single contributor. The members of the governing 
body of the organization are unrelated to its creator. The gardens are 
open to the public without charge and attract a substantial number of 
visitors each year. For the 4 taxable years immediately preceding the 
current taxable year, 95 percent of the organization's total support was 
received from investment income from its original endowment. N also 
maintains a membership society which is supported by members of the 
general public who wish to contribute to the upkeep of the gardens by 
paying a small annual membership fee. Over the 4-year period in 
question, these fees from the general public constituted the remaining 5 
percent of the organization's total support for such period. Under these 
circumstances, N does not meet the 33 1/3 percent-of-support test under 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for its current taxable year. 
Furthermore, since only 5 percent of its total support is, with respect 
to the current taxable year, normally received from the general public, 
N does not satisfy the 10 percent-of-support limitation described in 
subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph and cannot therefore be classified 
as ``publicly supported'' under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. For 
its current taxable year, N therefore, is not an organization described 
in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi). Since N has failed to satisfy the 10 
percent-of-support limitation under subparagraph (3)(i) of this 
paragraph, none of the other requirements or factors set forth in 
subparagraph (3) (iii) through (vii) of this paragraph can be considered 
in determining whether N qualifies as a ``publicly supported'' 
organization.
    Example 3. (a) O, an art museum, is an organization referred to in 
section 170(c)(2). In 1930, O was founded in Y City by the members of a 
single family to collect, preserve, interpret, and display to the public 
important works of art. O is governed by a Board of Trustees which 
originally consisted almost entirely of members of the founding family. 
However, since 1945, members of the founding family or persons standing 
in a relationship to the members of such family described in section 
4946(a)(1)(C) through (G) have annually constituted less than one- fifth 
of the Board of Trustees. The remaining board members are citizens of Y 
City from a variety of professions and occupations who represent the 
interests and views of the people of Y City in the activities carried on 
by the organization rather than the personal or private interests of the 
founding family. O solicits contributions from the general public and 
for each of its 4 most recent taxable years has received total 
contributions (in small sums of less than $100, none of which exceeds 2 
percent of O's total support for such period) in excess of $10,000. 
These contributions from the general public (as defined in subparagraph 
(6) of this paragraph) represent 25 percent of the organization's total 
support for such 4-year period. For this same period, investment income 
from several large endowment funds has constituted 75 percent of its 
total support. O expends substantially all of its annual income for its 
exempt purposes and thus depends upon the funds it annually solicits 
from the public as well as its investment income in order to carry out 
its activities on a normal and continuing basis and to acquire new works 
of art. O has, for the entire period of its existence, been open to the 
public and more than 300,000 people (from Y City and elsewhere) have 
visited the museum in each of its four most recent taxable years.
    (b) Under these circumstances, O does not meet the 33 1/3 percent-
of-support test under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for its current 
year since it has received only 25 percent of its total support for the 
applicable 4-year period from the general public. However, under the 
facts set forth above, O has met the 10 percent-of-support limitation 
under subparagraph (3)(i), as well as the requirements of subparagraph 
(3)(ii), of this paragraph. Under all of the facts set forth in this 
example, O is considered as meeting the requirements of subparagraph (3) 
of this paragraph on the basis of satisfying subparagraph (3) (i) and 
(ii) of this paragraph and the factors set forth in subparagraph (3) 
(iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this paragraph, and is therefore 
classified as a ``publicly supported organization'' under subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph for its current taxable year and the immediately 
succeeding taxable year (there being no substantial and material changes 
in the organization's character, purposes, methods of operation, or 
sources of support in these years).
    Example 4. (a) In 1960, the P Philharmonic Orchestra was organized 
in Z City through the combined efforts of a local music society and a 
local women's club to present to the public a wide variety of musical 
programs intended to foster music appreciation in the community. P is an 
organization referred to in section 170(c)(2). The orchestra is composed 
of professional musicians who are paid by the association. Twelve 
performances open to the public are scheduled each year. A small 
admission charge is made for each of these performances. In addition, 
several performances are staged annually without charge. During its 4 
most recent taxable years, P has received separate contributions of 
$200,000 each from A and B (not members of a single family) and support 
of $120,000 from the Z Community Chest, a public federated fundraising 
organization operating in Z City. P depends on these funds in order to 
carry out its activities and will continue to depend on contributions of 
this type to be made in the future. P has also begun a fundraising 
campaign in an attempt to expand its

[[Page 98]]

activities for the coming years. P is governed by a Board of Directors 
comprised of five individuals. A faculty member of a local college, the 
president of a local music society, the head of a local banking 
institution, a prominent doctor, and a member of the governing body of 
the local chamber of commerce currently serve on the Board and represent 
the interests and views of the community in the activities carried on by 
P.
    (b) With respect to P's current taxable year, P's sources of support 
are computed on the basis of the 4 immediately preceding years, as 
follows:

  Contributions..............................................   $520,000
  Receipts from performances.................................    100,000
                                                              ----------
    Total support............................................    620,000
Less:                                                                   
  Receipts from performances (excluded under subparagraph               
   (7)(i)(a) of this paragraph)..............................    100,000
                                                              ----------
    Total support for purposes of subparagraphs (2) and                 
     (3)(i) of this paragraph................................    520,000
                                                                        

    (c) For purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3)(i) of this paragraph, 
P's support is computed as follows:

  Z Community Chest (indirect support from the general                  
   public)...................................................   $120,000
  Two contributions (each in excess of $10,400--2 percent of            
   total support) 2 x $10,400................................     20,800
                                                              ----------
    Total....................................................    140,800
                                                                        

    (d) P's support from the general public, directly and indirectly, 
does not meet the 33 1/3 percent-of-support test under subparagraph (2) 
of this paragraph ($140,800/$520,000=27 percent of total support). 
However, since P receives 27 percent of its total support from the 
general public, it meets the 10 percent-of-support limitation under 
subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph. P also meets the requirements of 
subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph. As a result of satisfying these 
requirements and the factors set forth in subparagraph (3) (iii), (iv), 
(v), and (vi) of this paragraph, P is considered as meeting the 
requirements of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph and is therefore 
considered to be a ``publicly supported'' organization under 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
    (e) If, instead of the above facts, P were a newly created 
organization, P could obtain a ruling pursuant to subparagraph (5) of 
this paragraph by reason of its purposes, organizational structure and 
proposed method of operation. Even if P had initially been founded by 
the contributions of a few individuals, such fact would not, in and of 
itself, disqualify P from receiving a ruling under subparagraph (5) of 
this paragraph.
    Example 5. (a) Q is an organization referred to in section 
170(c)(2). It is a philanthropic organization founded in 1965 by A for 
the purpose of making annual contributions to worthy charities. A 
created Q as a charitable trust by the transfer of $500,000 worth of 
appreciated securities to Q.
    Pursuant to the trust agreement, A and two other members of his 
family are the sole trustees and are vested with the right to appoint 
successor trustees. In each of its four most recent taxable years, Q 
received $15,000 in investment income from its original endowment. Each 
year Q makes a solicitation for funds by operating a charity ball at A's 
residence. Guests are invited and requested to make contributions of 
$100 per couple. During the 4-year period involved, $15,000 was received 
from the proceeds of these events. A and his family have also made 
contributions to Q of $25,000 over the course of the organization's 4 
most recent taxable years. Q makes disbursements each year of 
substantially all of its net income to the public charities chosen by 
the trustees.
    (b) With respect to Q's current taxable year, Q's sources of support 
are computed on the basis of the 4 immediately preceding years as 
follows:

  Investment income..........................................    $60,000
  Contributions..............................................     40,000
                                                              ----------
    Total support............................................    100,000
                                                                        

    (c) For purposes of subparagraphs (2) and (3)(i) of this paragraph, 
Q's support is computed as follows:

  Contributions from the general public......................    $15,000
  One contribution (in excess of $2,000--2 percent of total             
   support) 1 x $2,000.......................................      2,000
                                                              ----------
    Total....................................................     17,000
                                                                        

    (d) Q's support from the general public does not meet the 33 1/3 
percent-of-support test under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph 
($17,000/$100,000=17 percent of total support). Thus, Q's classification 
as a ``publicly supported'' organization depends on whether it meets the 
requirements of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Even though it 
satisfies the 10 percent-of-support limitation under subparagraph (3)(i) 
of this paragraph, its method of solicitation makes it questionable 
whether Q satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (3)(ii) of this 
paragraph. Because of its method of operating, Q also has a greater 
burden of establishing its publicly supported nature under subparagraph 
(3)(iii) of this paragraph. Based upon the foregoing and upon Q's 
failure to receive favorable consideration under the factors set forth 
in subparagraph (3) (iv), (v), and (vi) of this paragraph, Q does not 
satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as a 
``publicly supported'' organization.
    (e) If, instead of the above facts, Q were a newly created 
organization, Q would not be

[[Page 99]]

able to receive a ruling pursuant to subparagraph (5) of this paragraph. 
Its purposes, organizational structure, and method of operation would be 
insufficient to establish that Q could reasonably be expected to meet 
the requirements of subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph for its 
first 2 or its first 5 taxable years.

    (10) Community trusts; introduction. Community trusts have often 
been established to attract large contributions of a capital or 
endowment nature for the benefit of a particular community or area, and 
often such contributions have come initially from a small number of 
donors. While the community trust generally has a governing body 
comprised of representatives of the particular community or area, its 
contributions are often received and maintained in the form of separate 
trusts or funds, which are subject to varying degrees of control by the 
governing body. To qualify as a ``publicly supported'' organization, a 
community trust must meet the 33 1/3 percent-of-support test of 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or, if it cannot meet that test, be 
organized and operated so as to attract new and additional public or 
governmental support on a continuous basis sufficient to meet the facts 
and circumstances test of paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Such facts 
and circumstances test includes a requirement of attraction of public 
support in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section which, as applied to 
community trusts will generally satisfied, if they seek gifts and 
bequests from a wide range of potential donors in the community or area 
served, through banks or trust companies, through attorneys or other 
professional persons, or in other appropriate ways which call attention 
to the community trust as a potential recipient of gifts and berquests 
made for the benefit of the community or area served. A community trust 
is not required to engage in periodic, community-wide, fund-raising 
campaigns directed toward attracting a large number of small 
contributions in a manner similiar to campaigns conducted by a community 
chest or united fund. Paragraph (e) (12) and (13) of this section 
provide a transitional ruling period for certain community trusts in 
existence before November 11, 1976 that had irregular public support, so 
that they can meet the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this 
section based on the 4-year computation period described in paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section. Paragraph (e)(11) of this section provides rules 
for determining the extent to which separate trusts or funds may be 
treated as component parts of a community trust, fund or foundation 
(herein collectively referred to as a ``community trust'', and sometimes 
referred to as an ``organization'') for purposes of meeting the 
requirements of this paragraph for classification as a ``publicly 
supported'' organization. Paragraph (e)(14) of this section contains 
rules for trusts or funds which are prevented from qualifying as 
component parts of a community trust by paragraph (e)(11) of this 
section.
    (11) Community trusts; requirements for treatment as a single 
entity--(i) General rule. For purposes of sections 170, 501, 507, 508, 
509, and Chapter 42, any organization that meets the requirements 
contained in paragraph (e)(11) (iii) through (iv) of this section will 
be treated as a single entity, rather than as an aggregation of separate 
funds, and except as otherwise provided, all funds associated with such 
organization (whether a trust, not-for-profit corporation, 
unincorporated association, or a combination thereof) which meet the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(11)(ii) of this section will be treated as 
component parts of such organization.
    (ii) Component part of a community trust. In order to be treated as 
a component part of a community trust referred to in paragraph (e)(11) 
of this section (rather than as a separate trust or not-for-profit 
corporation or association) a trust or fund:
    (A) Must be created by a gift, bequest, legacy, devise, or other 
transfer to a community trust which is treated as a single entity under 
paragraph (e)(11) of this section; and
    (B) May not be directly or indirectly subjected by the transferor to 
any material restriction or condition (within the meaning of Sec. 1.507-
2(a)(8) with respect to the transferred assets.

For purposes of paragraph (e)(11)(ii)(B) of this section, if the 
transferor is not a private foundation, the provisions of Sec. 1.507-
2(a)(8) shall be applied to the trust or fund as if the transferor were

[[Page 100]]

a private foundation established and funded by the person establishing 
the trust or fund and such foundation transferred all its assets to the 
trust or fund. Any transfer made to a fund or trust which is treated as 
a component part of a community trust under paragraph (e)(11)(ii) of 
this section will be treated as a transfer made ``to'' a ``publicly 
supported'' community trust for purposes of section 170(b)(1)(A) and 
507(b)(1)(A) if such community trust meets the requirements of section 
170(b)(10(A)(vi) as a ``publicly supported'' organization at the time of 
the transfer, except as provided in Sec. 1.170A-9(e)(4)(v)(b) or 
Sec. 1.508-1(b) (4) and (6) (relating, generally, to reliance by 
grantors and contributors). See, also, paragraph (e)(14) (ii) and (iii) 
of this section for special provisions relating to split-interest trusts 
and certain private foundations described in section 170(b)(1)(E)(iii).
    (iii) Name. The organization must be commonly known as a community 
trust, fund, foundation or other similar name conveying the concept of a 
capital or endoment fund to support charitable activities (within the 
meaning of section 170(c)(1) or (2)(B)) in the community or area it 
serves.
    (iv) Common instrument. All funds of the organization must be 
subject to a common governing instrument or a master trust or agency 
agreement (herein referred to as the ``governing instrument''), which 
may be embodied in a single document or several documents containing 
common language. Language in an instrument of transfer to the community 
trust making a fund subject to the community trust's governing 
instrument or master trust or agency agreement will satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(11)(iv) of this section. In addition, if a 
community trust adopts a new governing instrument (or creates a 
corporation) to put into effect new provisions (applying to future 
transfers to the community trust), the adoption of such new governing 
instrument (or creation of a corporation with a governing instrument) 
which contains common language with the existing governing instrument 
shall not preclude the community trust from meeting the requirements of 
such paragraph (e)(11)(iv).
    (v) Common governing body. (A) The organization must have a common 
governing body or distribution committee (herein referred to as the 
``governing body'') which either directs or, in the case of a fund 
designated for specified beneficiaries, monitors the distribution of all 
of the funds exclusively for charitable purposes (within the meaning of 
section 170(c) (1) or (2)(B)).

For purposes of this (v) a fund is designated for specified 
beneficiaries only if no person is left with the discretion to direct 
the distribution of the fund.
    (B) Powers of modification and removal. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(11)(v)(C) of this section, the governing body must have 
the power in the governing instrument, the instrument of transfer, the 
resolutions or by-laws of the governing body, a written agreement, or 
otherwise--
    (1) To modify any restriction or condition on the distribution of 
funds for any specified charitable purposes or to specified charitable 
purposes or to specified organizations if in the sole judgment of the 
governing body (without the necessity of the approval of any 
participating trustee, custodian, or agent), such restriction or 
condition becomes, in effect, unnecessary, incapable of fulfillment, or 
inconsistent with the charitable needs of the community or area served;
    (2) To replace any participating trustee, custodian, or agent for 
breach of fiduciary duty under State law; and
    (3) To replace any participating trustee, custodian, or agent for 
failure to produce a reasonable (as determined by the governing body) 
return of net income (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(11)(v)(F) of 
this section) over a reasonable period of time (as determined by the 
governing body).

The fact that the exercise of any such power in paragraph (e)(11)(v)(B) 
(1), (2) or (3) of this section is reviewable by an appropriate State 
authority will not preclude the community trust from meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(11)(v)(B) of this section.
    (C) Transitional rule. (1) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(11)(v)(B) 
of this section, if a community trust meets the requirements of 
paragraph (e)(11)(v)(C)(2) of this section, then in the case of any 
instrument of transfer

[[Page 101]]

which is executed before July 19, 1977 and is not revoked or amended 
thereafter (with respect to any dispositive provision affecting the 
transfer to the community trust), and in the case of any instrument of 
transfer which is irrevocable on January 19, 1982, the governing body 
must have the power to cause proceedings to be instituted (by request to 
the appropriate State authority):
    (i) To modify any restriction or condition on the distribution of 
funds for any specified charitable purposes or to specified 
organizations if in the judgment of the governing body such restriction 
or condition becomes, in effect, unnecessary, incapable of fulfillment, 
or inconsistent with the charitable needs of the community or area 
served; and (ii) To remove any participating trustee, custodian, or 
agent for breach of fiduciary duty under State law.

The necessity for the governing body to obtain the approval of a 
participating trustee to exercise such a power shall be treated as not 
preventing the governing body from having such power, unless (and until) 
such approval has been (or is) requested by the governing body and has 
been (or is) denied.
    (2) Paragraph (e)(11)(v)(C)(1) of this section shall not apply 
unless the community trust meets the requirements of paragraph 
(e)(11)(v)(B) of this section, with respect to funds other than those 
under instruments of transfer described in the first sentence of such 
paragraph (e)(11)(v)(C)(1), by January 19, 1978, or such later date as 
the Commissioner may provide for such community trust, and unless the 
community trust does not, once it so complies, thereafter solicit for 
funds that will not qualify under the requirements of such paragraph 
(e)(11)(v)(B).
    (D) Inconsistent State law. (1) For purposes of paragraph 
(e)(11)(v)(B) (1), (2), or (3) or (C)(1) (i) or (ii) or (E) of this 
section, if a power described in such a provision is inconsistent with 
State law even if such power were expressly granted to the governing 
body by the governing instrument and were accepted without limitation 
under an instrument of transfer, then the community trust will be 
treated as meeting the requirements of such a provision if it meets such 
requirements to the fullest extent possible consistent with State law 
(if such power is or had been so expressly granted).
    (2) For example, if, under the conditions of paragraph 
(e)(11)(v)(D)(1) of this section, the power to modify is inconsistent 
with State law, but the power to institute proceedings to modify if so 
expressly granted, would be consistent with State law, the community 
trust will be treated as meeting such requirements to the fullest extent 
possible if the governing body has the power (in the governing 
instrument or otherwise) to institute proceedings to modify a condition 
or restriction. On the other hand, if in such a case the community trust 
has only the power to cause proceedings to be instituted to modify a 
condition or restriction, it will not be treated as meeting such 
requirements to the fullest extent possible.
    (3) In addition, if, for example, under the conditions of paragraph 
(e)(11)(v)(D)(1) of this section, the power to modify and the power to 
institute proceedings to modify a condition or restriction is 
inconsistent with State law, but the power to cause such proceedings to 
be instituted would be consistent with State law, if it were expressly 
granted in the governing instrument and if the approval of the State 
Attorney General were obtained, then the community trust will be treated 
as meeting such requirements to the fullest extent possible if it has 
the power (in the governing instrument or otherwise) to cause such 
proceedings to be instituted, even if such proceedings can be instituted 
only with the approval of the State Attorney General.
    (E) Exercise of powers. The governing body shall (by resolution or 
otherwise) commit itself to exercise the powers described in paragraph 
(e)(11)(v) (B), (C) and (D) of this section in the best interests of the 
community trust. The governing body will be considered not to be so 
committed where it has grounds to exercise such a power and fails to 
exercise it by taking appropriate action. Such appropriate action may 
include, for example, consulting with the appropriate State authority 
prior to taking action to replace a participating trustee.

[[Page 102]]

    (F) Reasonable return. In addition to the requirements of paragraph 
(e)(11)(v) (B), (C), (D) or (E) of this section, the governing body 
shall (by resolution or otherwise) commit itself to obtain information 
and take other appropriate steps with the view to seeing that each 
participating trustee, custodian, or agent, with respect to each 
restricted (within the meaning of paragraph (e)(13)(x) of this section) 
trust or fund that is, and with respect to the aggregate of the 
unrestricted trusts or funds that are, a component part of the community 
trust, administers such trust or fund in accordance with the terms of 
its governing instrument and accepted standards of fiduciary conduct to 
produce a reasonable return of net income (or appreciation where not 
inconsistent with the community trust's need for current income), with 
due regard to safety of principal, in furtherance of the exempt purposes 
of the community trust (except for assets held for the active conduct of 
the community trust's exempt activities). In the case of a low return of 
net income (and, where appropriate, appreciation), the Internal Revenue 
Service will examine carefully whether the governing body has, in fact, 
committed itself to take the appropriate steps.
    (vi) Common reports. The organization must prepare periodic 
financial reports treating all of the funds which are held by the 
community trust, either directly or in component parts, as funds of the 
organization.
    (vii) Transitional rule. If the governing instrument of a community 
trust (or an instrument of transfer) is inconsistent with the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(11) (iv) or (v) of this section but with 
respect to gifts or bequests acquired before January 1, 1982, the 
community trust changes its governing instrument (or instrument of 
transfer) by the later of November 11, 1977, or one year after the gift 
or bequest is acquired, in order to conform such instruments to such 
provisions, then such an instrument shall be treated as consistent with 
paragraph (e)(11) (iv) or (v) of this section for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1969. In addition, if prior to the later of 
such dates, the organization has instituted court proceedings in order 
to conform such an instrument, then it may apply (prior to the later of 
such dates) for an extension of the period to conform such instrument to 
such provisions. Such application shall be made to the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue, Attention: E:EO, Washington, DC 20224. The 
Commissioner, at the Commissioner's discretion, may grant such an 
extension, if in the Commissioner's opinion such a change will conform 
the instrument to such provisions and will be made within a reasonable 
time.
    (12) Community trusts qualifying for 5-year transitional ruling 
period--(i) In general. Paragraph (e) (12) and (13) of this section 
contain transitional rules for certain community trusts in existence 
before November 11, 1976 which are unable to meet the requirements of 
paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section based upon a 4-year computation 
period under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. A community trust that 
satisfies the requirements of paragraph (e)(12)(ii) of this section will 
be eligible for a transitional ruling or determination letter that it 
will be treated as a section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) organization for a 5-year 
transitional ruling period (referred to in this section as 
``transitional ruling or determination letter''). These transitional 
rules apply to:
    (A) A community trust which has been in existence less than 9 
taxable years before November 11, 1976; and
    (B) Other community trusts that for each taxable year beginning 
after December 31, 1969, and before January 1, 1978, qualify as 
``publicly supported'' under paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section 
based upon a computation period of either:
    (1) 10 taxable years, or
    (2) The number of taxable years (but not more than 20 nor less than 
10) preceding such taxable year that the organization was in existence.

For special rules in applying the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) or 
(3) of this section based upon such computation periods, see paragraph 
(e)(12)(v) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (e)(12) of this 
section the initial taxable year of the 5-year transitional ruling 
period (hereinafter referred to as the ``transitional ruling period'') 
shall be the organization's taxable year beginning in 1977, and (unless 
terminated

[[Page 103]]

earlier) the last year of the transitional ruling period is the 
organization's taxable year which begins in 1981.
    (ii) Transitional 5-year ruling. (A) If a community trust meets the 
requirements of paragraph (e) (11), (12) and (13) of this section and 
can reasonably be expected to meet the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) 
or (3) of this section:
    (1) For each of its taxable years (if such a year begins after its 
tenth taxable year) beginning in 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1981 based upon a 
10-year computation period, and
    (2) For its taxable year beginning in 1982 based upon a 4-year 
computation period under paragraph (e)(4) of this section;

it may, at the discretion of the Commissioner, receive a transitional 
ruling or determination letter for the transitional ruling period.
    (B)(1) However, if for the taxable year beginning in 1977, a 
community trust can meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(12)(i)(B) of 
this section only by using the computation period of its existence 
described in paragraph (e)(12)(i)(B)(2) of this section, then the 
community trust may meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(12)(ii)(A)(1) 
of this section if it is reasonably expected to meet the requirements of 
paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section for each of its taxable years 
beginning in 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1981 based upon a computation period 
consisting of the number of taxable years (but not more than 20 nor less 
than 10) preceding such taxable year that the organization was in 
existence.
    (2) In the case of a community trust that will not have been in 
existence more than ten taxable years as of its taxable year beginning 
in 1981, a transitional ruling or determination letter for the 
transitional ruling period will not be granted unless the community 
trust can reasonably be expected to meet the requirements of paragraph 
(e) (2) or (3) of this section for its taxable year beginning in 1982 
based upon a 4-year computation period under paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section and also a computation period consisting of the taxable years 
the organization has been in existence (other than the organization's 
taxable year beginning in 1982).
    (C) A community trust that is eligible for a transitional ruling or 
determination letter must apply with the district director for such 
ruling or determination letter within one year after November 11, 1976. 
A transitional ruling or determination letter will be granted only if 
the requesting organization files with its request for such ruling or 
determination letter a consent letter under section 6501(c)(4) to the 
effect that the period of limitation upon assessment under section 4940 
for all taxable years beginning before January 1, 1982 during the 
transitional ruling period shall not expire prior to 1 year after the 
date of the expiration of the time prescribed by law for the assessment 
of a deficiency for its taxable year beginning in 1981. The provisions 
of paragraph (e)(5)(iii) of this section (relating to reliance upon 
ruling) shall apply with respect to a community trust which receives a 
transitional ruling or determination letter and with respect to its 
grantors and contributors, expect that the transitional ruling period 
described in paragraph (e)(12)(ii) of this section shall be substituted 
for the advance ruling period described in paragraph (e)(5) (i) or (iv) 
of this section.
    (D) A community trust does not have to meet the requirements of 
paragraph (e)(13) of this section for taxable years beginning prior to 
the date of its application for a transitional ruling or determination 
letter or for any taxable year beginning after the expiration or 
termination of its transitional ruling or determination letter. In 
applying paragraph (e)(13) of this section to organizations applying for 
a transitional ruling or determination letter, paragraph (e)(13) (x) and 
(xii) of this section (relating to unrestricted gifts and excess 
holdings, respectively) shall be applied without regard to assets 
acquired prior to November 11, 1976. In addition, if within 1 year from 
acquiring any asset, the community trust removes any restriction 
inconsistent with paragraph (e)(13) of this section, such asset shall be 
treated as if it were not subject to such restriction as of the time it 
was acquired. Since under paragraph

[[Page 104]]

(e)(12)(ii)(D) of this section, a community trust does not have to meet 
the requirements of paragraph (e)(13) of this section for taxable years 
beginning prior to the date of its application for the transitional 
ruling or determination letter, then if the community trust makes such 
application in its taxable year beginning 1977 and it terminates such 
ruling or determination letter in such year as well, such a community 
trust does not have to meet such requirements for any taxable year.
    (E) After the transitional ruling or determination letter of an 
organization has expired or been terminated under paragraph (e)(12)(iii) 
of this section, the organization must qualify as a ``publicly 
supported'' organization pursuant to the rules set forth in paragraph 
(e) (1) through (11) of this section. Thus, since the transitional 
ruling period of a community trust expires with its taxable year 
beginning in 1981, for its taxable year beginning in 1982 and 
thereafter, the community trust must meet the requirements of paragraph 
(e) (2) or (3) of this section based upon the 4-year computation period 
under paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (iii) Termination of transitional ruling. (A) The transitional 
ruling or determination letter issued under this paragraph is subject to 
termination under paragraph (e)(12)(iii) (B) or (D) of this section 
without a request from the organization. In addition, such a ruling or 
determination letter is subject to termination under paragraph 
(e)(12)(iii)(E) of this section at the request of the organization. A 
transitional ruling or determination letter is subject to termination 
for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1976, and before 
January 1, 1982, under paragraph (e)(12)(iii) (B), (D) or (E) of this 
section.
    (B) The transitional ruling or determination letter issued under 
this paragraph shall be terminated for any taxable year (if such a year 
begins after its tenth taxable year) beginning in 1978, 1979, 1980 or 
1981 for which a community trust receiving such a ruling or 
determination letter fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) 
or (3) of this section for a 10-year computation period, except as 
provided in paragraph (e)(12)(iii)(C) of this section.
    (C) In applying paragraph (e)(12)(iii)(B) of this section to a 
community trust described in paragraph (e)(12)(ii)(B)(1) of this 
section, a computation period consisting of the number of taxable years 
(but not more than 20 nor less than 10) preceding such taxable year that 
the organization has been in existence shall be substituted for the 10-
year computation period until the first taxable year beginning in 1978, 
1979, 1980 or 1981 that the community trust can meet the requirements of 
paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section based upon a 10-year 
computation period.
    (D) The Commissioner may, at the discretion of the Commissioner, 
terminate the transitional ruling or determation letter of any community 
trust for any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1982, for which 
the organization fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (e) (11), 
(12) or (13) of this section as provided in paragraph (e)(12)(ii) of 
this section.
    (E) A community trust may request an immediate termination of the 
community trust's transitional ruling or determination letter in order 
that, for the current taxable year, it may be determined if such 
community trust meets the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of 
this section based upon a 4-year computation period under paragraph 
(e)(4) of this section. Such a request shall be granted and the 
transitional ruling or determination letter terminated only if the 
community trust meets such requirements, and in the case of an 
organization that has been in existence less than 11 taxable years at 
the time of such request, the organization also meets the requirements 
of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section for the computation period 
consisting of the taxable years that the organization has been in 
existence.
    (iv) Initial determination of status. (A) The initial determination 
of status of a community trust is the first determination (other than by 
issuance of an advance ruling or determination letter under paragraph 
(e)(5) or a transitional ruling or determination letter under paragraph 
(e)(12)(ii) of this section)

[[Page 105]]

that the community trust will be considered as ``normally'' meeting the 
requirements of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section for a period 
beginning with its first taxable year.
    (B)(1) In the case of a community trust described in paragraph 
(e)(12)(i)(B) of this section, the initial determination of status shall 
be made for the community trust's taxable year beginning in 1977 if such 
community trust has met the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of 
this section for its taxable year beginning in 1977, based upon a 10-
year computation period.
    (2) In the case of any other community trust described in paragraph 
(e)(12)(i)(B) of this section (but not described in paragraph 
(e)(12)(iv) (B)(1) of this section), the initial determination of status 
shall be made for its first taxable year beginning after December 31, 
1976 and before January 1, 1982, for which it meets the requirements of 
paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section based upon a 10-year 
computation period (if the community trust has received a transitional 
ruling or determination letter that has not been terminated before such 
taxable year).
    (C) In the case of a community trust described in paragraph 
(e)(12)(i)(A) of this section (relating to an organization in existence 
less than 9 taxable years) that reaches its 11th taxable year before its 
taxable year beginning in 1982, its initial determination of status a 
10-year computation period (if it has received a transitional ruling or 
determination letter that has not been terminated before such taxable 
year).
    (D) If a community trust has not received an initial determination 
of status shall be for its 11th taxable year based upon prior to the 
expiration or termination of its transitional ruling period, the initial 
determination of status shall be made:
    (1) In the case of an expiration, for the taxable year beginning in 
1982, or
    (2) In the case of a termination, for the last taxable year of the 
terminated transitional period.

Based upon a 4-year computation period under paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section. In the case of an organization that has been in existence less 
than 11 taxable years at such time, the initial determination of status 
shall also be based upon a computation period consisting of the taxable 
years it has been in existence. For example, if the initial 
determination of status (for an organization that has been in existence 
for at least 11 taxable years) is made for its taxable year beginning in 
1982, then, except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this section 
(relating to exception for material changes of support), such 
determination shall be based upon a 4-year computation period ending 
with the taxable year beginning in 1980 or 1981 (treating the taxable 
year beginning in 1982, as the subsequent year or current year, 
respectively).

On the other hand, if, for example, the transitional ruling or 
determination letter is terminated in the taxable year beginning in 
1980, then, except as provided in such paragraph (e)(4)(v), the initial 
determination of status shall be made for the taxable year beginning in 
1980 based upon the 4-year computation period ending with the taxable 
year beginning in 1978 or 1979.
    (v) Special rules--(A) Consequences of organization failing to meet 
requirements at end of transitional period. If upon the expiration (or 
termination) of the transitional period an organization with a 
transitional ruling or determination letter fails to meet the 
requirements of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section based upon the 
4-year computation period of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, it shall 
not be treated as an organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi) 
for its taxable year beginning in 1982 (or for the last taxable year of 
its terminated transitional period, as the case may be). If, by reason 
of failing to qualify as an organization described in section 
170(b)(1)(A)(vi), such organization becomes a private foundation, then 
the organization will be a private foundation for its taxable year 
beginning in 1982 (or the last taxable year of its terminated 
transitional period, as the case may be) and all subsequent taxable 
years, unless and until it terminates its status under section 507. In 
addition, such an organization is a private foundation for all taxable 
years beginning prior to its taxable year beginning in 1982 (or for the 
last

[[Page 106]]

taxable year of the terminated transition period, as the case may be), 
except:
    (1) That if the organization had received an initial determination 
of status that it met the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of 
this section, then the organization will be treated as ``publicly 
supported'' for the taxable years to which the initial determination of 
status is effective, as well as for all taxable years beginning after 
the last of such years and before January 1, 1982, for which the 
organization consecutively meets the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) 
or (3) of this section based upon a 10-year computation period,
    (2) That in the case of an organization that has reached its tenth 
taxable year of existence before January 1, 1970, if the organization 
has not received an initial determination of status prior to its taxable 
year beginning in 1982, then the organization will be treated as 
``publicly supported'' for each taxable year beginning before January 1, 
1977, that the organization, beginning with the taxable year beginning 
in 1970, consecutively met the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) 
of this section based upon a 10-year computation period, or
    (3) That in the case of an organization whose 11th taxable year of 
its existence began after December 31, 1970 and before January 1, 1977, 
if the organization has not received an initial determination of status 
prior to its taxable year beginning in 1982, but the organization for 
its 11th taxable year of existence met the requirements of paragraph (e) 
(2) or (3) of this section based upon a 10-year computation period, then 
the organization will be treated as ``publicly supported'' for the first 
12 taxable years of its existence. In addition, such an organization 
will be so treated for its 13th taxable year and each subsequent taxable 
year (if such a year begins before January 1, 1977) that the 
organization, beginning with its 12th taxable year, consecutively met 
the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section based upon 
a 10-year computation period.
    (4) To the extent provided in paragraph (e)(4)(vii) of this section 
(relating to special rule for organization with existing rulings), 
Sec. 1.508-1(b) (relating to notice that an organization is not a 
private foundation) or Sec. 1.509(a)-7 (relating to reliance by grantors 
and contributors to section 509(a) (1), (2), and (3) organizations).
    (B) Computation period. In applying the requirements of paragraph 
(e) (2) or (3) of this section to a 10-year or other computation period 
under paragraph (e) (12) or (13) of this section, such 10-year or other 
computation period shall be substituted for the 4-year computation 
period of paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Thus, for example, an 
organization will (except as provided in paragraph (e)(4)(v) of this 
section relating to exemption for material changes in sources of 
support) meet the ``publicly supported'' test of this paragraph for the 
taxable year beginning in 1977 based upon a 10-year computation period, 
if it met the requirements of paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section 
for a computation period consisting of either the taxable years 
beginning in the years 1966 through 1975 or the years 1967 through 1976, 
since under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, meeting the requirements 
for a computation period is effective for the current taxable year and 
the immediately succeeding taxable year. However, in substituting a 10-
year or other computation period for the 4-year computation period of 
paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the rules of such paragraph (e) (4) 
and (6) apply, including the 2-percent limitation under paragraph 
(e)(6)(i) of this section and the exclusion for unusual grants under 
paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section. In applying such provisions, the 
fact that the computation period is other than a 4-year computation 
period shall be taken into account, so that, for example, the 2-percent 
limitation shall be applied, in the case of a 10-year computation 
period, with reference to 2 percent of the organization's total support 
for the 10-year computation period rather than a 4-year computation 
period.

In addition, in substituting a 10-year or other computation period for 
purposes of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, all of the facts and 
circumstances referred to in such paragraph (e)(3) shall be considered 
with respect to such period, viewing such period as a whole. See, also,

[[Page 107]]

paragraph (e)(10) of this section with respect to the organization being 
organized and operated to attract public support.
    (C) First taxable year of less than 8 months. In the case of an 
organization whose first taxable year consisted of less than 8 months, 
in order to coordinate the rules of paragraph (e)(12) of this section 
with the rules of paragraph (e)(5) of this section, in applying the 
rules of paragraph (e)(12) of this section, such an organization shall 
be treated as organized at the beginning of its succeeding taxable year, 
so that such succeeding taxable year shall be treated as its first 
taxable year of existence. However, the support received for the period 
preceding such succeeding taxable year shall be taken into account with 
the support received in such succeeding taxable year.
    (13) Community trusts; requirements for 5-year transitional ruling 
period--(i) In general. In order for a community trust to be eligible 
for a transitional ruling or determination letter for the transitional 
ruling period under paragraph (e)(12) of this section, it must establish 
that it is organized, and will be operated, in such manner that it can 
reasonably be expected to meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(13) of 
this section, and can reasonably be expected to meet the requirements of 
paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section, for each taxable year during 
and immediately following the transitional ruling period, as provided in 
paragraph (e)(12)(ii) of this section. In determining whether an 
organization can reasonably be expected to meet the requirements of 
paragraph (e) (2) or (3) of this section for each such taxable year, the 
basic consideration is whether its organizational structure, proposed 
programs or activities, and intended method of operation are such as to 
attract the type of broadly based support from the general public, 
public charities, and governmental units which is necessary to meet such 
tests. The information to be considered for this purpose shall consist 
of all pertinent facts and circumstances relating to the requirements 
set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. For purposes of meeting 
the requirements of paragraph (e)(13) of this section, a community trust 
may, prior to its application for a transitional ruling or determination 
letter under paragraph (e)(12)(i)(C) of this section, adopt a resolution 
stating that, as a matter of policy, it will attempt to meet the 
conditions set forth in paragraph (e)(13) of this section during the 
transitional ruling period. A community trust will not be treated as 
failing to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(13) of this section 
merely because the governing body, or any of its trustees, agents, or 
custodians, fails to meet one or more of the requirements contained in 
paragraph (e)(13) (ii) through (xiii) of this section by reason of 
isolated and nonrepetitive acts. However, any continuing pattern on the 
part of the governing body, or its trustees, agents or custodians, 
indicating a continued and repetitive failure to comply with a policy of 
meeting such requirements will result in termination of the transitional 
ruling or determination letter under paragraph (e)(12)(iii)(D) of this 
section.
    (ii) Area. The community trust is organized and operated exclusively 
to carry out charitable purposes (within the meeting of section 170(c) 
(1) or (2)(B)) primarily within a broad geographical area which it 
serves, such as a municipality, county, metropolitan area, State or 
region.
    (iii) General composition of governing body. The governing body must 
represent the board interests of the public rather than the personal or 
private interests of a limited number of donors. An organization will be 
treated as meeting this requirement if it has a governing body comprised 
of public officials acting in their capacities as such; individuals 
selected by public officials acting in their capacities as such; persons 
having special knowledge or expertise in a particular field or 
discipline in which the community trust operates; community leaders, 
such as elected or appointed officials, clergymen, educators, civic 
leaders; or other such persons representing a broad cross-section of the 
views and interests of the area served.
    (iv) Rules for governing body. With respect to terms of office 
beginning after the date of the application of the community trust for a 
transitional ruling or determination letter:

[[Page 108]]

    (A) Its governing body is comprised of members who may serve a 
period of not more than ten consecutive years;
    (B) Upon completion of a period of service (beginning before or 
after such date) no person may serve within a period consisting of the 
lesser of 5 years or the number of consecutive years the member has 
immediately completed serving;
    (C) Persons who would be described in section 4946(a)(1) (A) or (C) 
through (G) if the community trust were a private foundation do not 
constitute more than one-third of its governing body; and
    (D) Representatives of banks or trust companies which serve as 
trustees, investment managers, custodians, or agents, plus persons 
described in paragraph (e)(13)(iv)(C) of this section, do not constitute 
a majority of the governing body.

No term of office beginning on or before the date of such application 
may continue for more than 10 years from such date.
    (v) Fiduciary responsibility. Fiduciary responsibility with respect 
to the funds of the community trust is imposed, either by the master 
trust or agency agreement or by State law, on either its governing body 
or its trustee banks or trust companies or both.
    (vi) Ultimate control of assets. Neither its governing body, nor any 
of its trustees, investment managers, custodians or agents may be 
subjected by any donor to the community trust to any material condition 
or restriction within the meaning of Sec. 1.507-2(a)(8) which would 
prevent it from exercising ultimate control over its assets.
    (vii) Administration. Administration and investment of all gifts and 
bequests are accomplished through:
    (A) A governing body which directly holds, administers or invests 
such gifts and bequests exclusively for charitable purposes;
    (B) Banks or trust companies (acting or appointed as trustees), 
investment managers, custodians or agents of the community trust or one 
or more components thereof; or
    (C) A combination of such persons.
    (viii) Annual distributions. It makes annual distributions for 
purposes described in section 170(c) (1) or (2)(B), including 
administrative expenses and amounts paid to acquire an asset used (or 
held for use) directly in carrying out one or more of such purposes, in 
an amount not less than its adjusted net income (as defined in section 
4942(f)). For purposes of paragraph (e)(13)(viii) of this section, the 
term ``distributions'' shall include amounts set aside for a specific 
project, but only if prior to making the set-aside the organization has, 
pursuant to a request for a ruling, established to the satisfaction of 
the Commissioner that:
    (A) The amount will be paid for the specific project within 5 years; 
and
    (B) The project is one which can be better accomplished by such set-
aside than by immediate distribution of funds.

All annual distributions required to be made pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(13)(viii) of this section, except for set-asides, must be made no 
later than the close of the organization's first taxable year after the 
taxable year for which the adjusted net income is computed. Thus, in the 
case of a calendar year community trust which has received a 
transitional ruling or determination letter upon an application made in 
1977, it must make distributions under paragraph (e)(13)(vii) of this 
section for 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1981 based upon its adjusted net income 
for 1977, 1978, 1979 and 1980, respectively, unless its transitional 
ruling or determination letter is terminated. If such a community 
trust's transitional ruling or determination letter is terminated in 
1979, it must make distributions under paragraph (e)(13)(viii) of this 
section only for 1978 based upon its adjusted net income for 1977. On 
the other hand, if such ruling or letter is terminated in 1977 or 1978, 
no distribution under paragraph (e)(13)(viii) of this section need be 
made.
    (ix) Net income. The community trust's funds must, on an aggregate 
basis, be invested to produce an annual adjusted net income (as defined 
in section 4942(f)) of not less than two-thirds of what would be its 
minimum investment return (within the meaning of section 4942(e)) if 
such organization were a private foundation.

[[Page 109]]

    (x) Unrestricted gifts. At least one-half of the total income which 
the community trust derives from the investment of gifts and bequests 
received must be unrestricted (within the meaning of this (x)) with 
respect to its availability for distribution by the governing body. For 
purposes of this (x), any income which has been designated by the donor 
of the gift or bequest to which such income is attributable as being 
available only for the use or benefit of a broad charitable purpose, 
such as the encouragement of higher education or the promotion of better 
health care in the community, will be treated as unrestricted. However, 
any income which has been designated for the use or benefit of a named 
charitable organization or agency or for the use or benefit of a 
particular class of charitable organizations or agencies, the members of 
which are readily ascertainable and are less than five in number, will 
be treated as restricted.
    (xi) Self-dealing. The community trust may not engage in any act 
with any person (other than a foundation manager acting only in such 
capacity) which would constitute self-dealing within the meaning of 
section 4941 if such community trust were a private foundation.
    (xii) Excess holdings. The community trust must dispose of any 
holdings which would constitute excess business holdings (within the 
meaning of section 4943--applied on a component-by-component basis as if 
each component were a private foundation, except that components will be 
combined for purposes of this paragraph if such components would have 
been described in section 4946(a)(1)(H)(ii)).
    (xiii) Expenditure responsibility. The community trust must exercise 
expenditure responsibility (within the meaning of section 4945(h)) 
through either its governing body, trustees, investment managers, 
custodians, or agents with respect to any grant which would otherwise 
constitute a taxable expenditure under section 4945(d)(4) if the 
community trust were a private foundation, except that it need not make 
the reports required of private foundations by section 4945(h)(3).
    (14) Community trusts; treatment of trusts and not-for-profit 
corporations and associations not included as components. (i) For 
purposes of sections 170, 501, 507, 508, 509 and Chapter 42, any trust 
or not-for-profit corporation or association which is alleged to be a 
component part of a community trust, but which fails to meet the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(11)(ii) of this section, shall not be 
treated as a component part of a community trust and, if a trust, shall 
be treated as a separate trust and be subject to the provisions of 
section 501 or section 4947(a) (1) or (2), as the case may be. If such 
organization is a not-for-profit corporation or association, it will be 
treated as a separate entity, and, if it is described in section 
501(c)(3), it will be treated as a private foundation unless it is 
described in section 509(a) (1), (2), (3), or (4). Any transfer made in 
connection with the creation of such separate trust or not-for-profit 
organization, or to such entity, will not be treated as being made 
``to'' the community trust or one of its components for purposes of 
sections 170(b)(1)(A) and 507(b)(1)(A) even though a deduction with 
respect to such transfer is allowable under Sec. 1,170-1(e), 
Sec. 20.2055-2(b), or Sec. 25.2522(a)-2(b), unless such treatment is 
permitted under Sec. 1.170A-9(e)(4)(v)(b) or Sec. 1.508-1(b)(4). In the 
case of a fund which is ultimately treated as not being a component part 
of a community trust pursuant to paragraph (e)(14) of this section, if 
the Forms 990 filed annually by the community trust included financial 
information with respect to such fund and treated such fund in the same 
manner as other component parts thereof, such returns filed by the 
community trust prior to the taxable year in which the Commissioner 
notifies such fund that it will not be treated as a component part will 
be treated as its separate return for purpose of Subchapter A of Chapter 
61 of Subtitle F, and the first such return filed by the community trust 
will be treated as the notification required of the separate entity for 
purposes of section 508(a).
    (ii) If a transfer is made in trust to a community trust to make 
income or other payments for a period of a life or lives in being or a 
term of years to any individual or for any noncharitable purpose, 
followed by payments to or for the use of the community trust (such

[[Page 110]]

as in the case of a charitable remainder annuity trust or a charitable 
remainder unitrust described in section 664 or a pooled income fund 
described in section 642(c)(5)), such trust will be treated as a 
component part of the community trust upon the termination of all 
intervening noncharitable interests and rights to the actual possession 
or enjoyment of the property if such trust satisfies the requirements of 
paragraph (e)(11) of this section at such time. Until such time, the 
trust will be treated as a separate trust. If a transfer is made in 
trust to a community trust to make income or other payments to or for 
the use of the community trust, followed by payments to any individual 
or for any noncharitable purpose, such trust will be treated as a 
separate trust rather than as a component part of the community trust. 
See section 4947(a)(2) and the regulations thereunder for the treatment 
of such split-interest trusts. The provisions of this (ii) only provide 
rules for determining when a charitable remainder trust or pooled income 
fund may be treated as a component part of a community trust and are not 
intended to preclude a community trust from maintaining a charitable 
remainder trust or pooled income fund. Thus, for purposes of grantors 
and contributors, a pooled income fund of a ``publicly supported'' 
community trust shall be treated no differently than a pooled income 
fund of any other ``publicly supported'' organization.
    (iii) An organization described in section 170(b)(1)(E)(iii) will 
not ordinarily satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(11)(ii) of this 
section because of the unqualified right of the donor to designate the 
recipients of the income and principal of the trust. Such organization 
will therefore ordinarily be treated as other than a component part of a 
community trust under paragraph (e)(14)(i) of this section. However, see 
section 170(b)(1)(E)(iii) and the regulations thereunder with respect to 
the treatment of contributions to such organizations.
    (f) Private operating foundation. An organization is described in 
section 170(b)(1) (A)(vii) and (E)(i) if it is a private ``operating 
foundation'' as defined in section 4942(j)(3) and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (g) Private nonoperating foundation distributing amount equal to all 
contributions received--(1) In general. (i) An organization is described 
in section 170(b)(1) (A)(vii) and (E)(ii) if it is a private foundation 
which, not later than the 15th day of the third month after the close of 
its taxable year in which any contributions are received, distributes an 
amount equal in value to 100 percent of all contributions received in 
such year. Such distributions must be qualifying distributions (as 
defined in section 4942(g) without regard to paragraph (3) thereof) 
which are treated, after the application of section 4942(g)(3), as 
distributions out of corpus in accordance with section 4942(h). 
Qualifying distributions, as defined in section 4942(g) without regard 
to paragraph (3) thereof, cannot be made to (i) an organization 
controlled directly or indirectly by the foundation or by one or more 
disqualified persons (as defined in section 4946) with respect to the 
foundation or (ii) a private foundation which is not an operating 
foundation (as defined in section 4942(j)(3)). The phrase ``after the 
application of section 4942(g)(3)'' means that every contribution 
described in section 4942(g)(3) received by a private foundation 
described in this subparagraph in a particular taxable year must be 
distributed (within the meaning of section 4942(g)(3)(A)) by such 
foundation not later than the 15th day of the third month after the 
close of such taxable year in order for any other distribution by such 
foundation to be counted toward the 100-percent requirement described in 
this subparagraph.
    (ii) In order for an organization to meet the distribution 
requirements of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, it must, not later 
than the 15th day of the third month after the close of its taxable year 
in which any contributions are received, distribute (within the meaning 
of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) an amount equal in value to 100 
percent of all contributions received in such year and have no remaining 
undistributed income for such year.
    (iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:


[[Page 111]]


    Example 1. X is a private foundation on a calendar year basis. As of 
January 1, 1971, X had no undistributed income for 1970. X's 
distributable amount for 1971 was $600,000. In July 1971, A, an 
individual, contributed $500,000 (fair market value determined at the 
time of the contribution) of appreciated property to X (which, if sold, 
would give rise to long-term capital gain). X did not receive any other 
contribution in either 1970 or 1971. During 1971, X made qualifying 
distributions of $700,000 which were treated as made out of the 
undistributed income for 1971 and $100,000 out of corpus. X will meet 
the requirements of section 170(b)(1)(E)(ii) for 1971 if it makes 
additional qualifying distributions of $400,000 out of corpus by March 
15, 1972.
    Example 2. Assume the facts as stated in Example 1, except that as 
of January 1, 1971, X had $100,000 of undistributed income for 1970. 
Under these circumstances, the $700,000 distributed by X in 1971 would 
be treated as made out of the undistributed income for 1970 and 1971. X 
would therefore have to make additional qualifying distributions of 
$500,000 out of corpus between January 1, 1972, and March 15, 1972, in 
order to meet the requirements of section 170(b)(1)(E)(ii) for 1971.

    (2) Special rules. In applying subparagraph (1) of this paragraph:
    (i) For purposes of section 170(b)(1)(A)(vii), an organization 
described in section 170(b)(1)(E)(ii) must distribute all contributions 
received in any year, whether of cash or property. However, solely for 
purposes of section 170(e)(1)(B)(ii), an organization described in 
section 170(b)(1)(E)(ii) is required to distribute all contributions of 
property only received in any year. Contributions for purposes of this 
paragraph do not include bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers 
within the meaning of section 2055 or 2106(a)(2) with respect to which a 
deduction was not allowed under section 170.
    (ii) Any distributions made by a private foundation pursuant to 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to a particular taxable 
year shall be treated as made first out of contributions of property and 
then out of contributions of cash received by such foundation in such 
year.
    (iii) A private foundation is not required to trace specific 
contributions of property, or amounts into which such contributions are 
converted, to specific distributions.
    (iv) For purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 
170(b)(1)(D)(ii), except as provided to the contrary in this subdivision 
(iv), the fair market value of contributed property, determined on the 
date of contribution, is required to be used for purposes of determining 
whether an amount equal in value to 100 percent of the contribution 
received has been distributed. However, reasonable selling expenses, if 
any, incurred by the foundation in the sale of the contributed property 
may be deducted from the fair market value of the contributed property 
on the date of contribution, and distribution of the balance of the fair 
market value will satisfy the 100 percent distribution requirement. If a 
private foundation receives a contribution of property and, within 30 
days thereafter, either sells the property or makes an in kind 
distribution of the property to a public charity, then at the choice of 
the private foundation the gross amount received on the sale (less 
reasonable selling expenses incurred) or the fair market value of the 
contributed property at the date of its distribution to the public 
charity, and not the fair market value of the contributed property on 
the sale of contribution (less reasonable selling expenses, if any), is 
considered to be the amount of the fair market value of the contributed 
property for purposes of the requirements of section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii).
    (v) A private foundation may satisfy the requirements of 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for a particular taxable year by 
electing (pursuant to section 4942(h)(2) and the regulations thereunder) 
to treat a portion or all of one or more distributions, made not later 
than the 15th day of the third month after the close of such year, as 
made out of corpus.
    (3) Transitional rules--(i) Taxable years beginning before January 
1, 1970, and ending after December 31, 1969. In order for an 
organization to meet the distribution requirements of subparagraph 
(1)(i) of this paragraph for a taxable year which begins before January 
1, 1970, and ends after December 31, 1969, it must, not later than the 
15th day of the third month after the close of such taxable year, 
distribute (within the meaning of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph) 
an amount equal in

[[Page 112]]

value to 100 percent of all contributions (other than contributions 
described in section 4942(g)(3)) which were received between January 1, 
1970, and the last day of such taxable year. Because the organization is 
not subject to the provisions of section 4942 for such year, the 
organization need not satisfy subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph or 
the phrase ``after the application of section 4942(g)(3)'' for such 
year.
    (ii) Extension of period. For purposes of section 170(b)(1)(A)(vii) 
and 170(e)(1)(B)(ii), in the case of a taxable year ending in either 
1970, 1971 or 1972, the period referred to in section 170(b)(1)(E)(ii) 
for making distributions shall not expire before April 2, 1973.
    (4) Adequate records required. A taxpayer claiming a deduction under 
section 170 for a charitable contribution to a foundation described in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph must obtain adequate records or other 
sufficient evidence from such foundation showing that the foundation 
made the required qualifying distributions within the time prescribed. 
Such records or other evidence must be attached to the taxpayer's return 
for the taxable year for which the charitable contribution deduction is 
claimed. If necessary, an amended income tax return or claim for refund 
may be filed in accordance with Sec. 301.6402-2 and Sec. 301.6402-3 of 
this chapter (procedure and administration regulations).
    (h) Private foundation maintaining a common fund--(1) Designation by 
substantial contributors. An organization is described in section 
170(b)(1) (A)(vii) and (E)(iii) if it is a private foundation all of the 
contributions to which are pooled in a common fund and which would be 
described in section 509(a)(3) but for the right of any donor who is a 
substantial contributor or his spouse to designate annually the 
recipients, from among public charities, of the income attributable to 
the donor's contribution to the fund and to direct (by deed or by will) 
the payment, to public charities, of the corpus in the common fund 
attributable to the donor's contribution. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the private foundation is to be treated as meeting the 
requirements of section 509(a)(3) (A) and (B) even though donors to the 
foundation, or their spouses, retain the right to, and in fact do, 
designate public charities to receive income or corpus from the fund.
    (2) Distribution requirements. To qualify under subparagraph (1) of 
this paragraph, the private foundation described therein must be 
required by its governing instrument to distribute, and it must in fact 
distribute (including administrative expenses):
    (i) All of the adjusted net income (as defined in section 4942(f)) 
of the common fund to one or more public charities not later than the 
15th day of the third month after the close of the taxable year in which 
such income is realized by the fund, and
    (ii) All the corpus attributable to any donor's contribution to the 
fund to one or more public charities not later than 1 year after the 
donor's death or after the death of the donor's surviving spouse if such 
surviving spouse has the right to designate the recipients of such 
corpus.
    (3) Failure to designate. A private foundation will not fail to 
qualify under this paragraph merely because a substantial contributor or 
his spouse fails to exercise his right to designate the recipients of 
income or corpus of the fund, provided that the income and corpus 
attributable to his contribution are distributed as required by 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (4) Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph:
    (i) The term substantial contributor is as defined in section 
507(d)(2) and the regulations thereunder.
    (ii) The term public charity means an organization described in 
section 170(b)(1)(A) (i) through (vi). If an organization is described 
in section 170(b)(1)(A) (i) through (vi), and is also described in 
section 170(b)(1)(A)(viii), it shall be treated as a public charity for 
purposes of this paragraph.
    (iii) The term income attributable to means the income earned by the 
fund which is properly allocable to the contributed amount by any 
reasonable and consistently applied method. See, for example, 
Sec. 1.642(c)-5(c).
    (iv) The term corpus attributable to means the portion of the corpus 
of the fund attributable to the contributed

[[Page 113]]

amount. Such portion may be determined by any reasonable and 
consistently applied method.
    (v) The term donor means any individual who makes a contribution 
(whether of cash or property) to the private foundation, whether or not 
such individual is a substantial contributor.
    (i) Section 509(a) (2) or (3) organization. An organization is 
described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(viii) if it is described in section 
509(a) (2) or (3) and the regulations thereunder.

<R05>
Sec. 1.170A-10   Charitable contributions carryovers of individuals.

    (a) In general. (1) Section 170(d)(1), relating to carryover of 
charitable contributions in excess of 50 percent of contribution base, 
and section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii), relating to carryover of charitable 
contributions in excess of 30 percent of contribution base, provide for 
excess charitable contributions carryovers by individuals of charitable 
contributions to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations described in 
Sec. 1.170A-9. These carryovers shall be determined as provided in 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. No excess charitable 
contributions carryover shall be allowed with respect to contributions 
``for the use of,'' rather than ``to,'' section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organizations or with respect to contributions ``to'' or ``for the use 
of'' organizations which are not section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations. See 
Sec. 1.170A-8(a)(2) for definitions of ``to'' or ``for the use of'' a 
charitable organization.
    (2) The carryover provisions apply with respect to contributions 
made during a taxable year in excess of the applicable percentage 
limitation even though the taxpayer elects under section 144 to take the 
standard deduction in that year instead of itemizing the deduction 
allowable in computing taxable income for that year.
    (3) For provisions requiring a reduction of the excess charitable 
contribution computed under paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section 
when there is a net operating loss carryover to the taxable year, see 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (4) The provisions of section 170 (b)(1)(D)(ii) and (d)(1) and this 
section do not apply to contributions by an estate; nor do they apply to 
a trust unless the trust is a private foundation which, pursuant to 
Sec. 1.642(c)-4, is allowed a deduction under section 170 subject to the 
provisions applicable to individuals.
    (b) 50-percent charitable contributions carryover of individuals--
(1) Computation of excess of charitable contributions made in a 
contribution year. Under section 170(d)(1), subject to certain 
conditions and limitations, the excess of:
    (i) The amount of the charitable contributions made by an individual 
in a taxable year (hereinafter) in this paragraph referred to as the 
``contribution year'') to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations described 
in Sec. 1.170A-9, over
    (ii) 50 percent of his contribution base, as defined in section 
170(b)(1)(F), for such contribution year, shall be treated as a 
charitable contribution paid by him to a section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization in each of the 5 taxable years immediately succeeding the 
contribution year in order of time. However, such excess to the extent 
it consists of contributions of 30-percent capital gain property, as 
defined in Sec. 1.170A-8(d)(3), shall be subject to the rules of section 
170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (c) of this section in the years to which 
it is carried over. A charitable contribution made in a taxable year 
beginning before January 1, 1970, to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization 
and carried over to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, 
under section 170(b)(5) (before its amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 
1969) shall be treated in such taxable year beginning after December 31, 
1969, as a charitable contribution of cash subject to the limitations of 
this paragraph, whether or not such carryover consists of contributions 
of 30-percent capital gain property or of ordinary income property 
described in Sec. 1.170A-4(b)(1). For purposes of applying this 
paragraph and paragraph (c) of this section, such a carryover from a 
taxable year beginning before January 1,

[[Page 114]]

1970, which is so treated as paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization 
in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, shall be treated as 
paid to such an organization under section 170(d)(1) and this section. 
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. Assume that H and W (husband and wife) have a 
contribution base for 1970 of $50,000 and for 1971 of $40,000 and file a 
joint return for each year. Assume further that in 1970 they make a 
charitable contribution in cash of $26,500 to a church and $1,000 to X 
(not a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization) and in 1971 they make a 
charitable contribution in cash of $19,000 to a church and $600 to X. 
They may claim a charitable contributions deduction of $25,000 in 1970, 
and the excess of $26,500 (contribution to the church) over $25,000 (50 
percent of contribution base), or $1,500, constitutes a charitable 
contributions carryover which shall be treated as a charitable 
contribution paid by them to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in each 
of the 5 succeeding taxable years in order of time. No carryover is 
allowed with respect to the $1,000 contribution made to X in 1970. Since 
50 percent of their contribution base for 1971 ($20,000) exceeds the 
charitable contributions of $19,000 made by them in 1971 to section 
170(b)(1)(A) organizations (computed without regard to section 170 
(b)(1)(D)(ii) and (d)(1) and this section), the portion of the 1970 
carryover equal to such excess of $1,000 ($20,000 minus $19,000) is 
treated, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph, as paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1971; the 
remaining $500 constitutes an unused charitable contributions carryover. 
No deduction for 1971, and no carryover, are allowed with respect to the 
$600 contribution made to X in 1971.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that H and 
W have a contribution base for 1971 of $42,000. Since 50 percent of 
their contribution base for 1971 ($21,000) exceeds by $2,000 the 
charitable contribution of $19,000 made by them in 1971 to the section 
170(b)(1)(A) organization (computed without regard to section 170 
(b)(1)(D)(ii) and (d)(1) and this section), the full amount of the 1970 
carryover of $1,500 is treated, pursuant to the provisions of 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, as paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization in 1971. They may also claim a charitable contribution of 
$500 ($21,000 -$20,500[$19,000+$1,500]) with respect to the gift to X in 
1971. No carryover is allowed with respect to the $100 ($600-$500) of 
the contribution to X which is not deductible in 1971.

    (2) Determination of amount treated as paid in taxable years 
succeeding contribution year. In applying the provisions of subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph, the amount of the excess computed in accordance 
with the provisions of such subparagraph and paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section which is to be treated as paid in any one of the 5 taxable years 
immediately succeeding the contribution year to a section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization shall not exceed the lesser of the amounts computed under 
subdivisions (i) to (iii), inclusive, of this subparagraph:
    (i) The amount by which 50 percent of the taxpayer's contribution 
base for such succeeding taxable year exceeds the sum of:
    (a) The charitable contributions actually made (computed without 
regard to the provisions of section 170 (b)(1)(D)(ii) and (d)(1) and 
this section) by the taxpayer in such succeeding taxable year to section 
170(b)(1)(A) organizations, and
    (b) The charitable contributions, other than contributions of 30-
percent capital gain property, made to section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organizations in taxable years preceding the contribution year which, 
pursuant to the provisions of section 170(d)(1) and this section, are 
treated as having been paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 
such succeeding year.
    (ii) In the case of the first taxable year succeeding the 
contribution year, the amount of the excess charitable contribution in 
the contribution year, computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
and paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (iii) In the case of the second, third, fourth, and fifth taxable 
years succeeding the contribution year, the portion of the excess 
charitable contribution in the contribution year, computed under 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and paragraph (d)(1) of this section, 
which has not been treated as paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization in a year intervening between the contribution year and 
such succeeding taxable year.

For purposes of applying subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph, the 
amount of charitable contributions of 30-percent capital gain property 
actually made in a taxable year succeeding the contribution year shall 
be determined

[[Page 115]]

by first applying the 30-percent limitation of section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) 
and paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.170A-8. If a taxpayer, in any one of the 4 
taxable years succeeding a contribution year, elects under section 144 
to take the standard deduction instead of itemizing the deductions 
allowable in computing taxable income, there shall be treated as paid 
(but not allowable as a deduction) in such standard deduction year the 
lesser of the amounts determined under subdivisions (i) to (iii), 
inclusive, of this subparagraph. The provisions of this subparagraph may 
be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Assume that B has a contribution base for 1970 of $20,000 
and for 1971 of $30,000. Assume further that in 1970 B contributed 
$12,000 in cash to a church and in 1971 he contributed $13,500 in cash 
to the church. B may claim a charitable contributions deduction of 
$10,000 in 1970, and the excess of $12,000 (contribution to the church) 
over $10,000 (50 percent of B's contribution base), or $2,000, 
constitutes a charitable contributions carryover which shall be treated 
as a charitable contribution paid by B to a section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization in the 5 taxable years succeeding 1970 in order of time. B 
may claim a charitable contributions deduction of $15,000 in 1971. Such 
$15,000 consists of the $13,500 contribution to the church in 1971 and 
$1,500 carried over from 1970 and treated as a charitable contribution 
paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1971. The $1,500 
contribution treated as paid in 1971 is computed as follows:

1970 excess contributions....................................     $2,000
                                                   ============

Amount of 1970 excess treated as paid in 1971--the lesser of            
 $2,000 (1970 excess contributions) or $1,500 (excess of 50             
 percent of contribution base for 1971 ($15,000) over the sum           
 of the section 170(b)(1)(A) contributions actually made in             
 1971 ($13,500) and the section 170(b)(1)(A) contributions              
 made in years prior to 1970 treated as having been paid in             
 1971 ($0))..................................................      1,500
                                                   ============         
                                                                        

If the excess contributions made by B in 1970 had been $1,000 instead of 
$2,000, then, for purposes of this example, the amount of the 1970 
excess treated as paid in 1971 would be $1,000 rather than $1,500.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), and, in 
addition, that B has a contribution base for 1972 of $10,000 and for 
1973 of $20,000. Assume further with respect to 1972 that B elects under 
section 144 to take the standard deduction in computing taxable income 
and that his actual contributions to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations 
in that year are $300 in cash. Assume further with respect to 1973 that 
R itemizes his deductions, which include a $5,000 cash contribution to a 
church. B's deductions for 1972 are not increased by reason of the $500 
available as a charitable contributions carryover from 1970 (excess 
contributions made in 1970 ($2,000) less the amount of such excess 
treated as paid in 1971 ($1,500)), since B elected to take the standard 
deduction in 1972. However, for purposes of determining the amount of 
the excess charitable contributions made in 1970 which is available as a 
carryover to 1973, B is required to treat such $500 as a charitable 
contribution paid in 1972--the lesser of $500 or $4,700 (50 percent of 
contribution base ($5,000) over contributions actually made in 1972 to 
section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations ($300)). Therefore, even though the 
$5,000 contribution made by B in 1973 to a church does not amount to 50 
percent of B's contribution base for 1973 (50 percent of $20,000), B may 
claim a charitable contributions deduction of only the $5,000 actually 
paid in 1973 since the entire excess charitable contribution made in 
1970 ($2,000) has been treated as paid in 1971 ($1,500) and 1972 ($500).
    Example 3. Assume the following factual situation for C who itemizes 
his deductions in computing taxable income for each of the years set 
forth in the example:

Since C's contributions in 1973 and 1974 to section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organizations are less than 50 percent of his contribution base for such 
years, the excess contributions for 1970, 1971, and 1972 are treated as

    (c) 30-percent charitable contributions carryover of individuals--
(1) Computation of excess of charitable contributions made in a 
contribution year. Under section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii), subject to certain 
conditions and limitations, the excess of:
    (i) The amount of the charitable contributions of 30-percent capital 
gain property, as defined in Sec. 1.170A-8(d)(3), made by an individual 
in a taxable year (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the 
``contribution year'') to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations described 
in Sec. 1.170A-9, over
    (ii) 30 percent of his contribution base for such contribution year, 
shall, subject to section 170(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.170A-
8, be treated as a charitable contribution of 30-percent capital gain 
property paid by him to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in each of 
the 5 taxable years immediately succeeding the contribution year in 
order of time. In addition, any charitable contribution of 30-percent 
capital gain property which is carried over to such years under section 
170(d)(1) and paragraph (b) of this section shall also be treated as 
though it were a carryover of 30-percent capital gain property under 
section 170(b)(1)(D)(ii) and this paragraph. The provisions of this 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Assume that H and W (husband and wife) have a 
contribution base for 1970 of $50,000 and for 1971 of $40,000 and file a 
joint return for each year. Assume further that in 1970 they contribute 
$20,000 cash and $13,000 of 30-percent capital gain property to a 
church, and that in 1971 they contribute $5,000 cash and $10,000 of 30-
percent capital gain property to a church. They may claim a charitable 
contributions deduction of $25,000 in 1970 and the excess of $33,000 
(contributed to the church) over $25,000 (50 percent of contribution 
base), or $8,000, constitutes a charitable contributions carryover which 
shall be treated as a charitable contribution of 30-percent capital gain 
property paid by them to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in each of 
the 5 succeeding taxable years in order of time. Since 30 percent of 
their contribution base for 1971 ($12,000) exceeds the charitable 
contributions of 30-percent capital gain property ($10,000) made by them 
in 1971 to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations (computed without regard 
to section 170 (b)(1)(D)(ii) and (d)(1) and this section), the portion 
of the 1970 carryover equal to such excess of $2,000 ($12,000--$10,000) 
is treated, pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph, as paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1971; the 
remaining $6,000 constitutes an unused charitable contributions 
carryover in respect of 30-percent capital gain property from 1970.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except the 
$33,000 of charitable contributions in 1970 are all 30-percent capital 
gain property. Since their charitable contributions in 1970 exceed 30 
percent of their contribution base ($15,000) by $18,000

[[Page 117]]

($33,000--$15,000), they may claim a charitable contributions deduction 
of $15,000 in 1970, and the excess of $33,000 over $15,000, or $18,000, 
constitutes a charitable contributions carryover which shall be treated 
as a charitable contribution of 30-percent capital gain property paid by 
them to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in each of the 5 succeeding 
taxable years in order of time. Since they are allowed to treat only 
$2,000 of their 1970 contribution as paid in 1971, they have a remaining 
unused charitable contributions carryover of $16,000 in respect of 30-
percent capital gain property from 1970.

    (2) Determination of amount treated as paid in taxable years 
succeeding contribution year. In applying the provisions of subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph, the amount of the excess computed in accordance 
with the provisions of such subparagraph and paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section which is to be treated as paid in any one of the 5 taxable years 
immediately succeeding the contribution year to a section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization shall not exceed the least of the amounts computed under 
subdivisions (i) to (iv), inclusive, of this subparagraph:
    (i) The amount by which 30 percent of the taxpayer's contribution

actually made (computed without regard to the provisions of section 170 
(b)(1)(D)(ii) and (d)(1) and this section) by the taxpayer in such 
succeeding taxable year to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations, and
    (b) The charitable contributions of 30-percent capital gain property 
made to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations in taxable years preceding 
the contribution year, which, pursuant to the provisions of section 170 
(b)(1)(D)(ii) and (d)(1) and this section, are treated as having been 
paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in such succeeding year.
    (ii) The amount by which 50 percent of the taxpayer's contribution 
base for such succeeding taxable year exceeds the sum of:
    (a) The charitable contributions actually made (computed without 
regard to the provisions of section 170 (b)(1)(D)(ii) and (d)(1) and 
this section) by the taxpayer in such succeeding taxable year to section 
170(b)(1)(A) organizations,
    (b) The charitable contributions of 30-percent capital gain property 
made to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations in taxable years preceding 
the contribution year which, pursuant to the provisions of section 170 
(b)(1)(D)(ii) and (d)(1) and this section, are treated as having been 
paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in such succeeding year, and
    (c) The charitable contributions, other than contributions of 30-
percent capital gain property, made to section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organizations which, pursuant to the provisions of section 170(d)(1) and 
paragraph (b) of this section, are treated as having been paid to a 
section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in such succeeding year.
    (iii) In the case of the first taxable year succeeding the 
contribution year, the amount of the excess charitable contribution of 
30-percent capital gain property in the contribution year, computed 
under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph and paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section.
    (iv) In the case of the second, third, fourth, and fifth succeeding 
taxable years succeeding the contribution year, the portion of the 
excess charitable contribution of 30-percent capital gain property in 
the contribution year (computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
and paragraph (d)(1) of this section) which has not been treated as paid 
to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in a year intervening between the 
contribution year and such succeeding taxable year.

For purposes of applying subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, 
the amount of charitable contributions of 30-percent capital gain 
property actually made in a taxable year succeeding the contribution 
year shall be determined by first applying the 30-percent limitation of 
section 170(b)(1)(D)(i) and paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.170A-8. If a 
taxpayer, in any one of the four taxable years succeeding a contribution 
year, elects under section 144 to take the standard deduction instead of 
itemizing the deductions allowable in computing taxable income, there 
shall be treated as paid (but not allowable as a deduction) in the 
standard deduction

    (d) Adjustments--(1) Effect of net operating loss carryovers on 
carryover of excess contributions. An individual having a net operating 
loss carryover from a prior taxable year which is available as a 
deduction in a contribution year must apply the special rule of section 
170(d)(1)(B) and this subparagraph in computing the excess described in 
paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section for such contribution year. 
In determining the amount of excess charitable contributions that shall 
be treated as paid in each of the 5 taxable years succeeding the 
contribution year, the excess charitable contributions described in 
paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section must be reduced by the amount 
by which such excess reduces taxable income (for purposes of determining 
the portion of a net operating loss which shall be carried to taxable 
years succeeding the contribution year under the second sentence of 
section 172(b)(2)) and increases the net operating loss which is carried 
to a succeeding taxable year. In reducing taxable income under the 
second sentence of section

[[Page 121]]

172(b)(2), an individual who has made charitable contributions in the 
contribution year to both section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations, as defined 
in Sec. 1.170A-9, and to organizations which are not section 
170(b)(1)(A) organizations must first deduct contributions made to the 
section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations from his adjusted gross income 
computed without regard to his net operating loss deduction before any 
of the contributions made to organizations which are not section 
170(b)(1)(A) organizations may be deducted from such adjusted gross 
income. Thus, if the excess of the contributions made in the 
contribution year to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations over the amount 
deductible in such contribution year is utilized to reduce taxable 
income (under the provisions of section 172(b)(2)) for such year, 
thereby serving to increase the amount of the net operating loss 
carryover to a succeeding year or years, no part of the excess 
charitable contributions made in such contribution year shall be treated 
as paid in any of the 5 immediately succeeding taxable years. If only a 
portion of the excess charitable contributions is so used, the excess 
charitable contributions shall be reduced only to that extent. The 
provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. B, an individual, reports his income on the calendar year 
basis and for the year 1970 has adjusted gross income (computed without 
regard to any net operating loss deduction) of $50,000. During 1970 he 
made charitable contributions of cash in the amount of $30,000 all of 
which were to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations. B has a net operating 
loss carryover from 1969 of $50,000. In the absence of the net operating 
loss deduction B would have been allowed a deduction for charitable 
contributions of $25,000. After the application of the net operating 
loss deduction, B is allowed no deduction for charitable contributions, 
and there is (before applying the special rule of section 170(d)(1)(B) 
and this subparagraph) a tentative excess charitable contribution of 
$30,000. For purposes of determining the net operating loss which 
remains to be carried over to 1971, B computes his taxable income for 
1970 under section 172(b)(2) by deducting the $25,000 charitable 
contribution. After the $50,000 net operating loss carryover is applied 
against the $25,000 of taxable income for 1970 (computed in accordance 
with section 172(b)(2), assuming no deductions other than the charitable 
contributions deduction are applicable in making such computation), 
there remains a $25,000 net operating loss carryover to 1971. Since the 
application of the net operating loss carryover of $50,000 from 1969 
reduces the 1970 adjusted gross income (for purposes of determining 1970 
tax liability) to zero, no part of the $25,000 of charitable 
contributions in that year is deductible under section 170(b)(1). 
However, in determining the amount of the excess charitable 
contributions which shall be treated as paid in taxable years 1971, 
1972, 1973, 1974, and 1975, the $30,000 must be reduced to $5,000 by the 
portion of the excess charitable contributions ($25,000) which was used 
to reduce taxable income for 1970 (as computed for purposes of the 
second sentence of section 172(b)(2)) and which thereby served to 
increase the net operating loss carryover to 1971 from zero to $25,000.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that B's 
total charitable contributions of $30,000 in cash made during 1970 
consisted of $25,000 to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations and $5,000 to 
organizations other than section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations. Under these 
facts there is a tentative excess charitable contribution of $25,000, 
rather than $30,000 as in Example (1). For purposes of determining the 
net operating loss which remains to be carried over to 1971, B computes 
his taxable income for 1970 under section 172(b)(2) by deducting the 
$25,000 of charitable contributions made to section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organizations. Since the excess charitable contribution of $25,000 
determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section was used 
to reduce taxable income for 1970 (as computed for purposes of the 
second sentence of section 172(b)(2)) and thereby served to increase the 
net operating loss carryover to 1971 from zero to $25,000, no part of 
such excess charitable contributions made in the contribution year shall 
be treated as paid in any of the five immediately succeeding taxable 
years. No carryover is allowed with respect to the $5,000 of charitable 
contributions made in 1970 to organizations other than section 
170(b)(1)(A) organizations.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that B's 
total contributions of $30,000 made during 1970 were of 30-percent 
capital gain property. Under these facts there is a tentative excess 
charitable contribution of $30,000. For purposes of determining the net 
operating loss which remains to be carried over to 1971, B computes his 
taxable income for 1970 under section 172(b)(2)(B) by deducting the 
$15,000 (30% of $50,000) contribution of 30-percent capital gain 
property which would have been deductible in 1970 absent the net 
operating loss deduction. Since $15,000 of the excess charitable 
contribution of $30,000 determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section was used to reduce taxable income for

[[Page 122]]

1970 (as computed for purposes of the second sentence of section 
172(b)(2)) and thereby served to increase the net operating loss 
carryover to 1971 from zero to $15,000, only $15,000 ($30,000--$15,000) 
of such excess shall be treated as paid in taxable years 1971, 1972, 
1973, 1974, and 1975.

    (2) Effect of net operating loss carryback to contribution year. The 
amount of the excess contribution for a contribution year computed as 
provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section and subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph shall not be increased because a net operating 
loss carryback is available as a deduction in the contribution year. 
Thus, for example, assuming that in 1970 there is an excess contribution 
of $50,000 (determined as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) 
which is to be carried to the 5 succeeding taxable years and that in 
1973 the taxpayer has a net operating loss which may be carried back to 
1970, the excess contribution of $50,000 for 1970 is not increased by 
reason of the fact that the adjusted gross income for 1970 (on which 
such excess contribution was based) is subsequently decreased by the 
carryback of the net operating loss from 1973. In addition, in 
determining under the provisions of section 172(b)(2) the amount of the 
net operating loss for any year subsequent to the contribution year 
which is a carryback or carryover to taxable years succeeding the 
contribution year, the amount of contributions made to section 
170(b)(1)(A) organizations shall be limited to the amount of such 
contributions which did not exceed 50 percent or, in the case of 30-
percent capital gain property, 30 percent of the donor's contribution 
base, computed without regard to any of the modifications referred to in 
section 172(d), for the contribution year. Thus, for example, assume 
that the taxpayer has a net operating loss in 1973 which is carried back 
to 1970 and in turn to 1971 and that he has made charitable 
contributions in 1970 to section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations. In 
determining the maximum amount of such charitable contributions which 
may be deducted in 1970 for purposes of determining the taxable income 
for 1970 which is deducted under section 172(b)(2) from the 1973 loss in 
order to ascertain the amount of such loss which is carried back to 
1971, the 50-percent limitation of section 170(b)(1)(A) is based upon 
the adjusted gross income for 1970 computed without taking into account 
the net operating loss carryback from 1973 and without making any of the 
modifications specified in section 172(d).
    (3) Effect of net operating loss carryback to taxable years 
succeeding the contribution year. The amount of the charitable 
contribution from a preceding taxable year which is treated as paid, as 
provided in paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section, in a current 
taxable year (hereinafter referred to in this subparagraph as the 
``deduction year'') shall not be reduced because a net operating loss 
carryback is available as a deduction in the deduction year. In 
addition, in determining under the provisions of section 172(b)(2) the 
amount of the net operating loss for any taxable year subsequent to the 
deduction year which is a carryback or carryover to taxable years 
succeeding the deduction year, the amount of contributions made to 
section 170(b)(1)(A) organizations in the deduction year shall be 
limited to the amount of such contributions, which were actually made in 
such year and those which were treated as paid in such year, which did 
not exceed 50 percent or, in the case of 30-percent capital gain 
property, 30 percent of the donor's contribution base, computed without 
regard to any of the modifications referred to in section 172(d), for 
the deduction year.
    (4) Husband and wife filing joint returns--(i) Change from joint 
return to separate returns. If a husband and wife:
    (a) Make a joint return for a contribution year and compute an 
excess charitable contribution for such year in accordance with the 
provisions of paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section and 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and
    (b) Make separate returns for one or more of the 5 taxable years 
immediately succeeding such contribution year, any excess charitable 
contribution for the contribution year which is unused at the beginning 
of the first such taxable year for which separate returns are filed 
shall be allocated between the husband and wife. For purposes of the 
allocation, a computation

[[Page 123]]

shall be made of the amount of any excess charitable contribution which 
each spouse would have computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) or 
(c)(1) of this section and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph if 
separate returns (rather than a joint return) had been filed for the 
contribution year. The portion of the total unused excess charitable 
contribution for the contribution year allocated to each spouse shall be 
an amount which bears the same ratio to such unused excess charitable 
contribution as such spouse's excess contribution, based on the separate 
return computation, bears to the total excess contributions of both 
spouses, based on the separate return computation. To the extent that a 
portion of the amount allocated to either spouse in accordance with the 
foregoing provisions of this subdivision is not treated in accordance 
with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section as a 
charitable contribution paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 
the taxable year in which a separate return or separate returns are 
filed, each spouse shall for purposes of paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of 
this section treat his respective unused portion as the available 
charitable contributions carryover to the next succeeding taxable year 
in which the joint excess charitable contribution may be treated as paid 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section. If such 
husband and wife make a joint return in one of the 5 taxable years 
immediately succeeding the contribution year with respect to which a 
joint excess charitable contribution is computed and following such 
first taxable year for which such husband and wife filed a separate 
return, the amounts allocated to each spouse in accordance with this 
subdivision for such first year reduced by the portion of such amounts 
treated as paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in such first 
year and in any taxable year intervening between such first year and the 
succeeding taxable year in which the joint return is filed shall be 
aggregated for purposes of determining the amount of the available 
charitable contributions carryover to such succeeding taxable year. The 
provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following 
example:

    Example. (a) H and W file joint returns for 1970, 1971, and 1972, 
and in 1973 they file separate returns. In each such year H and W 
itemize their deductions in computing taxable income. Assume the 
following factual situation with respect to H and W for 1970:

                                  1970

                                                H         W      return

Excess contributions for taxable year to

 taxable years............................    12,000     8,000    20,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (b) The joint excess charitable contribution of $20,000 is to be 
treated as having been paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization in 
the 5 succeeding taxable years. Assume that in 1971 the portion of such 
excess treated as paid by H and W is $3,000, and that in 1972 the 
portion of such excess treated as paid is $7,000. Thus, the unused 
portion of the excess charitable contribution made in the contribution 
year is $10,000 ($20,000 less $3,000 [amount treated as paid in 1971] 
and $7,000 [amount treated as paid in 1972]). Since H and W file 
separate returns in 1973, $6,000 of such $10,000 is allocable to H, and 
$4,000 is allocable to W. Such allocation is computed as follows:
$12,000 (excess charitable contributions made by H (based on separate 
return computation) in 1970)/$20,000 (total excess charitable 
contributions made by H and W (based on separate return computation) in 
1970) x $10,000=$6,000
$8,000 (excess charitable contributions made by W (based on separate 
return computation) in 1970)/$20,000 (total excess charitable 
contributions made by H and W (based on separate return computation) in 
1970) x $10,000=$4,000
    (c) In 1973 H has a contribution base of $70,000, and he contributes 
$14,000 in cash to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization. In 1973 W has a 
contribution base of $50,000, and she contributes $10,000 in cash to a 
section 170(b)(1)(A) organization. Accordingly, H may claim a charitable 
contributions deduction of $20,000 in 1973, and W may claim a charitable 
contributions deduction of $14,000 in 1973. H's $20,000 deduction 
consists of the $14,000 contribution made to the section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization in 1973 and the $6,000 carried over from 1970 and treated 
as a charitable contribution paid by him to a section 170(b)(1)(A) 
organization in 1973. W's

[[Page 124]]

$14,000 deduction consists of the $10,000 contribution made to a section 
170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1973 and the $4,000 carried over from 1970 
and treated as a charitable contribution paid by her to a section 
170(b)(1)(A) organization in 1973.
    (d) The $6,000 contribution treated as paid in 1973 by H, and the 
$4,000 contribution treated as paid in 1973 by W, are computed as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          H         W

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) It is assumed that H and W made no contributions of 30-percent 
capital gain property during these years. If they had made such 
contributions, there would have been similar adjustments based on 30 
percent of the contribution base.

    (ii) Change from separate returns to joint return. If in the case of 
a husband and wife:
    (a) Either or both of the spouses make a separate return for a 
contribution year and compute an excess charitable contribution for such 
year in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of 
this section and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and
    (b) Such husband and wife make a joint return for one or more of the 
taxable years succeeding such contribution year, the excess charitable 
contribution of the husband and wife for the contribution year which is 
unused at the beginning of the first taxable year for which a joint 
return is filed shall be aggregated for purposes of determining the 
portion of such unused charitable contribution which shall be treated in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section as a 
charitable contribution paid to a section 170(b)(1)(A) organization. The 
provisions of this subdivision also apply in the case of two single 
individuals who are subsequently married and file a joint return. A 
remarried taxpayer who filed a joint return with a former spouse in a 
contribution year with respect to which an excess charitable 
contribution was computed and who in any one of the 5 taxable years 
succeeding such contribution year files a joint return with his or her 
present spouse shall treat the unused portion of such excess charitable 
contribution allocated to him or her in accordance with subdivision (i) 
of this subparagraph in the same manner as the unused portion of an 
excess charitable contribution computed in a contribution year in which 
he filed a separate return, for purposes of determining the amount which 
in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section shall be 
treated as paid to an organization specified in section 170(b)(1)(A) in 
such succeeding year.
    (iii) Unused excess charitable contribution of deceased spouse. In 
case of the death of one spouse, any unused portion of an excess 
charitable contribution which is allocable in accordance with 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to such spouse shall not be treated 
as paid in the taxable year in which such death occurs or in any 
subsequent taxable year except on a separate return made for the 
deceased spouse by a fiduciary for the taxable year which ends with the 
date of death or on a joint return for the taxable year in which such 
death occurs. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. Assume the same facts as in the example in subdivision (i) 
of this subparagraph except that H dies in 1972 and W files a separate 
return for 1973. W made a joint return for herself and H for 1972. In 
the example, the unused excess charitable contribution as of January 1, 
1973, was $10,000, $6,000 of which was allocable to H and $4,000 to W. 
No portion of the $6,000 allocable to H may be treated as paid by W or 
any other person in 1973 or any subsequent year.

    (e) Information required in support of a deduction of an amount 
carried over and treated as paid. If, in a taxable year, a

[[Page 125]]

deduction is claimed in respect of an excess charitable contribution 
which, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) 
of this section, is treated (in whole or in part) as paid in such 
taxable year, the taxpayer shall attach to his return a statement 
showing:
    (1) The contribution year (or years) in which the excess charitable 
contributions were made,
    (2) The excess charitable contributions made in each contribution 
year, and the amount of such excess charitable contributions consisting 
of 30-percent capital gain property,
    (3) The portion of such excess, or of each such excess, treated as 
paid in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) or (c)(2) of this section in 
any taxable year intervening between the contribution year and the 
taxable year for which the return is made, and the portion of such 
excess which consists of 30-percent capital gain property.
    (4) Whether or not an election under section 170(b)(1)(D)(iii) has 
been made which affects any of such excess contributions of 30-percent 
capital gain property, and
    (5) Such other information as the return or the instructions 
relating thereto may require.
    (f) Effective date. This section applies only to contributions paid 
in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969. For purposes of 
applying section 170(d)(1) with respect to contributions paid in a 
taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, subsection (b)(1)(D), 
subsection (e), and paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) of subsection (f) 
of section 170 shall not apply. See section 201(g)(1)(D) of the Tax 
Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 564).

[T.D. 7207, 37 FR 20787, Oct. 4, 1972; 37 FR 22982, Oct. 27, 1972, as 
amended by T.D. 7340, 40 FR 1240, Jan. 7, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 1.170A-11   Limitation on, and carryover of, contributions by corporations.

    (a) In general. The deduction by a corporation in any taxable year 
for charitable contributions, as defined in section 170(c), is limited 
to 5 percent of its taxable income for the year, computed without regard 
to:
    (1) The deduction under section 170 for charitable contributions,
    (2) The special deductions for corporations allowed under Part VIII 
(except section 248), Subchapter B, Chapter 1 of the Code,
    (3) Any net operating loss carryback to the taxable year under 
section 172, and
    (4) Any capital loss carryback to the taxable year under section 
1212(a)(1).

A charitable contribution by a corporation to a trust, chest, fund, or 
foundation described in section 170(c)(2) is deductible under section 
170 only if the contribution is to be used in the United States or its 
possessions exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, 
or educational purposes or for the prevention of cruelty to children or 
animals. For the purposes of section 170, amounts excluded from the 
gross income of a corporation under section 114, relating to sports 
programs conducted for the American National Red Cross, are not to be 
considered contributions or gifts.
    (b) Election by corporations on an accrual method. (1) A corporation 
reporting its taxable income on an accrual method may elect to have a 
charitable contribution treated as paid during the taxable year, if 
payment is actually made on or before the 15th day of the third month 
following the close of such year and if, during such year, its board of 
directors authorizes the charitable contribution. If by reason of such 
an election a charitable contribution (other than a contribution of a 
letter, memorandum, or property similar to a letter or memorandum) paid 
in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, is treated as paid 
during a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, the provisions 
of Sec. 1.170A-4 shall not be applied to reduce the amount of such 
contribution. However, see section 170(e) before its amendment by the 
Tax Reform Act of 1969.
    (2) The election must be made at the time the return for the taxable 
year is filed, by reporting the contribution on the return. There shall 
be attached to the return when filed a written declaration that the 
resolution authorizing the contribution was adopted by the board of 
directors during the taxable year, and the declaration shall be

[[Page 126]]

verified by a statement signed by an officer authorized to sign the 
return that it is made under the penalties of perjury. There shall also 
be attached to the return when filed a copy of the resolution of the 
board of directors authorizing the contribution.
    (c) Charitable contributions carryover of corporations--(1) In 
general. Subject to the reduction provided in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph, any charitable contributions made by a corporation in a 
taxable year (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the 
``contribution year'') in excess of the amount deductible in such 
contribution year under the 5-percent limitation of section 170(b)(2) 
are deductible in each of the five succeeding taxable years in order of 
time, but only to the extent of the lesser of the following amounts:
    (i) The excess of the maximum amount deductible for such succeeding 
taxable year under the 5-percent limitation of section 170(b)(2) over 
the sum of the charitable contributions made in that year plus the 
aggregate of the excess contributions which were made in taxable years 
before the contribution year and which are deductible under this 
paragraph in such succeeding taxable year; or
    (ii) In the case of the first taxable year succeeding the 
contribution year, the amount of the excess charitable contributions, 
and in the case of the second, third, fourth, and fifth taxable years 
succeeding the contribution year, the portion of the excess charitable 
contributions not deductible under this subparagraph for any taxable 
year intervening between the contribution year and such succeeding 
taxable year.

This paragraph applies to excess charitable contributions by a 
corporation, whether or not such contributions are made to, or for the 
use of, the donee organization and whether or not such organization is a 
section 170(b)(1)(A) organization, as defined in Sec. 1.170A-9. For 
purposes of applying this paragraph, a charitable contribution made in a 
taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, which is carried over to 
taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, under section 170(b)(2) 
(before its amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1969) and is deductible 
in such taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, shall be treated 
as deductible under section 170(d)(1) and this paragraph. The 
application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following 
example:

    Example. A corporation which reports its income on the calendar year 
basis makes a charitable contribution of $20,000 in 1970. Its taxable 
income (determined without regard to any deduction for charitable 
contributions) for 1970 is $100,000. Accordingly, the charitable 
contributions deduction for that year is limited to $5,000 (5 percent of 
$100,000). The excess charitable contribution not deductible in 1970 
($15,000) is a carryover to 1971. The corporation has taxable income 
(determined without regard to any deduction for charitable 
contributions) of $150,000 in 1971 and makes a charitable contribution 
of $5,000 in that year. For 1971 the corporation may deduct as a 
charitable contribution the amount of $7,500 (5 percent of $150,000). 
This amount consists of the $5,000 contribution made in 1971 and of the 
$2,500 carried over from 1970. The remaining $12,500 carried over from 
1970 and not allowable as a deduction for 1971 because of the 5-percent 
limitation may be carried over to 1972. The corporation has taxable 
income (determined without regard to any deduction for charitable 
contributions) of $200,000 in 1972 and makes a charitable contribution 
of $5,000 in that year. For 1972 the corporation may deduct the amount 
of $10,000 (5 percent of $200,000). This amount consists of the $5,000 
contributed in 1972, and $5,000 of the $12,500 carried over from 1970 to 
1972. The remaining $7,500 of the carryover from 1970 is available for 
purposes of computing the charitable contributions carryover from 1970 
to 1973, 1974, and 1975.

    (2) Effect of net operating loss carryovers on carryover of excess 
contributions. A corporation having a net operating loss carryover from 
any taxable year must apply the special rule of section 170(d)(2)(B) and 
this subparagraph before computing under subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph the excess charitable contributions carryover from any taxable 
year. In determining the amount of excess charitable contributions that 
may be deducted in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph in 
taxable years succeeding the contribution year, the excess of the 
charitable contributions made by a corporation in the contributions year 
over the amount deductible in such year must be reduced by the amount by 
which such excess reduces taxable income for purposes of determining the

[[Page 127]]

net operating loss carryover under the second sentence of section 
172(b)(2)) and increases a net operating loss carryover to a succeeding 
taxable year. Thus, if the excess of the contributions made in a taxable 
year over the amount deductible in the taxable year is utilized to 
reduce taxable income (under the provisions of section 172(b)(2)) for 
such year, thereby serving to increase the amount of the net operating 
loss carryover to a succeeding taxable year or years, no charitable 
contributions carryover will be allowed. If only a portion of the excess 
charitable contributions is so used, the charitable contributions 
carryover will be reduced only to that extent. The application of this 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. A corporation, which reports its income on the calendar 
year basis, makes a charitable contribution of $10,000 during 1971. Its 
taxable income for 1971 is $80,000 (computed without regard to any net 
operating loss deduction and computed in accordance with section 
170(b)(2) without regard to any deduction for charitable contributions). 
The corporation has a net operating loss carryover from 1970 of $80,000. 
In the absence of the net operating loss deduction the corporation would 
have been allowed a deduction for charitable contributions of $4,000 (5 
percent of $80,000). After the application of the net operating loss 
deduction the corporation is allowed no deduction for charitable 
contributions, and there is a tentative charitable contribution 
carryover from 1971 of $10,000. For purposes of determining the net 
operating loss carryover to 1972 the corporation computes its taxable 
income for 1971 under section 172(b)(2) by deducting the $4,000 
charitable contribution. Thus, after the $80,000 net operating loss 
carryover is applied against the $76,000 of taxable income for 1971 
(computed in accordance with section 172(b)(2)), there remains a $4,000 
net operating loss carryover to 1972. Since the application of the net 
operating loss carryover of $80,000 from 1970 reduces the taxable income 
for 1971 to zero, no part of the $10,000 of charitable contributions in 
that year is deductible under section 170(b)(2). However, in determining 
the amount of the allowable charitable contributions carryover from 1971 
to 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 1976, the $10,000 must be reduced by the 
portion thereof ($4,000) which was used to reduce taxable income for 
1971 (as computed for purposes of the second sentence of section 
172(b)(2)) and which thereby served to increase the net operating loss 
carryover from 1970 to 1972 from zero to $4,000.

    (3) Effect of net operating loss carryback to contribution year. The 
amount of the excess contribution for a contribution year computed as 
provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not be increased 
because a net operating loss carryback is available as a deduction in 
the contribution year. In addition, in determining under the provisions 
of section 172(b)(2) the amount of the net operating loss for any year 
subsequent to the contribution year which is a carryback or carryover to 
taxable years succeeding the contribution year, the amount of any 
charitable contributions shall be limited to the amount of such 
contributions which did not exceed 5 percent of the donor's taxable 
income, computed as provided in paragraph (a) of this section and 
without regard to any of the modifications referred to in section 
172(d), for the contribution year. For illustrations see paragraph 
(d)(2) of Sec. 1.170A-10.
    (4) Effect of net operating loss carryback to taxable year 
succeeding the contribution year. The amount of the charitable 
contribution from a preceding taxable year which is deductible (as 
provided in this paragraph) in a current taxable year (hereinafter 
referred to in this subparagraph as the ``deduction year'') shall not be 
reduced because a net operating loss carryback is available as a 
deduction in the deduction year. In addition, in determining under the 
provisions of section 172(b)(2) the amount of the net operating loss for 
any taxable year subsequent to the deduction year which is a carryback 
or a carryover to taxable years succeeding the deduction year, the 
amount of contributions made in the deduction year shall be limited to 
the amount of such contributions, which were actually made in such year 
and those which were deductible in such year under section 170(d)(2), 
which did not exceed 5 percent of the donor's taxable income, computed 
as provided in paragraph (a) of this section and without regard to any 
of the modifications referred to in section 172(d), for the deduction 
year.
    (5) Year contribution is made. For purposes of this paragraph, 
contributions made by a corporation in a contribution year include 
contributions which, in accordance with the provisions of

[[Page 128]]

section 170(a)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section, are considered as 
paid during such contribution year.
    (d) Effective date. This section applies only to contributions paid 
in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969. For purposes of 
applying section 170(d)(2) with respect to contributions paid, or 
treated under section 170(a)(2) as paid, in a taxable year beginning 
before January 1, 1970, subsection (e), and paragraphs (1), (2), (3), 
and (4) of subsection (f) of section 170 shall not apply. See section 
201(g)(1)(D) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 564).

<R05>
Sec. 1.170A-12   Valuation of a remainder interest in real property for contributions made after July 31, 1969.

    (a) In general. (1) Section 170(f)(4) provides that, in determining 
the value of a remainder interest in real property for purposes of 
section 170, depreciation and depletion of such property shall be taken 
into account. Depreciation shall be computed by the straight line method 
and depletion shall be computed by the cost depletion method. Section 
170(f)(4) and this section apply only in the case of a contribution, not 
made in trust, of a remainder interest in real property made after July 
31, 1969, for which a deduction is otherwise allowable under section 
170.
    (2) In the case of the contribution of a remainder interest in real 
property consisting of a combination of both depreciable and 
nondepreciable property, or of both depletable and nondepletable 
property, and allocation of the fair market value of the property at the 
time of the contribution shall be made between the depreciable and 
nondepreciable property, or the depletable and nondepletable property, 
and depreciation or depletion shall be taken into account only with 
respect to the depreciable or depletable property. The expected value at 
the end of its ``estimated useful life'' (as defined in paragraph (d) of 
this section) of that part of the remainder interest consisting of 
depreciable property shall be considered to be nondepreciable property 
for purposes of the required allocation. In the case of the contribution 
of a remainder interest in stock in a cooperative housing corporation 
(as defined in section 216(b)(1)), an allocation of the fair market 
value of the stock at the time of the contribution shall be made to 
reflect the respective values of the depreciable and nondepreciable 
property underlying such stock, and depreciation on the depreciable part 
shall be taken into account for purposes of valuing the remainder 
interest in such stock.
    (3) If the remainder interest that has been contributed follows only 
one life, the value of the remainder interest shall be computed under 
the rules contained in paragraph (b) of this section. If the remainder 
interest that has been contributed follows a term for years, the value 
of the remainder interest shall be computed under the rules contained in 
paragraph (c) of this section. If the remainder interest that has been 
contributed is dependent upon the continuation or the termination of 
more than one life or upon a term certain concurrent with one or more 
lives, the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section shall apply. In 
every case where it is provided in this section that the rules contained 
in Sec. 25.2512-5 (or, for certain prior periods, Sec. 25.2512-5A) of 
this chapter (Gift Tax Regulations) apply, such rules shall apply 
notwithstanding the general effective date for such rules contained in 
paragraph (a) of such section. Except as provided in Sec. 1.7520-3(b) of 
this chapter, for transfers of remainder interests after April 30, 1989, 
the present value of the remainder interest is determined under 
Sec. 25.2512-5 of this chapter by use of the interest rate component on 
the date the interest is transferred unless an election is made under 
section 7520 and Sec. 1.7520-2 of this chapter to compute the present 
value of the interest transferred by use of the interest rate component 
for either of the 2 months preceding the month in which the interest is 
transferred. In some cases, a reduction in the amount of a charitable 
contribution of a remainder interest, after the computation of its value 
under section 170(f)(4) and this section, may be required. See section 
170(e) and Sec. 1.170A-4.
    (b) Valuation of a remainder interest following only one life--(1) 
General rule. The value of a remainder interest in real property 
following only one life is

[[Page 129]]

determined under the rules provided in Sec. 20.2031-7 (or for certain 
prior periods, Sec. 20.2031-7A) of this chapter (Estate Tax 
Regulations), using the interest rate and life contingencies prescribed 
for the date of the gift. See, however, Sec. 1.7520-3(b) (relating to 
exceptions to the use of prescribed tables under certain circumstances). 
However, if any part of the real property is subject to exhaustion, wear 
and tear, or obsolescence, the special factor determined under paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section shall be used in valuing the remainder interest 
in that part. Further, if any part of the property is subject to 
depletion of its natural resources, such depletion is taken into account 
in determining the value of the remainder interest.
    (2) Computation of depreciation factor. If the valuation of the 
remainder interest in depreciable property is dependent upon the 
continuation of one life, a special factor must be used. The factor 
determined under this paragraph (b)(2) is carried to the fifth decimal 
place. The special factor is to be computed on the basis of the interest 
rate and life contingencies prescribed in Sec. 20.2031-7 (or for certain 
prior periods, Sec. 20.2031-7A) of this chapter (Estate Tax Regulations) 
and on the assumption that the property depreciates on a straight-line 
basis over its estimated useful life. For transfers for which the 
valuation date is after April 30, 1989, special factors for determining 
the present value of a remainder interest following one life and an 
example describing the computation are contained in Internal Revenue 
Service Publication 1459, ``Actuarial Values, Gamma Volume,'' (8-89). 
This publication is no longer available for purchase from the 
Superintendent of Documents. However, it may be obtained by requesting a 
copy from: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (IRS Publication 1459), room 5228, Internal 
Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044. 
See, however, Sec. 1.7520-3(b) (relating to exceptions to the use of 
prescribed tables under certain circumstances). Otherwise, in the case 
of the valuation of a remainder interest following one life, the special 
factor may be obtained through use of the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10JN94.000

Where:

n=the estimated number of years of useful life,
i=the applicable interest rate under section 7520 of the Internal 
Revenue Code,
v=1 divided by the sum of 1 plus the applicable interest rate under 
section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code,
x=the age of the life tenant, and
lx=number of persons living at age x as set forth in Table 80CNSMT of 
Sec. 20.2031-7 (or, for prior periods, in Sec. 20.2031-7A) of this 
chapter.

    (3) The following example illustrates the provisions of this 
paragraph (b):

    Example. In June 1992, A, who is 62, donates to Y University a 
remainder interest in a personal residence, consisting of a house and 
land, subject to a reserved life estate in A. At the time of the gift, 
the land has a value of $30,000 and the house has a value of $100,000 
with an estimated useful life of 45 years, at the end of which the value 
of the house is expected to be $20,000. The portion of the property 
considered to be depreciable is $80,000 (the value of the house 
($100,000) less its expected value at the end of 45 years ($20,000)). 
The portion of the property considered to be nondepreciable is $50,000 
(the value of the land at the time of the gift ($20,000) plus the 
expected value of the house at the end of 45 years ($20,000)). The 
interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for June 1992 is 8.4 
percent. Based on an interest rate of 8.4 percent, the remainder factor 
for $1.00 prescribed in Sec. 20.2031-7 of this chapter for a person age 
62 is 0.29567. The value of the nondepreciable remainder interest is 
$14,783.50 (0.29567 times $50,000). The value of the depreciable 
remainder interest is $17,387.20 (0.21734, computed under the formula 
described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, times $80,000). 
Therefore, the value of the remainder interest is $32,170.70.

[[Page 130]]

    (c) Valuation of a remainder interest following a term for years. 
The value of a remainder interest in real property following a term for 
years shall be determined under the rules provided in Sec. 25.2512-5 
(or, for certain prior periods, Sec. 25.2512-5A) of this chapter (Gift 
Tax Regulations) using Table B provided in paragraph (f) of such 
sections. However, if any part of the real property is subject to 
exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence, in valuing the remainder 
interest in that part the value of such part is adjusted by subtracting 
from the value of such part the amount determined by multiplying such 
value by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years in 
the term or, if less, the estimated useful life of the property, and the 
denominator of which is the estimated useful life of the property. The 
resultant figure is the value of the property to be used in 
Sec. 25.2512-5 (or, for certain prior periods, Sec. 25.2512-5A) of this 
chapter (Gift Tax Regulations). Further, if any part of the property is 
subject to depletion of its natural resources, such depletion shall be 
taken into account in determining the value of the remainder interest. 
The provisions of this paragraph as it relates to depreciation are 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. In 1972, B donates to Z University a remainder interest in 
his personal residence, consisting of a house and land, subject to a 20 
year term interest provided for his sister. At such time the house has a 
value of $60,000, and an expected useful life of 45 years, at the end of 
which time it is expected to have a value of $10,000, and the land has a 
value of $8,000. The value of the portion of the property considered to 
be depreciable is $50,000 (the value of the house ($60,000) less its 
expected value at the end of 45 years ($10,000)), and this is multiplied 
by the fraction 20/45. The product, $22,222.22, is subtracted from 
$68,000, the value of the entire property, and the balance, $45,777.78, 
is multiplied by the factor .311805 (see Sec. 25.2512-5A(c)). The 
result, $14,273.74, is the value of the remainder interest in the 
property.

    (d) Definition of estimated useful life. For the purposes of this 
section, the determination of the estimated useful life of depreciable 
property shall take account of the expected use of such property during 
the period of the life estate or term for years. The term ``estimated 
useful life'' means the estimated period (beginning with the date of the 
contribution) over which such property may reasonably be expected to be 
useful for such expected use. This period shall be determined by 
reference to the experience based on any prior use of the property for 
such purposes if such prior experience is adequate. If such prior 
experience is inadequate or if the property has not been previously used 
for such purposes, the estimated useful life shall be determined by 
reference to the general experience of persons normally holding similar 
property for such expected use, taking into account present conditions 
and probable future developments. The estimated useful life of such 
depreciable property is not limited to the period of the life estate or 
term for years preceding the remainder interest. In determining the 
expected use and the estimated useful life of the property, 
consideration is to be given to the provisions of the governing 
instrument creating the life estate or term for years or applicable 
local law, if any, relating to use, preservation, and maintenance of the 
property during the life estate or term for years. In arriving at the 
estimated useful life of the property, estimates, if available, of 
engineers or other persons skilled in estimating the useful life of 
similar property may be taken into account. At the option of the 
taxpayer, the estimated useful life of property contributed after 
December 31, 1970, for purposes of this section, shall be an asset 
depreciation period selected by the taxpayer that is within the 
permissible asset depreciation range for the relevant asset guideline 
class established pursuant to Sec. 1.167(a)-11(b) (4)(ii). For purposes 
of the preceding sentence, such period, range, and class shall be those 
which are in effect at the time that the contribution of the remainder 
interest was made. At the option of the taxpayer, in the case of 
property contributed before January 1, 1971, the estimated useful life, 
for purposes of this section, shall be the guideline life provided in 
Revenue Procedure 62-21 for the relevant asset guideline class.
    (e) Valuation of a remainder interest following more than one life 
or a term certain concurrent with one or more lives. (1)(i) If the 
valuation of the remainder

[[Page 131]]

interest in the real property is dependent upon the continuation or the 
termination of more than one life or upon a term certain concurrent with 
one or more lives, a special factor must be used.
    (ii) The special factor is to be computed on the basis of--
    (A) Interest at the rate prescribed under Sec. 25.2512-5 (or, for 
certain prior periods, Sec. 25.2512-5A) of this chapter, compounded 
annually;
    (B) Life contingencies determined from the values that are set forth 
in the mortality table in Sec. 20.2031-7 (or, for certain prior periods, 
Sec. 20.2031-7A) of this chapter; and
    (C) If depreciation is involved, the assumption that the property 
depreciates on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
    (iii) If any part of the property is subject to depletion of its 
natural resources, such depletion must be taken into account in 
determining the value of the remainder interest.
    (2) In the case of the valuation of a remainder interest following 
two lives, the special factor may be obtained through use of the 
following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10JN94.001

Where:

n=the estimated number of years of useful life,
i=the applicable interest rate under section 7520 of the Internal 
Revenue Code,
v=1 divided by the sum of 1 plus the applicable interest rate under 
section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code,
x and y=the ages of the life tenants, and
lx and ly=the number of persons living at ages x and y as set forth in 
Table 80CNSMT in Sec. 20.2031-7 (or, for prior periods, in Sec. 20.2031-
7A) of this chapter.

    (3) Notwithstanding that the taxpayer may be able to compute the 
special factor in certain cases under paragraph (2), if a special factor 
is required in the case of an actual contribution, the Commissioner will 
furnish the factor to the donor upon request. The request must be 
accompanied by a statement of the sex and date of birth of each person 
the duration of whose life may affect the value of the remainder 
interest, copies of the relevant instruments, and, if depreciation is 
involved, a statement of the estimated useful life of the depreciable 
property. However, since remainder interests in that part of any 
property which is depletable cannot be valued on a purely actuarial 
basis, special factors will not be furnished with respect to such part. 
Requests should be forwarded to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 
Attention: E:A:G, Washington, DC 20224.

Sec. 1.170A-13  Recordkeeping and return requirements for deductions for charitable contributions.

    (a) Charitable contributions of money made in taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1982--(1) In general. If a taxpayer makes a 
charitable contribution of money in a taxable year beginning after 
December 31, 1982, the taxpayer shall maintain for each contribution one 
of the following:
    (i) A cancelled check.
    (ii) A receipt from the donee charitable organization showing the 
name of the donee, the date of the contribution, and the amount of the 
contribution. A letter or other communication from the donee charitable 
organization acknowledging receipt of a contribution and showing the 
date and amount of the contribution constitutes a receipt for purposes 
of this paragraph (a).

[[Page 132]]

    (iii) In the absence of a canceled check or receipt from the donee 
charitable organization, other reliable written records showing the name 
of the donee, the date of the contribution, and the amount of the 
contribution.
    (2) Special rules--(i) Reliability of records. The reliability of 
the written records described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section 
is to be determined on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances 
of a particular case. In all events, however, the burden shall be on the 
taxpayer to establish reliability. Factors indicating that the written 
records are reliable include, but are not limited to:
    (A) The contemporaneous nature of the writing evidencing the 
contribution.
    (B) The regularity of the taxpayer's recordkeeping procedures. For 
example, a contemporaneous diary entry stating the amount and date of 
the donation and the name of the donee charitable organization made by a 
taxpayer who regularly makes such diary entries would generally be 
considered reliable.
    (C) In the case of a contribution of a small amount, the existence 
of any written or other evidence from the donee charitable organization 
evidencing receipt of a donation that would not otherwise constitute a 
receipt under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (including an emblem, 
button, or other token traditionally associated with a charitable 
organization and regularly given by the organization to persons making 
cash donations).
    (ii) Information stated in income tax return. The information 
required by paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section shall be stated in the 
taxpayer's income tax return if required by the return form or its 
instructions.
    (3) Taxpayer option to apply paragraph (d)(1) to pre-1985 
contribution. See paragraph (d)(1) of this section with regard to 
contributions of money made on or before December 31, 1984.
    (b) Charitable contributions of property other than money made in 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982--(1) In general. Except 
in the case of certain charitable contributions of property made after 
December 31, 1984, to which paragraph (c) of this section applies, any 
taxpayer who makes a charitable contribution of property other than 
money in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1982, shall 
maintain for each contribution a receipt from the donee showing the 
following information:
    (i) The name of the donee.
    (ii) The date and location of the contribution.
    (iii) A description of the property in detail reasonably sufficient 
under the circumstances. Although the fair market value of the property 
is one of the circumstances to be taken into account in determining the 
amount of detail to be included on the receipt, such value need not be 
stated on the receipt.

A letter or other written communication from the donee acknowledging 
receipt of the contribution, showing the date of the contribution, and 
containing the required description of the property contributed 
constitutes a receipt for purposes of this paragraph. A receipt is not 
required if the contribution is made in circumstances where it is 
impractical to obtain a receipt (e.g., by depositing property at a 
charity's unattended drop site). In such cases, however, the taxpayer 
shall maintain reliable written records with respect to each item of 
donated property that include the information required by paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Special rules--(i) Reliability of records. The rules described 
in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section also apply to this paragraph (b) 
for determining the reliability of the written records described in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section
    (ii) Content of records. The written records described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section shall include the following information and such 
information shall be stated in the taxpayers income tax return if 
required by the return form or its instructions:
    (A) The name and address of the donee organization to which the 
contribution was made.
    (B) The date and location of the contribution.
    (C) A description of the property in detail reasonable under the 
circumstances (including the value of the property), and, in the case of 
securities, the name of the issuer, the type of

[[Page 133]]

security, and whether or not such security is regularly traded on a 
stock exchange or in an over-the-counter market.
    (D) The fair market value of the property at the time the 
contribution was made, the method utilized in determining the fair 
market value, and, if the valuation was determined by appraisal, a copy 
of the signed report of the appraiser.
    (E) In the case of property to which section 170(e) applies, the 
cost or other basis, adjusted as provided by section 1016, the reduction 
by reason of section 170(e)(1) in the amount of the charitable 
contribution otherwise taken into account, and the manner in which such 
reduction was determined. A taxpayer who elects under paragraph (d)(2) 
of Sec. 1.170A-8 to apply section 170(e)(1) to contributions and 
carryovers of 30 percent capital gain property shall maintain a written 
record indicating the years for which the election was made and showing 
the contributions in the current year and carryovers from preceding 
years to which it applies. For the definition of the term ``30-percent 
capital gain property,'' see paragraph (d)(3) of Sec. 1.170A-8.
    (F) If less than the entire interest in the property is contributed 
during the taxable year, the total amount claimed as a deduction for the 
taxable year due to the contribution of the property, and the amount 
claimed as a deduction in any prior year or years for contributions of 
other interests in such property, the name and address of each 
organization to which any such contribution was made, the place where 
any such property which is tangible property is located or kept, and the 
name of any person, other than the organization to which the property 
giving rise to the deduction was contributed, having actual possession 
of the property.
    (G) The terms of any agreement or understanding entered into by or 
on behalf of the taxpayer which relates to the use, sale, or other 
disposition of the property contributed, including for example, the 
terms of any agreement or understanding which:
    (1) Restricts temporarily or permanently the donee's right to use or 
dispose of the donated property,
    (2) Reserves to, or confers upon, anyone (other than the donee 
organization or an organization participating with the donee 
organization in cooperative fundraising) any right to the income from 
the donated property or to the possession of the property, including the 
right to vote donated securities, to acquire the property by purchase or 
otherwise, or to designate the person having such income, possession, or 
right to acquire, or
    (3) Earmarks donated property for a particular use.
    (3) Deductions in excess of $500 claimed for a charitable 
contribution of property other than money--(i) In general. In addition 
to the information required under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, 
if a taxpayer makes a charitable contribution of property other than 
money in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1982, and claims a 
deduction in excess of $500 in respect of the contribution of such item, 
the taxpayer shall maintain written records that include the following 
information with respect to such item of donated property, and shall 
state such information in his or her income tax return if required by 
the return form or its instructions:
    (A) The manner of acquisition, as for example by purchase, gift 
bequest, inheritance, or exchange, and the approximate date of 
acquisition of the property by the taxpayer or, if the property was 
created, produced, or manufactured by or for the taxpayer, the 
approximate date the property was substantially completed.
    (B) The cost or other basis, adjusted as provided by section 1016, 
of property, other than publicly traded securities, held by the taxpayer 
for a period of less than 12 months (6 months for property contributed 
in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1982, and on or before 
June 6, 1988, immediately preceding the date on which the contribution 
was made and, when the information is available, of property, other than 
publicly traded securities, held for a period of 12 months or more (6 
months or more for property contributed in taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1982, and on or before June 6, 1988, preceding the date on 
which the contribution was made.

[[Page 134]]

    (ii) Information on acquisition date or cost basis not available. If 
the return form or its instructions require the taxpayer to provide 
information on either the acquisition date of the property or the cost 
basis as described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) (A) and (B), respectively, of 
this section, and the taxpayer has reasonable cause for not being able 
to provide such information, the taxpayer shall attach an explanatory 
statement to the return. If a taxpayer has reasonable cause for not 
being able to provide such information, the taxpayer shall not be 
disallowed a charitable contribution deduction under section 170 for 
failure to comply with paragraph (b)(3)(i) (A) and (B) of the section.
    (4) Taxpayer option to apply paragraph (d) (1) and (2) to pre-1985 
contributions. See paragraph (d) (1) and (2) of this section with regard 
to contributions of property made on or before December 31, 1984.
    (c) Deductions in excess of $5,000 for certain charitable 
contributions of property made after December 31, 1984--(1) General 
Rule--(i) In general. This paragraph applies to any charitable 
contribution made after December 31, 1984, by an individual, closely 
held corporation, personal service corporation, partnership, or S 
corporation of an item of property (other than money and publicly traded 
securities to which Sec. 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(B) does not apply if the 
amount claimed or reported as a deduction under section 170 with respect 
to such item exceeds $5,000. This paragraph also applies to charitable 
contributions by C corporations (as defined in section 1361(a)(2) of the 
Code) to the extent described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. 
No deduction under section 170 shall be allowed with respect to a 
charitable contribution to which this paragraph applies unless the 
substantiation requirements described in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section are met. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the amount claimed 
or reported as a deduction for an item of property is the aggregate 
amount claimed or reported as a deduction for a charitable contribution 
under section 170 for such items of property and all similar items of 
property (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section) by the 
same donor for the same taxable year (whether or not donated to the same 
donee).
    (ii) Special rule for property to which section 170(e) (3) or (4) 
applies. For purposes of this paragraph (c), in computing the amount 
claimed or reported as a deduction for donated property to which section 
170(e) (3) or (4) applies (pertaining to certain contributions of 
inventory and scientific equipment) there shall be taken into account 
only the amount claimed or reported as a deduction in excess of the 
amount which would have been taken into account for tax purposes by the 
donor as costs of goods sold if the donor had sold the contributed 
property to the donee. For example, assume that a donor makes a 
contribution from inventory of clothing for the care of the needy to 
which section 170(e)(3) applies. The cost of the property to the donor 
was $5,000, and, pursuant to section 170(e)(3)(B), the donor claims a 
charitable contribution deduction of $8,000 with respect to the 
property. Therefore, $3,000 ($8,000-$5,000) is the amount taken into 
account for purposes of determining whether the $5,000 threshold of this 
paragraph (c)(1) is met.
    (2) Substantiation requirements--(i) In general. Except as provided 
in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a donor who claims or reports a 
deduction with respect to a charitable contribution to which this 
paragraph (c) applies must comply with the following three requirements:
    (A) Obtain a qualified appraisal (as defined in paragraph (c) (3) of 
this section) for such property contributed. If the contributed property 
is a partial interest, the appraisal shall be of the partial interest.
    (B) Attach a fully completed appraisal summary (as defined in 
paragraph (c) (4) of this section) to the tax return (or, in the case of 
a donor that is a partnership or S corporation, the information return) 
on which the deduction for the contribution is first claimed (or 
reported) by the donor.
    (C) Maintain records containing the information required by 
paragraph (b) (2) (ii) of this section.

[[Page 135]]

    (ii) Special rules for certain nonpublicly traded stock, certain 
publicly traded securities, and contributions by certain C corporations. 
(A) In cases described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, a 
qualified appraisal is not required, and only a partially completed 
appraisal summary form (as described in paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(A) of this 
section) is required to be attached to the tax or information return 
specified in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section. However, in all 
cases donors must maintain records containing the information required 
by paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (B) This paragraph (c)(2)(ii) applies in each of the following 
cases:
    (1) The contribution of nonpublicly traded stock, if the amount 
claimed or reported as a deduction for the charitable contribution of 
such stock is greater than $5,000 but does not exceed $10,000;
    (2) The contribution of a security to which paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(B) 
of this section applies; and
    (3) The contribution of an item of property or of similar items of 
property described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section made after June 
6, 1988, by a C corporation (as defined in section 1361(a)(2) of the 
Code), other than a closely held corporation or a personal service 
corporation.
    (3) Qualified appraisal--(i) In general. For purposes of this 
paragraph (c), the term ``qualified appraisal'' means an appraisal 
document that--
    (A) Relates to an appraisal that is made not earlier than 60 days 
prior to the date of contribution of the appraised property nor later 
than the date specified in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) of this section;
    (B) Is prepared, signed, and dated by a qualified appraiser (within 
the meaning of paragraph (c)(5) of this section);
    (C) Includes the information required by paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of 
this section; and
    (D) Does not involve an appraisal fee prohibited by paragraph (c)(6) 
of this section.
    (ii) Information included in qualified appraisal. A qualified 
appraisal shall include the following information:
    (A) A description of the property in sufficient detail for a person 
who is not generally familiar with the type of property to ascertain 
that the property that was appraised is the property that was (or will 
be) contributed;
    (B) In the case of tangible property, the physical condition of the 
property;
    (C) The date (or expected date) of contribution to the donee;
    (D) The terms of any agreement or understanding entered into (or 
expected to be entered into) by or on behalf of the donor or donee that 
relates to the use, sale, or other disposition of the property 
contributed, including, for example, the terms of any agreement or 
understanding that--
    (1) Restricts temporarily or permanently a donee's right to use or 
dispose of the donated property,
    (2) Reserves to, or confers upon, anyone (other than a donee 
organization or an organization participating with a donee organization 
in cooperative fundraising) any right to the income from the contributed 
property or to the possession of the property, including the right to 
vote donated securities, to acquire the property by purchase or 
otherwise, or to designate the person having such income, possession, or 
right to acquire, or
    (3) Earmarks donated property for a particular use;
    (E) The name, address, and (if a taxpayer identification number is 
otherwise required by section 6109 and the regulations thereunder) the 
identifying number of the qualified appraiser; and, if the qualified 
appraiser is acting in his or her capacity as a partner in a 
partnership, an employee of any person (whether an individual, 
corporation, or partnerships), or an independent contractor engaged by a 
person other than the donor, the name, address, and taxpayer 
identification number (if a number is otherwise required by section 6109 
and the regulations thereunder) of the partnership or the person who 
employs or engages the qualified appraiser;
    (F) The qualifications of the qualified appraiser who signs the 
appraisal, including the appraiser's background, experience, education, 
and membership, if any, in professional appraisal associations;
    (G) A statement that the appraisal was prepared for income tax 
purposes;

[[Page 136]]

    (H) The date (or dates) on which the property was appraised;
    (I) The appraised fair market value (within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.170A-1 (c)(2)) of the property on the date (or expected date) of 
contribution;
    (J) The method of valuation used to determine the fair market value, 
such as the income approach, the market-data approach, and the 
replacement-cost-less-depreciation approach; and
    (K) The specific basis for the valuation, such as specific 
comparable sales transactions or statistical sampling, including a 
justification for using sampling and an explanation of the sampling 
procedure employed.
    (iii) Effect of signature of the qualified appraiser. Any appraiser 
who falsely or fraudulently overstates the value of the contributed 
property referred to in a qualified appraisal or appraisal summary (as 
defined in paragraphs (c) (3) and (4), respectively, of this section) 
that the appraiser has signed may be subject to a civil penalty under 
section 6701 for aiding and abetting an understatement of tax liability 
and, moreover, may have appraisals disregarded pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 
330(c).
    (iv) Special rules--(A) Number of qualified appraisals. For purposes 
of paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section, a separate qualified 
appraisal is required for each item of property that is not included in 
a group of similar items of property. See paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this 
section for the definition of similar items of property. Only one 
qualified appraisal is required for a group of similar items of property 
contributed in the same taxable year of the donor, although a donor may 
obtain separate qualified appraisals for each item of property. A 
qualified appraisal prepared with respect to a group of similar items of 
property shall provide all the information required by paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) of this section for each item of similar property, except 
that the appraiser may select any items whose aggregate value is 
appraised at $100 or less and provide a group description of such items.
    (B) Time of receipt of qualified appraisal. The qualified appraisal 
must be received by the donor before the due date (including extensions) 
of the return on which a deduction is first claimed (or reported in the 
case of a donor that is a partnership or S corporation) under section 
170 with respect to the donated property, or, in the case of a deduction 
first claimed (or reported) on an amended return, the date on which the 
return is filed.
    (C) Retention of qualified appraisal. The donor must retain the 
qualified appraisal in the donor's records for so long as it may be 
relevant in the administration of any internal revenue law.
    (D) Appraisal disregarded pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 330(c). If an 
appraisal is disregarded pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 330(c) it shall have no 
probative effect as to the value of the appraised property. Such 
appraisal will, however, otherwise constitute a ``qualified appraisal'' 
for purposes of this paragraph (c) if the appraisal summary includes the 
declaration described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(L)(2) and the taxpayer had 
no knowledge that such declaration was false as of the time described in 
paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
    (4) Appraisal summary--(i) In general. For purposes of this 
paragraph (c), except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(A) of this 
section, the term appraisal summary means a summary of a qualified 
appraisal that--
    (A) Is made on the form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service;
    (B) Is signed and dated (as described in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of 
this section) by the donee (or presented to the donee for signature in 
cases described in paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(C)(2) of this section);
    (C) Is signed and dated by the qualified appraiser (within the 
meaning of paragraph (c)(5) of this section) who prepared the qualified 
appraisal (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(3) of this section); and
    (D) Includes the information required by paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of 
this section.
    (ii) Information included in an appraisal summary. An appraisal 
summary shall include the following information:
    (A) The name and taxpayer identification number of the donor (social 
security number if the donor is an individual or employer identification 
number if the donor is a partnership or corporation);

[[Page 137]]

    (B) A description of the property in sufficient detail for a person 
who is not generally familiar with the type of property to ascertain 
that the property that was appraised is the property that was 
contributed;
    (C) In the case of tangible property, a brief summary of the overall 
physical condition of the property at the time of the contribution;
    (D) The manner of acquisition (e.g., purchase, exchange, gift, or 
bequest) and the date of acquisition of the property by the donor, or, 
if the property was created, produced, or manufactured by or for the 
donor, a statment to that effect and the approximate date the property 
was substantially completed;
    (E) The cost or other basis of the property adjusted as provided by 
section 1016;
    (F) The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the 
donee;
    (G) The date the donee received the property;
    (H) For charitable contributions made after June 6, 1988, a 
statement explaining whether or not the charitable contribution was made 
by means of a bargain sale and the amount of any consideration received 
from the donee for the contribution;
    (I) The name, address, and (if a taxpayer identification number is 
otherwise required by section 6109 and the regulations thereunder) the 
identifying number of the qualified appraiser who signs the appraisal 
summary and of other persons as required by paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(E) of 
this section;
    (J) The appraised fair market value of the property on the date of 
contribution;
    (K) The declaration by the appraiser described in paragraph 
(c)(5)(i) of this section;
    (L) A declaration by the appraiser stating that--
    (1) The fee charged for the appraisal is not of a type prohibited by 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section; and
    (2) Appraisals prepared by the appraiser are not being disregarded 
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 330(c) on the date the appraisal summary is signed 
by the appraiser; and
    (M) Such other information as may be specified by the form.
    (iii) Signature of the original donee. The person who signs the 
appraisal summary for the donee shall be an official authorized to sign 
the tax or information returns of the donee, or a person specifically 
authorized to sign appraisal summaries by an official authorized to sign 
the tax or information returns of such done. In the case of a donee that 
is a governmental unit, the person who signs the appraisal summary for 
such donee shall be the official authorized by such donee to sign 
appraisal summaries. The signature of the donee on the appraisal summary 
does not represent concurrence in the appraised value of the contributed 
property. Rather, it represents acknowledgment of receipt of the 
property described in the appraisal summary on the date specified in the 
appraisal summary and that the donee understands the information 
reporting requirements imposed by section 6050L and Sec. 1.6050L-1. In 
general, Sec. 1.6050L-1 requires the donee to file an information return 
with the Internal Revenue Service in the event the donee sells, 
exchanges, consumes, or otherwise disposes of the property (or any 
portion thereof) described in the appraisal summary within 2 years after 
the date of the donor's contribution of such property.
    (iv) Special rules--(A) Content of appraisal summary required in 
certain cases. With respect to contributions of nonpublicly traded stock 
described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(1) of this section, contributions 
of securities described in paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(B) of this section, and 
contributions by C corporations described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(3) 
of this section, the term appraisal summary means a document that--
    (1) Complies with the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(i) (A) and 
(B) of this section,
    (2) Includes the information required by paragraph (c)(4)(ii) (A) 
through (H) of this section,
    (3) Includes the amount claimed or reported as a charitable 
contribution deduction, and

[[Page 138]]

    (4) In the case of securities described in paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(B) 
of this section, also includes the pertinent average trading price (as 
described in paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(B)(2)(iii) of this section).
    (B) Number of appraisal summaries. A separate appraisal summary for 
each item of property described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section must 
be attached to the donor's return. If, during the donor's taxable year, 
the donor contributes similar items of property described in paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section to more than one donee, the donor shall attach to 
the donor's return a separate appraisal summary for each donee. See 
paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section for the definition of similar 
items of property. If, however, during the donor's taxable year, a donor 
contributes similar items of property described in paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section to the same donee, the donor may attach to the donor's 
return a single appraisal summary with respect to all similar items of 
property contributed to the same donee. Such an appraisal summary shall 
provide all the information required by paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this 
section for each item of property, except that the appraiser may select 
any items whose aggregate value is appraised at $100 or less and provide 
a group description for such items.
    (C) Manner of acquisition, cost basis and donee's signature. (1) If 
a taxpayer has reasonable cause for being unable to provide the 
information required by paragraph (c)(4)(ii) (D) and (E) of this section 
(relating to the manner of acquisition and basis of the contributed 
property), an appropriate explanation should be attached to the 
appraisal summary. The taxpayer's deduction will not be disallowed 
simply because of the inability (for reasonable cause) to provide these 
items of information.
    (2) In rare and unusual circumstances in which it is impossible for 
the taxpayer to obtain the signature of the donee on the appraisal 
summary as required by paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the 
taxpayer's deduction will not be disallowed for that reason provided 
that the taxpayer attaches a statement to the appraisal summary 
explaining, in detail, why it was not possible to obtain the donee's 
signature. For example, if the donee ceases to exist as an entity 
subsequent to the date of the contribution and prior to the date when 
the appraisal summary must be signed, and the donor acted reasonably in 
not obtaining the donee's signature at the time of the contribution, 
relief under this paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(C)(2) would generally be 
appropriate.
    (D) Information excluded from certain appraisal summaries. The 
information required by paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C), paragraph (c)(4)(ii) 
(D), (E), (H) through (M), and paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(A)(3), and the 
average trading price referred to in paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(A)(4) of this 
section do not have to be included on the appraisal summary at the time 
it is signed by the donee or a copy is provided to the donee pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(E) of this section.
    (E) Statement to be furnished by donors to donees. Every donor who 
presents an appraisal summary to a donee for signature after June 6, 
1988, in order to comply with paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section 
shall furnish a copy of the appraisal summary to such donee.
    (F) Appraisal summary required to be provided to partners and S 
corporation shareholders. If the donor is a partnership or S 
corporation, the donor shall provide a copy of the appraisal summary to 
every partner or shareholder, respectively, who receives an allocation 
of a charitable contribution deduction under section 170 with respect to 
the property described in the appraisal summary.
    (G) Partners and S corporation shareholders. A partner of a 
partnership or shareholder of an S corporation who receives an 
allocation of a deduction under section 170 for a charitable 
contribution of property to which this paragraph (c) applies must attach 
a copy of the partnership's or S corporation's appraisal summary to the 
tax return on which the deduction for the contribution is first claimed. 
If such appraisal summary is not attached, the partner's or 
shareholder's deduction shall not be allowed except as provided for in 
paragraph (c)(4)(iv)(H) of this section.
    (H) Failure to attach appraisal summary. In the event that a donor 
fails to

[[Page 139]]

attach to the donor's return an appraisal summary as required by 
paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the Internal Revenue Service may 
request that the donor submit the appraisal summary within 90 days of 
the request. If such a request is made and the donor complies with the 
request within the 90-day period, the deduction under section 170 shall 
not be disallowed for failure to attach the appraisal summary, provided 
that the donor's failure to attach the appraisal summary was a good 
faith omission and the requirements of paragraph (c) (3) and (4) of this 
section are met (including the completion of the qualified appraisal 
prior to the date specified in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) of this section).
    (5) Qualified appraiser--(i) In general. The term qualified 
appraiser means an individual (other than a person described in 
paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section) who includes on the appraisal 
summary (described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section), a declaration 
that--
    (A) The individual either holds himself or herself out to the public 
as an appraiser or performs appraisals on a regular basis;
    (B) Because of the appraiser's qualifications as described in the 
appraisal (pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(F) of this section), the 
appraiser is qualified to make appraisals of the type of property being 
valued;
    (C) The appraiser is not one of the persons described in paragraph 
(c)(5)(iv) of this section; and
    (D) The appraiser understands that an intentionally false or 
fraudulent overstatement of the value of the property described in the 
qualified appraisal or appraisal summary may subject the appraiser to a 
civil penalty under section 6701 for aiding and abetting an 
understatement of tax liability, and, moreover, the appraiser may have 
appraisals disregarded pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 330(c) (see paragraph 
(c)(3)(iii) of this section).
    (ii) Exception. An individual is not a qualified appraiser with 
respect to a particular donation, even if the declaration specified in 
paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section is provided in the appraisal 
summary, if the donor had knowledge of facts that would cause a 
reasonable person to expect the appraiser falsely to overstate the value 
of the donated property (e.g., the donor and the appraiser make an 
agreement concerning the amount at which the property will be valued and 
the donor knows that such amount exceeds the fair market value of the 
property).
    (iii) Numbers of appraisers. More than one appraiser may appraise 
the donated property. If more than one appraiser appraises the property, 
the donor does not have to use each appraiser's appraisal for purposes 
of substantiating the charitable contribution deduction pursuant to this 
paragraph (c). If the donor uses the appraisal of more than one 
appraiser, or if two or more appraisers contribute to a single 
appraisal, each appraiser shall comply with the requirements of this 
paragraph (c), including signing the qualified appraisal and appraisal 
summary as required by paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(B) and (c)(4)(i)(C) of this 
section, respectively.
    (iv) Qualified appraiser exclusions. The following persons cannot be 
qualified appraisers with respect to particular property:
    (A) The donor or the taxpayer who claims or reports a deductions 
under section 170 for the contribution of the property that is being 
appraised.
    (B) A party to the transaction in which the donor acquired the 
property being appraised (i.e., the person who sold, exchanged, or gave 
the property to the donor, or any person who acted as an agent for the 
transferor or for the donor with respect to such sale, exchange, or 
gift), unless the property is donated within 2 months of the date of 
acquisition and its appraised value does not exceed its acquisition 
price.
    (C) The donee of the property.
    (D) Any person employed by any of the foregoing persons (e.g., if 
the donor acquired a painting from an art dealer, neither the art dealer 
nor persons employed by the dealer can be qualified appraisers with 
respect to that painting).
    (E) Any person related to any of the foregoing persons under section 
267(b), or, with respect to appraisals made after June 6, 1988, married 
to a person who is in a relationship described in section 267(b) with 
any of the foregoing persons.

[[Page 140]]

    (F) An appraiser who is regularly used by any person described in 
paragraph (c)(5)(iv) (A), (B), or (C) of this section and who does not 
perform a majority of his or her appraisals made during his or her 
taxable year for other persons.
    (6) Appraisal fees--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section, no part of the fee arrangement for 
a qualified appraisal can be based, in effect, on a percentage (or set 
of percentages) of the appraised value of the property. If a fee 
arrangement for an appraisal is based in whole or in part on the amount 
of the appraised value of the property, if any, that is allowed as a 
deduction under section 170, after Internal Revenue Service examination 
or otherwise, it shall be treated as a fee based on a percentage of the 
appraised value of the property. For example, an appraiser's fee that is 
subject to reduction by the same percentage as the appraised value may 
be reduced by the Internal Revenue Service would be treated as a fee 
that violates this paragraph (c)(6).
    (ii) Exception. Paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section does not apply 
to a fee paid to a generally recognized association that regulates 
appraisers provided all of the following requirements are met:
    (A) The association is not organized for profit and no part of the 
net earnings of the association inures to the benefit of any private 
shareholder or individual (these terms have the same meaning as in 
section 501(c)),
    (B) The appraiser does not receive any compensation from the 
association or any other persons for making the appraisal, and
    (C) The fee arrangement is not based in whole or in part on the 
amount of the appraised value of the donated property, if any, that is 
allowed as a deduction under section 170 after Internal Revenue Service 
examination or otherwise.
    (7) Meaning of terms. For purposes of this paragraph (c)--
    (i) Closely held corporation. The term closely held corporation 
means any corporation (other than an S corporation) with respect to 
which the stock ownership requirement of paragraph (2) of section 542(a) 
of the Code is met.
    (ii) Personal service corporation. The term personal service 
corporation means any corporation (other than an S corporation) which is 
a service organization (within the meaning of section 414(m)(3) of the 
Code).
    (iii) Similar items of property. The phrase similar items of 
property means property of the same generic category or type, such as 
stamp collections (including philatelic supplies and books on stamp 
collecting), coin collections (including numismatic supplies and books 
on coin collecting), lithographs, paintings, photographs, books, 
nonpublicly traded stock, nonpublicly traded securities other than 
nonpublicly trade stock, land, buildings, clothing, jewelry, funiture, 
electronic equipment, household appliances, toys, everyday kitchenware, 
china, crystal, or silver. For example, if a donor claims on her return 
for the year deductions of $2,000 for books given by her to College A, 
$2,500 for books given by her to College B, and $900 for books given by 
her to College C, the $5,000 threshold of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section is exceeded. Therefore, the donor must obtain a qualified 
appraisal for the books and attach to her return three appraisal 
summaries for the books donated to A, B, and C. For rules regarding the 
number of qualified appraisals and appraisal summaries required when 
similar items of property are contributed, see paragraphs (c)(3)(iv)(A) 
and (c)(4)(iv)(B), respectively, of this section.
    (iv) Donor. The term donor means a person or entity (other than an 
organization described in section 170(c) to which the donated property 
was previously contributed) that makes a charitable contribution of 
property.
    (v) Donee. The term donee means--
    (A) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(7)(v) (B) and (C) of this 
section, an organization described in section 170(c) to which property 
is contributed,
    (B) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(7)(v)(C) of this section, in 
the case of a charitable contribution of property placed in trust for 
the benefit of an organization described in section 170(c), the trust, 
or
    (C) In the case of a charitable contribution of property placed in 
trust

[[Page 141]]

for the benefit of an organization described in section 170(c) made on 
or before June 6, 1988, the beneficiary that is an organization 
described in section 170(c), or if the trust has assumed the duties of a 
donee by signing the appraisal summary pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the trust.

In general, the term, refers only to the original donee. However, with 
respect to paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D), the last sentence of paragraph 
(c)(4)(iii), and paragraph (c)(5)(iv)(C) of this section, the term donee 
means the original donee and all successor donees in cases where the 
original donee transfers the contributed property to a successor donee 
after July 5, 1988.
    (vi) Original donee. The term original donee means the donee to or 
for which property is initially donated by a donor.
    (vii) Successor donee. The term successor donee means any donee of 
property other than its original donee (i.e., a transferee of property 
for less than fair market value from an original donee or another 
successor donee).
    (viii) Fair market value. For the meaning of the term fair market 
value, see section 1.170A-1(c)(2).
    (ix) Nonpublicly traded securities. The term nonpublicly traded 
securities means securities (within the meaning of section 165(g)(2) of 
the Code) which are not publicly traded securities as defined in 
paragraph (c)(7)(xi) of this section.
    (x) Nonpublicly traded stock. The term nonpublicly traded stock 
means any stock of a corporation (evidence by a stock certificate) which 
is not a publicly traded security. The term stock does not include a 
debenture or any other evidence of indebtedness.
    (xi) Publicly traded securities--(A) In general. Except as provided 
in paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(C) of this section, the term publicly traded 
securities means securities (within the meaning of section 165(g)(2) of 
the Code) for which (as of the date of the contribution) market 
quotations are readily available on an established securities market. 
For purposes of this section, market quotations are readily available on 
an established securities market with respect to a security if:
    (1) The security is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the 
American Stock Exchange, or any city or regional exchange in which 
quotations are published on a daily basis, including foreign securities 
listed on a recognized foreign, national, or regional exchange in which 
quotations are published on a daily basis;
    (2) The security is regularly traded in the national or regional 
over-the-counter market, for which published quotations are available; 
or
    (3) The security is a share of an open-end investment company 
(commonly known as a mutual fund) registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940, as amended (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 to 80b-2), for which 
quotations are published on a daily basis in a newspaper of general 
circulation throughout the United States.

(If the market value of an issue of a security is reflected only on an 
interdealer quotation system, the issue shall not be considered to be 
publicly traded unless the special rule described in paragraph 
(c)(7)(xi)(B) of this section is satisfied.)
    (B) Special rule--(1) In General. An issue of a security that does 
not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(A) (1), (2), or (3) 
of this section shall nonetheless be considered to have market 
quotations readily available on an established securities market for 
purposes of paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(A) of this section if all of the 
following five requirements are met:
    (i) The issue is regularly traded during the computational period 
(as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(B)(2)(iv) of this section) in a 
market that is reflected by the existence of an interdealer quotation 
system for the issue,
    (ii) The issuer or an agent of the issuer computes the average 
trading price (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(B)(2)(iii) of this 
section) for the issue for the computational period,
    (iii) The average trading price and total volume of the issue during 
the computational period are published in a newspaper of general 
circulation throughout the United States not later than the last day of 
the month following the end of the calendar quarter in which the 
computational period ends,

[[Page 142]]

    (iv) The issuer or its agent keeps books and records that list for 
each transaction during the computational period involving each issue 
covered by this procedure the date of the settlement of the transaction, 
the name and address of the broker or dealer making the market in which 
the transaction occurred, and the trading price and volume, and
    (v) The issuer or its agent permits the Internal Revenue Service to 
review the books and records described in paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(B)(1)(iv) 
of this section with respect to transactions during the computational 
period upon giving reasonable notice to the issuer or agent.
    (2) Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(B)--
    (i) Issue of a security. The term issue of a security means a class 
of debt securities with the same obligor and identical terms except as 
to their relative denominations (amounts) or a class of stock having 
identical rights.
    (ii) Interdealer quotation system. The term interdealer quotation 
system means any system of general circulation to brokers and dealers 
that regularly disseminates quotations of obligations by two or more 
identified brokers or dealers, who are not related to either the issuer 
of the security or to the issuer's agent, who compute the average 
trading price of the security. A quotation sheet prepared and 
distributed by a broker or dealer in the regular course of its business 
and containing only quotations of such broker or dealer is not an 
interdealer quotation system.
    (iii) Average trading price. The term average trading price means 
the mean price of all transactions (weighted by volume), other than 
original issue or redemption transactions, conducted through a United 
States office of a broker or dealer who maintains a market in the issue 
of the security during the computational period. For this purpose, bid 
and asked quotations are not taken into account.
    (iv) Computational period. For calendar quarters beginning on or 
after June 6, 1988, the term computational period means weekly during 
October through December (beginning with the first Monday in October and 
ending with the first Sunday following the last Monday in December) and 
monthly during January through September (beginning January 1). For 
calendar quarters beginning before June 6, 1988, the term computational 
period means weekly during October through December and monthly during 
January through September.
    (C) Exception. Securities described in paragraph (c)(7)(xi) (A) or 
(B) of this section shall not be considered publicly traded securities 
if--
    (1) The securities are subject to any restrictions that materially 
affect the value of the securities to the donor or prevent the 
securities from being freely traded, or
    (2) If the amount claimed or reported as a deduction with respect to 
the contribution of the securities is different than the amount listed 
in the market quotations that are readily available on an established 
securities market pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(xi) (A) or (B) of this 
section.
    (D) Market quotations and fair market value. The fair market value 
of a publicly traded security, as defined in this paragraph (c)(7)(xi), 
is not necessarily equal to its market quotation, its average trading 
price (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(xi)(B)(2)(iii) of this section), 
or its face value, if any. See section 1.170A-1(c)(2) for the definition 
of fair market value.
    (d) Charitable contributions; information required in support of 
deductions for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983--(1) In 
general. This paragraph (d)(1) shall apply to deductions for charitable 
contributions made in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983. At 
the option of the taxpayer the requirements of this paragraph (d)(1) 
shall also apply to all charitable contributions made on or before 
December 31, 1984 (in lieu of the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section). In connection with claims for deductions for 
charitable contributions, taxpayers shall state in their income tax 
returns the name of each organization to which a contribution was made 
and the amount and date of the actual payment of each contribution. If a 
contribution is made in property other than money, the taxpayer shall 
state the kind of property contributed, for example, used clothing, 
paintings, or

[[Page 143]]

securities, the method utilized in determining the fair market value of 
the property at the time the contribution was made, and whether or not 
the amount of the contribution was reduced under section 170(e). If a 
taxpayer makes more than one cash contribution to an organization during 
the taxable year, then in lieu of listing each cash contribution and the 
date of payment the taxpayer may state the total cash payments made to 
such organization during the taxable year. A taxpayer who elects under 
paragraph (d)(2) of Sec. 1.170A-8 to apply section 170(e)(1) to his 
contributions and carryovers of 30-percent capital gain property must 
file a statement with his return indicating that he has made the 
election and showing the contributions in the current year and 
carryovers from preceding years to which it applies. For the definition 
of the term 30-percent capital gain property, see paragraph (d)(3) of 
Sec. 1.170A-8.
    (2) Contribution by individual of property other than money. This 
paragraph (d)(2) shall apply to deductions for charitable contributions 
made in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1983. At the option of 
the taxpayer, the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2) shall also apply 
to contributions of property made on or before December 31, 1984 (in 
lieu of the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section). If an 
individual taxpayer makes a charitable contribution of an item of 
property other than money and claims a deduction in excess of $200 in 
respect of his contribution of such item, he shall attach to his income 
tax return the following information with respect to such item:
    (i) The name and address of the organization to which the 
contribution was made.
    (ii) The date of the actual contribution.
    (iii) A description of the property in sufficient detail to identify 
the particular property contributed, including in the case of tangible 
property the physical condition of the property at the time of 
contribution, and, in the case of securities, the name of the issuer, 
the type of security, and whether or not such security is regularly 
traded on a stock exchange or in an over-the-counter market.
    (iv) The manner of acquisition, as, for example, by purchase, gift, 
bequest, inheritance, or exchange, and the approximate date of 
acquisition of the property by the taxpayer or, if the property was 
created, produced, or manufactured by or for the taxpayer, the 
approximate date the property was substantially completed.
    (v) The fair market value of the property at the time the 
contribution was made, the method utilized in determining the fair 
market value, and, if the valuation was determined by appraisal, a copy 
of the signed report of the appraiser.
    (vi) The cost or other basis, adjusted as provided by section 1016, 
of property, other than securities, held by the taxpayer for a period of 
less than 5 years immediately preceding the date on which the 
contribution was made and, when the information is available, of 
property, other than securities, held for a period of 5 years or more 
preceding the date on which the contribution was made.
    (vii) In the case of property to which section 170(e) applies, the 
cost or other basis, adjusted as provided by section 1016, the reduction 
by reason of section 170(e)(1) in the amount of the charitable 
contribution otherwise taken into account, and the manner in which such 
reduction was determined.
    (viii) The terms of any agreement or understanding entered into by 
or on behalf of the taxpayer which relates to the use, sale, or 
disposition of the property contributed, as, for example, the terms of 
any agreement or understanding which:
    (A) Restricts temporarily or permanently the donee's right to 
dispose of the donated property,
    (B) Reserves to, or confers upon, anyone other than the donee 
organization or other than an organization participating with such 
organization in cooperative fundraising, any right to the income from 
such property, to the possession of the property, including the right to 
vote securities, to acquire such property by purchase or otherwise, or 
to designate the person to have such income, possession, or right to 
acquire, or

[[Page 144]]

    (C) Earmarks contributed property for a particular charitable use, 
such as the use of donated furniture in the reading room of the donee 
organization's library.
    (ix) The total amount claimed as a deduction for the taxable year 
due to the contribution of the property and, if less than the entire 
interest in the property is contributed during the taxable year, the 
amount claimed as a deduction in any prior year or years for 
contributions of other interests in such property, the name and address 
of each organization to which any such contribution was made, the place 
where any such property which is tangible property is located or kept, 
and the name of any person, other than the organization to which the 
property giving rise to the deduction was contributed, having actual 
possession of the property.
    (3) Statement from donee organization. Any deduction for a 
charitable contribution must be substantiated, when required by the 
district director, by a statement from the organization to which the 
contribution was made indicating whether the organization is a domestic 
organization, the name and address of the contributor, the amount of the 
contribution, the date of actual receipt of the contribution, and such 
other information as the district director may deem necessary. If the 
contribution includes an item of property, other than money or 
securities which are regularly traded on a stock exchange or in an over-
the-counter market, which the donee deems to have a fair market value in 
excess of $500 ($200 in the case of a charitable contribution made in a 
taxable year beginning before January 1, 1983) at the time of receipt, 
such statement shall also indicate for each such item its location if it 
is retained by the organization, the amount received by the organization 
on any sale of the property and the date of sale or, in case of any 
other disposition of the property, the method of disposition. In the 
case of any contribution of tangible personal property, the statement 
shall indicate the use of the property by the organization and whether 
or not it is used for a purpose or function constituting the basis for 
the donee organization's exemption from income tax under section 501 or, 
in the case of a governmental unit, whether or not it is used for 
exclusively public purposes.
    (e) [Reserved]
    (f) Substantiation of charitable contributions of $250 or more--(1) 
In general. No deduction is allowed under section 170(a) for all or part 
of any contribution of $250 or more unless the taxpayer substantiates 
the contribution with a contemporaneous written acknowledgment from the 
donee organization. A taxpayer who makes more than one contribution of 
$250 or more to a donee organization in a taxable year may substantiate 
the contributions with one or more contemporaneous written 
acknowledgments. Section 170(f)(8) does not apply to a payment of $250 
or more if the amount contributed (as determined under Sec. 1.170A-1(h)) 
is less than $250. Separate contributions of less than $250 are not 
subject to the requirements of section 170(f)(8), regardless of whether 
the sum of the contributions made by a taxpayer to a donee organization 
during a taxable year equals $250 or more.
    (2) Written acknowledgment. Except as otherwise provided in 
paragraphs (f)(8) through (f)(11) and (f)(13) of this section, a written 
acknowledgment from a donee organization must provide the following 
information--
    (i) The amount of any cash the taxpayer paid and a description (but 
not necessarily the value) of any property other than cash the taxpayer 
transferred to the donee organization;
    (ii) A statement of whether or not the donee organization provides 
any goods or services in consideration, in whole or in part, for any of 
the cash or other property transferred to the donee organization;
    (iii) If the donee organization provides any goods or services other 
than intangible religious benefits (as described in section 170(f)(8)), 
a description and good faith estimate of the value of those goods or 
services; and
    (iv) If the donee organization provides any intangible religious 
benefits, a statement to that effect.
    (3) Contemporaneous. A written acknowledgment is contemporaneous if 
it is obtained by the taxpayer on or before the earlier of--

[[Page 145]]

    (i) The date the taxpayer files the original return for the taxable 
year in which the contribution was made; or
    (ii) The due date (including extensions) for filing the taxpayer's 
original return for that year.
    (4) Donee organization. For purposes of this paragraph (f), a donee 
organization is an organization described in section 170(c).
    (5) Goods or services. Goods or services means cash, property, 
services, benefits, and privileges.
    (6) In consideration for. A donee organization provides goods or 
services in consideration for a taxpayer's payment if, at the time the 
taxpayer makes the payment to the donee organization, the taxpayer 
receives or expects to receive goods or services in exchange for that 
payment. Goods or services a donee organization provides in 
consideration for a payment by a taxpayer include goods or services 
provided in a year other than the year in which the taxpayer makes the 
payment to the donee organization.
    (7) Good faith estimate. For purposes of this section, good faith 
estimate means a donee organization's estimate of the fair market value 
of any goods or services, without regard to the manner in which the 
organization in fact made that estimate. See Sec. 1.170A-1(h)(4) for 
rules regarding when a taxpayer may treat a donee organization's 
estimate of the value of goods or services as the fair market value.
    (8) Certain goods or services disregarded--(i) In general. For 
purposes of section 170(f)(8), the following goods or services are 
disregarded--
    (A) Goods or services that have insubstantial value under the 
guidelines provided in Revenue Procedures 90-12, 1990-1 C.B. 471, 92-49, 
1992-1 C.B. 987, and any successor documents. (See 
Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of the Statement of Procedural Rules, 26 CFR part 
601.); and
    (B) Annual membership benefits offered to a taxpayer in exchange for 
a payment of $75 or less per year that consist of--
    (1) Any rights or privileges, other than those described in section 
170(l), that the taxpayer can exercise frequently during the membership 
period. Examples of such rights and privileges may include, but are not 
limited to, free or discounted admission to the organization's 
facilities or events, free or discounted parking, preferred access to 
goods or services, and discounts on the purchase of goods or services; 
and
    (2) Admission to events during the membership period that are open 
only to members of a donee organization and for which the donee 
organization reasonably projects that the cost per person (excluding any 
allocable overhead) attending each such event is within the limits 
established for ``low cost articles'' under section 513(h)(2). The 
projected cost to the donee organization is determined at the time the 
organization first offers its membership package for the year (using 
section 3.07 of Revenue Procedure 90-12, or any successor documents, to 
determine the cost of any items or services that are donated).
    (ii) Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this 
paragraph (f)(8).

    Example 1. Membership benefits disregarded. Performing Arts Center E 
is an organization described in section 170(c). In return for a payment 
of $75, E offers a package of basic membership benefits that includes 
the right to purchase tickets to performances one week before they go on 
sale to the general public, free parking in E's garage during evening 
and weekend performances, and a 10% discount on merchandise sold in E's 
gift shop. In return for a payment of $150, E offers a package of 
preferred membership benefits that includes all of the benefits in the 
$75 package as well as a poster that is sold in E's gift shop for $20. 
The basic membership and the preferred membership are each valid for 
twelve months, and there are approximately 50 performances of various 
productions at E during a twelve-month period. E's gift shop is open for 
several hours each week and at performance times. F, a patron of the 
arts, is solicited by E to make a contribution. E offers F the preferred 
membership benefits in return for a payment of $150 or more. F makes a 
payment of $300 to E. F can satisfy the substantiation requirement of 
section 170(f)(8) by obtaining a contemporaneous written acknowledgment 
from E that includes a description of the poster and a good faith 
estimate of its fair market value ($20) and disregards the remaining 
membership benefits.
    Example 2. Contemporaneous written acknowledgment need not mention 
rights or privileges that can be disregarded. The facts are the same as 
in Example 1, except that F made a payment of $300 and received only a 
basic

[[Page 146]]

membership. F can satisfy the section 170(f)(8) substantiation 
requirement with a contemporaneous written acknowledgment stating that 
no goods or services were provided.
    Example 3. Rights or privileges that cannot be exercised frequently. 
Community Theater Group G is an organization described in section 
170(c). Every summer, G performs four different plays. Each play is 
performed two times. In return for a membership fee of $60, G offers its 
members free admission to any of its performances. Non-members may 
purchase tickets on a performance by performance basis for $15 a ticket. 
H, an individual who is a sponsor of the theater, is solicited by G to 
make a contribution. G tells H that the membership benefit will be 
provided in return for any payment of $60 or more. H chooses to make a 
payment of $350 to G and receives in return the membership benefit. G's 
membership benefit of free admission is not described in paragraph 
(f)(8)(i)(B) of this section because it is not a privilege that can be 
exercised frequently (due to the limited number of performances offered 
by G). Therefore, to meet the requirements of section 170(f)(8), a 
contemporaneous written acknowledgment of H's $350 payment must include 
a description of the free admission benefit and a good faith estimate of 
its value.
    Example 4. Multiple memberships. In December of each year, K, an 
individual, gives each of her six grandchildren a junior membership in 
Dinosaur Museum, an organization described in section 170(c). Each 
junior membership costs $50, and K makes a single payment of $300 for 
all six memberships. A junior member is entitled to free admission to 
the museum and to weekly films, slide shows, and lectures about 
dinosaurs. In addition, each junior member receives a bi-monthly, non-
commercial quality newsletter with information about dinosaurs and 
upcoming events. K's contemporaneous written acknowledgment from 
Dinosaur Museum may state that no goods or services were provided in 
exchange for K's payment.

    (9) Goods or services provided to employees or partners of donors--
(i) Certain goods or services disregarded. For purposes of section 
170(f)(8), goods or services provided by a donee organization to 
employees of a donor, or to partners of a partnership that is a donor, 
in return for a payment to the organization may be disregarded to the 
extent that the goods or services provided to each employee or partner 
are the same as those described in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section.
    (ii) No good faith estimate required for other goods or services. If 
a taxpayer makes a contribution of $250 or more to a donee organization 
and, in return, the donee organization offers the taxpayer's employees 
or partners goods or services other than those described in paragraph 
(f)(9)(i) of this section, the contemporaneous written acknowledgment of 
the taxpayer's contribution is not required to include a good faith 
estimate of the value of such goods or services but must include a 
description of those goods or services.
    (iii) Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this 
paragraph (f)(9).

    Example. Museum J is an organization described in section 170(c). 
For a payment of $40, J offers a package of basic membership benefits 
that includes free admission and a 10% discount on merchandise sold in 
J's gift shop. J's other membership categories are for supporters who 
contribute $100 or more. Corporation K makes a payment of $50,000 to J 
and, in return, J offers K's employees free admission for one year, a 
tee-shirt with J's logo that costs J $4.50, and a gift shop discount of 
25% for one year. The free admission for K's employees is the same as 
the benefit made available to holders of the $40 membership and is 
otherwise described in paragraph (f)(8)(i)(B) of this section. The tee-
shirt given to each of K's employees is described in paragraph 
(f)(8)(i)(A) of this section. Therefore, the contemporaneous written 
acknowledgment of K's payment is not required to include a description 
or good faith estimate of the value of the free admission or the tee-
shirts. However, because the gift shop discount offered to K's employees 
is different than that offered to those who purchase the $40 membership, 
the discount is not described in paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section. 
Therefore, the contemporaneous written acknowledgment of K's payment is 
required to include a description of the 25% discount offered to K's 
employees.

    (10) Substantiation of out-of-pocket expenses. A taxpayer who incurs 
unreimbursed expenditures incident to the rendition of services, within 
the meaning of Sec. 1.170A-1(g), is treated as having obtained a 
contemporaneous written acknowledgment of those expenditures if the 
taxpayer--
    (i) Has adequate records under paragraph (a) of this section to 
substantiate the amount of the expenditures; and
    (ii) Obtains by the date prescribed in paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section a statement prepared by the donee organization containing--

[[Page 147]]

    (A) A description of the services provided by the taxpayer;
    (B) A statement of whether or not the donee organization provides 
any goods or services in consideration, in whole or in part, for the 
unreimbursed expenditures; and
    (C) The information required by paragraphs (f)(2) (iii) and (iv) of 
this section.
    (11) Contributions made by payroll deduction--(i) Form of 
substantiation. A contribution made by means of withholding from a 
taxpayer's wages and payment by the taxpayer's employer to a donee 
organization may be substantiated, for purposes of section 170(f)(8), by 
both--
    (A) A pay stub, Form W-2, or other document furnished by the 
employer that sets forth the amount withheld by the employer for the 
purpose of payment to a donee organization; and
    (B) A pledge card or other document prepared by or at the direction 
of the donee organization that includes a statement to the effect that 
the organization does not provide goods or services in whole or partial 
consideration for any contributions made to the organization by payroll 
deduction.
    (ii) Application of $250 threshold. For the purpose of applying the 
$250 threshold provided in section 170(f)(8)(A) to contributions made by 
the means described in paragraph (f)(11)(i) of this section, the amount 
withheld from each payment of wages to a taxpayer is treated as a 
separate contribution.
    (12) Distributing organizations as donees. An organization described 
in section 170(c), or an organization described in 5 CFR 950.105 (a 
Principal Combined Fund Organization for purposes of the Combined 
Federal Campaign) and acting in that capacity, that receives a payment 
made as a contribution is treated as a donee organization solely for 
purposes of section 170(f)(8), even if the organization (pursuant to the 
donor's instructions or otherwise) distributes the amount received to 
one or more organizations described in section 170(c). This paragraph 
(f)(12) does not apply, however, to a case in which the distributee 
organization provides goods or services as part of a transaction 
structured with a view to avoid taking the goods or services into 
account in determining the amount of the deduction to which the donor is 
entitled under section 170.
    (13) Transfers to certain trusts. Section 170(f)(8) does not apply 
to a transfer of property to a trust described in section 170(f)(2)(B), 
a charitable remainder annuity trust (as defined in section 664(d)(1)), 
or a charitable remainder unitrust (as defined in section 664(d)(2) or 
(d)(3) or Sec. 1.664(3)(a)(1)(i)(b)). Section 170(f)(8) does apply, 
however, to a transfer to a pooled income fund (as defined in section 
642(c)(5)); for such a transfer, the contemporaneous written 
acknowledgment must state that the contribution was transferred to the 
donee organization's pooled income fund and indicate whether any goods 
or services (in addition to an income interest in the fund) were 
provided in exchange for the transfer. The contemporaneous written 
acknowledgment is not required to include a good faith estimate of the 
income interest.
    (14) Substantiation of payments to a college or university for the 
right to purchase tickets to athletic events. For purposes of paragraph 
(f)(2)(iii) of this section, the right to purchase tickets for seating 
at an athletic event in exchange for a payment described in section 
170(l) is treated as having a value equal to twenty percent of such 
payment. For example, when a taxpayer makes a payment of $312.50 for the 
right to purchase tickets for seating at an athletic event, the right to 
purchase tickets is treated as having a value of $62.50. The remaining 
$250 is treated as a charitable contribution, which the taxpayer must 
substantiate in accordance with the requirements of this section.
    (15) Substantiation of charitable contributions made by a 
partnership or an S corporation. If a partnership or an S corporation 
makes a charitable contribution of $250 or more, the partnership or S 
corporation will be treated as the taxpayer for purposes of section 
170(f)(8). Therefore, the partnership or S corporation must substantiate 
the contribution with a contemporaneous written acknowledgment from the 
donee organization before reporting the contribution on its income tax 
return for the year in which the contribution

[[Page 148]]

was made and must maintain the contemporaneous written acknowledgment in 
its records. A partner of a partnership or a shareholder of an S 
corporation is not required to obtain any additional substantiation for 
his or her share of the partnership's or S corporation's charitable 
contribution.
    (16) Purchase of an annuity. If a taxpayer purchases an annuity from 
a charitable organization and claims a charitable contribution deduction 
of $250 or more for the excess of the amount paid over the value of the 
annuity, the contemporaneous written acknowledgment must state whether 
any goods or services in addition to the annuity were provided to the 
taxpayer. The contemporaneous written acknowledgment is not required to 
include a good faith estimate of the value of the annuity. See 
Sec. 1.170A-1(d)(2) for guidance in determining the value of the 
annuity.
    (17) Substantiation of matched payments--(i) In general. For 
purposes of section 170, if a taxpayer's payment to a donee organization 
is matched, in whole or in part, by another payor, and the taxpayer 
receives goods or services in consideration for its payment and some or 
all of the matching payment, those goods or services will be treated as 
provided in consideration for the taxpayer's payment and not in 
consideration for the matching payment.
    (ii) Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this 
paragraph (f)(17).

    Example. Taxpayer makes a $400 payment to Charity L, a donee 
organization. Pursuant to a matching payment plan, Taxpayer's employer 
matches Taxpayer's $400 payment with an additional payment of $400. In 
consideration for the combined payments of $800, L gives Taxpayer an 
item that it estimates has a fair market value of $100. L does not give 
the employer any goods or services in consideration for its 
contribution. The contemporaneous written acknowledgment provided to the 
employer must include a statement that no goods or services were 
provided in consideration for the employer's $400 payment. The 
contemporaneous written acknowledgment provided to Taxpayer must include 
a statement of the amount of Taxpayer's payment, a description of the 
item received by Taxpayer, and a statement that L's good faith estimate 
of the value of the item received by Taxpayer is $100.

    (18) Effective date. This paragraph (f) applies to contributions 
made on or after December 16, 1996. However, taxpayers may rely on the 
rules of this paragraph (f) for contributions made on or after January 
1, 1994.

<R05>
Sec. 1.170A-14  Qualified conservation contributions.

    (a) Qualified conservation contributions. A deduction under section 
170 is generally not allowed for a charitable contribution of any 
interest in property that consists of less than the donor's entire 
interest in the property other than certain transfers in trust (see 
Sec. 1.170A-6 relating to charitable contributions in trust and 
Sec. 1.170A-7 relating to contributions not in trust of partial 
interests in property). However, a deduction may be allowed under 
section 170(f)(3)(B)(iii) for the value of a qualified conservation 
contribution if the requirements of this section are met. A qualified 
conservation contribution is the contribution of a qualified real 
property interest to a qualified organization exclusively for 
conservation purposes. To be eligible for a deduction under this 
section, the conservation purpose must be protected in perpetuity.
    (b) Qualified real property interest--(1) Entire interest of donor 
other than qualified mineral interest. (i) The entire interest of the 
donor other than a qualified mineral interest is a qualified real 
property interest. A qualified mineral interest is the donor's interest 
in subsurface oil, gas, or other minerals and the right of access to 
such minerals.
    (ii) A real property interest shall not be treated as an entire 
interest other than a qualified mineral interest by reason of section 
170(h)(2)(A) and this paragraph (b)(1) if the property in which the 
donor's interest exists was divided prior to the contribution in order 
to enable the donor to retain control of more than a qualified mineral 
interest or to reduce the real property interest donated. See Treasury 
regulations Sec. 1.170A-7(a)(2)(i). An entire interest in real property 
may consist of an

[[Page 149]]

undivided interest in the property. But see section 170(h)(5)(A) and the 
regulations thereunder (relating to the requirement that the 
conservation purpose which is the subject of the donation must be 
protected in perpetuity). Minor interests, such as rights-of-way, that 
will not interfere with the conservation purposes of the donation, may 
be transferred prior to the conservation contribution without affecting 
the treatment of a property interest as a qualified real property 
interest under this paragraph (b)(1).
    (2) Perpetual conservation restriction. A ``perpetual conservation 
restriction'' is a qualified real property interest. A ``perpetual 
conservation restriction'' is a restriction granted in perpetuity on the 
use which may be made of real property--including, an easement or other 
interest in real property that under state law has attributes similar to 
an easement (e.g., a restrictive covenant or equitable servitude). For 
purposes of this section, the terms easement, conservation restriction, 
and perpetual conservation restriction have the same meaning. The 
definition of perpetual conservation restriction under this paragraph 
(b)(2) is not intended to preclude the deductibility of a donation of 
affirmative rights to use a land or water area under Sec. 1.170A-
13(d)(2). Any rights reserved by the donor in the donation of a 
perpetual conservation restriction must conform to the requirements of 
this section. See e.g., paragraph (d)(4)(ii), (d)(5)(i), (e)(3), and 
(g)(4) of this section.
    (c) Qualified organization--(1) Eligible donee. To be considered an 
eligible donee under this section, an organization must be a qualified 
organization, have a commitment to protect the conservation purposes of 
the donation, and have the resources to enforce the restrictions. A 
conservation group organized or operated primarily or substantially for 
one of the conservation purposes specified in section 170(h)(4)(A) will 
be considered to have the commitment required by the preceding sentence. 
A qualified organization need not set aside funds to enforce the 
restrictions that are the subject of the contribution. For purposes of 
this section, the term qualified organization means:
    (i) A governmental unit described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(v);
    (ii) An organization described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(vi);
    (iii) A charitable organization described in section 501(c)(3) that 
meets the public support test of section 509(a)(2);
    (iv) A charitable organization described in section 501(c)(3) that 
meets the requirements of section 509(a)(3) and is controlled by an 
organization described in paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this 
section.
    (2) Transfers by donee. A deduction shall be allowed for a 
contribution under this section only if in the instrument of conveyance 
the donor prohibits the donee from subsequently transferring the 
easement (or, in the case of a remainder interest or the reservation of 
a qualified mineral interest, the property), whether or not for 
consideration, unless the donee organization, as a condition of the 
subsequent transfer, requires that the conservation purposes which the 
contribution was originally intended to advance continue to be carried 
out. Moreover, subsequent transfers must be restricted to organizations 
qualifying, at the time of the subsequent transfer, as an eligible donee 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. When a later unexpected change 
in the conditions surrounding the property that is the subject of a 
donation under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section makes 
impossible or impractical the continued use of the property for 
conservation purposes, the requirement of this paragraph will be met if 
the property is sold or exchanged and any proceeds are used by the donee 
organization in a manner consistent with the conservation purposes of 
the original contribution. In the case of a donation under paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section to which the preceding sentence applies, see also 
paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section.
    (d) Conservation purposes--(1) In general. For purposes of section 
170(h) and this section, the term conservation purposes means--
    (i) The preservation of land areas for outdoor recreation by, or the 
education of, the general public, within the meaning of paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section,

[[Page 150]]

    (ii) The protection of a relatively natural habitat of fish, 
wildlife, or plants, or similar ecosystem, within the meaning of 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section,
    (iii) The preservation of certain open space (including farmland and 
forest land) within the meaning of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, or
    (iv) The preservation of a historically important land area or a 
certified historic structure, within the meaning of paragraph (d)(5) of 
this section.
    (2) Recreation or education--(i) In general. The donation of a 
qualified real property interest to preserve land areas for the outdoor 
recreation of the general public or for the education of the general 
public will meet the conservation purposes test of this section. Thus, 
conservation purposes would include, for example, the preservation of a 
water area for the use of the public for boating or fishing, or a nature 
or hiking trail for the use of the public.
    (ii) Access. The preservation of land areas for recreation or 
education will not meet the test of this section unless the recreation 
or education is for the substantial and regular use of the general 
public.
    (3) Protection of environmental system--(i) In general. The donation 
of a qualified real property interest to protect a significant 
relatively natural habitat in which a fish, wildlife, or plant 
community, or similar ecosystem normally lives will meet the 
conservation purposes test of this section. The fact that the habitat or 
environment has been altered to some extent by human activity will not 
result in a deduction being denied under this section if the fish, 
wildlife, or plants continue to exist there in a relatively natural 
state. For example, the preservation of a lake formed by a man-made dam 
or a salt pond formed by a man-made dike would meet the conservation 
purposes test if the lake or pond were a nature feeding area for a 
wildlife community that included rare, endangered, or threatened native 
species.
    (ii) Significant habitat or ecosystem. Significant habitats and 
ecosystems include, but are not limited to, habitats for rare, 
endangered, or threatened species of animal, fish, or plants; natural 
areas that represent high quality examples of a terrestrial community or 
aquatic community, such as islands that are undeveloped or not intensely 
developed where the coastal ecosystem is relatively intact; and natural 
areas which are included in, or which contribute to, the ecological 
viability of a local, state, or national park, nature preserve, wildlife 
refuge, wilderness area, or other similar conservation area.
    (iii) Access. Limitations on public access to property that is the 
subject of a donation under this paragraph (d)(3) shall not render the 
donation nondeductible. For example, a restriction on all public access 
to the habitat of a threatened native animal species protected by a 
donation under this paragraph (d)(3) would not cause the donation to be 
nondeductible.
    (4) Preservation of open space--(i) In general. The donation of a 
qualified real property interest to preserve open space (including 
farmland and forest land) will meet the conservation purposes test of 
this section if such preservation is--
    (A) Pursuant to a clearly delineated Federal, state, or local 
governmental conservation policy and will yield a significant public 
benefit, or
    (B) For the scenic enjoyment of the general public and will yield a 
significant public benefit.

An open space easement donated on or after December 18, 1980, must meet 
the requirements of section 170(h) in order to be deductible.
    (ii) Scenic enjoyment--(A) Factors. A contribution made for the 
preservation of open space may be for the scenic enjoyment of the 
general public. Preservation of land may be for the scenic enjoyment of 
the general public if development of the property would impair the 
scenic character of the local rural or urban landscape or would 
interfere with a scenic panorama that can be enjoyed from a park, nature 
preserve, road, waterbody, trail, or historic structure or land area, 
and such area or transportation way is open to, or utilized by, the 
public. ``Scenic enjoyment'' will be evaluated by considering all 
pertinent facts and circumstances germane to the contribution. Regional

[[Page 151]]

variations in topography, geology, biology, and cultural and economic 
conditions require flexibility in the application of this test, but do 
not lessen the burden on the taxpayer to demonstrate the scenic 
characteristics of a donation under this paragraph. The application of a 
particular objective factor to help define a view as scenic in one 
setting may in fact be entirely inappropriate in another setting. Among 
the factors to be considered are:
    (1) The compatibility of the land use with other land in the 
vicinity;
    (2) The degree of contrast and variety provided by the visual scene;
    (3) The openness of the land (which would be a more significant 
factor in an urban or densely populated setting or in a heavily wooded 
area);
    (4) Relief from urban closeness;
    (5) The harmonious variety of shapes and textures;
    (6) The degree to which the land use maintains the scale and 
character of the urban landscape to preserve open space, visual 
enjoyment, and sunlight for the surrounding area;
    (7) The consistency of the proposed scenic view with a methodical 
state scenic identification program, such as a state landscape 
inventory; and
    (8) The consistency of the proposed scenic view with a regional or 
local landscape inventory made pursuant to a sufficiently rigorous 
review process, especially if the donation is endorsed by an appropriate 
state or local governmental agency.
    (B) Access. To satisfy the requirement of scenic enjoyment by the 
general public, visual (rather than physical) access to or across the 
property by the general public is sufficient. Under the terms of an open 
space easement on scenic property, the entire property need not be 
visible to the public for a donation to qualify under this section, 
although the public benefit from the donation may be insufficient to 
qualify for a deduction if only a small portion of the property is 
visible to the public.
    (iii) Governmental conservation policy--(A) In general. The 
requirement that the preservation of open space be pursuant to a clearly 
delineated Federal, state, or local governmental policy is intended to 
protect the types of property identified by representatives of the 
general public as worthy of preservation or conservation. A general 
declaration of conservation goals by a single official or legislative 
body is not sufficient. However, a governmental conservation policy need 
not be a certification program that identifies particular lots or small 
parcels of individually owned property. This requirement will be met by 
donations that further a specific, identified conservation project, such 
as the preservation of land within a state or local landmark district 
that is locally recognized as being significant to that district; the 
preservation of a wild or scenic river, the preservation of farmland 
pursuant to a state program for flood prevention and control; or the 
protection of the scenic, ecological, or historic character of land that 
is contiguous to, or an integral part of, the surroundings of existing 
recreation or conservation sites. For example, the donation of a 
perpetual conservation restriction to a qualified organization pursuant 
to a formal resolution or certification by a local governmental agency 
established under state law specifically identifying the subject 
property as worthy of protection for conservation purposes will meet the 
requirement of this paragraph. A program need not be funded to satisfy 
this requirement, but the program must involve a significant commitment 
by the government with respect to the conservation project. For example, 
a governmental program according preferential tax assessment or 
preferential zoning for certain property deemed worthy of protection for 
conservation purposes would constitute a significant commitment by the 
government.
    (B) Effect of acceptance by governmental agency. Acceptance of an 
easement by an agency of the Federal Government or by an agency of a 
state or local government (or by a commission, authority, or similar 
body duly constituted by the state or local government and acting on 
behalf of the state or local government) tends to establish the 
requisite clearly delineated governmental policy, although such 
acceptance, without more, is not sufficient. The more rigorous the 
review process by the governmental agency, the more the acceptance of 
the easement tends

[[Page 152]]

to establish the requisite clearly delineated governmental policy. For 
example, in a state where the legislature has established an 
Environmental Trust to accept gifts to the state which meet certain 
conservation purposes and to submit the gifts to a review that requires 
the approval of the state's highest officials, acceptance of a gift by 
the Trust tends to establish the requisite clearly delineated 
governmental policy. However, if the Trust merely accepts such gifts 
without a review process, the requisite clearly delineated governmental 
policy is not established.
    (C) Access. A limitation on public access to property subject to a 
donation under this paragraph (d)(4)(iii) shall not render the deduction 
nondeductible unless the conservation purpose of the donation would be 
undermined or frustrated without public access. For example, a donation 
pursuant to a governmental policy to protect the scenic character of 
land near a river requires visual access to the same extent as would a 
donation under paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) Significant public benefit--(A) Factors. All contributions made 
for the preservation of open space must yield a significant public 
benefit. Public benefit will be evaluated by considering all pertinent 
facts and circumstances germane to the contribution. Factors germane to 
the evaluation of public benefit from one contribution may be irrelevant 
in determining public benefit from another contribution. No single 
factor will necessarily be determinative. Among the factors to be 
considered are:
    (1) The uniqueness of the property to the area;
    (2) The intensity of land development in the vicinity of the 
property (both existing development and foreseeable trends of 
development);
    (3) The consistency of the proposed open space use with public 
programs (whether Federal, state or local) for conservation in the 
region, including programs for outdoor recreation, irrigation or water 
supply protection, water quality maintenance or enhancement, flood 
prevention and control, erosion control, shoreline protection, and 
protection of land areas included in, or related to, a government 
approved master plan or land management area;
    (4) The consistency of the proposed open space use with existing 
private conservation programs in the area, as evidenced by other land, 
protected by easement or fee ownership by organizations referred to in 
Sec. 1.170A-14(c)(1), in close proximity to the property;
    (5) The likelihood that development of the property would lead to or 
contribute to degradation of the scenic, natural, or historic character 
of the area;
    (6) The opportunity for the general public to use the property or to 
appreciate its scenic values;
    (7) The importance of the property in preserving a local or regional 
landscape or resource that attracts tourism or commerce to the area;
    (8) The likelihood that the donee will acquire equally desirable and 
valuable substitute property or property rights;
    (9) The cost to the donee of enforcing the terms of the conservation 
restriction;
    (10) The population density in the area of the property; and
    (11) The consistency of the proposed open space use with a 
legislatively mandated program identifying particular parcels of land 
for future protection.
    (B) Illustrations. The preservation of an ordinary tract of land 
would not in and of itself yield a significant public benefit, but the 
preservation of ordinary land areas in conjunction with other factors 
that demonstrate significant public benefit or the preservation of a 
unique land area for public employment would yield a significant public 
benefit. For example, the preservation of a vacant downtown lot would 
not by itself yield a significant public benefit, but the preservation 
of the downtown lot as a public garden would, absent countervailing 
factors, yield a significant public benefit. The following are other 
examples of contributions which would, absent countervailing factors, 
yield a significant public benefit: The preservation of farmland 
pursuant to a state program for flood prevention and control; the 
preservation of a unique natural land formation for the enjoyment of the 
general public; the preservation of woodland along a

[[Page 153]]

public highway pursuant to a government program to preserve the 
appearance of the area so as to maintain the scenic view from the 
highway; and the preservation of a stretch of undeveloped property 
located between a public highway and the ocean in order to maintain the 
scenic ocean view from the highway.
    (v) Limitation. A deduction will not be allowed for the preservation 
of open space under section 170(h)(4)(A)(iii), if the terms of the 
easement permit a degree of intrusion or future development that would 
interfere with the essential scenic quality of the land or with the 
governmental conservation policy that is being furthered by the 
donation. See Sec. 1.170A-14(e)(2) for rules relating to inconsistent 
use.
    (vi) Relationship of requirements--(A) Clearly delineated 
governmental policy and significant public benefit. Although the 
requirements of ``clearly delineated governmental policy'' and 
``significant public benefit'' must be met independently, for purposes 
of this section the two requirements may also be related. The more 
specific the governmental policy with respect to the particular site to 
be protected, the more likely the governmental decision, by itself, will 
tend to establish the significant public benefit associated with the 
donation. For example, while a statute in State X permitting 
preferential assessment for farmland is, by definition, governmental 
policy, it is distinguishable from a state statute, accompanied by 
appropriations, naming the X River as a valuable resource and 
articulating the legislative policy that the X River and the relatively 
natural quality of its surrounding be protected. On these facts, an open 
space easement on farmland in State X would have to demonstrate 
additional factors to establish ``significant public benefit.'' The 
specificity of the legislative mandate to protect the X River, however, 
would by itself tend to establish the significant public benefit 
associated with an open space easement on land fronting the X River.
    (B) Scenic enjoyment and significant public benefit. With respect to 
the relationship between the requirements of ``scenic enjoyment'' and 
``significant public benefit,'' since the degrees of scenic enjoyment 
offered by a variety of open space easements are subjective and not as 
easily delineated as are increasingly specific levels of governmental 
policy, the significant public benefit of preserving a scenic view must 
be independently established in all cases.
    (C) Donations may satisfy more than one test. In some cases, open 
space easements may be both for scenic enjoyment and pursuant to a 
clearly delineated governmental policy. For example, the preservation of 
a particular scenic view identified as part of a scenic landscape 
inventory by a rigorous governmental review process will meet the tests 
of both paragraphs (d)(4)(i)(A) and (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section.
    (5) Historic preservation--(i) In general. The donation of a 
qualified real property interest to preserve an historically important 
land area or a certified historic structure will meet the conservation 
purposes test of this section. When restrictions to preserve a building 
or land area within a registered historic district permit future 
development on the site, a deduction will be allowed under this section 
only if the terms of the restrictions require that such development 
conform with appropriate local, state, or Federal standards for 
construction or rehabilitation within the district. See also, 
Sec. 1.170A-14(h)(3)(ii).
    (ii) Historically important land area. The term historically 
important land area includes:
    (A) An independently significant land area including any related 
historic resources (for example, an archaeological site or a Civil War 
battlefield with related monuments, bridges, cannons, or houses) that 
meets the National Register Criteria for Evaluation in 36 CFR 60.4 (Pub. 
L. 89-665, 80 Stat. 915);
    (B) Any land area within a registered historic district including 
any buildings on the land area that can reasonably be considered as 
contributing to the significance of the district; and
    (C) Any land area (including related historic resources) adjacent to 
a property listed individually in the National Register of Historic 
Places (but not within a registered historic district) in

[[Page 154]]

a case where the physical or environmental features of the land area 
contribute to the historic or cultural integrity of the property.
    (iii) Certified historic structure. The term certified historic 
structure, for purposes of this section, means any building, structure 
or land area which is--
    (A) Listed in the National Register, or
    (B) Located in a registered historic district (as defined in section 
48(g)(3)(B)) and is certified by the Secretary of the Interior (pursuant 
to 36 CFR 67.4) to the Secretary of the Treasury as being of historic 
significance to the district.

A structure for purposes of this section means any structure, whether or 
not it is depreciable. Accordingly easements on private residences may 
qualify under this section. In addition, a structure would be considered 
to be a certified historic structure if it were certified either at the 
time the transfer was made or at the due date (including extensions) for 
filing the donor's return for the taxable year in which the contribution 
was made.
    (iv) Access. (A) In order for a conservation contribution described 
in section 170(h)(4)(A)(iv) and this paragraph (d)(5) to be deductible, 
some visual public access to the donated property is required. In the 
case of an historically important land area, the entire property need 
not be visible to the public for a donation to qualify under this 
section. However, the public benefit from the donation may be 
insufficient to qualify for a deduction if only a small portion of the 
property is so visible. Where the historic land area or certified 
historic structure which is the subject of the donation is not visible 
from a public way (e.g., the structure is hidden from view by a wall or 
shrubbery, the structure is too far from the public way, or interior 
characteristics and features of the structure are the subject of the 
easement), the terms of the easement must be such that the general 
public is given the opportunity on a regular basis to view the 
characteristics and features of the property which are preserved by the 
easement to the extent consistent with the nature and condition of the 
property.
    (B) Factors to be considered in determining the type and amount of 
public access required under paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(A) of this section 
include the historical significance of the donated property, the nature 
of the features that are the subject of the easement, the remoteness or 
accessibility of the site of the donated property, the possibility of 
physical hazards to the public visiting the property (for example, an 
unoccupied structure in a dilapidated condition), the extent to which 
public access would be an unreasonable intrusion on any privacy 
interests of individuals living on the property, the degree to which 
public access would impair the preservation interests which are the 
subject of the donation, and the availability of opportunities for the 
public to view the property by means other than visits to the site.
    (C) The amount of access afforded the public by the donation of an 
easement shall be determined with reference to the amount of access 
permitted by the terms of the easement which are established by the 
donor, rather than the amount of access actually provided by the donee 
organization. However, if the donor is aware of any facts indicating 
that the amount of access that the donee organization will provide is 
significantly less than the amount of access permitted under the terms 
of the easement, then the amount of access afforded the public shall be 
determined with reference to this lesser amount.
    (v) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section 
may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A and his family live in a house in a certified historic 
district in the State of X. The entire house, including its interior, 
has architectural features representing classic Victorian period 
architecture. A donates an exterior and interior easement on the 
property to a qualified organization but continues to live in the house 
with his family. A's house is surrounded by a high stone wall which 
obscures the public's view of it from the street. Pursuant to the terms 
of the easement, the house may be opened to the public from 10:00 a.m. 
to 4:00 p.m. on one Sunday in May and one Sunday in November each year 
for house and garden tours. These tours are to be under the supervision 
of the donee and open to members of the general public upon payment of a 
small fee. In addition, under the terms of the easement, the donee 
organization is given the right to photograph the

[[Page 155]]

interior and exterior of the house and distribute such photographs to 
magazines, newsletters, or other publicly available publications. The 
terms of the easement also permit persons affiliated with educational 
organizations, professional architectural associations, and historical 
societies to make an appointment through the donee organization to study 
the property. The donor is not aware of any facts indicating that the 
public access to be provided by the donee organization will be 
significantly less than that permitted by the terms of the easement. The 
2 opportunities for public visits per year, when combined with the 
ability of the general public to view the architectural characteristics 
and features that are the subject of the easement through photographs, 
the opportunity for scholarly study of the property, and the fact that 
the house is used as an occupied residence, will enable the donation to 
satisfy the requirement of public access.
    Example 2. B owns an unoccupied farmhouse built in the 1840's and 
located on a property that is adjacent to a Civil War battlefield. 
During the Civil War the farmhouse was used as quarters for Union 
troops. The battlefield is visited year round by the general public. The 
condition of the farmhouse is such that the safety of visitors will not 
be jeopardized and opening it to the public will not result in 
significant deterioration. The farmhouse is not visible from the 
battlefield or any public way. It is accessible only by way of a private 
road owned by B. B donates a conservation easement on the farmhouse to a 
qualified organization. The terms of the easement provide that the donee 
organization may open the property (via B's road) to the general public 
on four weekends each year from 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The donation does 
not meet the public access requirement because the farmhouse is safe, 
unoccupied, and easily accessible to the general public who have come to 
the site to visit Civil War historic land areas (and related resources), 
but will only be open to the public on four weekends each year. However, 
the donation would meet the public access requirement if the terms of 
the easement permitted the donee organization to open the property to 
the public every other weekend during the year and the donor is not 
aware of any facts indicating that the donee organization will provide 
significantly less access than that permitted.

    (e) Exclusively for conservation purposes--(1) In general. To meet 
the requirements of this section, a donation must be exclusively for 
conservation purposes. See paragraphs (c)(1) and (g)(1) through 
(g)(6)(ii) of this section. A deduction will not be denied under this 
section when incidental benefit inures to the donor merely as a result 
of conservation restrictions limiting the uses to which the donor's 
property may be put.
    (2) Inconsistent use. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this 
section, a deduction will not be allowed if the contribution would 
accomplish one of the enumerated conservation purposes but would permit 
destruction of other significant conservation interests. For example, 
the preservation of farmland pursuant to a State program for flood 
prevention and control would not qualify under paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section if under the terms of the contribution a significant naturally 
occurring ecosystem could be injured or destroyed by the use of 
pesticides in the operation of the farm. However, this requirement is 
not intended to prohibit uses of the property, such as selective timber 
harvesting or selective farming if, under the circumstances, those uses 
do not impair significant conservation interests.
    (3) Inconsistent use permitted. A use that is destructive of 
conservation interests will be permitted only if such use is necessary 
for the protection of the conservation interests that are the subject of 
the contribution. For example, a deduction for the donation of an 
easement to preserve an archaeological site that is listed on the 
National Register of Historic Places will not be disallowed if site 
excavation consistent with sound archaeological practices may impair a 
scenic view of which the land is a part. A donor may continue a pre-
existing use of the property that does not conflict with the 
conservation purposes of the gift.
    (f) Examples. The provisions of this section relating to 
conservation purposes may be illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. State S contains many large tract forests that are 
desirable recreation and scenic areas for the general public. The 
forests' scenic values attract millions of people to the State. However, 
due to the increasing intensity of land development in State S, the 
continued existence of forestland parcels greater than 45 acres is 
threatened. J grants a perpetual easement on a 100-acre parcel of 
forestland that is part of one of the State's scenic areas to a 
qualifying organization. The easement imposes restrictions on the use of 
the parcel for the purpose of maintaining its scenic values. The

[[Page 156]]

restrictions include a requirement that the parcel be maintained forever 
as open space devoted exclusively to conservation purposes and wildlife 
protection, and that there be no commercial, industrial, residential, or 
other development use of such parcel. The law of State S recognizes a 
limited public right to enter private land, particularly for 
recreational pursuits, unless such land is posted or the landowner 
objects. The easement specifically restricts the landowner from posting 
the parcel, or from objecting, thereby maintaining public access to the 
parcel according to the custom of the State. J's parcel provides the 
opportunity for the public to enjoy the use of the property and 
appreciate its scenic values. Accordingly, J's donation qualifies for a 
deduction under this section.
    Example 2. A qualified conservation organization owns Greenacre in 
fee as a nature preserve. Greenacre contains a high quality example of a 
tall grass prairie ecosystem. Farmacre, an operating farm, adjoins 
Greenacre and is a compatible buffer to the nature preserve. Conversion 
of Farmacre to a more intense use, such as a housing development, would 
adversely affect the continued use of Greenacre as a nature preserve 
because of human traffic generated by the development. The owner of 
Farmacre donates an easement preventing any future development on 
Farmacre to the qualified conservation organization for conservation 
purposes. Normal agricultural uses will be allowed on Farmacre. 
Accordingly, the donation qualifies for a deduction under this section.
    Example 3. H owns Greenacre, a 900-acre parcel of woodland, rolling 
pasture, and orchards on the crest of a mountain. All of Greenacre is 
clearly visible from a nearby national park. Because of the strict 
enforcement of an applicable zoning plan, the highest and best use of 
Greenacre is as a subdivision of 40-acre tracts. H wishes to donate a 
scenic easement on Greenacre to a qualifying conservation organization, 
but H would like to reserve the right to subdivide Greenacre into 90-
acre parcels with no more than one single-family home allowable on each 
parcel. Random building on the property, even as little as one home for 
each 90 acres, would destroy the scenic character of the view. 
Accordingly, no deduction would be allowable under this section.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in example (3), except that not 
all of Greenacre is visible from the park and the deed of easement 
allows for limited cluster development of no more than five nine-acre 
clusters (with four houses on each cluster) located in areas generally 
not visible from the national park and subject to site and building plan 
approval by the donee organization in order to preserve the scenic view 
from the park. The donor and the donee have already identified sites 
where limited cluster development would not be visible from the park or 
would not impair the view. Owners of homes in the clusters will not have 
any rights with respect to the surrounding Greenacre property that are 
not also available to the general public. Accordingly, the donation 
qualifies for a deduction under this section.
    Example 5. In order to protect State S's declining open space that 
is suited for agricultural use from increasing development pressure that 
has led to a marked decline in such open space, the Legislature of State 
S passed a statute authorizing the purchase of ``agricultural land 
development rights'' on open acreage. Agricultural land development 
rights allow the State to place agricultural preservation restrictions 
on land designated as worthy of protection in order to preserve open 
space and farm resources. Agricultural preservation restrictions 
prohibit or limit construction or placement of buildings except those 
used for agricultural purposes or dwellings used for family living by 
the farmer and his family and employees; removal of mineral substances 
in any manner that adversely affects the land's agricultural potential; 
or other uses detrimental to retention of the land for agricultural use. 
Money has been appropriated for this program and some landowners have in 
fact sold their ``agricultural land development rights'' to State S. K 
owns and operates a small dairy farm in State S located in an area 
designated by the Legislature as worthy of protection. K desires to 
preserve his farm for agricultural purposes in perpetuity. Rather than 
selling the development rights to State S, K grants to a qualified 
organization an agricultural preservation restriction on his property in 
the form of a conservation easement. K reserves to himself, his heirs 
and assigns the right to manage the farm consistent with sound 
agricultural and management practices. The preservation of K's land is 
pursuant to a clearly delineated governmental policy of preserving open 
space available for agricultural use, and will yield a significant 
public benefit by preserving open space against increasing development 
pressures.

    (g) Enforceable in perpetuity--(1) In general. In the case of any 
donation under this section, any interest in the property retained by 
the donor (and the donor's successors in interest) must be subject to 
legally enforceable restrictions (for example, by recordation in the 
land records of the jurisdiction in which the property is located) that 
will prevent uses of the retained interest inconsistent with the 
conservation purposes of the donation. In the case of a contribution of 
a remainder interest, the contribution will not qualify if the tenants, 
whether they are tenants for life or a term of years, can

[[Page 157]]

use the property in a manner that diminishes the conservation values 
which are intended to be protected by the contribution.
    (2) Protection of a conservation purpose in case of donation of 
property subject to a mortgage. In the case of conservation 
contributions made after February 13, 1986, no deducion will be 
permitted under this section for an interest in property which is 
subject to a mortgage unless the mortgagee subordinates its rights in 
the property to the right of the qualified organization to enforce the 
conservation purposes of the gift in perpetuity. For conservation 
contributions made prior to February 14, 1986, the requirement of 
section 170 (h)(5)(A) is satisfied in the case of mortgaged property 
(with respect to which the mortgagee has not subordinated its rights) 
only if the donor can demonstrate that the conservation purpose is 
protected in perpetuity without subordination of the mortgagee's rights.
    (3) Remote future event. A deduction shall not be disallowed under 
section 170(f)(3)(B)(iii) and this section merely because the interest 
which passes to, or is vested in, the donee organization may be defeated 
by the performance of some act or the happening of some event, if on the 
date of the gift it appears that the possibility that such act or event 
will occur is so remote as to be negligible. See paragraph (e) of 
Sec. 1.170A-1. For example, a state's statutory requirement that use 
restrictions must be rerecorded every 30 years to remain enforceable 
shall not, by itself, render an easement nonperpetual.
    (4) Retention of qualified mineral interest--(i) In general. Except 
as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section, the 
requirements of this section are not met and no deduction shall be 
allowed in the case of a contribution of any interest when there is a 
retention by any person of a qualified mineral interest (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section) if at any time there may be 
extractions or removal of minerals by any surface mining method. 
Moreover, in the case of a qualified mineral interest gift, the 
requirement that the conservation purposes be protected in perpetuity is 
not satisfied if any method of mining that is inconsistent with the 
particular conservation purposes of a contribution is permitted at any 
time. See also Sec. 1.170A-14(e)(2). However, a deduction under this 
section will not be denied in the case of certain methods of mining that 
may have limited, localized impact on the real property but that are not 
irremediably destructive of significant conservation interests. For 
example, a deduction will not be denied in a case where production 
facilities are concealed or compatible with existing topography and 
landscape and when surface alteration is to be restored to its original 
state.
    (ii) Exception for qualified conservation contributions after July 
1984. (A) A contribution made after July 18, 1984, of a qualified real 
property interest described in section 170(h)(2)(A) shall not be 
disqualified under the first sentence of paragraph (g)(4)(i) of this 
section if the following requirements are satisfied.
    (1) The ownership of the surface estate and mineral interest were 
separated before June 13, 1976, and remain so separated up to and 
including the time of the contribution.
    (2) The present owner of the mineral interest is not a person whose 
relationship to the owner of the surface estate is described at the time 
of the contribution in section 267(b) or section 707(b), and
    (3) The probability of extraction or removal of minerals by any 
surface mining method is so remote as to be negligible.
Whether the probability of extraction or removal of minerals by surface 
mining is so remote as to be negligible is a question of fact and is to 
be made on a case by case basis. Relevant factors to be considered in 
determining if the probability of extraction or removal of minerals by 
surface mining is so remote as to be negligible include: Geological, 
geophysical or economic data showing the absence of mineral reserves on 
the property, or the lack of commercial feasibility at the time of the 
contribution of surface mining the mineral interest.
    (B) If the ownership of the surface estate and mineral interest 
first became separated after June 12, 1976, no deduction is permitted 
for a contribution

[[Page 158]]

under this section unless surface mining on the property is completely 
prohibited.
    (iii) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (g)(4)(i) and (ii) of 
this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. K owns 5,000 acres of bottomland hardwood property along 
a major watershed system in the southern part of the United States. 
Agencies within the Department of the Interior have determined that 
southern bottomland hardwoods are a rapidly diminishing resource and a 
critical ecosystem in the south because of the intense pressure to cut 
the trees and convert the land to agricultural use. These agencies have 
further determined (and have indicated in correspondence with K) that 
bottomland hardwoods provide a superb habitat for numerous species and 
play an important role in controlling floods and purifying rivers. K 
donates to a qualified organization his entire interest in this property 
other than his interest in the gas and oil deposits that have been 
identified under K's property. K covenants and can ensure that, although 
drilling for gas and oil on the property may have some temporary 
localized impact on the real property, the drilling will not interfere 
with the overall conservation purpose of the gift, which is to protect 
the unique bottomland hardwood ecosystem. Accordingly, the donation 
qualifies for a deduction under this section.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that in 
1979, K sells the mineral interest to A, an unrelated person, in an 
arm's-length transaction, subject to a recorded prohibition on the 
removal of any minerals by any surface mining method and a recorded 
prohibition against any mining technique that will harm the bottomland 
hardwood ecosystem. After the sale to A, K donates a qualified real 
property interest to a qualified organization to protect the bottomland 
hardwood ecosystem. Since at the time of the transfer, surface mining 
and any mining technique that will harm the bottomland hardwood 
ecosystem are completely prohibited, the donation qualifies for a 
deduction under this section.

    (5) Protection of conservation purpose where taxpayer reserves 
certain rights--(i) Documentation. In the case of a donation made after 
February 13, 1986, of any qualified real property interest when the 
donor reserves rights the exercise of which may impair the conservation 
interests associated with the property, for a deduction to be allowable 
under this section the donor must make available to the donee, prior to 
the time the donation is made, documentation sufficient to establish the 
condition of the property at the time of the gift. Such documentation is 
designed to protect the conservation interests associated with the 
property, which although protected in perpetuity by the easement, could 
be adversely affected by the exercise of the reserved rights. Such 
documentation may include:
    (A) The appropriate survey maps from the United States Geological 
Survey, showing the property line and other contiguous or nearby 
protected areas;
    (B) A map of the area drawn to scale showing all existing man-made 
improvements or incursions (such as roads, buildings, fences, or gravel 
pits), vegetation and identification of flora and fauna (including, for 
example, rare species locations, animal breeding and roosting areas, and 
migration routes), land use history (including present uses and recent 
past disturbances), and distinct natural features (such as large trees 
and aquatic areas);
    (C) An aerial photograph of the property at an appropriate scale 
taken as close as possible to the date the donation is made; and
    (D) On-site photographs taken at appropriate locations on the 
property. If the terms of the donation contain restrictions with regard 
to a particular natural resource to be protected, such as water quality 
or air quality, the condition of the resource at or near the time of the 
gift must be established. The documentation, including the maps and 
photographs, must be accompanied by a statement signed by the donor and 
a representative of the donee clearly referencing the documentation and 
in substance saying ``This natural resources inventory is an accurate 
representation of [the protected property] at the time of the 
transfer.''.
    (ii) Donee's right to inspection and legal remedies. In the case of 
any donation referred to in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section, the 
donor must agree to notify the donee, in writing, before exercising any 
reserved right, e.g. the right to extract certain minerals which may 
have an adverse impact on the conservation interests associated with the 
qualified real property interest.

[[Page 159]]

The terms of the donation must provide a right of the donee to enter the 
property at reasonable times for the purpose of inspecting the property 
to determine if there is compliance with the terms of the donation. 
Additionally, the terms of the donation must provide a right of the 
donee to enforce the conservation restrictions by appropriate legal 
proceedings, including but not limited to, the right to require the 
restoration of the property to its condition at the time of the 
donation.
    (6) Extinguishment. (i) In general. If a subsequent unexpected 
change in the conditions surrounding the property that is the subject of 
a donation under this paragraph can make impossible or impractical the 
continued use of the property for conservation purposes, the 
conservation purpose can nonetheless be treated as protected in 
perpetuity if the restrictions are extinguished by judicial proceeding 
and all of the donee's proceeds (determined under paragraph (g)(6)(ii) 
of this section) from a subsequent sale or exchange of the property are 
used by the donee organization in a manner consistent with the 
conservation purposes of the original contribution.
    (ii) Proceeds. In case of a donation made after February 13, 1986, 
for a deduction to be allowed under this section, at the time of the 
gift the donor must agree that the donation of the perpetual 
conservation restriction gives rise to a property right, immediately 
vested in the donee organization, with a fair market value that is at 
least equal to the proportionate value that the perpetual conservation 
restriction at the time of the gift, bears to the value of the property 
as a whole at that time. See Sec. 1.170A-14(h)(3)(iii) relating to the 
allocation of basis. For purposes of this paragraph (g)(6)(ii), that 
proportionate value of the donee's property rights shall remain 
constant. Accordingly, when a change in conditions give rise to the 
extinguishment of a perpetual conservation restriction under paragraph 
(g)(6)(i) of this section, the donee organization, on a subsequent sale, 
exchange, or involuntary conversion of the subject property, must be 
entitled to a portion of the proceeds at least equal to that 
proportionate value of the perpetual conservation restriction, unless 
state law provides that the donor is entitled to the full proceeds from 
the conversion without regard to the terms of the prior perpetual 
conservation restriction.
    (h) Valuation--(1) Entire interest of donor other than qualified 
mineral interest. The value of the contribution under section 170 in the 
case of a contribution of a taxpayer's entire interest in property other 
than a qualified mineral interest is the fair market value of the 
surface rights in the property contributed. The value of the 
contribution shall be computed without regard to the mineral rights. See 
paragraph (h)(4), example (1), of this section.
    (2) Remainder interest in real property. In the case of a 
contribution of any remainder interest in real property, section 
170(f)(4) provides that in determining the value of such interest for 
purposes of section 170, depreciation and depletion of such property 
shall be taken into account. See Sec. 1.170A-12. In the case of the 
contribution of a remainder interest for conservation purposes, the 
current fair market value of the property (against which the limitations 
of Sec. 1.170A-12 are applied) must take into account any pre-existing 
or contemporaneously recorded rights limiting, for conservation 
purposes, the use to which the subject property may be put.
    (3) Perpetual conservation restriction--(i) In general. The value of 
the contribution under section 170 in the case of a charitable 
contribution of a perpetual conservation restriction is the fair market 
value of the perpetual conservation restriction at the time of the 
contribution. See Sec. 1.170A-7(c). If there is a substantial record of 
sales of easements comparable to the donated easement (such as purchases 
pursuant to a governmental program), the fair market value of the 
donated easement is based on the sales prices of such comparable 
easements. If no substantial record of market-place sales is available 
to use as a meaningful or valid comparison, as a general rule (but not 
necessarily in all cases) the fair market value of a perpetual 
conservation restriction is equal to the difference between the fair 
market value of the property it encumbers before the

[[Page 160]]

granting of the restriction and the fair market value of the encumbered 
property after the granting of the restriction. The amount of the 
deduction in the case of a charitable contribution of a perpetual 
conservation restriction covering a portion of the contiguous property 
owned by a donor and the donor's family (as defined in section 
267(c)(4)) is the difference between the fair market value of the entire 
contiguous parcel of property before and after the granting of the 
restriction. If the granting of a perpetual conservation restriction 
after January 14, 1986, has the effect of increasing the value of any 
other property owned by the donor or a related person, the amount of the 
deduction for the conservation contribution shall be reduced by the 
amount of the increase in the value of the other property, whether or 
not such property is contiguous. If, as a result of the donation of a 
perpetual conservation restriction, the donor or a related person 
receives, or can reasonably expect to receive, financial or economic 
benefits that are greater than those that will inure to the general 
public from the transfer, no deduction is allowable under this section. 
However, if the donor or a related person receives, or can reasonably 
expect to receive, a financial or economic benefit that is substantial, 
but it is clearly shown that the benefit is less than the amount of the 
transfer, then a deduction under this section is allowable for the 
excess of the amount transferred over the amount of the financial or 
economic benefit received or reasonably expected to be received by the 
donor or the related person. For purposes of this paragraph (h)(3)((i), 
related person shall have the same meaning as in either section 267(b) 
or section 707(b). (See Example (10) of paragraph (h)(4) of this 
section.)
    (ii) Fair market value of property before and after restriction. If 
before and after valuation is used, the fair market value of the 
property before contribution of the conservation restriction must take 
into account not only the current use of the property but also an 
objective assessment of how immediate or remote the likelihood is that 
the property, absent the restriction, would in fact be developed, as 
well as any effect from zoning, conservation, or historic preservation 
laws that already restrict the property's potential highest and best 
use. Further, there may be instances where the grant of a conservation 
restriction may have no material effect on the value of the property or 
may in fact serve to enhance, rather than reduce, the value of property. 
In such instances no deduction would be allowable. In the case of a 
conservation restriction that allows for any development, however 
limited, on the property to be protected, the fair maket value of the 
property after contribution of the restriction must take into account 
the effect of the development. In the case of a conservation easement 
such as an easement on a certified historic structure, the fair market 
value of the property after contribution of the restriction must take 
into account the amount of access permitted by the terms of the 
easement. Additionally, if before and after valuation is used, an 
appraisal of the property after contribution of the restriction must 
take into account the effect of restrictions that will result in a 
reduction of the potential fair market value represented by highest and 
best use but will, nevertheless, permit uses of the property that will 
increase its fair market value above that represented by the property's 
current use. The value of a perpetual conservation restriction shall not 
be reduced by reason of the existence of restrictions on transfer 
designed solely to ensure that the conservation restriction will be 
dedicated to conservation purposes. See Sec. 1.170A-14 (c)(3).
    (iii) Allocation of basis. In the case of the donation of a 
qualified real property interest for conservation purposes, the basis of 
the property retained by the donor must be adjusted by the elimination 
of that part of the total basis of the property that is properly 
allocable to the qualified real property interest granted. The amount of 
the basis that is allocable to the qualified real property interest 
shall bear the same ratio to the total basis of the property as the fair 
market value of the qualified real property interest bears to the fair 
market value of the property before the granting of the qualified real 
property interest. When a

[[Page 161]]

taxpayer donates to a qualifying conservation organization an easement 
on a structure with respect to which deductions are taken for 
depreciation, the reduction required by this paragraph (h)(3)(ii) in the 
basis of the property retained by the taxpayer must be allocated between 
the structure and the underlying land.
    (4) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples. In examples illustrating the value or 
deductibility of donations, the applicable restrictions and limitations 
of Sec. 1.170A-4, with respect to reduction in amount of charitable 
contributions of certain appreciated property, and Sec. 1.170A-8, with 
respect to limitations on charitable deductions by individuals. must 
also be taken into account.

    Example 1. A owns Goldacre, a property adjacent to a state park. A 
wants to donate Goldacre to the state to be used as part of the park, 
but A wants to reserve a qualified mineral interest in the property, to 
exploit currently and to devise at death. The fair market value of the 
surface rights in Goldacre is $200,000 and the fair market value of the 
mineral rights in $100.000. In order to ensure that the quality of the 
park will not be degraded, restrictions must be imposed on the right to 
extract the minerals that reduce the fair market value of the mineral 
rights to $80,000. Under this section, the value of the contribution is 
$200,000 (the value of the surface rights).
    Example 2. In 1984 B, who is 62, donates a remainder interest in 
Greenacre to a qualifying organization for conservation purposes. 
Greenacre is a tract of 200 acres of undeveloped woodland that is valued 
at $200,000 at its highest and best use. Under Sec. 1.170A-12(b), the 
value of a remainder interest in real property following one life is 
determined under Sec. 25.2512-5 of this chapter (Gift Tax Regulations). 
(See Sec. 25.2512-5A of this chapter with respect to the valuation of 
annuities, interests for life or term of years, and remainder or 
reversionary interests transferred before December 1, 1983.) 
Accordingly, the value of the remainder interest, and thus the amount 
eligible for an income tax deduction under section 170(f), is $55,996 
($200,000 x .27998).
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (2), except that 
Greenacre is B's 200-acre estate with a home built during the colonial 
period. Some of the acreage around the home is cleared; the balance of 
Greenacre, except for access roads, is wooded and undeveloped. See 
section 170(f)(3)(B)(i). However, B would like Greenacre to be 
maintained in its current state after his death, so he donates a 
remainder interest in Greenacre to a qualifying organization for 
conservation purposes pursunt to section 170 (f)(3)(B)(iii) and 
(h)(2)(B). At the time of the gift the land has a value of $200,000 and 
the house has a value of $100,000. The value of the remainder interest, 
and thus the amount eligible for an income tax deduction under section 
170(f), is computed pursuant to Sec. 1.170A-12. See Sec. 1.170A-
12(b)(3).
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Eexample (2), except that at 
age 62 instead of donating a remainder interest B donates an easement in 
Greenacre to a qualifying organization for conservation purposes. The 
fair market value of Greenacre after the donation is reduced to 
$110,000. Accordingly, the value of the easement, and thus the amount 
eligible for a deduction under section 170(f), is $90,000 ($200,000 less 
$110,000).
    Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example (4), and assume that 
three years later, at age 65, B decides to donate a remainder interest 
in Greenacre to a qualifying organization for conservation purposes. 
Increasing real estate values in the area have raised the fair market 
value of Greenacre (subject to the easement) to $130,000. Accordingly, 
the value of the remainder interest, and thus the amount eligible for a 
deduction under section 170(f), is $41,639 ($130,000 x .32030).
    Example 6. Assume the same facts as in Example (2), except that at 
the time of the donation of a remainder interest in Greenacre, B also 
donates an easement to a different qualifying organization for 
conservation purposes. Based on all the facts and circumstances, the 
value of the easement is determined to be $100,000. Therefore, the value 
of the property after the easement is $100,000 and the value of the 
remainder interest, and thus the amount eligible for deduction under 
section 170(f), is $27,998 ($100,000 x .27998).
    Example 7. C owns Greenacre, a 200-acre estate containing a house 
built during the colonial period. At its highest and best use, for home 
development, the fair market value of Greenacre is $300,000. C donates 
an easement (to maintain the house and Green acre in their current 
state) to a qualifying organization for conservation purposes. The fair 
market value of Greenacre after the donation is reduced to $125,000. 
Accordingly, the value of the easement and the amount eligible for a 
deduction under section 170(f) is $175.000 ($300,000 less $125,000).
    Example 8. Assume the same facts as in Example (7) and assume that 
three years later, C decides to donate a remainder interest in Greenacre 
to a qualifying organization for conservation purposes. Increasing real 
estate values in the area have raised the fair market value of Greenacre 
to $180.000. Assume that because of the perpetual easement prohibiting 
any development of the land, the value of the house is $120,000 and the 
value of

[[Page 162]]

the land is $60,000. The value of the remainder interest, and thus the 
amount eligible for an income tax deduction under section 170(f), is 
computed pursuant to Sec. 1.170A-12. See Sec. 1.170A-12(b)(3).
    Example 9. D owns property with a basis of $20,000 and a fair market 
value of $80,000. D donates to a qualifying organization an easement for 
conservation purposes that is determined under this section to have a 
fair market value of $60,000. The amount of basis allocable to the 
easement is $15,000 ($60,000/$80,000=$15,000/$20,000). Accordingly, the 
basis of the property is reduced to $5,000 ($20,000 minus $15,000).
    Example 10. E owns 10 one-acre lots that are currently woods and 
parkland. The fair market value of each of E's lots is $15,000 and the 
basis of each lot is $3,000. E grants to the county a perpetual easement 
for conservation purposes to use and maintain eight of the acres as a 
public park and to restrict any future development on those eight acres. 
As a result of the restrictions, the value of the eight acres is reduced 
to $1,000 an acre. However, by perpetually restricting development on 
this portion of the land, E has ensured that the two remaining acres 
will always be bordered by parkland, thus increasing their fair market 
value to $22,500 each. If the eight acres represented all of E's land, 
the fair market value of the easement would be $112,000, an amount equal 
to the fair market value of the land before the granting of the easement 
(8 x $15,000=$120,000) minus the fair market value of the encumbered 
land after the granting of the easement (8 x $1,000=$8,000). However, 
because the easement only covered a portion of the taxpayer's contiguous 
land, the amount of the deduction under section 170 is reduced to 
$97,000 ($150,000-$53,000), that is, the difference between the fair 
market value of the entire tract of land before ($150,000) and after 
((8 x $1,000)+(2 x  $22,500)) the granting of the easement.
    Example 11. Assume the same facts as in example (10). Since the 
easement covers a portion of E's land, only the basis of that portion is 
adjusted. Therefore, the amount of basis allocable to the easement is 
$22,400 ((8 x $3,000) x ($112,000/$120,000)). Accordingly, the basis of 
the eight acres encumbered by the easement is reduced to $1,600 
($24,000-$22,400), or $200 for each acre. The basis of the two remaining 
acres is not affected by the donation.
    Example 12. F owns and uses as professional offices a two-story 
building that lies within a registered historic district. F's building 
is an outstanding example of period architecture with a fair market 
value of $125,000. Restricted to its current use, which is the highest 
and best use of the property without making changes to the facade, the 
building and lot would have a fair market value of $100,000, of which 
$80,000 would be allocable to the building and $20,000 woud be allocable 
to the lot. F's basis in the property is $50,000, of which $40,000 is 
allocable to the building and $10,000 is allocable to the lot. F's 
neighborhood is a mix of residential and commercial uses, and it is 
possible that F (or another owner) could enlarge the building for more 
extensive commercial use, which is its highest and best use. However, 
this would require changes to the facade. F would like to donate to a 
qualifying preservation organization an easement restricting any changes 
to the facade and promising to maintain the facade in perpetuity. The 
donation would qualify for a deduction under this section. The fair 
market value of the easement is $25,000 (the fair market value of the 
property before the easement, $125,000, minus the fair market value of 
the property after the easement, $100,000). Pursuant to Sec. 1.170A-
14(h)(3)(iii), the basis allocable to the easement is $10,000 and the 
basis of the underlying property (building and lot) is reduced to 
$40,000.

    (i) Substantiation requirement. If a taxpayer makes a qualified 
conservation contribution and claims a deduction, the taxpayer must 
maintain written records of the fair market value of the underlying 
property before and after the donation and the conservation purpose 
furthered by the donation and such information shall be stated in the 
taxpayer's income tax return if required by the return or its 
instructions. See also Sec. 1.170A-13(c) (relating to substantiation 
requirements for deductions in excess of $5,000 for charitable 
contributions made after 1984), and section 6659 (relating to additions 
to tax in the case of valuation overstatements).
    (j) Effective date. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.170A-
14(g)(4)(ii), this section applies only to contributions made on or 
after December 18, 1980.

Sec. 1.171-1   Amortizable bond premium.

    (a) In general. Under section 171, bond premium is amortizable by 
the owner of the bond (as defined in Sec. 1.171-4) in accordance with 
subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph as follows:
    (1) Amortization of bond premium is mandatory with respect to:
    (i) Fully tax-exempt bonds (the interest on which is excludable from 
gross

[[Page 163]]

income), whether the owner is a corporation, individual, or other 
taxpayer; and
    (ii) Partially tax-exempt bonds owned by a corporation.
    (2) Amortization of bond premium is optional, at the election of the 
taxpayer, with respect to:
    (i) Fully taxable bonds, whether the owner is a corporation, 
individual, or other taxpayer; and
    (ii) Partially tax-exempt bonds owned by taxpayers other than 
corporations.
    (b) Operation. (1) In the case of a fully tax-exempt bond, the 
amortizable bond premium for the taxable year is simply an adjustment to 
the basis or adjusted basis of the bond. Thus, if such premium is $1, 
the basis or adjusted basis of the bond is reduced by $1. No deduction 
is allowable on account of such amortizable bond premium. See paragraph 
(b)(2) of Sec. 1.171-2 for treatment of bonds with alternative call 
dates.
    (2) In the case of a fully taxable bond to which section 171 is 
applicable, the amortizable bond premium is applied both as an 
adjustment to the basis or adjusted basis of the bond and as a deduction 
in computing taxable income. For the disallowance of a deduction in 
certain cases, see paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 1.171-2.
    (3) In the case of a partially tax exempt bond, the amortizable bond 
premium for the taxable year is used for the following purposes:
    (i) As an adjustment to the basis or adjusted basis of the bond;
    (ii) As a deduction in computing taxable income;
    (iii) In the case of individuals, estates, or trusts, as a reduction 
of the amount which would otherwise be taken into account in computing 
the credit against the tax provided under section 35; or
    (iv) In the case of corporations, as a reduction of the amount 
allowed under section 242 as a deduction in computing taxable income.
    (4) The application of the provisions of subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph relating to a partially tax-exempt bond may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. In the case of an individual who has elected to amortize 
the premium on a partially tax-exempt bond, if the interest on such bond 
with an adjusted basis of $1,024 is $30 for the taxable year, and the 
amortizable bond premium thereon is $4 for the taxable year, then the 
$30 is included in gross income, the $4 is allowable as a deduction, the 
adjusted basis of $1,024 is reduced by $4 to $1,020, and a credit 
amounting to $0.78 (3 percent of $30 minus $4) is allowed against the 
tax for such taxable year. In the case of a corporation, which is 
required to amortize the premium on such bond, no credit is allowed 
against the tax, but the deduction under section 242 on account of the 
interest is $26 ($30 minus $4).

    (5) In the case where no specific deduction is permitted under 
section 171 (a) for amortization of bond premium as such, because the 
tax is computed for the taxpayer under section 3 by use of the optional 
tax tables, or because the taxpayer elects under section 144 to take the 
standard deduction, it shall be deemed, if the taxpayer has elected to 
amortize bond premium in accordance with the provisions of section 171, 
that the deduction for amortization of bond premium has been allowed for 
the purpose of determining the adjusted basis of the bond.
    (c) Bonds owned by decedents--(1) Decedents using cash receipts and 
disbursements method of accounting. (i) Where a decedent who used the 
cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting owned fully taxable 
bonds to which section 171 applies:
    (a) The interest accruing thereon during the period ending with his 
death is, by reason of section 691, included upon its receipt in the 
gross income of the estate or legatee, whichever acquires the right to 
receive such interest, and
    (b) The amount of amortizable bond premium properly allowable for 
such period is a deduction for such period to the decedent and is not 
allowable as a deduction to the estate or legatee.
    (ii) Where a decedent who used the cash receipts and disbursements 
method of accounting owned partially tax-exempt bonds to which section 
171 applies:
    (a) The interest accruing thereon during the period ending with his 
death is, by reason of section 691, included upon its receipt in the 
gross income of

[[Page 164]]

the estate or legatee, whichever acquires the right to receive such 
interest, and
    (b) The amount of the amortizable bond premium properly allowable 
for such period is a deduction for such period to the decedent, as in 
the case of a fully taxable bond, and
    (c) The amount of the amortizable bond premium shall not be applied 
to reduce the estate's or legatee's credit or deduction for such 
interest for such period.
    (2) Illustration. The provisions of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this 
paragraph relating to a partially tax-exempt bond may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. At the time of his death in 1956, D owned a partially tax-
exempt bond to which section 171 applies. For the period beginning 
January 1, 1956, and ending with D's death on September 30, 1956, the 
accrued interest on such bond is $25 and the amortizable bond premium is 
$2. D's estate has the right to receive such interest. D's executor, in 
making the income tax return for D's last taxable year (January 1 to 
September 30, 1956), may take into account a deduction of $2 on account 
of the amortizable bond premium for such year. D's estate includes the 
$25 interest in its gross income upon receipt and, for purposes of the 
income tax, receives a credit under section 35 of $0.75 (3 percent of 
$25). In computing such credit, the $25 interest is not reduced on 
account of the amortizable bond premium which was a deduction allowable 
for the last taxable year of the decedent.

    (3) Decedents using an accrual method of accounting. Where a 
decedent using an accrual method of accounting owned fully taxable bonds 
and partially tax-exempt bonds to which section 171 applies:
    (i) In the case of fully taxable bonds, both the interest accruing 
thereon during the period ending with his death and the deduction on 
account of the amortizable bond premium for such period are taken into 
account in computing the taxable income of the decedent; and
    (ii) In the case of partially taxexempt bonds, the rule as to the 
accrued interest and the amortization deduction is the same as in 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, and the amount which would 
otherwise be taken into account in computing the decedent's credit 
against tax for such interest is required to be reduced by the amount of 
the amortizable bond premium for the period ending with the decedent's 
death.


<R05>
Sec. 1.171-2   Determination of bond premium.

    (a) In general. (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, 
bond premium on any bond to which section 171 applies is the excess of 
the amount of the basis (for determining loss on sale or exchange under 
section 1011) of the bond over the amount payable at maturity or, in the 
case of a callable bond, the earlier call date. For determination of 
applicable call date, see paragraph (b) of this section.
    (2)(i) In the case of wholly taxable bonds described in section 
171(c)(1)(B) which are issued after January 22, 1951, and acquired after 
January 22, 1954, but before January 1, 1958, the earlier call date may 
be used in computing the amortizable bond premium only if such earlier 
call date is a date more than 3 years after the date of original issue. 
If a bond described in the preceding sentence is subject to a call date 
which falls within 3 years of the date of original issue, the 
amortizable bond premium shall be computed by reference to the amount 
payable on maturity. If a wholly taxable bond described in section 
171(c)(1)(B) is acquired after December 31, 1957, the amortizable bond 
premium shall be computed by reference to the amount payable on 
maturity, or if it results in a smaller amortizable bond premium 
attributable to the period of earlier call date, the computation shall 
be made by reference to the amount payable on the earlier call date. For 
purposes of this subdivision, the date of acquisition of a bond shall be 
the date such bond was ordered under a firm commitment to buy and not 
the date the bond was delivered to the taxpayer. For determining whether 
an earlier call date is a date more than 3 years after the date of 
original issue, consideration will be given to the terms under which a 
bond is issued.
    (ii) The application of the provisions of subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Assume that the taxpayer acquired on the date of issue, 
January 1, 1956,

[[Page 165]]

a $100 wholly taxable bond for $112, callable at any time thereafter 
upon 30 days' notice. The premium of $12 attributable to such bond may 
be amortized only with reference to the maturity date of the bond. 
Similarly, assume that in 1957 the taxpayer acquired a $100, 20-year 
bond, issued on January 1, 1954, for $115. The bond was callable 2 years 
after the date of issuance or, if not then called, 10 years after the 
date of issuance. The premium of $15 attributable to such bond may be 
amortized only with reference to the maturity date of the bond.
    Example 2. On January 1, 1958, the taxpayer (who is on a calendar 
year basis) pays $1,200 for a $1,000 wholly taxable bond which matures 
on December 31, 1977. The bond is callable on January 1, 1963, at 
$1,165. The premium computed with reference to the maturity date of the 
bond is $200. The premium computed with reference to the earlier call 
date is $35. Although the premium amortized ratably to maturity would 
yield a deduction of $10 for each year ($200 divided by 20 years), under 
section 171(b)(1)(B)(ii) the deduction for each taxable year for the 
period before January 1, 1963, will be $7 ($35 divided by 5 years). If 
the bond is not called, the deduction for each taxable year in the 
period from 1963 through 1977 will be $11 ($165 divided by 15 years). If 
the earliest call date in this example had been January 1, 1961, instead 
of January 1, 1963, the premium amortized ratably to maturity would be 
used to obtain a deduction of $10 per year since this would be less than 
the premium amortized ratably to earlier call date of $11.67 ($35 
divided by 3, the number of years to the earliest call date).

    (iii) In the case of a wholly taxable bond described in section 
171(b)(1)(B) (ii) or (iii), which has a call date, the amount of bond 
premium attributable to the taxable year in which the bond is called 
shall include an amount equal to the excess of the amount of the 
adjusted basis (for determining loss on sale or exchange) of such bond 
as of the beginning of the taxable year over the amount received on 
redemption of the bond or (if greater than the amount received on 
redemption) the amount payable on maturity. For adjustments proper to 
reflect unamortized bond premium for the period before the date as of 
which section 171 becomes applicable to the bond in the hands of the 
taxpayer, see subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. For example, if a 
wholly taxable bond, issued on January 1, 1954, and acquired by the 
taxpayer on January 1, 1955, at a price of $109, matures in 10 years 
from the date of issue (9 years from the date of acquisition) but is 
callable at $105 on 30 days' notice, section 171(b)(1)(B)(iii) requires 
that the bond be amortized to maturity, that is, at the rate of $1 per 
year. If the bond is called on December 31, 1956, for $105, then $3, the 
excess of the adjusted basis of $108 ($109 less $1 deducted in 1955) 
over the amount received on redemption, $105, may be deducted for the 
year 1956.
    (3) Whether the purchase and immediate transfer of callable bonds 
occurs in such a manner as to make the entire transaction not bona fide, 
and hence the deductions for amortization for bond premium not 
allowable, will depend on all the facts and circumstances.
    (4) If the date as of which the basis of the bond was established 
precedes the first taxable year with respect to which section 171 
applies to the bond, proper adjustments shall be made to reflect 
unamortized bond premium on such bond for the period including the 
holding period (as determined under section 1223) before the date as of 
which section 171 first becomes applicable to the bond in the hands of 
the taxpayer. Such adjustment is required whether an election was made 
under section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or under section 
171 and applies to all bonds to which section 171 is applicable.
    (5) The rule relating to adjustments set forth in subparagraph (4) 
of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. On January 1, 1956, T, who makes his income tax returns 
on the calendar year basis, owns a fully taxable $100 bond, maturing on 
January 1, 1966. T purchased this bond on January 1, 1946, for $120. T 
elects to have section 171 apply to such bond for 1957 and subsequent 
taxable years. In determining the amount of bond premium to be amortized 
over the remaining 9 years of the life of the bond, T is required, but 
solely for such purpose, to treat the bond as if he had amortized the 
bond premium thereon during the prior 11 years, and to make the proper 
adjustment in the original bond premium. Accordingly, T would treat $11 
as having been amortized during the first 11 years and would be required 
to amortize the remaining $9 over the following 9 years. When the bond 
is redeemed on January 1, 1966, for $100, only the $9 attributable to 
the last 9 years will actually have been amortized and

[[Page 166]]

the basis of the bond will have been reduced only by that amount. The 
$11 attributable to the first 11 years will have been treated as an 
adjustment to the original bond premium but will not have been amortized 
nor will the basis of the bond have been reduced by that amount. 
Consequently, T will have a capital loss in the year of redemption on 
account of the $11 attributable to the period January 1, 1946, to 
January 1, 1957.
    Example 2. On January 1, 1956, X's father gave him a fully taxable 
$100 bond maturing on January 1, 1966. X's father had purchased the bond 
on January 1, 1946, for $120. The fair market value of the bond at the 
time of the gift was $127. X makes his income tax returns on the 
calendar year basis and elects to amortize the bond premium on the bond 
during the period 1956- 1966. Under section 1015, the cost of the bond 
to X's father constitutes the basis of the bond in X's hands for 
determining loss, since such cost is lower than the fair market value of 
the bond at the time of the gift, and, under section 1223, X's holding 
period is deemed to include the 10 years during which his father held 
the bond. X is required to treat the bond as if the bond premium thereon 
had been amortized during his father's holding period. Thus, X is 
required to amortize $10 over the period January 1, 1956, to January 1, 
1966, and in the year of redemption will have a capital loss on account 
of the $10 attributable to his father's holding period.
    Example 3. Y, who makes his income tax returns on the calendar year 
basis, owns a fully tax-exempt $100 bond maturing on January 1, 1961. He 
purchased this bond on January 1, 1941, for $120. On December 31, 1954, 
Y sells the bond for $108 and realizes a gain of $1, computed as 
follows:

(i) Total bond premium ($120--$100)..........................        $20
(ii) Amount of bond premium amortizable if held to maturity             
 (total bond premium minus unamortized bond premium                     
 attributable to 1941 (a year to which section 125 of the               
 Internal Revenue Code of 1939 was not applicable), $20--$1).         19
(iii) Amount of bond premium amortized from Jan. 1, 1942,               
 through Dec. 31, 1954 ($1 for each such year)...............         13
(iv) Adjusted basis of bond at close of 1954 ($120-$13)......        107
(v) Gains ($108-$107)........................................          1
                                                                        

    (6) Amortizable bond premium on any bond to which section 171 
applies is that part of the bond premium on the bond which is 
attributable to the taxable year.
    (b) Callable bonds. (1) For purposes of section 171, in the case of 
a callable bond, the earlier call date will be considered as the 
maturity date, except as provided in paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this 
section. The amount due on the earlier call date will be considered as 
the amount payable on maturity unless it is determined under a different 
method of amortization regularly employed by the taxpayer that another 
amount shall be the amount payable on maturity. Hence, in the case where 
a bond premium is to be amortized to the earlier call date, the bond 
premium on such bond is required to be spread over the period from the 
date as of which the basis for loss of the bond is established down to 
the earlier call date, rather than to the maturity date. The earlier 
call date may be the earliest call date specified in the bond as a day 
certain, the earliest interest payment date if the bond is callable at 
such date, the earliest date at which the bond is callable at par, or 
such other call date, prior to maturity, specified in the bond as may be 
selected by the taxpayer.
    (2) Where a deduction for amortizable bond premium may be determined 
with respect to alternative call dates, the amount of amortizable bond 
premium calculated with reference to a particular call date must be 
calculated thereafter with reference to the same call date. However, if, 
upon such call date originally selected, the bond has not in fact been 
called, the bond premium then unamortized must be amortized to a 
succeeding call date or to maturity. Thus, assume a $100 bond is 
acquired at time of issue for $125. The bond is callable in five years 
at $115 and in 10 years at $110. The taxpayer may amortize $10 of 
premium during the first five years and, if the bond is not then called, 
an additional $5 of premium during the next five years. If the bond is 
not called at the end of ten years, the remaining $10 of premium must be 
amortized to maturity.
    (c) Convertible bonds. (1) The fact that a bond is convertible into 
stock does not, in itself, prevent the application of section 171. A 
convertible bond is within the scope of such section if the option to 
convert on a date certain specified in the bond rests with the holder 
thereof. However, for the purpose of determining the amount of 
amortizable bond premium on a convertible bond for the taxable year, the 
amount of bond premium shall not include any

[[Page 167]]

amount attributable to the conversion features of the bond.
    (2) The value of the conversion features of a particular bond shall 
be ascertained as of the time of acquisition by reference to the assumed 
price at which such bond would be purchased on the open market if 
without conversion features, and by subtracting such assumed price from 
the cost of the bond. The assumed price of the bond without conversion 
features shall be ascertained by comparison to the yields on which bonds 
of similar character, not having conversion features, are sold on the 
open market and adjusting the price of the bond in question to this 
yield. This adjustment may be made by the use of standard bond tables. 
In selecting quotations for comparative purposes, bonds of the same 
classification and grade shall be used.
    (3) The application of the principles set forth in this paragraph 
may be illustrated as follows:

    Example. T purchased for $115 a $100 bond, maturing in 10 years, on 
which interest is payable semiannually at the rate of 3 percent a year. 
This bond is convertible into common stock at the option of the holder. 
It is found that bonds of the same character, not having conversion 
features, were sold on the open market on or about the time of T's 
purchase on a basis to yield 2.6 percent. By recourse to a standard bond 
table, it is found that the cost of a 3 percent, 10-year, $100 bond to 
yield 2.6 percent would have been $103.50. Since the taxpayer paid $115 
for the convertible bond, the difference between $115 and $103.50, or 
$11.50, represents the value of the conversion features of the bond at 
the time of purchase. The balance of $3.50 represents the bond premium 
subject to amortization under section 171.

    (4) If a convertible bond acquired on or before June 15, 1950, is 
held during the taxable year, the amortizable bond premium shall be 
computed as if the provisions for the determination of the bond premium 
without the inclusion of any amount attributable to the conversion 
features of the bond were applicable for each year for which the bond 
was held prior to such taxable year. Thus, if T, in the example in 
subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, had acquired the bond on January 1, 
1949, and if T makes his income tax returns on the basis of the calendar 
year, the amortizable bond premium for 1957 would be $0.35, determined 
as follows:

Bond premium not attributable to conversion feature..........      $3.50
Amortizable bond premium for 1949 and 1950, determined by               
 reference to bond premium not attributable to conversion               
 feature.....................................................        .70
                                                              ----------
    Portion of bond premium amortizable over remaining life             
     of bond.................................................       2.80
Amortizable bond premium for each of the remaining 8 years,             
 including the taxable year 1957 (one-eighth of $2.80).......        .35
                                                                        

    (d) Capitalized expenses. (1) In the case of a bond to which section 
171 otherwise applies, on which the bond premium is attributable only to 
capitalized expenses (such as buying commissions), if a taxpayer:
    (i) Regularly employs a reasonable method of amortization under 
which capitalized expenses are amortized, or
    (ii) Is required by the regulations to use the method of 
amortization prescribed by paragraph (f) of this section, or
    (iii) Regularly employs a reasonable method of amortization but does 
not amortize capitalized expenses, such taxpayer is permitted, but is 
not required, to amortize capitalized expenses in accordance with such 
method.
    (2) In the case of a bond to which section 171 applies and on which 
there is bond premium exclusive of capitalized expenses:
    (i) If a taxpayer regularly employs a reasonable method of 
amortization under which capitalized expenses are treated as being part 
of the bond premium for purposes of amortization, such capitalized 
expenses must be treated as being a part of the bond premium for the 
purposes of section 171.
    (ii) If a taxpayer is required by regulations to use the method of 
amortization prescribed by paragraph (f) of this section, he must treat 
capitalized expenses as being part of the bond premium for purposes of 
section 171.
    (iii) If a taxpayer regularly employs a method of amortization under 
which capitalized expenses are not treated as being part of the bond 
premium for the purposes of amortization, he is permitted, but is not 
required, to treat such capitalized expenses as being part of the bond 
premium for the purposes of section 171.

[[Page 168]]

    (e) Taxable years in which interest not received or accruable. In 
the case of a taxpayer who makes his income tax returns on the cash 
receipts and disbursements method or one who makes his returns on an 
accrual method and who owns a bond to which section 171 applies and in 
respect of which no interest is received or accrued by the taxpayer 
during the taxable year, if the taxpayer:
    (1) Regularly employs a reasonable method of amortization under 
which the bond premium on such bond for such taxable year is amortized, 
or
    (2) Is required by the regulations to use the method of amortization 
prescribed by paragraph (f) of this section, or
    (3) Regularly employs a reasonable method of amortization under 
which the bond premium on such bond for such taxable year is not 
amortized, such taxpayer is permitted, but not required, to amortize 
bond premium on the bond for such taxable year in accordance with such 
method.
    (f) Methods of amortization. (1) Determination of the bond premium 
and amortizable bond premium on any bond to which section 171 applies 
shall be made in accordance with:
    (i) The method of amortization regularly employed by the taxpayer, 
if such method is reasonable; or
    (ii) In all other cases, the method of amortization prescribed by 
this section.

A method of amortization, for example, the composite method described in 
Sec. 1.1016-9, will be deemed ``regularly employed'' by a taxpayer if 
the method was consistently followed in taxable years beginning before 
January 1, 1954, or if for taxable years beginning on or after such date 
a taxpayer who has never previously taken a deduction for amortization 
initiates in the first taxable year for which such deduction is taken a 
reasonable method of amortization and consistently follows such method 
thereafter. A taxpayer who regularly employs a method of amortization 
may be one, for example, who is subject to the jurisdiction of a State 
or Federal regulatory agency and who, for the purposes of such agency, 
amortizes the bond premium on his bonds in accordance with a method 
prescribed or approved by such agency. However, it is not necessary that 
the taxpayer be subject to the jurisdiction of such an agency or that 
the method be prescribed or approved by such agency. It is sufficient if 
the taxpayer regularly employs a method of amortization and if such 
method is reasonable.
    (2) The bond premium to be amortized shall be determined under the 
following method:
    (i) The amortizable bond premium on such bond attributable to the 
taxable year under paragraph (a)(6) of this section shall be an amount 
which bears the same ratio to the bond premium on the bond as the number 
of months in the taxable year during which the bond was held by the 
taxpayer bears to the number of months from the beginning of the taxable 
year (or, if the bond was acquired in the taxable year, from the date of 
acquisition) to the date of maturity or earlier call date. For the 
purposes of this subdivision, a fractional part of a month shall be 
disregarded unless it amounts to more than half of a month, in which 
case it shall be considered as a month.
    (ii) For purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the bond 
premium as of any date on any bond to which section 171 applies shall be 
determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section by 
ascertaining the excess of the amount of the basis of the bond, as 
determined under section 1011 (adjusted to date for amortizable bond 
premium under section 1016) over the amount payable at maturity or, in 
the case of a callable bond, the earlier call date (except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section).
    (3) The application of the provisions of this paragraph relating to 
method of amortization may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. (i) A taxpayer, who makes calendar year returns on June 20, 
1955, acquires at a cost of $119 a $100 bond issued January 1, 1955, 
maturing January 1, 1965. The amortizable bond premium as of the last 
day of 1955 is computed as follows:

Bond premium at date of acquisition..........................        $19
Number of months in 1955 during which bond is held by the               
 taxpayer....................................................          6
Number of months from date of acquisition to date of maturity        114
Amortizable bond premium (6/114 x $19) equals................          1
                                                                        


[[Page 169]]

    (ii) The bond premium as of the close of 1955 would be computed as 
follows:


Bond premium at date of acquisition (or first day of taxable            
 year).......................................................        $19
Amortizable bond premium for period during which bond was               
 owned in 1955...............................................          1
Bond premium as of the close of the taxable year 1955........         18
                                                                        

    (iii) If the bond in this example were issued with a call date not 
more than 3 years after issue date, the premium would also be amortized 
to maturity as indicated above because of the application of paragraph 
(a)(2) of this section.

    (4) For the method of amortization in the case of individual 
mortgages purchased, acquired, or originated at a premium by mutual 
savings banks, building and loan associations, and cooperative banks, 
see section 1016 and Sec. 1.1016-9.

Sec. 1.171-3   Election with respect to taxable and partially taxable bonds.

    (a) In general. In the case of a corporation, the election provided 
in section 171 may be made only with respect to fully taxable bonds. In 
the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, the election provided 
in such section may be made with respect to the following classes: (1) 
fully taxable bonds only, or (2) partially tax-exempt bonds only, or (3) 
both fully taxable bonds and partially tax-exempt bonds. Such election 
shall be made by the taxpayer by claiming a deduction for the bond 
premium in his return for the first taxable year to which he desires the 
election to be applicable. No other method of making such election will 
be recognized. If the election is so made, the taxpayer should attach to 
his return a statement showing the computation of the deduction. The 
election shall apply to all the bonds in respect of which it was made 
owned by the taxpayer at the beginning of the first taxable year to 
which the election applies and also to all the bonds of such class (or 
classes) thereafter acquired by him, and shall be binding for all 
subsequent taxable years. Upon application by the taxpayer, the 
Commissioner may permit him to revoke the election, subject to such 
conditions as the Commissioner deems necessary. In the case of bonds 
owned by a partnership, common trust fund, or foreign personal holding 
company, the election shall be exercisable by such partnership (as 
provided in section 703(b)), common trust fund, or foreign personal 
holding company.
    (b) Special rule for transition period. For taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, the election 
to deduct amortizable bond premium applies to premiums on both of the 
following types of bonds:
    (1) Those with interest coupons or in registered form, and
    (2) Those without interest coupons and not in registered form, 
including those commonly referred to as ``corporate mortgages.''

If a taxpayer claimed a deduction for amortizable bond premium in a 
return filed for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 
1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, to which the election under 
section 171 is applicable to the taxpayer, and such deduction did not 
include amortizable bond premiums for both types of bonds, described in 
subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph, held by the taxpayer during 
such taxable year, such election with respect to the deduction of 
amortizable bond premiums shall not constitute a valid election unless 
such election is perfected in accordance with this paragraph in an 
amended return for such taxable year filed not later than March 11, 
1958. Such amended return shall have attached thereto a statement 
showing a recomputation of the deduction, in accordance with the 
provisions of section 171 and this section, for amortizable bond premium 
on both such types of bonds. If such election is not perfected as 
provided in this paragraph, no deduction shall be allowed for 
amortization of premium on any bond to which the election is applicable, 
whether or not with interest coupons or in registered form. If a return 
has been filed for a subsequent taxable year, such return shall be 
conformed to the election made with respect to such first taxable year 
by filing an amended return for such subsequent taxable year, if 
necessary.
    (c) Partially tax-exempt bonds owned by estates, trusts, 
partnerships, etc. If a

[[Page 170]]

trust owning partially tax-exempt bonds elects to amortize the bond 
premium thereon under section 171, the credits of the trust and the 
credits and deductions of the beneficiaries on account of such interest 
are required to be reduced by the portion of the amortization deduction 
attributable to their shares of such interest. See section 642 (a)(1). A 
similar rule is applicable in the case of partially tax-exempt bonds 
owned by estates, common trust funds, partnerships, and foreign personal 
holding companies.


<R05>
Sec. 1.171-4   Definition.

    (a) The term bond, as used in section 171, means any bond, 
debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence of indebtedness, 
issued by any corporation and bearing interest (including any like 
obligation issued by a government or political subdivision thereof), but 
the term does not include any such obligation which constitutes stock in 
trade of the taxpayer or any such obligation of a kind which would 
properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the 
close of the taxable year, or any such obligation held by the taxpayer 
primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or 
business. This definition of a bond is applicable to bonds, whether or 
not with coupons or in registered form, held or acquired in taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 
1954.
    (b) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1954, or taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1953, but ending on or before August 
16, 1954, the term bond, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, 
applies only to a bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other 
evidence of indebtedness with interest coupons or in registered form.
    (c) Section 171 has no application to bonds held by dealers in 
securities other than bonds held by such dealers for investment pursuant 
to section 1236 and the regulations thereunder. See, however, Sec. 1.75-
1, relating to the treatment of bond premiums in case of dealers in tax-
exempt securities.


<R05>
Sec. 1.172-1  Net operating loss deduction.

    (a) Allowance of deduction. Section 172(a) allows as a deduction in 
computing taxable income for any taxable year subject to the Code the 
aggregate of the net operating loss carryovers and net operating loss 
carrybacks to such taxable year. This deduction is referred to as the 
net operating loss deduction. The net operating loss is the basis for 
the computation of the net operating loss carryovers and net operating 
loss carrybacks and ultimately for the net operating loss deduction 
itself. The net operating loss deduction shall not be disallowed for any 
taxable year merely because the taxpayer has no income from a trade or 
business for the taxable year.
    (b) Steps in computation of net operating loss deduction. The three 
steps to be taken in the ascertainment of the net operating loss 
deduction for any taxable year subject to the Code are as follows:
    (1) Compute the net operating loss for any preceding or succeeding 
taxable year from which a net operating loss may be carried over or 
carried back to such taxable year.
    (2) Compute the net operating loss carryovers to such taxable year 
from such preceding taxable years and the net operating loss carrybacks 
to such taxable year from such succeeding taxable years.
    (3) Add such net operating loss carryovers and carrybacks in order 
to determine the net operating loss deduction for such taxable year.
    (c) Statement with tax return. Every taxpayer claiming a net 
operating loss deduction for any taxable year shall file with his return 
for such year a concise statement setting forth the amount of the net 
operating loss deduction claimed and all material and pertinent facts 
relative thereto, including a detailed schedule showing the computation 
of the net operating loss deduction.
    (d) Ascertainment of deduction dependent upon net operating loss 
carryback. If the taxpayer is entitled in computing his net operating 
loss deduction to a carryback which he is not able to ascertain at the 
time his return is due, he shall compute the net operating loss 
deduction on his return without regard to such net operating loss 
carryback. When the taxpayer ascertains the net

[[Page 171]]

operating loss carryback, he may within the applicable period of 
limitations file a claim for credit or refund of the overpayment, if 
any, resulting from the failure to compute the net operating loss 
deduction for the taxable year with the inclusion of such carryback; or 
he may file an application under the provisions of section 6411 for a 
tentative carryback adjustment.
    (e) Law applicable to computations. (1) In determining the amount of 
any net operating loss carryback or carryover to any taxable year, the 
necessary computations involving any other taxable year shall be made 
under the law applicable to such other taxable year.
    (2) The net operating loss for any taxable year shall be determined 
under the law applicable to that year without regard to the year to 
which it is to be carried and in which, in effect, it is to be deducted 
as part of the net operating loss deduction.
    (3) The amount of the net operating loss deduction which shall be 
allowed for any taxable year shall be determined under the law 
applicable to that year.
    (f) Electing small business corporations. In determining the amount 
of the net operating loss deduction of any corporation, there shall be 
disregarded the net operating loss of such corporation for any taxable 
year for which such corporation was an electing small business 
corporation under subchapter S (section 1371 and following), chapter 1 
of the Code. In applying section 172(b)(1) and (2) to a net operating 
loss sustained in a taxable year in which the corporation was not an 
electing small business corporation, a taxable year in which the 
corporation was an electing small business corporation is counted as a 
taxable year to which such net operating loss is carried back or over. 
However, the taxable income for such year as determined under section 
172(b)(2) is treated as if it were zero for purposes of computing the 
balance of the loss available to the corporation as a carryback or 
carryover to other taxable years in which the corporation is not an 
electing small business corporation. See section 1374 and the 
regulations thereunder for allowance of a deduction to shareholders for 
a net operating loss sustained by an electing small business 
corporation.
    (g) Husband and wife. The net operating loss deduction of a husband 
and wife shall be determined in accordance with this section, but 
subject also to the provisions of Sec. 1.172-7.

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8107, 51 FR 
43345, Dec. 2, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1.172-2  Net operating loss in case of a corporation.

    (a) Modification of deductions. A net operating loss is sustained by 
a corporation in any taxable year if and to the extent that, for such 
year, there is an excess of deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Code 
over gross income computed thereunder. In determining the excess of 
deductions over gross income for such purpose--
    (1) Items not deductible. No deduction shall be allowed under--
    (i) Section 172 for the net operating loss deduction, and
    (ii) Section 922 in respect of Western Hemisphere trade 
corporations;
    (2) Dividends received. The 85-percent limitation provided by 
section 246(b) shall not apply to the deductions otherwise allowed 
under--
    (i) Section 243(a) in respect of dividends received from domestic 
corporations.
    (ii) Section 244 in respect of dividends received on preferred stock 
of public utilities, and
    (iii) Section 245 in respect of dividends received from foreign 
corporations; and
    (3) Dividends paid. The deduction granted by section 247 in respect 
of dividends paid on the preferred stock of public utilities shall be 
computed without regard to subsection (a)(1)(B) of Section 247.
    (b) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
paragraph (a):

    Example. For the calendar year 1981, the X corporation has a gross 
income of $400,000 and total deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Code 
of $375,000 exclusive of any net operating loss deduction and exclusive 
of any deduction for dividends received or paid. Corporation X in 1981 
received $100,000 of dividends entitled to the benefits of section

[[Page 172]]

243(a). These dividends are included in Corporation X's $400,000 gross 
income. Corporation X has no other deductions to which section 172(d) 
applies. On the basis of these facts, Corporation X has a net operating 
loss for the year 1981 of $60,000, computed as follows:

Deductions for 1981..........................................   $375,000
Plus: Deduction for dividends received, computed without                
 regard to the limitation provided in section 246(b) (85% of            
 $100,000)...................................................     85,000
                                                              ----------
      Total..................................................    460,000
Less: Gross income for 1981 (including $100,000 dividends)...    400,000
                                                              ----------
      Net operating loss for 1981............................     60,000
                                                                        

    (c) Qualified real estate investment trusts. For taxable years 
ending after October 4, 1976, the net operating loss of a qualified real 
estate investment trust (as defined in Sec. 1.172-10(b)) is computed by 
taking into account the adjustments described in section 857(b)(2) 
(other than the deduction for dividends paid, as defined in section 
561), as well as the modifications required by paragraph (a)(1) of this 
section. Thus, for example, the special deductions for dividends 
received, etc., provided in part VIII of subchapter B (other than 
section 248), as well as the net operating loss deduction under section 
172, are not allowed in computing the net operating loss of a qualified 
real estate investment trust.

[T.D. 8107, 51 FR 43345, Dec. 2, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1.172-3   Net operating loss in case of a taxpayer other than a corporation.

    (a) Modification of deductions. A net operating loss is sustained by 
a taxpayer other than a corporation in any taxable year if and to the 
extent that, for such year there is an excess of deductions allowed by 
chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code over gross income computed 
thereunder. In determining the excess of deductions over gross income 
for such purpose:
    (1) Items not deductible. No deduction shall be allowed under:
    (i) Section 151 for the personal exemptions or under any other 
section which grants a deduction in lieu of the deductions allowed by 
section 151,
    (ii) Section 172 for the net operating loss deduction, and
    (iii) Section 1202 in respect of the net long-term capital gain.
    (2) Capital losses. (i) The amount deductible on account of business 
capital losses shall not exceed the sum of the amount includible on 
account of business capital gains and that portion of nonbusiness 
capital gains which is computed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (ii) The amount deductible on account of nonbusiness capital losses 
shall not exceed the amount includible on account of nonbusiness capital 
gains.
    (3) Nonbusiness deductions--(i) Ordinary deductions. Ordinary 
nonbusiness deductions shall be taken into account without regard to the 
amount of business deductions and shall be allowed in full to the 
extent, but not in excess, of that amount which is the sum of the 
ordinary nonbusiness gross income and the excess of nonbusiness capital 
gains over nonbusiness capital losses. See paragraph (c) of this 
section. For purposes of section 172, nonbusiness deductions and income 
are those deductions and that income which are not attributable to, or 
derived from, a taxpayer's trade or business. Wages and salary 
constitute income attributable to the taxpayer's trade or business for 
such purposes.
    (ii) Sale of business property. Any gain or loss on the sale or 
other disposition of property which is used in the taxpayer's trade or 
business and which is of a character that is subject to the allowance 
for depreciation provided in section 167, or of real property used in 
the taxpayer's trade or business, shall be considered, for purposes of 
section 172(d)(4), as attributable to, or derived from, the taxpayer's 
trade or business. Such gains and losses are to be taken into account 
fully in computing a net operating loss without regard to the limitation 
on nonbusiness deductions. Thus, a farmer who sells at a loss land used 
in the business of farming may, in computing a net operating loss, 
include in full the deduction otherwise allowable with respect to such 
loss, without regard to the amount of his nonbusiness income and without 
regard to whether he is engaged in the trade or business of selling 
farms. Similarly, an

[[Page 173]]

individual who sells at a loss machinery which is used in his trade or 
business and which is of a character that is subject to the allowance 
for depreciation may, in computing the net operating loss, include in 
full the deduction otherwise allowable with respect to such loss.
    (iii) Casualty losses. Any deduction allowable under section 
165(c)(3) for losses of property not connected with a trade or business 
shall not be considered, for purposes of section 172(d)(4), to be a 
nonbusiness deduction but shall be treated as a deduction attributable 
to the taxpayer's trade or business.
    (iv) Self-employed retirement plans. Any deduction allowed under 
section 404, relating to contributions of an employer to an employees' 
trust or annuity plan, or under section 405(c), relating to 
contributions to a bond purchase plan, to the extent attributable to 
contributions made on behalf of an individual while he is an employee 
within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), shall not be treated, for 
purposes of section 172(d)(4), as attributable to, or derived from, the 
taxpayer's trade or business, but shall be treated as a nonbusiness 
deduction.
    (v) Limitation. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not be 
construed to permit the deduction of items disallowed by subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph.
    (b) Treatment of capital loss carryovers. Because of the distinction 
between business and nonbusiness capital gains and losses, a taxpayer 
who has a capital loss carryover from a preceding taxable year, 
includible by virtue of section 1212 among the capital losses for the 
taxable year in issue, is required to determine how much of such capital 
loss carryover is a business capital loss and how much is a nonbusiness 
capital loss. In order to make this determination, the taxpayer shall 
first ascertain what proportion of the net capital loss for such 
preceding taxable year was attributable to an excess of business capital 
losses over business capital gains for such year, and what proportion 
was attributable to an excess of nonbusiness capital losses over 
nonbusiness capital gains. The same proportion of the capital loss 
carryover from such preceding taxable year shall be treated as a 
business capital loss and a nonbusiness capital loss, respectively. In 
order to determine the composition (business--nonbusiness) of a net 
capital loss for a taxable year, for purposes of this paragraph, if such 
net capital loss is computed under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.1212-1 and 
takes into account a capital loss carryover from a preceding taxable 
year, the composition (business--nonbusiness) of the net capital loss 
for such preceding taxable year must also be determined. For purposes of 
this paragraph, the term capital loss carryover means the sum of the 
short-term and long-term capital loss carryovers from such year. This 
paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) A, an individual, has $5,000 ordinary taxable income 
(computed without regard to the deductions for personal exemptions) for 
the calendar year 1954 and also has the following capital gains and 
losses for such year: Business capital gains of $2,000; business capital 
losses of $3,200; nonbusiness capital gains of $1,000; and nonbusiness 
capital losses of $1,200.
    (ii) A's net capital loss for the taxable year 1954 is $400, 
computed as follows:

Capital losses...............................................     $4,400
Capital gains................................................      3,000
                                                              ----------
Excess of capital losses over capital gains..................      1,400
Less: $1,000 of such ordinary taxable income.................      1,000
                                                              ----------
    Net capital loss for 1954................................        400
                                                                        

    (iii) A's capital losses for 1954 exceeded his capital gains for 
such year by $1,400. Since A's business capital losses for 1954 exceeded 
his business capital gains for such year by $1,200, 6/7ths ($1,200/
$1,400) of A's net capital loss for 1954 is attributable to an excess of 
his business capital losses over his business capital gains for such 
year. Similarly, 1/7th of the net capital loss is attributable to the 
excess of nonbusiness capital losses over nonbusiness capital gains. 
Since the capital loss carryover for 1954 to 1955 is $400, 6/7ths of 
$400, or $342.86, shall be treated as a business capital loss in 1955; 
and 1/7th of $400, or $57.14, as a nonbusiness capital loss.
    Example 2. (i) A, an individual who is computing a net operating 
loss for the calendar year 1966, has a capital loss carryover from 1965 
of $8,000. In order to apply the provisions of this paragraph, A must 
determine what portion of the $8,000 carryover is attributable to the 
excess of business capital losses over business capital gains and what 
portion thereof is attributable to the excess of nonbusiness capital 
losses over nonbusiness capital gains. For 1965, A had $10,000 ordinary

[[Page 174]]

taxable income (computed without regard to the deductions for personal 
exemptions), and a short-term capital loss carryover of $6,000 from 
1964. In order to determine the composition (business--nonbusiness) of 
the $8,000 carryover from 1965, A first determines that of the $6,000 
carryover from 1964, $5,000 is a business capital loss and $1,000 is a 
nonbusiness capital loss. This must be done since, under paragraph (b) 
of Sec. 1.1212-1, the net capital loss for 1965 is computed by taking 
into account the capital loss carryover from 1964. A's capital gains and 
losses for 1965 are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           Carried over 
                                                  1965       from 1964  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Business capital gains........................    $2,000               0
Business capital losses.......................     3,000          $5,000
Nonbusiness capital gains.....................     4,000               0
Nonbusiness capital losses....................     6,000           1,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) A's net capital loss for the taxable year 1965 is $8,000, 
computed as follows:

Capital losses (including carryovers)........................    $15,000
Capital gains................................................      6,000
                                                              ----------
Excess of capital losses over capital gains..................      9,000
Less: $1,000 of such ordinary taxable income.................      1,000
                                                              ----------
    Net capital loss for 1965................................      8,000
                                                                        

    (iii) A's capital losses, including carryovers, for 1965 exceeded 
his capital gains for such year by $9,000. Since A's business capital 
losses for 1965 exceeded his business capital gains for such year by 
$6,000, 2/3rds ($6,000/$9,000) of A's net capital loss for 1965 is 
attributable to an excess of his business capital losses over his 
business capital gains for such year. Similarly, 1/3rd of the net 
capital loss is attributable to the excess of nonbusiness capital losses 
over nonbusiness capital gains. Since the total capital loss carryover 
from 1965 to 1966 is $8,000, 2/3rds of $8,000, or $5,333.33, shall be 
treated as a business capital loss in 1966; and 1/3rd of $8,000, or 
$2,666.67, as a nonbusiness capital loss.

    (c) Determination of portion of nonbusiness capital gains available 
for the deduction of business capital losses. In the computation of a 
net operating loss a taxpayer other than a corporation must use his 
nonbusiness capital gains for the deduction of his nonbusiness capital 
losses. Any amount not necessary for this purpose shall then be used for 
the deduction of any excess of ordinary nonbusiness deductions over 
ordinary nonbusiness gross income. The remainder, computed by applying 
the excess ordinary nonbusiness deductions against the excess 
nonbusiness capital gains, shall be treated as nonbusiness capital gains 
and used for the purpose of determining the deductibility of business 
capital losses under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. This principle 
may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. (1) A, an individual, has a total nonbusiness gross income 
of $20,500, computed as follows:

Ordinary gross income........................................     $7,500
Capital gains................................................     13,000
                                                   ------------         
    Total gross income.......................................     20,500
                                                                        

    (2) A also has total nonbusiness deductions of $16,000, computed as 
follows:

Ordinary deductions..........................................     $9,000
Capital loss.................................................      7,000
                                                              ----------
    Total deductions.........................................     16,000
                                                                        

    (3) The portion of nonbusiness capital gains to be used for the 
purpose of determining the deductibility of business capital losses is 
$4,500, computed as follows:

Nonbusiness capital gains....................................    $13,000
Less: Nonbusiness capital loss...............................      7,000
                                                   ------------         
Excess to be taken into account for purposes of paragraph               
 (a)(3)(i) of this section...................................     6,000 
Ordinary nonbusiness deductions...................     $9,000           
Less: Ordinary nonbusiness gross income...........      7,500           
                                                     --------      1,500
                                                              ----------
Portion of nonbusiness capital gains to be used for purposes            
 of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section......................      4,500
                                                                        

    (d) Joint net operating loss of husband and wife. In the case of a 
husband and wife, the joint net operating loss for any taxable year for 
which a joint return is filed is to be computed on the basis of the 
combined income and deductions of both spouses, and the modifications 
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section are to be computed as if the 
combined income and deductions of both spouses were the income and 
deductions of one individual.
    (e) Illustration of computation of net operating loss of a taxpayer 
other than a corporation--(1) Facts. For the calendar year 1954 A, an 
individual, has gross income of $483,000 and allowable deductions of 
$540,000. The latter amount does not include the net operating loss 
deduction or any deduction on account

[[Page 175]]

of the sale or exchange of capital assets. Included in gross income are 
business capital gains of $50,000 and ordinary nonbusiness income of 
$10,000. Included among the deductions are ordinary nonbusiness 
deductions of $12,000 and a deduction of $600 for his personal 
exemption. A has a business capital loss of $60,000 in 1954. A has no 
other items of income or deductions to which section 172(d) applies.
    (2) Computation. On the basis of these facts, A has a net operating 
loss for 1954 of $104,400, computed as follows:

Deductions for 1954 (as specified in first sentence of                  
 subparagraph (1))...........................................   $540,000
Plus: Amount of business capital loss ($60,000) to extent               
 such amount does not exceed business capital gains ($50,000)     50,000

 minus $10,000)...................................     $2,000           
Deduction for personal exemption..................        600           
                                                     --------     $2,600

Sec. 1.172-4  Net operating loss carrybacks and net operating loss carryovers.

    (a) General provisions--(1) Years to which loss may be carried--(i) 
In general. In order to compute the net operating loss deduction the 
taxpayer must first determine the part of any net operating losses for 
any preceding or succeeding taxable years which are carrybacks or 
carryovers to the taxable year in issue.
    (ii) General rule for carrybacks and carryovers. Except as provided 
in section 172 (b)(1)(C), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), (I), and (J), 
paragraphs (a)(1)(iii), (iv), (v), and (vi) of this section, and 
Sec. 1.172-10(a), a net operating loss shall be carried back to the 3 
preceding taxable years and carried over to the 15 succeeding taxable 
years (5 succeeding taxable years for a loss sustained in a taxable year 
ending before January 1, 1976).
    (iii) Loss of a regulated transportation corporation. Except as 
provided in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph and Sec. 1.172-10(a), 
a net operating loss sustained by a taxpayer which is a regulated 
transportation corporation (as defined in section 172(g)(1)) in a 
taxable year ending before January 1, 1976, shall, subject to the 
provisions of section 172(g) and Sec. 1.172-8, be carried back to the 
taxable years specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section and 
shall be carried over to the 7 succeeding taxable years.
    (iv) Loss attributable to foreign expropriation. If the provisions 
of section 172(b)(3)(A) and Sec. 1.172-9 are satisfied, the portion of a 
net operating loss attributable to a foreign expropriation loss (as 
defined in section 172(h)) shall not be a net operating loss carryback 
to any taxable year preceding the taxable year of such loss and shall be 
a net operating loss carryover to each of the 10 taxable years following 
the taxable year of such loss.
    (v) Loss of a financial institution. A net operating loss sustained 
in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1975, by a taxpayer to 
which section 585, 586, or 593 applies shall be carried back (except as 
provided in Sec. 1.172-10(a)) to the 10 preceding taxable years and 
shall be carried over to the 5 succeeding taxable years.
    (vi) Loss of a Bank for Cooperatives. A net operating loss sustained 
by a taxpayer which is a Bank for Cooperatives (organized and chartered 
pursuant to section 2 of the Farm Credit Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. 1134)) 
shall be carried back (except as provided in Sec. 1.172-10(a)) to the 10 
preceding taxable years and shall be carried over to the 5 succeeding 
taxable years.
    (2) Periods of less than 12 months. A fractional part of a year 
which is a taxable year under sections 441(b) and 7701(a)(23) is a 
preceding or a succeeding taxable year for the purpose of determining 
under section 172 the first, second, etc., preceding or succeeding 
taxable year.
    (3) Amount of loss to be carried. The amount which is carried back 
or carried over to any taxable year is the net operating loss to the 
extent it was not absorbed in the computation of the taxable (or net) 
income for other taxable years, preceding such taxable year, to which it 
may be carried back

[[Page 176]]

or carried over. For the purpose of determining the taxable (or net) 
income for any such preceding taxable year, the various net operating 
loss carryovers and carrybacks to such taxable year are considered to be 
applied in reduction of the taxable (or net) income in the order of the 
taxable years from which such losses are carried over or carried back, 
beginning with the loss for the earliest taxable year.
    (4) Husband and wife. The net operating loss carryovers and 
carrybacks of a husband and wife shall be determined in accordance with 
this section, but subject also to the provisions of Sec. 1.172-7.
    (5) Corporate acquisitions. For the computation of the net operating 
loss carryovers in the case of certain acquisitions of the assets of a 
corporation by another corporation, see section 381 and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (6) Special limitations. For special limitations on the net 
operating loss carryovers in certain cases of change in both the 
ownership and the trade or business of a corporation and in certain 
cases of corporate reorganization lacking specified continuity of 
ownership, see section 382 and the regulations thereunder.
    (7) Electing small business corporations. For special rule 
applicable to corporations which were electing small business 
corporations under Subchapter S (section 1361 and following), chapter 1 
of the Code, during one or more of the taxable years described in 
section 172 (b)(1), see paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.172-1.
    (b) Portion of net operating loss which is a carryback or a 
carryover to the taxable year in issue. (1) A net operating loss shall 
first be carried to the earliest of the several taxable years for which 
such loss is allowable as a carryback or a carryover, and shall then be 
carried to the next earliest of such several taxable years, etc. Except 
as provided in Sec. 1.172-9, the entire net operating loss shall be 
carried back to such earliest year.
    (2) The portion of the loss which shall be carried to any of such 
several taxable years subsequent to the earliest taxable year is the 
excess of such net operating loss over the sum of the taxable incomes 
(computed as provided in Sec. 1.172-5) for all of such several taxable 
years preceding such subsequent taxable year.
    (3) If a portion of the net operating loss for a taxable year is 
attributable to a foreign expropriation loss (as defined in section 
172(h)) and if an election under paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.172-9 is made 
with respect to such portion of the net operating loss, then see 
Sec. 1.172-9 for the separate treatment of such portion of the net 
operating loss.
    (c) Illustration. The principles of this section are illustrated in 
Sec. 1.172-6.

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8107, 51 FR 
43345, Dec. 2, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1.172-5   Taxable income which is subtracted from net operating loss to determine carryback or carryover.

    (a) Taxable year subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The 
taxable income for any taxable year subject to the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1954 which is subtracted from the net operating loss for any other 
taxable year to determine the portion of such net operating loss which 
is a carryback or a carryover to a particular taxable year is computed 
with the modifications prescribed in this paragraph. These modifications 
shall be made independently of, and without reference to, the 
modifications required by Secs. 1.172-2(a) and 1.172-3(a) for purposes 
of computing the net operating loss itself.
    (1) Modifications applicable to unincorporated taxpayers only. In 
the case of a taxpayer other than a corporation, in computing taxable 
income and adjusted gross income:
    (i) No deduction shall be allowed under section 151 for the personal 
exemptions (or under any other section which grants a deduction in lieu 
of the deductions allowed by section 151) and under section 1202 in 
respect of the net long-term capital gain.
    (ii) The amount deductible on account of losses from sales or 
exchanges of capital assets shall not exceed the amount includible on 
account of gains from sales or exchanges of capital assets.
    (2) Modifications applicable to all taxpayers. In the case either of 
a corporation or of a taxpayer other than a corporation:

[[Page 177]]

    (i) Net operating loss deduction. The net operating loss deduction 
for such taxable year shall be computed by taking into account only such 
net operating losses otherwise allowable as carrybacks or carryovers to 
such taxable year as were sustained in taxable years preceding the 
taxable year in which the taxpayer sustained the net operating loss from 
which the taxable income is to be deducted. Thus, for such purposes, the 
net operating loss for the loss year or any taxable year thereafter 
shall not be taken into account.

    Example. The taxpayer's income tax returns are made on the basis of 
the calendar year. In computing the net operating loss deduction for 
1954, the taxpayer has a carryover from 1952 of $9,000, a carryover from 
1953 of $6,000, a carryback from 1955 of $18,000, and a carryback from 
1956 of $10,000, or an aggregate of $43,000 in carryovers and 
carrybacks. Thus, the net operating loss deduction for 1954, for 
purposes of determining the tax liability for 1954, is $43,000. However, 
in computing the taxable income for 1954 which is subtracted from the 
net operating loss for 1955 for the purpose of determining the portion 
of such loss which may be carried over to subsequent taxable years, the 
net operating loss deduction for 1954 is $15,000, that is, the aggregate 
of the $9,000 carryover from 1952 and the $6,000 carryover from 1953. In 
computing the net operating loss deduction for such purpose, the $18,000 
carryback from 1955 and the $10,000 carryback from 1956 are disregarded. 
In computing the taxable income for 1954, however, which is subtracted 
from the net operating loss for 1956 for the purpose of determining the 
portion of such loss which may be carried over to subsequent taxable 
years, the net operating loss deduction for 1954 is $33,000, that is, 
the aggregate of the $9,000 carryover from 1952, the $6,000 carryover 
from 1953, and the $18,000 carryback from 1955. In computing the net 
operating loss deduction for such purpose, the $10,000 carryback from 
1956 is disregarded.

    (ii) Recomputation of percentage limitations. Unless otherwise 
specifically provided in this subchapter, any deduction which is limited 
in amount to a percentage of the taxpayer's taxable income or adjusted 
gross income shall be recomputed upon the basis of the taxable income or 
adjusted gross income, as the case may be, determined with the 
modifications prescribed in this paragraph. Thus, in the case of an 
individual the deduction for medical expenses would be recomputed after 
making all the modifications prescribed in this paragraph, whereas the 
deduction for charitable contributions would be determined without 
regard to any net operating loss carryback but with regard to any other 
modifications so prescribed. See, however, the regulations under 
paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.170-2 (relating to charitable contributions 
carryover of individuals) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.170-3 (relating to 
charitable contributions carryover of corporations) for special rules 
regarding charitable contributions in excess of the percentage 
limitations which may be treated as paid in succeeding taxable years.

    Example 1. For the calendar year 1954 the taxpayer, an individual, 
files a return showing taxable income of $4,800, computed as follows:

In 1955 the taxpayer undertakes the operation of a trade or business and 
sustains therein a net operating loss of $3,000. Under section 
172(b)(2), it is determined that the entire $3,000 is a carryback to 
1954. In 1956 he sustains a net operating loss of $10,000 in the 
operation of the business. In determining the amount of the carryover of 
the 1956 loss to 1957, the taxable income for 1954 as computed under 
this paragraph is $3,970, determined as follows:

Salary.......................................................     $5,000
Net long-term capital gain...................................      4,000

In 1960 the taxpayer undertakes the operation of a trade or business and 
sustains therein a net operating loss of $4,700. In 1961 he sustains a 
net operating loss of $10,000 in the operation of the business. Under 
section 172(b)(2), it is determined that the entire amount of each loss, 
$4,700 and $10,000, is a carryback to 1959. In determining the amount of 
the carryover of the 1961 loss to 1962, the taxable income for 1959 as 
computed under this paragraph is $3,870, determined as follows:

Salary.......................................................     $5,000
Net long-term capital gain...................................      4,000

    Taxable income...........................................      3,870
                                                                        

    (iii) Minimum limitation. The taxable income, as modified under this 
paragraph, shall in no case be considered less than zero.
    (3) Electing small business corporations. For special rule 
applicable to corporations which were electing small business 
corporations under Subchapter S (section 1361 and following), Chapter 1 
of the Code, during one or more of the taxable years described in 
section 172(b)(1), see paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.172-1.
    (4) Qualified real estate investment trust. Where a net operating 
loss is carried over to a qualified taxable year (as defined in 
Sec. 1.172-10(b)) ending after October 4, 1976, the real estate 
investment trust taxable income (as defined in section 857(b)(2)) shall 
be used as the ``taxable income'' for that taxable year to determine, 
under section 172(b)(2), the balance of the net operating loss available 
as a carryover to a subsequent taxable year. The real estate investment 
trust taxable income, however, is computed by applying the rules 
applicable to corporations in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Thus, in 
computing real estate investment trust taxable income for purposes of 
section 172(b)(2), the net operating loss deduction for the taxable year 
shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this 
section. The principles of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, is formed on 
January 1, 1977. X incurs a net operating loss of $100,000 for its 
taxable year 1977, which under section 172(b)(2), is a carryover to 
1978. For 1978 X is a qualified real estate investment trust (as defined 
in Sec. 1.172-10(b)) and has real estate investment trust taxable income 
(determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid or the 
net operating loss deduction) of $150,000, all of which consists of 
ordinary income. X pays dividends in 1978 totaling $120,000 that qualify 
for the deduction for dividends paid under section 857(b)(2)(B). The 
portion of the 1977 net operating loss available as a carryover to 1979 
and subsequent years is $70,000 (i.e., the excess of the amount of the 
net operating loss ($100,000) over the amount of the real estate 
investment trust taxable income for 1978 ($30,000), determined by taking 
into account the deduction for dividends paid allowable under section 
857(b)(2)(B) and without taking into account the net operating loss of 
1977).
    Example 2. (i) Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that 
the $150,000 of real estate investment trust taxable income (determined 
without the net operating loss deduction or the dividends paid 
deduction) consists of $80,000 of ordinary income and $70,000

[[Page 179]]

of net capital gain. The amount of capital gain dividends which may be 
paid for 1978 is limited to $50,000, that is, the amount of the real 
estate investment trust taxable income for 1978, determined by taking 
into account the net operating loss deduction for the taxable year, but 
not the deduction for dividends paid ($150,000 minus $100,000). See 
Sec. 1.857-6(e)(1)(ii).
    (ii) X designated $50,000 of the $120,000 of dividends paid as 
capital gains dividends (as defined in section 857(b)(3)(C) and 
Sec. 1.857-6(e)). Thus, $70,000 is an ordinary dividend. Since both 
ordinary dividends and capital gains dividends are taken into account in 
computing the deduction for dividends paid under section 857(b)(2)(B), 
the result will be the same as in Example (1); that is, the portion of 
the 1977 net operating loss available as a carryover to 1979 and 
subsequent years is $70,000.

Sec. 1.172-6   Illustration of net operating loss carrybacks and carryovers.

    The application of Sec. 1.172-4 may be illustrated by the following 
example:
    (a) Facts. The books of the taxpayer, whose return is made on the 
basis of the calendar year, reveal the following facts:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  Net

1957..............................................     20,000  .........
1958..............................................  .........  (150,000)

1962..............................................     17,000  .........
1963..............................................     53,000  .........
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The taxable income thus shown is computed without any net operating loss 
deduction. The assumption is also made that none of the other 
modifications prescribed in Sec. 1.172-5 apply. There are no net 
operating losses for 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1964, 1965, or 1966.
    (b) Loss sustained in 1956. The portions of the $75,000 net 
operating loss for 1956 which shall be used as carrybacks to 1954 and 
1955 and as carryovers to 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1961 are computed 
as follows:
    (1) Carryback to 1954. The carryback to this year is $75,000, that 
is, the amount of the net operating loss.
    (2) Carryback to 1955. The carryback to this year is $60,000, 
computed as follows:

Net operating loss...........................................    $75,000
Less:                                                                   
  Taxable income for 1954 (computed without the deduction of            
   the carryback from 1956)..................................     15,000

    Carryback................................................     60,000
                                                                        

    (3) Carryover to 1957. The carryover to this year is $30,000,

   deduction of the carryback from 1956)..........    $15,000           
  Taxable income for 1955 (computed without the                         
   deduction of the carryback from 1956 or the                          
   carryback from 1958)...........................     30,000

    (4) Carryover to 1958. The carryover to this year is $10,000, 
computed as follows:

Net operating loss................................  .........    $75,000
Less:

   carryback from 1958)...........................     30,000           
  Taxable income for 1957 (computed without the                         
   deduction of the carryover from 1956 or the                          
   carryback from 1958)...........................     20,000

    (5) Carryover to 1959. The carryover to this year is $10,000, 
computed as follows:

Net operating loss................................  .........    $75,000
Less:

Sec. 1.172-7   Joint return by husband and wife.

    (a) In general. This section prescribes additional rules for 
computing the net operating loss carrybacks and carryovers of a husband 
and wife making a joint return for one or more of the taxable years 
involved in the computation of the net operating loss deduction.
    (b) From separate to joint return. If a husband and wife, making a 
joint return for any taxable year, did not make a joint return for any 
of the taxable years involved in the computation of a net operating loss 
carryover or a net operating loss carryback to the taxable year for 
which the joint return is made, such separate net operating loss 
carryover or separate net operating loss carryback is a joint net 
operating loss carryover or joint net operating loss carryback to such 
taxable year.
    (c) Continuous use of joint return. If a husband and wife making a 
joint return for a taxable year made a joint return for each of the 
taxable years involved in the computation of a net operating loss 
carryover or net operating loss carryback to such taxable year, the 
joint net operating loss carryover or joint net operating loss carryback 
to such taxable year is computed in the same manner as the net operating 
loss carryover or net operating loss carryback of an individual under 
Sec. 1.172-4 but upon the basis of the joint net operating losses and 
the combined taxable income of both spouses.
    (d) From joint to separate return. If a husband and wife making 
separate returns for a taxable year made a joint return for any, or all, 
of the taxable years involved in the computation of a net operating loss 
carryover or net operating loss carryback to such taxable year, the 
separate net operating loss carryover or separate net operating loss 
carryback of each spouse to the taxable year is computed in the manner 
set forth in Sec. 1.172-4 but with the following modifications:
    (1) Net operating loss. The net operating loss of each spouse for a 
taxable year for which a joint return was made shall be deemed to be 
that portion of the joint net operating loss (computed in accordance 
with paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.172-3) which is attributable to the gross 
income and deductions of such spouse, gross income and deductions being 
taken into account to the same extent that they are taken into account 
in computing the joint net operating loss.
    (2) Taxable income to be subtracted--(i) Net operating loss of other 
spouse. The

[[Page 183]]

taxable income of a particular spouse for any taxable year which is 
subtracted from the net operating loss of such spouse for another 
taxable year in order to determine the amount of such loss which may be 
carried back or carried over to still another taxable year is deemed to 
be, in a case in which such taxable income was reported in a joint 
return, the sum of the following:
    (a) That portion of the combined taxable income of both spouses for 
such year for which the joint return was made which is attributable to 
the gross income and deductions of the particular spouse, gross income 
and deductions being taken into account to the same extent that they are 
taken into account in computing such combined taxable income, and
    (b) That portion of such combined taxable income which is 
attributable to the other spouse; but, if such other spouse sustained a 
net operating loss in a taxable year beginning on the same date as the 
taxable year in which the particular spouse sustained the net operating 
loss from which the taxable income is subtracted, then such portion 
shall first be reduced by such net operating loss of such other spouse.
    (ii) Modifications. For purposes of this subparagraph, the combined 
taxable income shall be computed as though the combined income and 
deductions of both spouses were those of one individual. The provisions 
of Sec. 1.172-5 shall apply in computing the combined taxable income for 
such purposes except that the net operating loss deduction shall be 
determined without taking into account any separate net operating loss 
of either spouse, or any joint net operating loss of both spouses, which 
was sustained in a taxable year beginning on or after the date of the 
beginning of the taxable year in which the particular spouse sustained 
the net operating loss from which the taxable income is subtracted.
    (e) Recurrent use of joint return. If a husband and wife making a 
joint return for any taxable year made a joint return for one or more, 
but not all, of the taxable years involved in the computation of a net 
operating loss carryover or net operating loss carryback to such taxable 
year, such net operating loss carryover or net operating loss carryback 
to the taxable year is computed in the manner set forth in paragraph (d) 
of this section. Such net operating loss carryover or net operating loss 
carryback is considered a joint net operating loss carryover or joint 
net operating loss carryback to such taxable year.
    (f) Joint carryovers and carrybacks. The joint net operating loss 
carryovers and the joint net operating loss carrybacks to any taxable 
year for which a joint return is made are all the net operating loss 
carryovers and net operating loss carrybacks of both spouses to such 
taxable year. For example, a husband and wife file a joint return for 
the calendar year 1956, having a joint taxable income for such year. The 
wife filed a separate return for the calendar years 1954 and 1955, in 
which years she sustained net operating losses. The husband filed 
separate returns for his fiscal year ending June 30, 1955, and, having 
received permission to change his accounting period to a calendar year 
basis, for the 6-month period ending December 31, 1955. The husband 
sustained net operating losses in both such taxable years. Since the 
husband and wife did not file a joint return for any taxable year 
involved in the computation of the net operating loss carryovers to 1956 
from 1954 and 1955, the joint net operating loss carryovers to 1956 are 
the separate net operating loss carryovers of the wife from the calendar 
years 1954 and 1955 and the separate net operating loss carryovers of 
the husband from the fiscal year ending June 30, 1955, and from the 
short taxable year ending December 31, 1955. If the husband and wife 
also file joint returns for the calendar years 1957, 1958, and 1959, 
having joint taxable income in 1957 and 1958 and a joint net operating 
loss in 1959, the joint net operating loss carrybacks to 1956, 1957, and 
1958 from 1959 are computed on the basis of the joint net operating loss 
for 1959, since separate returns were not made for any taxable year 
involved in the computation of such carrybacks.
    (g) Illustration of principles. In the following examples, which 
illustrate the application of this section, it is assumed that there are 
no items of adjustment under section 172(b)(2)(A) and

[[Page 184]]

that the taxable income or loss in each case is the taxable income or 
loss determined without any net operating loss deduction. The taxpayers 
in each example, H, a husband, and W, his wife, report their income on 
the calendar-year basis.

    Example 1. H and W filed joint returns for 1954 and 1955. They 
sustained a joint net operating loss of $1,000 for 1954 and a joint net 
operating loss of $2,000 for 1955. For 1954 the deductions of H exceeded 
his gross income by $700, and the deductions of W exceeded her gross 
income by $300, the total of such amounts being $1,000. Therefore, $700 
of the $1,000 joint net operating loss for 1954 is considered the net 
operating loss of H for 1954, and $300 of such joint net operating loss 
is considered the net operating loss of W for 1954. For 1955 the gross 
income of H exceeded his deductions, so that his separate taxable income 
would be $1,500, and the deductions of W exceeded her gross income by 
$3,500. Therefore, all of the $2,000 joint net operating loss for 1955 
is considered the separate net operating loss of W for 1955.
    Example 2. (i) H and W filed joint returns for 1954 and 1956, and 
separate returns for 1955 and 1957. For the years 1954, 1955, 1956, and 
1957 they had taxable incomes and net operating losses as follows, 
losses being indicated in parentheses:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    1954      1955      1956      1957  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
H...............................  ($5,000)  ($2,500)    $6,500  ($4,000)
W...............................   (3,000)     2,000     3,000   (1,500)
                                 ---------------------------------------
  Total.........................   (8,000)  ........     9,500  ........
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The net operating loss carryover of H from 1957 to 1958 is 
$4,000, that is, his $4,000 net operating loss for 1957 which is not 
reduced by any part of the taxable income for 1956, since none of such 
taxable income is attributable to H and the portion attributable to W is 
entirely offset by her separate net operating loss for her taxable year 
1957, which taxable year begins on the same date as H's taxable year 
1957. H's $4,000 net operating loss for 1957 likewise is not reduced by 
reference to 1955 since H sustained a loss in 1955. The $0 taxable 
income for 1956 which reduces H's net operating loss for 1957 is 
computed as follows:
    (iii) The combined taxable income of $9,500 for 1956 is reduced to 
$1,000 by the net operating loss deduction for such year of $8,500. This 
net operating loss deduction is computed without taking into account any 
net operating loss of either H or W sustained in a taxable year 
beginning on or after January 1, 1957, the date of the beginning of the 
taxable year in which H sustained the net operating loss from which the 
taxable income is subtracted. This $8,500 is composed of H's carryovers 
of $5,000 from 1954 and $2,500 from 1955, and of W's carryover of $1,000 
from 1954 (the excess of W's $3,000 loss for 1954 over her $2,000 income 
for 1955). None of the $1,000 combined taxable income for 1956 (computed 
with the net operating loss deduction described above) is attributable 
to H since it is caused by W's income (computed after deducting her 
separate carryover) offsetting H's loss (computed by deducting from his 
income his separate carryovers). No part of the $1,000 combined taxable 
income for 1956 which is attributable to W is used to reduce H's net 
operating loss for 1957 since such taxable income attributable to W must 
first be reduced by W's $1,500 net operating loss for 1957, her taxable 
year beginning on the same date as the taxable year of H in which he 
sustained the net operating loss from which the taxable income is 
subtracted.
    (iv) The net operating loss carryover of W from 1957 to 1958 is 
$500, her $1,500 loss reduced by the sum of her $0 taxable income for 
1955 (computed by taking into account her $3,000 carryover from 1954) 
and her $1,000 taxable income for 1956, that is, the portion of the 
combined taxable income for 1956 which is attributable to her.
    Example 3. (i) Assume the same facts as in Example (2) except that 
for 1957 the net operating loss of W is $200 instead of $1,500.
    (ii) The net operating loss carryover of H from 1957 to 1958 is 
$3,200, that is, his $4,000 net operating loss for 1957 reduced by the 
sum of his $0 taxable income for 1955 (a year in which he sustained a 
loss) and his $800 taxable income for 1956. Such $800 is computed as 
follows:
    (iii) The combined taxable income for 1956, computed with the net 
operating loss deduction in the manner described in Example (2), remains 
$1,000, no part of which is attributable to H. To the $0 taxable income 
attributable to H for 1956 there is added $800, the excess of the $1,000 
taxable income for such year attributable to W over her $200 net 
operating loss sustained in 1957, a taxable year beginning on the same 
date as the taxable year of H in which he sustained the $4,000 net 
operating loss from which the taxable income is subtracted.
    (iv) W has no net operating loss carryover from 1957 to 1958 since 
her net operating loss of $200 for 1957 does not exceed the $1,000 
taxable income for 1956 attributable to her.
    Example 4. (i) Assume the same facts as in Example (2), except that 
W changes her accounting period in 1957 to a fiscal year ending on 
January 31, and has neither income nor losses for the taxable year 
January 1, 1957, to January 31, 1957, or for the fiscal year February 1, 
1957, to January 31, 1958, but has a net operating loss of $200 for the 
fiscal year February 1, 1958, to January 31, 1959.
    (ii) The net operating loss carryover of H from 1957 to 1958 is 
$3,000, that is, his net operating loss of $4,000 for 1957 reduced by 
the

[[Page 185]]

sum of his $0 taxable income for 1955 (a year in which he sustained a 
loss) and his $1,000 taxable income for 1956. Such $1,000 is computed as 
follows:
    (iii) The combined taxable income for 1956, computed with the net 
operating loss deduction in the manner described in Example (2), remains 
$1,000, no part of which is attributable to H. To the $0 taxable income 
attributable to H for 1956 there is added the $1,000 taxable income 
attributable to W for such year. The taxable income attributable to W is 
not reduced by any amount since she does not have a net operating loss 
for her taxable year beginning on January 1, 1957, the date of the 
beginning of the taxable year of H in which he sustained the $4,000 net 
operating loss from which his taxable income is subtracted.
    (iv) The net operating loss carryover of W from the fiscal year 
beginning February 1, 1958, to her next fiscal year is $200, that is, 
her net operating loss of $200 for the fiscal year beginning February 1, 
1958, reduced by the sum of her $0 taxable income for 1956, her $0 
taxable income for the taxable year January 1, 1957, to January 31, 1957 
(a year in which she had neither income nor loss), and her $0 taxable 
income for the fiscal year February 1, 1957, to January 31, 1958 (also a 
year in which she had neither income nor loss). The $0 taxable income 
for 1956 is computed as follows:
    (v) The combined taxable income of $9,500 for 1956 is reduced to $0 
amount by the net operating loss deduction for such year of $12,500. 
This net operating loss deduction is computed by taking into account the 
net operating loss of H for 1957 since it was sustained in a taxable 
year beginning before February 1, 1958, the date of the beginning of the 
taxable year of W in which she sustained the $200 net operating loss 
from which her taxable income is subtracted. This $12,500 is composed of 
H's carryovers of $5,000 from 1954 and $2,500 from 1955 and of his 
carryback of $4,000 from 1957, plus W's carryover of $1,000 from 1954 
(the excess of W's $3,000 loss for 1954 over her $2,000 income for 
1955). Since there is no combined taxable income for 1956, there is no 
taxable income attributable to W for such year.

Sec. 1.172-8  Net operating loss carryovers for regulated transportation corporations.

    (a) In general. A net operating loss sustained in a taxable year 
ending before January 1, 1976, shall be a carryover to the 7 succeeding 
taxable years if the taxpayer is a regulated transportation corporation 
(as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) for the loss year and for 
the 6th and 7th succeeding taxable years. If, however, the taxpayer is a 
regulated transportation corporation for the loss year and for the 6th 
succeeding taxable year, but not for the 7th succeeding taxable year, 
then the loss shall be a carryover to the 6 succeeding taxable years. If 
the taxpayer is not a regulated transportation corporation for the 6th 
succeeding taxable year then this section shall not apply. A net 
operating loss sustained in a taxable year ending after December 31, 
1975, shall be a carryover to the 15 succeeding taxable years.
    (b) Regulated transportation corporations. A corporation is a 
regulated transportation corporation for a taxable year if it is 
included within one or more of the following categories:
    (1) Eighty percent or more of the corporation's gross income 
(computed without regard to dividends and capital gains and losses) for 
such taxable year is income from transportation sources described in 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (2) The corporation is a railroad corporation, subject to Part I of 
the Interstate Commerce Act, which is either a lessor railroad 
corporation described in section 7701(a)(33)(G) or a common parent 
railroad corporation described in section 7701(a)(33)(H).
    (3) The corporation is a member of a regulated transportation system 
for the taxable year. For purposes of this section, a member of a 
regulated transportation system for a taxable year means a member of an 
affiliated group of corporations making a consolidated return for such 
year, if 80 percent or more of the sum of the gross incomes of the 
members of the affiliated group for such year (computed without regard 
to dividends, capital gains and losses, or eliminations for intercompany 
transactions) is derived from transportation sources described in 
paragraph (c) of this section. For purposes of this subparagraph, income 
derived by a corporation described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph 
from leases described in section 7701(a)(33)(G) shall be considered as 
income from transportation sources described in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (c) Transportation sources. For purposes of this section, income 
from

[[Page 186]]

``transportation sources'' means income received directly in 
consideration for transportation services, and income from the 
furnishing or sale of essential facilities, products, and other services 
which are directly necessary and incidental to the furnishing of 
transportation services. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the 
term transportation services means:
    (1) Transportation by railroad as a common carrier subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission;
    (2)(i) Transportation, which is not included in subparagraph (1) of 
this paragraph:
    (a) On an intrastate, suburban, municipal, or interurban electric 
railroad,
    (b) On an intrastate, municipal, or suburban trackless trolley

    (b) The unregulated rates have been and are substantially as 
favorable to users and consumers as are the regulated rates,

of a net operating loss sustained by a regulated transportation 
corporation (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) to which an 
acquiring corporation succeeds under section 381(a) only if the

Sec. 1.172-9   Election with respect to portion of net operating loss attributable to foreign expropriation loss.

    (a) In general. If a taxpayer has a net operating loss for a taxable 
year ending after December 31, 1958, and if the foreign expropriation 
loss for such year (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) 
equals or exceeds 50 percent of the net operating loss for such year, 
then the taxpayer may elect (at the time and in the manner provided in 
paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, whichever is applicable) to 
have the provisions of this section apply. If the taxpayer so elects, 
the portion of the net operating loss for such taxable year attributable 
(under paragraph (b)(2) of this section) to such foreign expropriation 
loss shall not be a net operating loss carryback to any taxable year 
preceding the taxable year of such loss and shall be a net operating 
loss carryover to each of the ten taxable years following the taxable 
year of such loss. In such case, the portion, if any, of the net 
operating loss not attributable to a foreign expropriation loss shall be 
carried back or carried over as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
Sec. 1.172-4.
    (b) Determination of ``foreign expropriation loss''--(1) Definition 
of ``foreign expropriation loss''. The term foreign expropriation loss 
means, for any taxable year, the sum of the losses allowable as 
deductions under section 165 (other

[[Page 187]]

than losses from, or which under section 165(g) or 1231(a) are treated 
or considered as losses from, sales or exchanges of capital assets and 
other than losses described in section 165(i)(1)) sustained by reason of 
the expropriation, intervention, seizure, or similar taking of property 
by the government or any foreign country, any political subdivision 
thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of the foregoing. For purposes 
of the preceding sentence, a debt which becomes worthless in whole or in 
part, shall, to the extent of any deduction allowed under section 
166(a), be treated as a loss allowable as a deduction under section 165.
    (2) Portion of the net operating loss attributable to a foreign 
expropriation loss. (i) Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this 
subparagraph, the portion of the net operating loss for any taxable year 
attributable to a foreign expropriation loss is the amount of the 
foreign expropriation loss for such taxable year (determined under 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph).
    (ii) The portion of the net operating loss for a taxable year 
attributable to a foreign expropriation loss shall not exceed the amount 
of the net operating loss, computed under section 172(c), for such year.
    (3) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. M Corporation, a domestic calendar year corporation 
manufacturing cigars in the United States, owns, in country X, a tobacco 
plantation having an adjusted basis of $400,000 and farm equipment 
having an adjusted basis of $300,000. On January 15, 1961, country X 
expropriates the plantation and equipment without any allowance for 
compensation. For the taxable year 1961, M Corporation sustains a loss 
from the operation of its business (not including losses from the 
seizure of its plantation and equipment in country X) of $200,000, which 
loss would not have been sustained in the absence of the seizure. 
Accordingly, M has a net operating loss of $900,000 (the sum of 
$400,000, $300,000, and $200,000). For purposes of section 172(k)(1), M 
Corporation has a foreign expropriation loss for 1961 of $700,000 (the 
sum of $400,000 and $300,000, the losses directly sustained by reason of 
the seizure of its property by country X). Since the foreign 
expropriation loss for 1961, $700,000, equals or exceeds 50 percent of 
the net operating loss for such year, or $450,000 (i.e., 50 percent of 
$900,000), M Corporation may make the election under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section with respect to $700,000, the portion of the net operating 
loss attributable to the foreign expropriation loss.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that for 
1961, M Corporation has operating profits of $300,000 (not including 
losses from the seizure of its plantation and equipment in country X) so 
that its net operating loss (as defined in section 172(c)) is only 
$400,000. Under the provisions of section 172(k)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) 
of this section, the portion of the net operating loss for 1961 
attributable to a foreign expropriation loss is limited to $400,000, the 
amount of the net operating loss.

    (c) Time and manner of making election--(1) Taxable years ending 
after December 31, 1963. In the case of a taxpayer who has a foreign 
expropriation loss for a taxable year ending after December 31, 1963, 
the election referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made 
by attaching to the taxpayer's income tax return (filed within the time 
prescribed by law, including extensions of time) for the taxable year of 
such foreign expropriation loss a statement containing the information 
required by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Such election shall be 
irrevocable after the due date (including extensions of time) of such 
return.
    (2) Information required. The statement referred to in subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph shall contain the following information:
    (i) The name, address, and taxpayer account number of the taxpayer;
    (ii) A statement that the taxpayer elects under section 
172(b)(3)(A)(ii) or (iii), whichever is applicable, to have section 
172(b)(1)(D) of the Code apply;
    (iii) The amount of the net operating loss for the taxable year; and
    (iv) The amount of the foreign expropriation loss for the taxable 
year, including a schedule showing the computation of such foreign 
expropriation loss.
    (d) Amount of foreign expropriation loss which is a carryover to the 
taxable year in issue--(1) General. If a portion of a net operating loss 
for the taxable year is attributable to a foreign expropriation loss and 
if an election under paragraph (a) of this section has been made with 
respect to such portion of the net operating loss, then such portion 
shall

[[Page 188]]

be considered to be a separate net operating loss for such year, and, 
for the purpose of determining the amount of such separate loss which 
may be carried over to other taxable years, such portion shall be 
applied after the other portion (if any) of such net operating loss. 
Such separate loss shall be carried to the earliest of the several 
taxable years to which such separate loss is allowable as a carryover 
under the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Sec. 1.172-4, and the 
amount of such separate loss which shall be carried over to any taxable 
year subsequent to such earliest year is an amount (not exceeding such 
separate loss) equal to the excess of:
    (i) The sum of (a) such separate loss and (b) the other portion (if 
any) of the net operating loss (i.e., that portion not attributable to a 
foreign expropriation loss) to the extent such other portion is a 
carryover to such earliest taxable year, over
    (ii) The sum of the aggregate of the taxable incomes (computed as 
provided in Sec. 1.172-5) for all of such several taxable years 
preceding such subsequent taxable year.
    (2) Cross reference. The portion of a net operating loss which is 
not attributable to a foreign expropriation loss shall be carried back 
or carried over, in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph 
(b)(1) of Sec. 1.172-4, as if such portion were the only net operating 
loss for such year.
    (3) Examples. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation A, organized in 1960 and whose return is made 
on the basis of the calendar year, incurs for 1960 a net operating loss 
of $10,000, of which $7,500 is attributable to a foreign expropriation 
loss. With respect to such $7,500, A makes the election described in 
paragraph (a) of this section. In each of the years 1961, 1962, 1963, 
1964, and 1965, A has taxable income in the amount of $600 (computed 
without any net operating loss deduction). The assumption is made that 
none of the other modifications prescribed in Sec. 1.172-5 apply. The 
portion of the net operating loss attributable to the foreign 
expropriation loss which is a carryover to the year 1966 is $7,000, 
which is the sum of $7,500 (the portion of the net operating loss 
attributable to the foreign expropriation loss) and $2,500 (the other 
portion of the net operating loss available as a carryover to 1961), 
minus $3,000 (the aggregate of the taxable incomes for taxable years 
1961 through 1965).
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that 
taxable income for each of the years 1961 through 1965 is $400 (computed 
without any net operating loss deduction). The carryover to the year 
1966 is $7,500, that is, the sum of $7,500 (the portion of the net 
operating loss attributable to the foreign expropriation loss) and 
$2,500 (the other portion of the net operating loss available as a 
carryover to 1961), minus $2,000 (the aggregate of the taxable incomes 
for taxable years 1961 through 1965), but limited to $7,500 (the portion 
of the net operating loss attributable to the foreign expropriation 
loss).

    (e) Taxable income which is subtracted from net operating loss to 
determine carryback or carryover. In computing taxable income for a 
taxable year (hereinafter called a ``prior taxable year'') for the 
purpose of determining the portion of a net operating loss for another 
taxable year which shall be carried to each of the several taxable years 
subsequent to the earliest taxable year to which such loss may be 
carried, the net operating loss deduction for any such prior taxable 
year shall be determined without regard to that portion, if any, of a 
net operating loss for a taxable year attributable to a foreign 
expropriation loss, if such portion may not, under the provisions of 
section 172(b)(1)(D) and paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Sec. 1.172-4, be 
carried back to such prior taxable year. Thus, if the taxpayer has a 
foreign expropriation loss for 1962 and elects the 10-year carryover 
with respect to the portion of his net operating loss for 1962 
attributable to the foreign expropriation loss, then in computing 
taxable income for the year 1960 for the purpose of determining the 
portion of a net operating loss for 1963 which is carried to years 
subsequent to 1960, the net operating loss deduction for 1960 is 
determined without regard to the portion of the net operating loss for 
1962 attributable to the foreign expropriation loss, since under the 
provisions of section 172(b)(1)(D) and paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of 
Sec. 1.172-4 such portion of the net operating loss for 1962 may not be 
carried back to 1960.

Sec. 1.172-10  Net operating losses of real estate investment trusts.

    (a) Taxable years to which a loss may be carried. (1) A net 
operating loss sustained by a qualified real estate investment trust (as 
defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) in a qualified taxable year 
(as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) ending after October 4, 
1976, shall not be carried back to a preceding taxable year.
    (2) A net operating loss sustained by a qualified real estate 
investment trust in a qualified taxable year ending before October 5, 
1976, shall be carried back to the 3 preceding taxable years. However, 
see Sec. 1.857-2(a)(5), which does not allow the net operating loss 
deduction in computing real estate investment trust taxable income for 
taxable years ending before October 5, 1976.
    (3) A net operating loss sustained by a qualified real estate 
investment trust in a qualified taxable year ending after December 31, 
1972, shall be carried over to the 15 succeeding taxable years. However, 
see Sec. 1.857-2(a)(5).
    (4) A net operating loss sustained by a qualified real estate 
investment trust in a qualified taxable year ending before January 1, 
1973, shall be carried over to 8 succeeding taxable years. However, see 
Sec. 1.857-2(a)(5).
    (5) A net operating loss sustained in a taxable year for which the 
taxpayer is not a qualified real estate investment trust generally may 
be carried back to the 3 preceding taxable years; however, a net 
operating loss sustained in a taxable year ending after December 31, 
1975, shall not be carried back to any qualified taxable year. However, 
see Sec. 1.857-2(a)(5), with respect to a net operating loss sustained 
in a taxable year ending before January 1, 1976.
    (6) A net operating loss sustained in a taxable year ending after 
December 31, 1975, for which the taxpayer is not a qualified real estate 
investment trust generally may be carried over to the 15 succeeding 
taxable years.
    (7)(i) A net operating loss sustained in a taxable year ending 
before January 1, 1986, for which the taxpayer is not a qualified real 
estate investment trust generally may be a net operating loss carryover 
to each of the 5 succeeding taxable years. However, where the loss was a 
net operating loss carryback to one or more qualified taxable years, the 
net operating loss, in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this 
section shall be--
    (A) Carried over to the 15 succeeding taxable years if the loss 
could be a net operating loss carryover to a taxable year ending in 
1981, or
    (B) Carried over to the 5, 6, 7, or 8 succeeding taxable years if 
paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this section does not apply.
    (ii) For purposes of determining whether a net operating loss could 
be a carryover to a taxable year ending in 1981 under paragraph 
(a)(7)(i)(A) of this section or, where paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this 
section does not apply, to determine the actual carryover period under 
paragraph (a)(7)(i)(B) of this section, the net operating loss shall 
have a carryover period of 5 years, and such period shall be increased 
(to a number not greater than 8) by the number of qualified taxable 
years to which such loss was a net operating loss carryback; however, 
where the taxpayer acted so as to cause itself to cease to be a 
qualified real estate investment trust and the principal purpose for 
such action was to secure the benefit of the allowance of a net 
operating loss carryover under section 172(b)(1)(B), the net operating 
loss carryover period shall be limited to 5 years. However, see 
Sec. 1.857-2(a)(5).
    (8) A qualified taxable year is a taxable year preceding or 
following the taxable year of the net operating loss, for purposes of 
section 172(b)(1), even though the loss may not be carried to, or 
allowed as a deduction in, such qualified taxable year. Thus, a 
qualified taxable year ending before October 5, 1976 (for which no net 
operating loss deduction is allowable) is nevertheless a preceding or 
following taxable year for purposes of section 172(b)(1). Moreover, a 
qualified taxable year ending after October 4, 1976 (to which a net 
operating loss cannot be carried back because of section 172(b)(1)(E)) 
is nevertheless a preceding taxable year for purposes of section 
172(b)(1). For purposes of determining, under section 172(b)(2), the 
balance of the loss available as a carryback or carryover to other 
taxable years, however, the net

[[Page 190]]

operating loss is not reduced on account of such qualified taxable year 
being a preceding or following taxable year.
    (b) Definitions. For purposes of this section and Secs. 1.172-2 and 
1.172-5:
    (1) The term qualified real estate investment trust means, with 
respect to any taxable year, a real estate investment trust within the 
meaning of part II of subchapter M which is taxable for such year under 
that part as a real estate investment trust, and
    (2) The term qualified taxable year means a taxable year for which 
the taxpayer is a qualified real estate investment trust.
    (c) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1--(i) Facts. X was a qualified real estate investment trust 
for the taxable years ending on December 31, 1972, and December 31, 
1973. X was not a qualified real estate investment trust for the taxable 
years ending on December 31, 1971, and December 31, 1974. X sustained a 
net operating loss for the taxable year ending on December 31, 1974.
    (ii) Applicable carryback and carryover periods. The net operating 
loss must be carried back to the 3 preceding taxable years. Under 
Sec. 1.857-2 (a)(5) the net operating loss deduction shall not be 
allowed in computing real estate investment trust taxable income for the 
years ending December 31, 1972, and December 31, 1973. Where a net 
operating loss is sustained in a taxable year ending before January 1, 
1976, for which the taxpayer is not a qualified real estate investment 
trust and the loss is a net operating loss carryback to one or more 
qualified taxable years, the carryover period is determined under 
Sec. 1.172-10 (a)(7); the carryover period is determined by first 
applying the rule provided in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section to 
obtain the carryover period for purposes of determining whether the net 
operating loss could have been a net operating loss carryover to a 
taxable year ending in 1981. Under these facts, paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of 
this section provides for a 7-year carryover period (5 years increased 
by the 2 qualified taxable years to which the loss was a net operating 
loss carryback); therefore, since the carryover period provided for by 
paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section would allow the net operating loss 
to be a net operating loss carryover to a taxable year ending in 1981, 
under paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section the applicable carryover 
period is 15 years (provided that X did not act so as to cause itself to 
cease to qualify as a real estate investment trust for the principal 
purpose of securing the benefit of a net operating loss carryover under 
section 172 (b)(1)(B)).
    Example 2--(i) Facts. The facts are the same as in example (1) 
except that the taxable year ending December 31, 1973, was not a 
qualified taxable year for X.
    (ii) Applicable carryback and carryover periods. The net operating 
loss must be carried back to the 3 preceding taxable years. Section 
1.857-2 (a)(5) provides that the net operating loss deduction shall not 
be allowed in computing real estate investment trust taxable income for 
the year ending December 31, 1972. Under these facts the carryover 
period is determined under Sec. 1.172-10 (a)(7). Paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of 
this section provides for a 6 year carryover period (5 years increased 
by the 1 qualified taxable year to which the loss was a net operating 
loss carryback); therefore, since a 6 year carryover period would not 
allow the net operating loss to be a net operating loss carryover to a 
taxable year ending in 1981, paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this section does 
not apply. Where the rule stated in paragraph (a)(7)(i)(A) of this 
section does not apply, paragraph (a)(7)(i)(B) of this section provides 
that the applicable carryover period is the carryover period determined 
under paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section, which, in this case, is 6 
years (provided that the principal purpose for X acting so as to cause 
itself to cease to qualify as a real estate investment trust was not to 
secure the benefit of the allowance of a net operating loss carryover 
under section 172 (b)(1)(B)).
    (d) Cross references. See Secs. 1.172-2(c) and 1.172-5(a)(5) for the 
computation of the net operating loss of a qualified real estate 
investment trust for a taxable year ending after October 4, 1976, and 
the amount of a net operating loss which is absorbed when carried over 
to a qualified taxable year ending after October 4, 1976. See 
Sec. 1.857-2(a)(5), which provides that for a taxable year ending before 
October 5, 1976, the net operating loss deduction is not allowed in 
computing the real estate investment trust taxable income of a qualified 
real estate investment trust.

Sec. 1.172-13  Product liability losses.

    (a) Entitlement to 10-year carryback--(1) In general. Unless an 
election is made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, in the case 
of a taxpayer which has a product liability loss (as defined in section 
172(j) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section) for a taxable year 
beginning after September 30, 1979 (hereinafter ``loss year''), the 
product liability

[[Page 191]]

loss shall be a net operating loss carryback to each of the 10 taxable 
years preceding the loss year.
    (2) Years to which loss may be carried. A product liability loss 
shall first be carried to the earliest of the taxable years to which 
such loss is allowable as a carryback and shall then be carried to the 
next earliest of such taxable years, etc.
    (3) Example. The application of this paragraph may be illustrated as 
follows:
    Example. Taxpayer A incurs a net operating loss for taxable year 
1980 of $80,000, of which $60,000 is a product liability loss. A's 
taxable income for each of the 10 years immediately preceding taxable 
year 1980 was $5,000. The product liability loss of $60,000 is first 
carried back to the 10th through the 4th preceding taxable years ($5,000 
per year), thus offsetting $35,000 of the loss. The remaining $25,000 of 
product liability loss is added to the remaining portion of the total 
net operating loss for taxable year 1980 which was not a product 
liability loss ($20,000), and the total is then carried back to the 3rd 
through 1st years preceding taxable year 1980, which offsets $15,000 of 
this loss. The remaining loss ($30,000) is carried forward pursuant to 
section 172(b)(1) and the regulations thereunder without regard to 
whether all or any portion thereof originated as a product liability 
loss.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Product liability loss. The term product 
liability loss means, for any taxable year, the lesser of--
    (i) The net operating loss for the current taxable year (not 
including the portion of such net operating loss attributable to foreign 
expropriation losses, as defined in Sec. 1.172-11), or
    (ii) The total of the amounts allowable as deductions under sections 
162 and 165 directly attributable to--
    (A) Product liability (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section), and
    (B) Expenses (including settlement payments) incurred in connection 
with the investigation or settlement of or opposition to claims against 
the taxpayer on account of alleged product liability.

Indirect corporate expense, or overhead, is not to be allocated to 
product liability claims so as to become a product liability loss.
    (2) Product liability. (i) The term product liability means the 
liability of a taxpayer for damages resulting from physical injury or 
emotional harm to individuals, or damage to or loss of the use of 
property, on account of any defect in any product which is manufactured, 
leased, or sold by the taxpayer. The preceding sentence applies only to 
the extent that the injury, harm, or damage occurs after the taxpayer 
has completed or terminated operations with respect to the product, 
including, but not limited to the manufacture, installation, delivery, 
or testing of the product, and has relinquished possession of such 
product.
    (ii) The term product liability does not include liabilities arising 
under warranty theories relating to repair or replacement of the 
property that are essentially contract liabilities. For example, the 
costs incurred by a taxpayer in repairing or replacing defective 
products under the terms of a warranty, express or implied, are not 
product liability losses. On the other hand, the taxpayer's liability 
for damage done to other property or for harm done to persons that is 
attributable to a defective product may be product liability losses 
regardless of whether the claim sounds in tort or contract. Further, 
liability incurred as a result of services performed by a taxpayer is 
not product liability. For purposes of the preceding sentence, where 
both a product and services are integral parts of a transaction, product 
liability does not arise until all operations with respect to the 
product are completed and the taxpayer has relinquished possession of 
it. On the other hand, any liability that arises after completion of the 
initial delivery, installation, servicing, testing, etc., is considered 
``product liability'' even if such liability arises during the 
subsequent servicing of the product pursuant to a service agreement or 
otherwise.
    (iii) Liability for injury, harm, or damage due to a defective 
product as described in this subparagraph shall be ``product liability'' 
notwithstanding that the liability is not considered product liability 
under the law of the State in which such liability arose.
    (iv) Amounts paid for insurance against product liability risks are 
not paid on account of product liability.
    (v) Notwithstanding subparagraph (iv), an amount is paid on account 
of

[[Page 192]]

product liability (even if such amount is paid to an insurance company) 
if the amount satisifies the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) (i) through 
(iii) of this section and the amount--
    (A) Is paid on account of specific claims against the taxpayer (or 
on account of expenses incurred in connection with the investigation or 
settlement of or opposition to such claims), subsequent to the events 
giving rise to the claims and pursuant to a contract entered into before 
those events,
    (B) Is not refundable, and
    (C) Is not applicable to other claims, other expenses or to 
subsequent coverage.
    (3) Examples. Paragraph (b)(2) of this section is illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. X, a manufacturer of heating equipment, sells a boiler to 
A, a homeowner. Subsequent to the sale and installation of the boiler, 
the boiler explodes due to a defect causing physical injury to A. A sues 
X for damages for the injuries sustained in the explosion and is awarded 
$250,000, which X pays. The payment was made on account of product 
liability.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) and that A also 
sues under the contract with X to recover for the cost of the boiler and 
recovers $1,000, the boiler's replacement cost. The $1,000 payment is 
not a payment on account of product liability. Similarly, if X agrees to 
repair the destroyed boiler, any amount expended by X for such repair is 
not payment made on account of product liability.
    Example 3. Y, a professional medical association, is sued by B, a 
patient, in an action based on the malpractice of one of its doctors. B 
recovers $25,000. Because the suit was based on the services of B, the 
payment is not made on account of product liability.
    Example 4. R, a retailer of communications equipment, sells a 
telecommunication device to C. R also contracts with C to service the 
equipment for 3 years. While R is installing the equipment, the unit 
catches on fire due to faulty wiring within the unit and destroys C's 
office. Because R had not relinquished possession of this equipment when 
the fire started, any amount paid to C by R for the damage to C's 
property on account of the defective product is not payment on account 
of product liability.
    Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example (4) except that the 
fire and resulting property damages occurred after R had installed the 
equipment and relinquished possession of it. Any amount paid for the 
property damages sustained on account of the defective product is 
payment on account of product liability.
    Example 6. Assume the same facts as in Example (4) except that the 
equipment catches on fire during the subsequent servicing of the unit. 
Because C is in possession of the unit during the servicing, any amount 
paid for the property damage sustained on account of the defective 
product would be payment on account of product liability.
    Example 7. X, a manufacturer of computers, sells a computer to A. X 
also has its employees periodically service the computer for A from time 
to time after it is placed in service. After the initial delivery, 
installation, servicing, and testing of the computer is completed, the 
computer catches on fire while X's employee is servicing the equipment. 
This fire causes property damage to A's office and physical injury to A. 
Any amount paid for the property or physical damage sustained on account 
of the defective product is payment on account of product liability.

    (c) Election--(1) In general. The 10-year carryback provision of 
this section applies, except as provided in this paragraph, to any 
taxpayer who, for a taxable year beginning after September 30, 1979, 
incurs a product liability loss. Any taxpayer entitled to a 10-year 
carryback under paragraph (a) of this section in any loss year may elect 
(at the time and in the manner provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section) to have the carryback period with respect to the product 
liability loss determined without regard to the carryback rules provided 
by paragraph (a) of this section. If the taxpayer so elects, the product 
liability loss shall not be carried back to the 10th through the 4th 
taxable years preceding the loss year. In such case, the product 
liability loss shall be carried back or carried over as provided by 
section 172(b) (except subparagraph (1)(I) thereof) and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (2) Time and manner of making election. An election by any taxpayer 
entitled to the 10-year carryback for the product liability loss to have 
the carryback with respect to such loss determined without regard to the 
10-year carryback provision of paragraph (a) of this section must be 
made by attaching to the taxpayer's tax return (filed

[[Page 193]]

within the time prescribed by law, including extensions of time) for the 
taxable year in which such product liability loss is sustained, a 
statement containing the information required by paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section. Such election, once made for any taxable year, shall be 
irrevocable after the due date (including extensions of time) of the 
taxpayer's tax return for that taxable year.
    (3) Information required. In the case of a statement filed after 
April 25, 1983, the statement referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section shall contain the following information:
    (i) The name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of the 
taxpayer; and
    (ii) A statement that the taxpayer elects under section 172(j)(3) 
not to have section 172(b)(1)(I) apply.
    (4) Relationship with section 172(b)(3)(C) election. If a taxpayer 
sustains during the taxable year both a net operating loss not 
attributable to product liability and a product liability loss (as 
defined in section 172(j)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section), an 
election pursuant to section 172(b)(3)(C) (relating to election to 
relinquish the entire carryback period) does not preclude the product 
liability loss from being carried back 10 years under section 
172(b)(1)(I) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

Sec. 1.173-1   Circulation expenditures.

    (a) Allowance of deduction. Section 173 provides for the deduction 
from gross income of all expenditures to establish, maintain, or 
increase the circulation of a newspaper, magazine, or other periodical, 
subject to the following limitations:
    (1) No deduction shall be allowed for expenditures for the purchase 
of land or depreciable property or for the acquisition of circulation 
through the purchase of any part of the business of another publisher of 
a newspaper, magazine, or other periodical;
    (2) The deduction shall be allowed only to the publisher making the 
circulation expenditures; and
    (3) The deduction shall be allowed only for the taxable year in 
which such expenditures are paid or incurred.

Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, the 
deduction permitted under section 173 and this paragraph shall be 
allowed without regard to the method of accounting used by the taxpayer 
and notwithstanding the provisions of section 263 and the regulations 
thereunder, relating to capital expenditures.
    (b) Deferred expenditures. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, expenditures paid or incurred in a 
taxable year subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 which are 
deferrable pursuant to I.T. 3369 (C.B. 1940-1, 46), as modified by Rev. 
Rul. 57-87 (C.B. 1957-1, 507) may be deducted in the taxable year 
subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to which so deferred.
    (c) Election to capitalize. (1) A taxpayer entitled to the deduction 
for circulation expenditures provided in section 173 and paragraph (a) 
of this section may, in lieu of taking such deduction, elect to 
capitalize the portion of such circulation expenditures which is 
properly chargeable to capital account. As a general rule, expenditures 
normally made from year to year in an effort to maintain circulation are 
not properly chargeable to capital account; conversely, expenditures 
made in an effort to establish or to increase circulation are properly 
chargeable to capital account. For example, if a newspaper normally 
employs five persons to obtain renewals of subscriptions by telephone, 
the expenditures in connection therewith would not be properly 
chargeable to capital account. However, if such newspaper, in a special 
effort to increase its circulation, hires for a limited period 20 
additional employees to obtain new subscriptions by means of telephone 
calls to the general public, the expenditures in connection therewith 
would be properly chargeable to capital account. If an election is made 
by a taxpayer to treat any portion of his circulation expenditures as 
chargeable to capital account, the election must apply to all such 
expenditures which are properly so chargeable. In such case, no 
deduction shall be allowed under section 173 for any such expenditures. 
In particular cases, the extent to which any deductions attributable to 
the amortization of capital

[[Page 194]]

expenditures are allowed may be determined under sections 162, 263, and 
461.
    (2) A taxpayer may make the election referred to in subparagraph (1) 
of this paragraph by attaching a statement to his return for the first 
taxable year to which the election is applicable. Once an election is 
made, the taxpayer must continue in subsequent taxable years to charge 
to capital account all circulation expenditures properly so chargeable, 
unless the Commissioner, on application made to him in writing by the 
taxpayer, permits a revocation of such election for any subsequent 
taxable year or years. Permission to revoke such election may be granted 
subject to such conditions as the Commissioner deems necessary.
    (3) Elections filed under section 23(bb) of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1939 shall be given the same effect as if they were filed under 
section 173. (See section 7807(b)(2).)


<R05>
Sec. 1.174-1   Research and experimental expenditures; in general.

    Section 174 provides two methods for treating research or 
experimental expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection 
with his trade or business. These expenditures may be treated as 
expenses not chargeable to capital account and deducted in the year in 
which they are paid or incurred (see Sec. 1.174-3), or they may be 
deferred and amortized (see Sec. 1.174-4). Research or experimental 
expenditures which are neither treated as expenses nor deferred and 
amortized under section 174 must be charged to capital account. The 
expenditures to which section 174 applies may relate either to a general 
research program or to a particular project. See Sec. 1.174-2 for the 
definition of research and experimental expenditures. The term paid or 
incurred, as used in section 174 and in Secs. 1.174-1 to 1.174-4, 
inclusive, is to be construed according to the method of accounting used 
by the taxpayer in computing taxable income. See section 7701(a)(25).


<R05>
Sec. 1.174-2   Definition of research and experimental expenditures.

    (a) In general. (1) The term research or experimental expenditures, 
as used in section 174, means expenditures incurred in connection with 
the taxpayer's trade or business which represent research and 
development costs in the experimental or laboratory sense. The term 
generally includes all such costs incident to the development or 
improvement of a product. The term includes the costs of obtaining a 
patent, such as attorneys' fees expended in making and perfecting a 
patent application. Expenditures represent research and development 
costs in the experimental or laboratory sense if they are for activities 
intended to discover information that would eliminate uncertainty 
concerning the development or improvement of a product. Uncertainty 
exists if the information available to the taxpayer does not establish 
the capability or method for developing or improving the product or the 
appropriate design of the product. Whether expenditures qualify as 
research or experimental expenditures depends on the nature of the 
activity to which the expenditures relate, not the nature of the product 
or improvement being developed or the level of technological advancement 
the product or improvement represents.
    (2) For purposes of this section, the term product includes any 
pilot model, process, formula, invention, technique, patent, or similar 
property, and includes products to be used by the taxpayer in its trade 
or business as well as products to be held for sale, lease, or license.
    (3) The term research or experimental expenditures does not include 
expenditures for--
    (i) The ordinary testing or inspection of materials or products for 
quality control (quality control testing);
    (ii) Efficiency surveys;
    (iii) Management studies;
    (iv) Consumer surveys;
    (v) Advertising or promotions;
    (vi) The acquisition of another's patent, model, production or 
process; or
    (vii) Research in connection with literary, historical, or similar 
projects.
    (4) For purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, testing or 
inspection to determine whether particular units of materials or 
products conform to specified parameters is quality control testing. 
However, quality control testing does not include testing to determine 
if

[[Page 195]]

the design of the product is appropriate.
    (5) See section 263A and the regulations thereunder for cost 
capitalization rules which apply to expenditures paid or incurred for 
research in connection with literary, historical, or similar projects 
involving the production of property, including the production of films, 
sound recordings, video tapes, books, or similar properties.
    (6) Section 174 applies to a research or experimental expenditure 
only to the extent that the amount of the expenditure is reasonable 
under the circumstances. In general, the amount of an expenditure for 
research or experimental activities is reasonable if the amount would 
ordinarily be paid for like activities by like enterprises under like 
circumstances. Amounts supposedly paid for research that are not 
reasonable under the circumstances may be characterized as disguised 
dividends, gifts, loans, or similar payments. The reasonableness 
requirement of this paragraph (a)(6) does not apply to the 
reasonableness of the type or nature of the activities themselves.
    (7) This paragraph (a) applies to taxable years beginning after 
October 3, 1994.
    (8) The provisions of this section apply not only to costs paid or 
incurred by the taxpayer for research or experimentation undertaken 
directly by him but also to expenditures paid or incurred for research 
or experimentation carried on in his behalf by another person or 
organization (such as a research institute, foundation, engineering 
company, or similar contractor). However, any expenditures for research 
or experimentation carried on in the taxpayer's behalf by another person 
are not expenditures to which section 174 relates, to the extent that 
they represent expenditures for the acquisition or improvement of land 
or depreciable property, used in connection with the research or 
experimentation, to which the taxpayer acquires rights of ownership.
    (9) The application of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A engages B to undertake research and experimental work 
in order to create a particular product. B will be paid annually a fixed 
sum plus an amount equivalent to his actual expenditures. In 1957, A 
pays to B in respect of the project the sum of $150,000 of which $25,000 
represents an addition to B's laboratory and the balance represents 
charges for research and experimentation on the project. It is agreed 
between the parties that A will absorb the entire cost of this addition 
to B's laboratory which will be retained by B. A may treat the entire 
$150,000 as expenditures under section 174.
    Example 2. X Corporation, a manufacturer of explosives, contracts 
with the Y research organization to attempt through research and 
experimentation the creation of a new process for making certain 
explosives. Because of the danger involved in such an undertaking, Y is 
compelled to acquire an isolated tract of land on which to conduct the 
research and experimentation. It is agreed that upon completion of the 
project Y will transfer this tract, including any improvements thereon, 
to X. Section 174 does not apply to the amount paid to Y representing 
the costs of the tract of land and improvements.

    (b) Certain expenditures with respect to land and other property. 
(1) Expenditures by the taxpayer for the acquisition or improvement of 
land, or for the acquisition or improvement of property which is subject 
to an allowance for depreciation under section 167 or depletion under 
section 611, are not deductible under section 174, irrespective of the 
fact that the property or improvements may be used by the taxpayer in 
connection with research or experimentation. However, allow- ances for 
depreciation or depletion of property are considered as research or 
experimental expenditures, for purposes of section 174, to the extent 
that the property to which the allowances relate is used in connection 
with research or experimentation. If any part of the cost of acquisition 
or improvement of depreciable property is attributable to research or 
experimentation (whether made by the taxpayer or another), see 
subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph.
    (2) Expenditures for research or experimentation which result, as an 
end product of the research or experimentation, in depreciable property 
to be used in the taxpayer's trade or business may, subject to the 
limitations of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, be allowable as a 
current expense deduction under section 174(a). Such expenditures

[[Page 196]]

cannot be amortized under section 174(b) except to the extent provided 
in paragraph (a)(4) of Sec. 1.174-4.
    (3) If expenditures for research or experimentation are incurred in 
connection with the construction or manufacture of depreciable property 
by another, they are deductible under section 174(a) only if made upon 
the taxpayer's order and at his risk. No deduction will be allowed (i) 
if the taxpayer purchases another's product under a performance 
guarantee (whether express, implied, or imposed by local law) unless the 
guarantee is limited, to engineering specifications or otherwise, in 
such a way that economic utility is not taken into account; or (ii) for 
any part of the purchase price of a product in regular production. For 
example, if a taxpayer orders a specially-built automatic milling 
machine under a guarantee that the machine will be capable of producing 
a given number of units per hour, no portion of the expenditure is 
deductible since none of it is made at the taxpayer's risk. Similarly, 
no deductible expense is incurred if a taxpayer enters into a contract 
for the construction of a new type of chemical processing plant under a 
turn-key contract guaranteeing a given annual production and a given 
consumption of raw material and fuel per unit. On the other hand, if the 
contract contained no guarantee of quality of production and of quantity 
of units in relation to consumption of raw material and fuel, and if 
real doubt existed as to the capabilities of the process, expenses for 
research or experimentation under the contract are at the taxpayer's 
risk and are deductible under section 174(a). However, see subparagraph 
(4) of this paragraph.
    (4) The deductions referred to in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this 
paragraph for expenditures in connection with the acquisition or 
production of depreciable property to be used in the taxpayer's trade or 
business are limited to amounts expended for research or 
experimentation. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, amounts 
expended for research or experimentation do not include the costs of the 
component materials of the depreciable property, the costs of labor or 
other elements involved in its construction and installation, or costs 
attributable to the acquisition or improvement of the property. For 
example, a taxpayer undertakes to develop a new machine for use in his 
business. He expends $30,000 on the project of which $10,000 represents 
the actual costs of material, labor, etc., to construct the machine, and 
$20,000 represents research costs which are not attributable to the 
machine itself. Under section 174(a) the taxpayer would be permitted to 
deduct the $20,000 as expenses not chargeable to capital account, but 
the $10,000 must be charged to the asset account (the machine).
    (c) Exploration expenditures. The provisions of section 174 are not 
applicable to any expenditures paid or incurred for the purpose of 
ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit 
of ore, oil, gas or other mineral. See sections 617 and 263.

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 8562, 59 FR 
50160, Oct. 3, 1994]


<R05>
Sec. 1.174-3   Treatment as expenses.

    (a) In general. Research or experimental expenditures paid or 
incurred by a taxpayer during the taxable year in connection with his 
trade or business are deductible as expenses, and are not chargeable to 
capital account, if the taxpayer adopts the method provided in section 
174(a). See paragraph (b) of this section. If adopted, the method shall 
apply to all research and experimental expenditures paid or incurred in 
the taxable year of adoption and all subsequent taxable years, unless a 
different method is authorized by the Commissioner under section 
174(a)(3) with respect to part or all of the expenditures. See paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section. Thus, if a change to the deferred expense method 
under section 174(b) is authorized by the Commissioner with respect to 
research or experimental expenditures attributable to a particular 
project or projects, the taxpayer, for the taxable year of the change 
and for subsequent taxable years, must apply the deferred expense method 
to all such expenditures paid or incurred during any of those taxable 
years in connection with the particular project or projects, even though 
all

[[Page 197]]

other research and experimental expenditures are required to be deducted 
as current expenses under this section. In no event will the taxpayer be 
permitted to adopt the method described in this section as to part of 
the expenditures relative to a particular project and adopt for the same 
taxable year a different method of treating the balance of the 
expenditures relating to the same project.
    (b) Adoption and change of method--(1) Adoption without consent. The 
method described in this section may be adopted for any taxable year 
beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954. The 
consent of the Commissioner is not required if the taxpayer adopts the 
method for the first such taxable year in which he pays or incurs 
research or experimental expenditures. The taxpayer may do so by 
claiming in his income tax return for such year a deduction for his 
research or experimental expenditures. If the taxpayer fails to adopt 
the method for the first taxable year in which he incurs such 
expenditures, he cannot do so in subsequent taxable years unless he 
obtains the consent of the Commissioner under section 174(a)(2)(B) and 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. See, however, subparagraph (4) of 
this paragraph, relating to extensions of time.
    (2) Adoption with consent. A taxpayer may, with the consent of the 
Commissioner, adopt at any time the method provided in section 174(a). 
The method adopted in this manner shall be applicable only to 
expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for which the 
request is made and in subsequent taxable years. A request to adopt this 
method shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the Commissioner of 
Internal Revenue, Attention: T:R, Washington, DC, 20224. The request 
shall set forth the name and address of the taxpayer, the first taxable 
year for which the adoption of the method is requested, and a 
description of the project or projects with respect to which research or 
experimental expenditures are to be, or have already been, paid or 
incurred. The request shall be signed by the taxpayer (or his duly 
authorized representative) and shall be filed not later than the last 
day of the first taxable year for which the adoption of the method is 
requested. See, however, subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, relating to 
extensions of time.
    (3) Change of method. An application for permission to change to a 
different method of treating research or experimental expenditures shall 
be in writing and shall be addressed to the Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue, Attention: T:R, Washington, DC, 20224. The application shall 
include the name and address of the taxpayer, shall be signed by the 
taxpayer (or his duly authorized representative), and shall be filed not 
later than the last day of the first taxable year for which the change 
in method is to apply. See, however, subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, 
relating to extensions of time. The application shall:
    (i) State the first year to which the requested change is to be 
applicable;
    (ii) State whether the change is to apply to all research or 
experimental expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer, or only to 
expenditures attributable to a particular project or projects;
    (iii) Include such information as will identify the project or 
projects to which the change is applicable;
    (iv) Indicate the number of months (not less than 60) selected for 
amortization of the expenditures, if any, which are to be treated as 
deferred expenses under section 174(b);
    (v) State that, upon approval of the application, the taxpayer will 
make an accounting segregation on his books and records of the research 
or experimental expenditures to which the change in method is to apply; 
and
    (vi) State the reasons for the change.

If permission is granted to make the change, the taxpayer shall attach a 
copy of the letter granting permission to his income tax return for the 
first taxable year in which the different method is effective.
    (4) Special rules. If the last day prescribed by law for filing a 
return for any taxable year (including extensions thereof) to which 
section 174(a) is applicable falls before January 2, 1958, consent is 
hereby given for the taxpayer to adopt the expense method or to change 
from the expense method to

[[Page 198]]

a different method. In the case of a change from the expense method to a 
different method, the taxpayer, on or before January 2, 1958, must 
submit to the district director for the internal revenue district in 
which the return was filed the information required by subparagraph (3) 
of this paragraph. For any taxable year for which the expense method or 
a different method is adopted pursuant to this subparagraph, an amended 
return reflecting such method shall be filed on or before January 2, 
1958, if such return is necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 1.174-4   Treatment as deferred expenses.

    (a) In general. (1) If a taxpayer has not adopted the method 
provided in section 174(a) of treating research or experimental 
expenditures paid or incurred by him in connection with his trade or 
business as currently deductible expenses, he may, for any taxable year 
beginning after December 31, 1953, elect to treat such expenditures as 
deferred expenses under section 174(b), subject to the limitations of 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If a taxpayer has adopted the method 
of treating such expenditures as expenses under section 174(a), he may 
not elect to defer and amortize any such expenditures unless permission 
to do so is granted under section 174(a)(3). See paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (2) The election to treat research or experimental expenditures as 
deferred expenses under section 174(b) applies only to those 
expenditures which are chargeable to capital account but which are not 
chargeable to property of a character subject to an allowance for 
depreciation or depletion under section 167 or 611, respectively. Thus, 
the election under section 174(b) applies only if the property resulting 
from the research or experimental expenditures has no determinable 
useful life. If the property resulting from the expenditures has a 
determinable useful life, section 174(b) is not applicable, and the 
capitalized expenditures must be amortized or depreciated over the 
determinable useful life. Amounts treated as deferred expenses are 
properly chargeable to capital account for purposes of section 
1016(a)(1), relating to adjustments to basis of property. See section 
1016(a)(14). See section 174(c) and paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.174-2 for 
treatment of expenditures for the acquisition or improvement of land or 
of depreciable or depletable property to be used in connection with the 
research or experimentation.
    (3) Expenditures which are treated as deferred expenses under 
section 174(b) are allowable as a deduction ratably over a period of not 
less than 60 consecutive months beginning with the month in which the 
taxpayer first realizes benefits from the expenditures. The length of 
the period shall be selected by the taxpayer at the time he makes the 
election to defer the expenditures. If a taxpayer has two or more 
separate projects, he may select a different amortization period for 
each project. In the absence of a showing to the contrary, the taxpayer 
will be deemed to have begun to realize benefits from the deferred 
expenditures in the month in which the taxpayer first puts the process, 
formula, invention, or similar property to which the expenditures relate 
to an income-producing use. See section 1016(a)(14) for adjustments to 
basis of property for amounts allowed as deductions under section 174(b) 
and this section. See section 165 and the regulations thereunder for 
rules relating to the treatment of losses resulting from abandonment.
    (4) If expenditures which the taxpayer has elected to defer and 
deduct ratably over a period of time in accordance with section 174(b) 
result in the development of depreciable property, deductions for the 
unrecovered expenditures, beginning with the time the asset becomes 
depreciable in character, shall be determined under section 167 
(relating to depreciation) and the regulations thereunder. For example, 
for the taxable year 1954, A, who reports his income on the basis of a 
calendar year, elects to defer and deduct ratably over a period of 60 
months research and experimental expenditures made in connection with a 
particular project. In 1956, the total of the deferred expenditures 
amounts to $60,000. At that time, A has developed a process which he 
seeks to patent. On July 1, 1956, A first realized benefits from the 
marketing of products resulting from this process. Therefore, the 
expenditures

[[Page 199]]

deferred are deductible ratably over the 60-month period beginning with 
July 1, 1956 (when A first realized benefits from the project). In his 
return for the year 1956. A deducted $6,000; in 1957, A deducted $12,000 
($1,000 per month). On July 1, 1958, a patent protecting his process is 
obtained by A. In his return for 1958, A is entitled to a deduction of 
$6,000, representing the amortizable portion of the deferred expenses 
attributable to the period prior to July 1, 1958. The balance of the 
unrecovered expenditures ($60,000 minus $24,000, or $36,000) is to be 
recovered as a depreciation deduction over the life of the patent 
commencing with July 1, 1958. Thus, one-half of the annual depreciation 
deduction based upon the useful life of the patent is also deductible 
for 1958 (from July 1 to December 31).
    (5) The election shall be applicable to all research and 
experimental expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer or, if so 
limited by the taxpayer's election, to all such expenditures with 
respect to the particular project, subject to the limitations of 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. The election shall apply for the 
taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent 
taxable years, unless a change to a different treatment is authorized by 
the Commissioner under section 174(b)(2). See paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section. Likewise, the taxpayer shall adhere to the amortization period 
selected at the time of the election unless a different period of 
amortization with respect to a part or all of the expenditures is 
similarly authorized. However, no change in method will be permitted 
with respect to expenditures paid or incurred before the taxable year to 
which the change is to apply. In no event will the taxpayer be permitted 
to treat part of the expenditures with respect to a particular project 
as deferred expenses under section 174(b) and to adopt a different 
method of treating the balance of the expenditures relating to the same 
project for the same taxable year. The election under this section shall 
not apply to any expenditures paid or incurred before the taxable year 
for which the taxpayer makes the election.
    (b) Election and change of method--(1) Election. The election under 
section 174(b) shall be made not later than the time (including 
extensions) prescribed by law for filing the return for the taxable year 
for which the method is to be adopted. The election shall be made by 
attaching a statement to the taxpayer's return for the first taxable 
year to which the election is applicable. The statement shall be signed 
by the taxpayer (or his duly authorized representative), and shall:
    (i) Set forth the name and address of the taxpayer;
    (ii) Designate the first taxable year to which the election is to 
apply;
    (iii) State whether the election is intended to apply to all 
expenditures within the permissible scope of the election, or only to a 
particular project or projects, and, if the latter, include such 
information as will identify the project or projects as to which the 
election is to apply;
    (iv) Set forth the amount of all research or experimental 
expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for which the 
election is made;
    (v) Indicate the number of months (not less than 60) selected for 
amortization of the deferred expenses for each project; and
    (vi) State that the taxpayer will make an accounting segregation in 
his books and records of the expenditures to which the election relates.
    (2) Change to a different method or period. Application for 
permission to change to a different method of treating research or 
experimental expenditures or to a different period of amortization for 
deferred expenses shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: T:R, Washington, DC, 20224. 
The application shall include the name and address of the taxpayer, 
shall be signed by the taxpayer (or his duly authorized representative), 
and shall be filed not later than the end of the first taxable year in 
which the different method or different amortization period is to be 
used (unless subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, relating to extensions 
of time, is applicable). The application shall set forth the following 
information with regard to the research or experimental expenditures 
which are being treated under section 174(b) as deferred expenses:

[[Page 200]]

    (i) Total amount of research or experimental expenditures 
attributable to each project;
    (ii) Amortization period applicable to each project; and
    (iii) Unamortized expenditures attributable to each project at the 
beginning of the taxable year in which the application is filed.

In addition, the application shall set forth the length of the new 
period or periods proposed, or the new method of treatment proposed, the 
reasons for the proposed change, and such information as will identify 
the project or projects to which the expenditures affected by the change 
relate. If permission is granted to make the change, the taxpayer shall 
attach a copy of the letter granting the permission to his income tax 
return for the first taxable year in which the different method or 
period is to be effective.
    (3) Special rules. If the last day prescribed by law for filing a 
return for any taxable year for which the deferred method provided in 
section 174(b) has been adopted falls before January 2, 1958, consent is 
hereby given for the taxpayer to change from such method and adopt a 
different method of treating research or experimental expenditures, 
provided that on or before January 2, 1958, he submits to the district 
director for the district in which the return was filed the information 
required by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, relating to a change to 
a different method or period. For any taxable year for which the 
different method is adopted pursuant to this subparagraph, an amended 
return reflecting such method shall be filed on or before January 2, 
1958.
    (c) Example. The application of this section is illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. N Corporation is engaged in the business of manufacturing 
chemical products. On January 1, 1955, work is begun on a special 
research project. N Corporation elects, pursuant to section 174(b), to 
defer the expenditures relating to the special project and to amortize 
the expenditures over a period of 72 months beginning with the month in 
which benefits from the expenditures are first realized. On January 1, 
1955, N Corporation also purchased for $57,600 a building having a 
remaining useful life of 12 years as of the date of purchase and no 
salvage value at the end of the period. Fifty percent of the building's 
facilities are to be used in connection with the special research 
project. During 1955, N Corporation pays or incurs the following 
expenditures relating to the special research project:

Salaries.....................................................    $15,000
Heat, light and power........................................        700
Drawings.....................................................      2,000
Models.......................................................      6,500
Laboratory materials.........................................      8,000
Attorneys' fees..............................................      1,400
Depreciation on building attributable to project (50 percent            
 of $4,800 allowable depreciation)...........................      2,400
                                                              ----------
    Total research and development expenditures..............     36,000
                                                                        

The above expenditures result in a process which is marketable but not 
patentable and which has no determinable useful life. N Corporation 
first realizes benefits from the process in January 1956. N Corporation 
is entitled to deduct the amount of $6,000 ($36,000 x 12 
months<divide>72 months) as deferred expenses under section 174(b) in 
computing taxable income for 1956.

Sec. 1.175-1   Soil and water conservation expenditures; in general.

    Under section 175, a farmer may deduct his soil or water 
conservation expenditures which do not give rise to a deduction for 
depreciation and which are not otherwise deductible. The amount of the 
deduction is limited annually to 25 percent of the taxpayer's gross 
income from farming. Any excess may be carried over and deducted in 
succeeding taxable years. As a general rule, once a farmer has adopted 
this method of treating soil and water conservation expenditures, he 
must deduct all such expenditures (subject to the 25-percent limitation) 
for the current and subsequent taxable years. If a farmer does not adopt 
this method, such expenditures increase the basis of the property to 
which they relate.


<R05>
Sec. 1.175-2   Definition of soil and water conservation expenditures.

    (a) Expenditures treated as a deduction. (1) The method described in 
section 175 applies to expenditures paid or incurred for the purpose of 
soil or water conservation in respect of land used in farming, or for 
the prevention of erosion of land used in farming, but only if such 
expenditures are made in the furtherance of the business of farming. 
More specifically, a farmer may deduct expenditures made for these 
purposes

[[Page 201]]

which are for (i) the treatment or moving of earth, (ii) the 
construction, control, and protection of diversion channels, drainage 
ditches, irrigation ditches, earthen dams, watercourses, outlets, and 
ponds, (iii) the eradication of brush, and (iv) the planting of 
windbreaks. Expenditures for the treatment or moving of earth include 
but are not limited to expenditures for leveling, conditioning, grading, 
terracing, contour furrowing, and restoration of soil fertility. For 
rules relating to the allocation of expenditures that benefit both land 
used in farming and other land of the taxpayer, see Sec. 1.175-7.
    (2) The following are examples of soil and water conservation: (i) 
Constructing terraces, or the like, to detain or control the flow of 
water, to check soil erosion on sloping land, to intercept runoff, and 
to divert excess water to protected outlets; (ii) constructing water 
detention or sediment retention dams to prevent or fill gullies, to 
retard or reduce run-off of water, or to collect stock water; and (iii) 
constructing earthen floodways, levies, or dikes, to prevent flood 
damage to farmland.
    (b) Expenditures not subject to section 175 treatment. (1) The 
method described in section 175 applies only to expenditures for 
nondepreciable items. Accordingly, a taxpayer may not deduct 
expenditures for the purchase, construction, installation, or 
improvement of structures, appliances, or facilities subject to the 
allowance for depreciation. Thus, the method does not apply to 
depreciable nonearthen items such as those made of masonry or concrete 
(see section 167). For example, expenditures in respect of depreciable 
property include those for materials, supplies, wages, fuel, hauling, 
and dirt moving for making structures such as tanks, reservoirs, pipes, 
conduits, canals, dams, wells, or pumps composed of masonry, concrete, 
tile, metal, or wood. However, the method applies to expenditures for 
earthen items which are not subject to a depreciation allowance. For 
example, expenditures for earthen terraces and dams which are 
nondepreciable are deductible under section 175. For taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1959, in the case of expenditures paid or 
incurred by farmers for fertilizer, lime, etc., for purposes other than 
soil or water conservation, see section 180 and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (2) The method does not apply to expenses deductible apart from 
section 175. Adoption of the method is not necessary in order to deduct 
such expenses in full without limitation. Thus, the method does not 
apply to interest (deductible under section 163), nor to taxes 
(deductible under section 164). It does not apply to expenses for the 
repair of completed soil or water conservation structures, such as costs 
of annual removal of sediment from a drainage ditch. It does not apply 
to expenditures paid or incurred primarily to produce an agricultural 
crop even though they incidentally conserve soil. Thus, the cost of 
fertilizing (the effectiveness of which does not last beyond one year) 
used to produce hay is deductible without adoption of the method 
prescribed in section 175. For taxable years beginning after December 
31, 1959, in the case of expenditures paid or incurred by farmers for 
fertilizer, lime, etc., for purposes other than soil or water 
conservation, see section 180 and the regulations thereunder. However, 
the method would apply to expenses incurred to produce vegetation 
primarily to conserve soil or water or to prevent erosion. Thus, for 
example, the method would apply to such expenditures as the cost of dirt 
moving, lime, fertilizer, seed and planting stock used in gulley 
stabilization, or in stabilizing severely eroded areas, in order to 
obtain a soil binding stand of vegetation on raw or infertile land.
    (c) Assessments. The method applies also to that part of assessments 
levied by a soil or water conservation or drainage district to reimburse 
it for its expenditures which, if actually paid or incurred during the 
taxable year by the taxpayer directly, would be deductible under section 
175. Depending upon the farmer's method of accounting, the time when the 
farmer pays or incurs the assessment, and not the time when the 
expenditures are paid or incurred by the district, controls the time the 
deduction must be taken. The provisions of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. In 1955 a soil and water conservation district levies an 
assessment of $700

[[Page 202]]

upon a farmer on the cash method of accounting. The assessment is to 
reimburse the district for its expenditures in 1954. The farmer's share 
of such expenditures is as follows: $400 for digging drainage ditches 
for soil conservation and $300 for assets subject to the allowance for 
depreciation. If the farmer pays the assessment in 1955 and has adopted 
the method of treating expenditures for soil or water conservation as 
current expenses under section 175, he may deduct in 1955 the $400 
attributable to the digging of drainage ditches as a soil conservation 
expenditure subject to the 25-percent limitation.

<R05>
Sec. 1.175-3   Definition of ``the business of farming.''

    The method described in section 175 is available only to a taxpayer 
engaged in ``the business of farming''. A taxpayer is engaged in the 
business of farming if he cultivates, operates, or manages a farm for 
gain or profit, either as owner or tenant. For the purpose of section 
175, a taxpayer who receives a rental (either in cash or in kind) which 
is based upon farm production is engaged in the business of farming. 
However, a taxpayer who receives a fixed rental (without reference to 
production) is engaged in the business of farming only if he 
participates to a material extent in the operation or management of the 
farm. A taxpayer engaged in forestry or the growing of timber is not 
thereby engaged in the business of farming. A person cultivating or 
operating a farm for recreation or pleasure rather than a profit is not 
engaged in the business of farming. For the purpose of this section, the 
term farm is used in its ordinary, accepted sense and includes stock, 
dairy, poultry, fish, fruit, and truck farms, and also plantations, 
ranches, ranges, and orchards. A fish farm is an area where fish are 
grown or raised, as opposed to merely caught or harvested; that is, an 
area where they are artificially fed, protected, cared for, etc. A 
taxpayer is engaged in ``the business of farming'' if he is a member of 
a partnership engaged in the business of farming. See paragraphs 
(a)(8)(i) and (c)(1)(iv) of Sec. 1.702-1.

[T.D. 6649, 28 FR 3762, Apr. 18, 1963]


<R05>
Sec. 1.175-4  Definition of ``land used in farming.''

    (a) Requirements. For purposes of section 175, the term land used in 
farming means land which is used in the business of farming and which 
meets both of the following requirements:
    (1) The land must be used for the production of crops, fruits, or 
other agricultural products, including fish, or for the sustenance of 
livestock. The term livestock includes cattle, hogs, horses, mules, 
donkeys, sheep, goats, captive fur-bearing animals, chickens, turkeys, 
pigeons, and other poultry. Land used for the sustenance of livestock 
includes land used for grazing such livestock.
    (2) The land must be or have been so used either by the taxpayer or 
his tenant at some time before or at the same time as, the taxpayer 
makes the expenditures for soil or water conservation or for the 
prevention of the erosion of land. The taxpayer will be considered to 
have used the land in farming before making such expenditure if he or 
his tenant has employed the land in a farming use in the past. If the 
expenditures are made by the taxpayer in respect of land newly acquired 
from one who immediately prior to the acquisition was using it in 
farming, the taxpayer will be considered to be using the land in farming 
at the time that such expenditures are made, if the use which is made by 
the taxpayer of the land from the time of its acquisition by him is 
substantially a continuation of its use in farming, whether for the same 
farming use as that of the taxpayer's predecessor or for one of the 
other uses specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A purchases an operating farm from B in the autumn after 
B has harvested his crops. Prior to spring plowing and planting when the 
land is idle because of the season, A makes certain soil and water 
conservation expenditures on this farm. At the time such expenditures 
are made the land is considered to be used by A in farming, and A may 
deduct such expenditures under section

[[Page 203]]

175, subject to the other requisite conditions of such section.
    Example 2. C acquires uncultivated land, not previously used in 
farming, which he intends to develop for farming. Prior to putting this 
land into production it is necessary for C to clear brush, construct 
earthen terraces and ponds, and make other soil and water conservation 
expenditures. The land is not used in farming at the same time that such 
expenditures are made. Therefore, C may not deduct such expenditures 
under section 175.
    Example 3. D acquires several tracts of land from persons who had 
used such land immediately prior to D's acquisition for grazing cattle. 
D intends to use the land for growing grapes. In order to make the land 
suitable for this use, D constructs earthen terraces, builds drainage 
ditches and irrigation ditches, extensively treats the soil, and makes 
other soil and water conservation expenditures. The land is considered 
to be used in farming by D at the time he makes such expenditures, even 
though it is being prepared for a different type of farming activity 
than that engaged in by D's predecessors. Therefore, D may deduct such 
expenditures under section 175, subject to the other requisite 
conditions of such section.

    (c) Cross reference. For rules relating to the allocation of 
expenditures that benefit both land used in farming and other land of 
the taxpayer, see Sec. 1.175-7.

[T.D. 7740, 45 FR 78634, Nov. 26, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 1.175-5   Percentage limitation and carryover.

    (a) The limitation--(1) General rule. The amount of soil and water 
conservation expenditures which the taxpayer may deduct under section 
175 in any one taxable year is limited to 25 percent of his ``gross 
income from farming''.
    (2) Definition of ``gross income from farming.'' For the purpose of 
section 175, the term gross income from farming means the gross income 
of the taxpayer, derived in ``the business of farming'' as defined in 
Sec. 1.175-3, from the production of crops, fruits, or other 
agricultural products, including fish, or from livestock (including 
livestock held for draft, breeding, or dairy purposes). It includes such 
income from land used in farming other than that upon which expenditures 
are made for soil or water conservation or for the prevention of erosion 
of land. It does not include gains from sales of assets such as farm 
machinery or gains from the disposition of land. A taxpayer shall 
compute his ``gross income from farming'' in accordance with his 
accounting method used in determining gross income. (See the regulations 
under section 61 relating to accounting methods used by farmers in 
determining gross income.) The provisions of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. A, who uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of 
accounting, includes in his ``gross income from farming'' for purposes 
of determining the 25-percent limitation the following items:

Proceeds from sale of his 1955 yield of corn.................    $10,000
Gain from disposition of old breeding cows replaced by                  
 younger cows................................................        500
                                                              ----------
    Total gross income from farming..........................     10,500
                                                                        

    A must exclude from ``gross income from farming'' the following 
items which are included in his gross income:

Gain from sale of tractor....................................       $100
Gain from sale of 40 acres of taxpayer's farm................      8,000
                                                              ----------
Interest on loan to neighboring farmer.......................        100
                                                                        

    (3) Deduction qualifies for net operating loss deduction. Any amount 
allowed as a deduction under section 175, either for the year in which 
the expenditure is paid or incurred or for the year to which it is 
carried, is taken into account in computing a net operating loss for 
such taxable year. If a deduction for soil or water conservation 
expenditures has been taken into account in computing a net operating 
loss carryback or carryover, it shall not be considered a soil or water 
conservation expenditure for the year to which the loss is carried, and 
therefore, is not subject to the 25-percent limitation for that year. 
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following 
example:

    Example. Assume that in 1956 A has gross income from farming of 
$4,000, soil and water conservation expenditures of $1,600 and 
deductible farm expenses of $3,500. Of the soil and water conservation 
expenditures $1,000 is deductible in 1956. The $600 in excess of 25 
percent of A's gross income from farming is carried over into 1957. 
Assuming that A has no other income, his deductions of $4,500 ($1,000 
plus $3,500) exceed his gross income of $4,000 by $500. This $500 will 
constitute a net operating loss which he must carry back two years and 
carry forward five years, until it has offset $500 of taxable income. No 
part of

[[Page 204]]

this $500 net operating loss carryback or carryover will be taken into 
account in determining the amount of soil and water conservation 
expenditures in the years to which it is carried.

    (b) Carryover of expenditures in excess of deduction. The deduction 
for soil and water conservation expenditures in any one taxable year is 
limited to 25 percent of the taxpayer's gross income from farming. The 
taxpayer may carry over the excess of such expenditures over 25 percent 
of his gross income from farming into his next taxable year, and, if not 
deductible in that year, into the next year, and so on without limit as 
to time. In determining the deductible amount of such expenditures for 
any taxable year, the actual expenditures of that year shall be added to 
any such expenditures carried over from prior years, before applying the 
25-percent limitation. Any such expenditures in excess of the deductible 
amount may be carried over during the taxpayer's entire existence. For 
this purpose in a farm partnership, since the 25-percent limitation is 
applied to each partner, not the partnership, the carryover may be 
carried forward during the life of the partner. The provisions of this 
paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. Assume the expenditures and income shown in the following 
table:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                      Deductible soil                           
                                                                         and water                              
                                                                        conservation               25

                                                                      taxable   prior           farming         
                                                                       year      year

1955...............................................................    1,000      $100   1,100      900      200
1956...............................................................     None       200     200    1,000     None
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The deduction for 1954 is limited to $800. The remainder, $100 ($900 
minus $800), not being deductible for 1954, is a carryover to 1955. For 
1955, accordingly, the total of the expenditures to be taken into 
account is $1,100 (the $100 carryover and the $1,000 actually paid in 
that year). The deduction for 1955 is limited to $900, and the remainder 
of the $1,100 total, or $200, is a carryover to 1956. The deduction for 
1956 consists solely of this carryover of $200. Since the total 
expenditures, actual and carried-over, for 1956 are less than 25 percent 
of gross income from farming, there is no carryover into 1957.

[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11402, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6649, 28 FR 
3762, Apr. 18, 1963]


<R05>
Sec. 1.175-6   Adoption or change of method.

    (a) Adoption with consent. A taxpayer may, without consent, adopt 
the method of treating expenditures for soil or water conservation as 
expenses for the first taxable year:
    (1) Which begins after December 31, 1953, and ends after August 16, 
1954, and
    (2) For which soil or water conservation expenditures described in 
section 175(a) are paid or incurred.

Such adoption shall be made by claiming the deduction on his income tax 
return. For a taxable year ending prior to May 31, 1957, the adoption of 
the method described in section 175 shall be made by claiming the 
deduction on such return for that year, or by claiming the deduction on 
an amended return filed for that year on or before August 30, 1957.
    (b) Adoption with consent. A taxpayer may adopt the method of 
treating soil and water conservation expenditures as provided by section 
175 for any taxable year to which the section is applicable if consent 
is obtained from the district director for the internal revenue district 
in which the taxpayer's return is required to be filed.
    (c) Change of method. A taxpayer who has adopted the method of 
treating expenditures for soil or water conservation, as provided by 
section 175, may change from this method and capitalize such 
expenditures made after the effective date of the change, if he obtains 
the consent of the district director for the internal revenue district 
in which his return is required to be filed.

[[Page 205]]

    (d) Request for consent to adopt or change method. Where the consent 
of the district director is required under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section, the request for his consent shall be in writing, signed by the 
taxpayer or his authorized representative, and shall be filed not later 
than the date prescribed by law for filing the income tax return for the 
first taxable year to which the adoption of, or change of, method is to 
apply, or not later than August 20, 1957, following their adoption, 
whichever is later. The request shall:
    (1) Set forth the name and address of the taxpayer;
    (2) Designate the first taxable year to which the method or change 
of method is to apply;
    (3) State whether the method or change of method is intended to 
apply to all expenditures within the permissible scope of section 175, 
or only to a particular project or farm and, if the latter, include such 
information as will identify the project or farm as to which the method 
or change of method is to apply;
    (4) Set forth the amount of all soil and water conservation 
expenditures paid or incurred during the first taxable year for which 
the method or change of method is to apply; and
    (5) State that the taxpayer will make an accounting segregation in 
his books and records of the expenditures to which the election relates.
    (e) Scope of method. Except with the consent of the district 
director as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the 
taxpayer's method of treating soil and water conservation expenditures 
described in section 175 shall apply to all such expenditures for the 
taxable year of adoption and all subsequent taxable years. Although a 
taxpayer may have elected to deduct soil and water conservation 
expenditures, he may request an authorization to capitalize his soil and 
water conservation expenditures attributable to a special project or 
single farm. Similarly, a taxpayer who has not elected to deduct such 
expenditures may request an authorization to deduct his soil and water 
conservation expenditures attributable to a special project or single 
farm. The authorization with respect to the special project or single 
farm will not affect the method adopted with respect to the taxpayer's 
regularly incurred soil and water conservation expenditures. No adoption 
of, or change of, the method under section 175 will be permitted as to 
expenditures actually paid or incurred before the taxable year to which 
the method or change of method is to apply. Thus, if a taxpayer adopts 
such method for 1956, he cannot deduct any part of such expenditures 
which he capitalized, or should have capitalized, in 1955. Likewise, if 
a taxpayer who has adopted such method has an unused carryover of such 
expenditures in excess of the 25-percent limitation, and is granted 
consent to capitalize soil and water conservation expenditures beginning 
in 1956, he cannot capitalize any part of the unused carryover. The 
excess expenditures carried over continue to be deductible to the extent 
of 25 percent of the taxpayer's gross income from farming. No adjustment 
to the basis of land shall be made under section 1016 for expenditures 
to which the method under section 175 applies. For example, A has an 
unused carryover of soil and water conservation expenditures amounting 
to $5,000 as of December 31, 1956. On January 1, 1957, A sells his farm 
and goes out of the business of farming. The unused carryover of $5,000 
cannot be added to the basis of the farm for purposes of determining 
gain or loss on its sale. In 1959, A purchases another farm and resumes 
the business of farming. In such year, A may deduct the amount of the 
unused carryover to the extent of 25 percent of his gross income from 
farming and may carry over any excess to subsequent years.


<R05>
Sec. 1.175-7  Allocation of expenditures in certain circumstances.

    (a) General rule. If at the time the taxpayer paid or incurred 
expenditures for the purpose of soil or water conservation, or for the 
prevention of erosion of land, it was reasonable to believe that such 
expenditures would directly and substantially benefit land of the 
taxpayer which does not qualify as ``land used in farming,'' as defined 
in Sec. 1.175-4, as well as land of the taxpayer which does so qualify, 
then, for purposes of section 175, only a part of the taxpayer's total 
expenditures is in respect of ``land used in farming.''

[[Page 206]]

    (b) Method of allocation. The part of expenditures allocable to 
``land used in farming'' generally equals the amount which bears the 
same proportion to the total amount of such expenditures as the area of 
land of the taxpayer used in farming which it was reasonable to believe 
would be directly and substantially benefited as a result of the 
expenditures bears to the total area of land of the taxpayer which it 
was reasonable to believe would be so benefited. If it is established by 
clear and convincing evidence that, in the light of all the facts and 
circumstances, another method of allocation is more reasonable than the 
method provided in the preceding sentence, the taxpayer may allocate the 
expenditures under that other method. For purposes of this section, the 
term land of the taxpayer means land with respect to which the taxpayer 
has title, leasehold, or some other substantial interest.
    (c) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. A owns a 200-acre tract of land, 80 acres of which 
qualify as ``land used in farming.'' A makes expenditures for the 
purpose of soil and water conservation which can reasonably be expected 
to directly and substantially benefit the entire 200-acre tract. In the 
absence of clear and convincing evidence that a different allocation is 
more reasonable, A may deduct 40 percent (80/200) of such expenditures 
under section 175. The same result would obtain if A had made the 
expenditures after newly acquiring the tract from a person who had used 
80 of the 200 acres in farming immediately prior to A's acquisition.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that A's 
expenditures for the purpose of soil and water conservation can 
reasonably be expected to directly and substantially benefit only the 80 
acres which qualify as land used in farming; any benefit to the other 
120 acres would be minor and incidental. A may deduct all of such 
expenditures under section 175.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that A's 
expenditures for the purpose of soil and water conservation can 
reasonably be expected to directly and substantially benefit only the 
120 acres which do not qualify as land used in farming. A may not deduct 
any of such expenditures under section 175. The same result would obtain 
even if A had leased the 200-acre tract to B in the expectation that B 
would farm the entire tract.

<R05>
Sec. 1.177-1   Election to amortize trademark and trade name expenditures.

    (a) In general. (1) Section 177 provides that a taxpayer may elect 
to treat any trademark or trade name expenditure (defined in section 
177(b) and paragraph (b) of this section) paid or incurred during a 
taxable year beginning after December 31, 1955, as a deferred expense. 
Any expenditure so treated shall be allowed as a deduction ratably over 
the number of continuous months (not less than 60) selected by the 
taxpayer, beginning with the first month of the taxable year in which 
the expenditure is paid or incurred. The term paid or incurred, as used 
in section 177 and this section, is to be construed according to the 
method of accounting used by the taxpayer in computing taxable income. 
See section 7701(a)(25). An election under section 177 is irrevocable 
insofar as it applies to a particular trademark or trade name 
expenditure, but separate elections may be made with respect to other 
trademark or trade name expenditures. See subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph. See also paragraph (c) of this section for time and manner of 
making election.
    (2) The number of continuous months selected by the taxpayer may be 
equal to or greater, but not less than 60, but in any event the 
deduction must begin with the first month of the taxable year in which 
the expenditure is paid or incurred. The number of months selected by 
the taxpayer at the time he makes the election may not be subsequently 
changed but shall be adhered to in computing taxable income for the 
taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable 
years.
    (3) Section 177 permits an election by the taxpayer for each 
separate trademark or trade name expenditure. Thus, a taxpayer who has 
several trademark or trade name expenditures in a taxable year may elect 
under section 177 with respect to some of such expenditures and not 
elect with respect to the other expenditures. Also, a taxpayer may 
choose different amortization periods for different trademark or trade 
name expenditures with respect to

[[Page 207]]

which he has made the election under section 177.
    (4) All trademark and trade name expenditures are properly 
chargeable to capital account for purposes of section 1016(a)(1), 
relating to adjustments to basis of property, whether or not they are to 
be amortized under section 177. However, the trademark and trade name 
expenditures with respect to which the taxpayer has made an election 
under section 177 must be kept in a separate account in the taxpayer's 
books and records. See paragraph (c) of this section. See also section 
1016(a)(16) and paragraph (m) of Sec. 1.1016-5 for adjustments to basis 
of property for amounts allowed as deductions under section 177 and this 
section.
    (b) Trademark and trade name expenditures defined. (1) The term 
trademark and trade name expenditures, as used in section 177 and this 
section, means any expenditure which:
    (i) Is directly connected with the acquisition, protection, 
expansion, registration (Federal, State, or foreign), or defense of a 
trademark or trade name;
    (ii) Is chargeable to capital account; and
    (iii) Is not part of the consideration or purchase price paid for a 
trademark, trade name, or a business (including goodwill) already in 
existence.

An expenditure which fails to meet one or more of these tests is not a 
trademark or trade name expenditure for purposes of section 177 and this 
section.

Amounts paid in connection with the acquisition of an existing trademark 
or trade name may not be amortized under section 177 even though such 
amounts may be paid to protect or expand a previously owned trademark or 
trade name through purchase of a competitive trademark. Similarly, the 
provisions of section 177 and this section are not applicable to 
expenditures paid or incurred for an agreement to discontinue the use of 
a trademark or trade name (if the effect of the agreement is the 
purchase of a trademark or trade name) nor to expenditures paid or 
incurred in acquiring franchises or rights to the use of a trademark or 
trade name. Generally, section 177 will apply to expenditures such as 
legal fees and other costs in connection with the acquisition of a 
certificate of registration of a trademark from the United States or 
other government, artists' fees and similar expenses connected with the 
design of a distinctive mark for a product or service, litigation 
expenses connected with infringement proceedings, and costs in 
connection with the preparation and filing of an application for renewal 
of registration and continued use of a trademark.
    (2) Expenditures for a trademark or trade name which has a 
determinable useful life and which would otherwise be depreciable under 
section 167 must be deferred and amortized under section 177 if an 
election under section 177 is made with respect to such expenditures.
    (3) The following examples illustrate the application of section 
177:

    Example 1. X Corporation engages an artist to design a distinctive 
trademark for its product. At the same time it retains an attorney to 
prepare the papers necessary for registration of this trademark with the 
Federal Government. The fees of both the artist and the attorney may be 
amortized under section 177 over a period of not less than 60 continuous 
months.
    Example 2. Y Corporation wishes to expand the market served by its 
product. It acquires a competing firm in a neighboring State. The 
contract of sale provides for a purchase price of $250,000 of which 
$225,000 shall constitute payment for physical assets and $25,000 for 
the trademark and goodwill. No part of the purchase price may be 
amortized under section 177.
    Example 3. M Corporation brings suit against N Corporation for 
infringement of M's trademark. The costs of this litigation may be 
amortized under section 177.

    (c) Time and manner of making election. (1) A taxpayer who elects to 
defer and amortize any trademark or trade name expenditure paid or 
incurred during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1955, shall, 
within the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for 
filing his income tax return for that year, attach to his income tax 
return a statement signifying his election under section 177 and setting 
forth the following:
    (i) Name and address of the taxpayer, and the taxable year involved;
    (ii) An identification of the character and amount of each 
expenditure to which the election applies and the

[[Page 208]]

number of continuous months (not less than 60) during which the 
expenditures are to be ratably deducted; and
    (iii) A declaration by the taxpayer that he will make an accounting 
segregation on his books and records of the trademark and trade name 
expenditures for which the election has been made, sufficient to permit 
an identification of the character and amount of each such expenditure 
and the amortization period selected for each expenditure.
    (2) The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply 
to income tax returns and statements required to be filed after May 4, 
1960. Elections properly made in accordance with the provisions of 
Treasury Decision 6209, approved October 26, 1956 (21 FR 8319, C.B. 
1956-2, 1370), continue in effect.


<R05>
Sec. 1.178-1   Depreciation or amortization of improvements on leased property and cost of acquiring a lease.

    (a) In general. Section 178 provides rules for determining the 
amount of the deduction allowable for any taxable year to a lessee for 
depreciation or amortization of improvements made on leased property and 
as amortization of the cost of acquiring a lease. For purposes of 
section 178 the term depreciation means the deduction allowable for 
exhaustion, wear and tear, or obsolescence under provisions of the Code 
such as section 167 or 611 and the regulations thereunder and the term 
amortization means the deduction allowable for amortization of buildings 
or other improvements made on leased property or for amortization of the 
cost of acquiring a lease under provisions of the Code such as section 
162 or 212 and the regulations thereunder. The provisions of section 178 
are applicable with respect to costs of acquiring a lease incurred, and 
improvements begun, after July 28, 1958, other than improvements which, 
on July 28, 1958, and at all times thereafter, the lessee was under a 
binding legal obligation to make.
    (b) Determination of amount of deduction. (1) In determining the 
amount of the deduction allowable to a lessee (other than a lessee who 
is related to the lessor within the meaning of Sec. 1.178-2) for any 
taxable year for depreciation or amortization of improvements made on 
leased property, or for amortization in respect of the cost of acquiring 
a lease, the term of the lease shall, except as provided in subparagraph 
(2) of this paragraph, be treated as including all periods for which the 
lease may be renewed, extended, or continued pursuant to an option or 
options exercisable by the lessee (whether or not specifically provided 
for in the lease) if:
    (i) In the case of any building erected, or other improvements made, 
by the lessee on the leased property, the portion of the term of the 
lease (excluding all periods for which the lease may subsequently be 
renewed, extended, or continued pursuant to an option or options 
exercisable by the lessee) remaining upon the completion of such 
building or other improvements is less than 60 percent of the estimated 
useful life of such building or other improvements; or
    (ii) In the case of any cost of acquiring the lease, less than 75 
percent of such cost is attributable to the portion of the term of the 
lease (excluding all periods for which the lease may be renewed, 
extended, or continued pursuant to an option or options exercisable by 
the lessee) remaining on the date of its acquisition.
    (2) The rules provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall 
not apply if the lessee establishes that, as of the close of the taxable 
year, it is more probable that the lease will not be renewed, extended, 
or continued than that the lease will be renewed, extended, or 
continued. In such case, the cost of improvements made on leased 
property or the cost of acquiring a lease shall be amortized over the 
remaining term of the lease without regard to any options exercisable by 
the lessee to renew, extend, or continue the lease. The probability test 
referred to in the first sentence of this subparagraph shall be 
applicable to each option period to which the lease may be renewed, 
extended, or continued. The establishment by a lessee as of the close of 
the taxable year that it is more probable that the lease will not be 
renewed, extended, or continued will ordinarily be effective as of the 
close of such taxable year and any subsequent taxable year, and the 
deduction for amortization will be based on the term of

[[Page 209]]

the lease without regard to any periods for which the lease may be 
renewed, extended, or continued pursuant to an option or options 
exercisable by the lessee. However, in appropriate cases, if the facts 
as of the close of any subsequent taxable year indicate that it is more 
probable that the lease will be renewed, extended, or continued, the 
deduction for amortization (or depreciation) shall, beginning with the 
first day of such subsequent taxable year, be determined by including in 
the remaining term of the lease all periods for which it is more 
probable that the lease will be renewed, extended, or continued.
    (3) If at any time the remaining term of the lease determined in 
accordance with section 178 and this section is equal to or of longer 
duration than the then estimated useful life of the improvements made on 
the leased property by the lessee, the cost of such improvements shall 
be depreciated over the estimated useful life of such improvements under 
the provisions of section 167 and the regulations thereunder.
    (4) For purposes of section 178(a)(1) and this section, the date on 
which the building erected or other improvements made are completed is 
the date on which the building or improvements are usable, whether or 
not used.
    (5)(i) For purposes of section 178(a)(2) and this section, the 
portion of the cost of acquiring a lease which is attributable to the 
term of the lease remaining on the date of its acquisition without 
regard to options exercisable by the lessee to renew, extend, or 
continue the lease shall be determined on the basis of the facts and 
circumstances of each case. In some cases, it may be appropriate to 
determine such portion of the cost of acquiring a lease by applying the 
principles used to measure the present value of an annuity. Where that 
method is used, such portion shall be determined by multiplying the cost 
of the lease by a fraction, the numerator comprised of a factor 
representing the present value of an annually recurring savings of $1 
per year for the period of the remaining term of the lease (without 
regard to options to renew, extend, or continue the lease) at an 
appropriate rate of interest (determined on the basis of all the facts 
and circumstances in each case), and the denominator comprised of a 
factor representing the present value of $1 per year for the period of 
the remaining term of the lease including the options to renew, extend, 
or continue the lease at an appropriate rate of interest.
    (ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. Lessee A acquires a lease with respect to unimproved 
property at a cost of $100,000 at which time there are 21 years 
remaining in the original term of the lease with two renewal options of 
21 years each. The lease provides for a uniform annual rental for the 
remaining term of the lease and the renewal periods. It has been 
determined that this is an appropriate case for the application of the 
principles used to measure the present value of an annuity. Assume that 
in this case the appropriate rate of interest is 5 percent. By applying 
the tables (Inwood) used to measure the present value of an annuity of 
$1 per year, the factor representing the present value of $1 per annum 
for 21 years at 5% is ascertained to be 12.821, and the factor 
representing the present value of $1 per annum for 63 years at 5% is 
19.075. The portion of the cost of the lease ($100,000) attributable to 
the remaining term of the original lease (21 years) is 67.21% or $67,210 
determined as follows:

                        12.821/19.075 or 67.21%.

    (6) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. Lessee A constructs a building on land leased from lessor 
B. The construction is commenced on August 1, 1958, and is completed and 
placed in service on December 31, 1958, at which time A has 15 years 
remaining on his lease with an option to renew for an additional 20 
years. Lessee A computes his taxable income on a calendar year basis. 
Lessee A was not, on July 28, 1958, under a binding legal obligation to 
erect the building. The building has an estimated useful life of 30 
years. A is not related to B. Since the portion of the term of the lease 
(without regard to any renewals) remaining upon completion of the 
building (15 years) is less than 60 percent of the estimated useful life 
of the building (60 percent of 30 years, or 18 years), the term of the 
lease shall be treated as including the remaining portion of the 
original lease period and the renewal period, or 35 years. Since the 
estimated useful life of the building (30 years) is less than 35 years, 
the cost of the building shall, in accord with paragraph (b)(3) of this 
section, be depreciated under the provisions of section 167, over its 
estimated useful life. If, however,

[[Page 210]]

lessee A establishes, as of the close of the taxable year 1958, it is 
more probable that the lease will not be renewed than that it will be 
renewed, then in such case the remaining term of the lease shall be 
treated as including only the 15-year period remaining in the original 
lease. Since this is less than the estimated useful life of the 
building, the remaining cost of the building would be amortized over 
such 15-year period under the provisions of section 162 and the 
regulations thereunder.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that A 
has 21 years remaining on his lease with an option to renew for an 
additional 10 years. Section 178(a) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section 
do not apply since the term of the lease remaining on the date of 
completion of the building (21 years) is not less than 60 percent of the 
estimated useful life of the building (60 percent of 30 years, or 18 
years).
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that A 
has no renewal option until July 1, 1961, when lessor B grants A an 
option to renew the lease for a 10-year period. Because there is no 
option to renew the lease, the term of the lease is, for the taxable 
years 1959 and 1960 and for the first six months of the taxable year 
1961, determined without regard to section 178(a). However, as of July 
1, 1961, the date the renewal option is granted, section 178(a) and 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section become applicable since the portion of 
the term of the lease remaining upon completion of the building (15 
years) was less than 60 percent of the estimated useful life of the 
building (60 percent of 30 years, or 18 years). As of July 1, 1961, the 
term of the lease shall be treated as including the remaining portion of 
the original lease period (12 1/2 years) and the 10-year renewal period, 
or 22 1/2 years, unless lessee A can establish that, as of the close of 
1961, it is more probable that the lease will not be renewed than that 
it will be.
    Example 4. On January 1, 1959, lessee A pays $10,000 to acquire a 
lease for 20 years with two options exercisable by him to renew for 
periods of 5 years each. Of the total $10,000 cost to acquire the lease, 
$7,000 was paid for the original 20-year lease period and the balance of 
$3,000 was paid for the renewal options. Since the $7,000 cost of 
acquiring the initial lease is less than 75 percent of the $10,000 cost 
of the lease ($7,500), the term of the lease shall be treated as 
including the original lease period and the 2 renewal periods, or 30 
years. However, if lessee A establishes that, as of the close of the 
taxable year 1959, it is more probable that the lease will not be 
renewed than that it will be renewed, the term of the lease shall be 
treated as including only the original lease period, or 20 years.
    Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example (4), except that the 
portion of the total cost ($10,000) paid for the 20-year original lease 
period is $8,000. Since the $8,000 cost of acquiring the original lease 
is not less than 75 percent of the $10,000 cost of the lease ($7,500), 
section 178(a) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply.

    (c) Application of section 178(a) where lessee gives notice to 
lessor of intention to exercise option. (1) If the lessee has given 
notice to the lessor of his intention to renew, extend, or continue a 
lease, the lessee shall, for purposes of applying the provisions of 
section 178(a) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section, take into account 
such renewal or extension in determining the portion of the term of the 
lease remaining upon the completion of the improvements or on the date 
of the acquisition of the lease.
    (2) The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Lessee A constructs a building on land leased from lessor 
B. The construction was commenced on September 1, 1958, and was 
completed and placed in service on December 31, 1958. Lessee A was not, 
on July 28, 1958, under a binding legal obligation to erect the 
building. A and B are not related. At the time the building was 
completed (December 31, 1958), lessee A had 3 years remaining on his 
lease with 2 options to renew for periods of 20 years each. The 
estimated useful life of the building is 50 years. Prior to completion 
of the building, lessee A gives notice to lessor B of his intention to 
exercise the first 20-year option. Therefore, the portion of the term of 
the lease remaining on January 1, 1959, shall be the 3 years remaining 
in the original lease period plus the 20-year renewal period, or 23 
years. Since the term of the lease remaining upon completion of the 
building (23 years) is less than 60 percent of the estimated useful life 
of the building (60 percent of 50 years, or 30 years), the provisions of 
section 178(a) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section are applicable. 
Accordingly, the term of the lease shall be treated as including the 
aggregate of the remaining term of the original lease (23 years) and the 
second 20-year renewal period or 43 years, unless lessee A establishes 
that it is more probable that the lease will not be renewed, extended, 
or continued under the second 20-year option than that it will be so 
renewed, extended, or continued under such option. If this is 
established by lessee A, then the term of the lease shall be treated as 
including only the remaining portion of the original lease period and 
the first 20-year renewal period, or 23 years.

[[Page 211]]

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the 
estimated useful life of the building is 30 years. Since the term of the 
lease remaining upon completion of the building (23 years) is not less 
than 60 percent of the estimated life of the building (60 percent of 30 
years, or 18 years), the provisions of section 178(a) and paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section do not apply.
    Example 3. If in Examples (1) and (2), the lessee failed to give 
notice of his intention to exercise the renewal option, the renewal 
period would not be taken into account in computing the percentage 
requirements under section 178(a) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 
Thus, unless lessee A establishes the required probability, the 
provisions of section 178(a) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section would 
apply in both examples since the term of the lease remaining upon 
completion of the building (3 years) is less than 60 percent of the 
estimated useful life of the building in either example (60 percent of 
50 years, or 30 years; 60 percent of 30 years, or 18 years).

    (d) Application of section 178 where lessee is related to lessor. 
(1)(i) If the lessee and lessor are related persons within the meaning 
of section 178(b)(2) and Sec. 1.178-2 at any time during the taxable 
year, the lease shall be treated as including a period of not less 
duration than the remaining estimated useful life of improvements made 
by the lessee on leased property for purposes of determining the amount 
of deduction allowable to the lessee for such taxable year for 
depreciation or amortization in respect of any building erected or other 
improvements made on leased property. If the lessee and lessor cease to 
be related persons during any taxable year, then for the immediately 
following and subsequent taxable years during which they continue to be 
unrelated, the amount allowable to the lessee as a deduction shall be 
determined without reference to section 178(b) and in accordance with 
section 178(a) or section 178(c), whichever is applicable.
    (ii) Although the related lessee and lessor rule of section 178(b) 
and Sec. 1.178-2 does not apply in determining the period over which the 
cost of acquiring a lease may be amortized, the relationship between a 
lessee and lessor will be a significant factor in applying section 178 
(a) and (c) in cases in which the lease may be renewed, extended, or 
continued pursuant to an option or options exercisable by the lessee.
    (2) The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Lessee A constructs a building on land leased from lessor 
B. The construction was commenced on August 1, 1958, and was completed 
and put in service on December 31, 1958. Lessee A was not on July 28, 
1958, under a binding legal obligation to erect the building. On the 
completion date of the building, lessee A had 20 years remaining in his 
original lease period with an option to renew for an additional 20 
years. The building has an estimated useful life of 50 years. During the 
taxable years 1959 and 1960, A and B are related persons within the 
meaning of section 178(b)(2) and Sec. 1.178-2, but they are not related 
persons at any time during the taxable year 1961 or during any 
subsequent taxable year. Since A and B are related persons during the 
taxable years 1959 and 1960, the term of the lease shall, for each of 
those years, be treated as 50 years. Section 178(a) and paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section become applicable in the taxable year 1961 since A and B 
are not related persons at any time during that year and because the 
portion of the original lease period remaining at the time the building 
was completed (20 years) is less than 60 percent of the estimated useful 
life of the building (60 percent of 50 years, or 30 years). Thus, the 
term of the lease shall, beginning on January 1, 1961, be treated as 
including the remaining portion of the original lease period (18 years) 
and the renewal period (20 years), or 38 years, unless lessee A can 
establish that, as of the close of the taxable year 1961 or any 
subsequent taxable year, it is more probable that the lease will not be 
renewed than that it will be renewed. Example 2. Assume the same facts 
as in Example (1), except that the estimated useful life of the building 
is 30 years. During the taxable years 1959 and 1960, the term of the 
lease shall be treated as 30 years. For the taxable year 1961, however, 
neither section 178(a) nor section 178(b) apply since the percentage 
requirement of section 178(a) and paragraph (b) of this section are not 
satisfied and A and B are not related persons within the meaning of 
section 178(b)(2) and Sec. 1.178-2.

Sec. 1.178-2   Related lessee and lessor.

    (a) For purposes of section 178 and Sec. 1.178-1, a lessor and 
lessee shall be considered to be related persons if:
    (1) The lessor and lessee are members of an affiliated group, as 
defined in section 1504 and the regulations thereunder; or
    (2) The relationship between the lessor and lessee is one described 
in section 267(b), except that the phrase ``80

[[Page 212]]

percent or more'' shall be substituted for the phrase ``more than 50 
percent'' wherever such phrase appears in section 267(b).
    (b) In the application of section 267(b) for purposes of section 
178, the rules provided in section 267(c) shall apply, except that the 
family of an individual shall include only his spouse, ancestors, and 
lineal descendants. Thus, if the lessee is the brother or sister of the 
lessor, the lessee and lessor will not be considered to be related 
persons for purposes of section 178 and Sec. 1.178-1. If the lessor 
leases property to a corporation of which he owns 80 percent or more in 
value of the outstanding stock, the lessor and lessee shall be 
considered to be related persons. On the other hand, if the lessor 
leases property to a corporation of which he owns less than 80 percent 
in value of the outstanding stock and his brother owns the remaining 
stock, the lessor and lessee will not be considered to be related 
persons.
    (c) If a relationship described in section 267(b) exists 
independently of family status, the brother-sister exception does not 
apply. For example, if the lessor leases property to the fiduciary of a 
trust of which he is the grantor, the lessor and lessee will be 
considered to be related persons for purposes of section 178. This 
result obtains whether or not the fiduciary is the brother or sister of 
the lessor since the disqualifying relationship exists because of the 
grantor-fiduciary status and not because of family status.

<R05>
Sec. 1.178-3   Reasonable certainty test.

    (a) In any case in which neither section 178 (a) nor (b) applies, 
the determination as to the amount of the deduction allowable to a 
lessee for any taxable year for depreciation or amortization in respect 
of any building erected, or other improvements made, on leased property, 
or in respect of any cost of acquiring a lease, shall be made with 
reference to the original term of the lease (excluding any period for 
which the lease may subsequently be renewed, extended, or continued 
pursuant to an option exercisable by the lessee) unless the lease has 
been renewed, extended, or continued, or the facts show with reasonable 
certainty that the lease will be renewed, extended, or continued. In a 
case in which the facts show with reasonable certainty that the lease 
will be renewed, extended, or continued, the term of the lease shall, 
beginning with the taxable year in which such reasonable certainty is 
shown, be treated as including the period or periods for which it is 
reasonably certain that the lease will be renewed, extended, or 
continued. If the lessee has given notice to the lessor of his intention 
to renew, extend, or continue a lease, the lease shall be considered as 
renewed, extended, or continued for the periods specified in the notice. 
See paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.178-1.
    (b) The reasonable certainty test is applicable to each option to 
which the lease is subject. Thus, in a case of two successive options, 
the facts in a particular taxable year may show with reasonable 
certainty that the lease will be renewed pursuant to an exercise of only 
the first option; and, beginning with such year, the term of the lease 
will be treated as including the first option, but not the second. If in 
a subsequent taxable year the facts show with reasonable certainty that 
the second option will also be exercised, the term of the lease shall, 
beginning with such subsequent taxable year, be treated as including 
both options. Although the related lessee and lessor rule of section 
178(b) and paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.178-1 does not apply in determining 
the period over which the cost of acquiring a lease may be amortized, 
the relationship between the lessee and lessor will be a significant 
factor in determining whether the ``reasonable certainty'' rule of 
section 178(c) and this section applies.
    (c) The application of the provisions of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation A leases land from lessor B for a period of 
30 years beginning with January 1, 1958. Corporation A and lessor B are 
not related persons. The lease provides that Corporation A will have two 
renewal options of 5 years each at the same annual rental as specified 
in the lease for the initial 30 years. Corporation A constructs a 
factory building on the leased land at a cost of $100,000. Corporation A 
was not, on July 28, 1958, under a binding legal obligation to erect the 
building. The construction was

[[Page 213]]

commenced on August 1, 1958, and was completed and placed in service on 
December 31, 1958. On January 1, 1959, Corporation A has 29 years 
remaining in the initial term of the lease. The estimated useful life of 
the building on January 1, 1959, is 40 years. The location of the leased 
property is particularly suitable for Corporation A's business and the 
annual rental of the property is lower than A would have to pay for 
other suitable property. No factors are present which establish that 
these conditions will not continue to exist beyond the initial term of 
the lease. Since the period remaining in the initial term of the lease 
on January 1, 1959 (29 years) is not less than 60 percent of the 
estimated useful life of the building (60 percent of 40 years, or 24 
years), the provisions of section 178(a) and paragraph (b)(1) of 
Sec. 1.178-1 do not apply, and since Corporation A and lessor B are not 
related, section 178(b) and paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.178-1 do not apply. 
However, since the facts show with reasonable certainty that Corporation 
A will renew the lease for the period of the two options (10 years), the 
cost of the building shall be amortized over the term of the lease, 
including the two renewal options, or 39 years.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that a 
term of 30 years is the longest period that lessor B is willing to lease 
the unimproved property; that there was no agreement that Corporation A 
will have any renewal options; and that any other location would be as 
suitable for Corporation A's business as the leased property. Since the 
facts do not show with reasonable certainty that the initial term of the 
lease will be renewed, extended, or continued, Corporation A shall 
amortize the cost of the building over the remaining term of the lease, 
or 29 years.

<R05>
Sec. 1.179-1  Election to expense certain depreciable assets.

    (a) In general. Section 179(a) allows a taxpayer to elect to expense 
the cost (as defined in Sec. 1.179-4(d)), or a portion of the cost, of 
section 179 property (as defined in Sec. 1.179-4(a)) for the taxable 
year in which the property is placed in service (as defined in 
Sec. 1.179-4(e)). The election is not available for trusts, estates, and 
certain noncorporate lessors. See paragraph (i)(2) of this section for 
rules concerning noncorporate lessors. However, section 179(b) provides 
certain limitations on the amount that a taxpayer may elect to expense 
in any one taxable year. See Secs. 1.179-2 and 1.179-3 for rules 
relating to the dollar and taxable income limitations and the carryover 
of disallowed deduction rules. For rules describing the time and manner 
of making an election under section 179, see Sec. 1.179-5. For the 
effective date, see Sec. 1.179-6.
    (b) Cost subject to expense. The expense deduction under section 179 
is allowed for the entire cost or a portion of the cost of one or more 
items of section 179 property. This expense deduction is subject to the 
limitations of section 179(b) and Sec. 1.179-2. The taxpayer may select 
the properties that are subject to the election as well as the portion 
of each property's cost to expense.
    (c) Proration not required--(1) In general. The expense deduction 
under section 179 is determined without any proration based on--
    (i) The period of time the section 179 property has been in service 
during the taxable year; or
    (ii) The length of the taxable year in which the property is placed 
in service.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section.


    Example. On December 1, 1991, X, a calendar-year corporation, 
purchases and places in service section 179 property costing $20,000. 
For the taxable year ending December 31, 1991, X may elect to claim a 
section 179 expense deduction on the property (subject to the 
limitations imposed under section 179(b)) without proration of its cost 
for the number of days in 1991 during which the property was in service.


    (d) Partial business use--(1) In general. If a taxpayer uses section 
179 property for trade or business as well as other purposes, the 
portion of the cost of the property attributable to the trade or 
business use is eligible for expensing under section 179 provided that 
more than 50 percent of the property's use in

[[Page 215]]

the taxable year is for trade or business purposes. The limitations of 
section179(b) and Sec. 1.179-2 are applied to the portion of the cost 
attributable to the trade or business use.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

    Example. A purchases section 179 property costing $10,000 in 1991 
for which 80 percent of its use will be in A's trade or business. The 
cost of the property adjusted to reflect the business use of the 
property is $8,000 (80 percent  x  $10,000). Thus, A may elect to 
expense up to $8,000 of the cost of the property (subject to the 
limitations imposed under section 179(b) and Sec. 1.179-2).

    (3) Additional rules that may apply. If a section 179 election is 
made for ``listed property'' within the meaning of section 280F(d)(4) 
and there is personal use of the property, section 280F(d)(1), which 
provides rules that coordinate section 179 with the section 280F 
limitation on the amount of depreciation, may apply. If section 179 
property is no longer predominantly used in the taxpayer's trade or 
business, paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) of this section, relating to 
recapture of the section 179 deduction, may apply.
    (e) Change in use; recapture--(1) In general. If a taxpayer's 
section 179 property is not used predominantly in a trade or business of 
the taxpayer at any time before the end of the property's recovery 
period, the taxpayer must recapture in the taxable year in which the 
section 179 property is not used predominantly in a trade or business 
any benefit derived from expensing such property. The benefit derived 
from expensing the property is equal to the excess of the amount 
expensed under this section over the total amount that would have been 
allowable for prior taxable years and the taxable year of recapture as a 
deduction under section 168 (had section 179 not been elected) for the 
portion of the cost of the property to which the expensing relates 
(regardless of whether such excess reduced the taxpayer's tax 
liability). For purposes of the preceding sentence (i) the ``amount 
expensed under this section'' shall not include any amount that was not 
allowed as a deduction to a taxpayer because the taxpayer's aggregate 
amount of allowable section 179 expenses exceeded the section 179(b) 
dollar limitation, and (ii) in the case of an individual who does not 
elect to itemize deductions under section 63(g) in the taxable year of 
recapture, the amount allowable as a deduction under section 168 in the 
taxable year of recapture shall be determined by treating property used 
in the production of income other than rents or royalties as being 
property used for personal purposes. The amount to be recaptured shall 
be treated as ordinary income for the taxable year in which the property 
is no longer used predominantly in a trade or business of the taxpayer. 
For taxable years following the year of recapture, the taxpayer's 
deductions under section 1688(a) shall be determined as if no section 
179 election with respect to the property had been made. However, see 
section 280F(d)(1) relating to the coordination of section 179 with the 
limitation on the amount of depreciation for luxury automobiles and 
where certain property is used for personal purposes. If the recapture 
rules of both section 280F(b)(2) and this paragraph (e)(1) apply to an 
item of section 179 property, the amount of recapture for such property 
shall be determined only under the rules of section 280F(b)(2).
    (2) Predominant use. Property will be treated as not used 
predominantly in a trade or business of the taxpayer if 50 percent or 
more of the use of such property during any taxable year within the 
recapture period is for a use other than in a trade or business of the 
taxpayer. If during any taxable year of the recapture period the 
taxpayer disposes of the property (other than in a disposition to which 
section 1245(a) applies) or ceases to use the property in a trade or 
business in a manner that had the taxpayer claimed a credit under 
section 38 for such property such disposition or cessation in use would 
cause recapture under section 47, the property will be treated as not 
used in a trade or business of the taxpayer. However, for purposes of 
applying the recapture rules of section 47 pursuant to the preceding 
sentence, converting the use of the property from use in trade or 
business to use in the production of income will be treated as a 
conversion to personal use.

[[Page 216]]

    (3) Basis; application with section 1245. The basis of property with 
respect to which there is recapture under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section shall be increased immediately before the event resulting in 
such recapture by the amount recaptured. If section 1245(a) applies to a 
disposition of property, there is no recapture under paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section.
    (4) Carryover of disallowed deduction. See Sec. 1.179-3 for rules on 
applying the recapture provisions of this paragraph (e) when a taxpayer 
has a carryover of disallowed deduction.
    (5) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section.

    Example. A, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and places in 
service on January 1, 1991, section 179 property costing $15,000. The 
property is 5-year property for section 168 purposes and is the only 
item of depreciable property placed in service by A during 1991. A 
properly elects to expense $10,000 of the cost and elects under section 
168(b)(5) to depreciate the remaining cost under the straight-line 
method. On January 1, 1992, A converts the property from use in A's 
business to use for the production of income, and A uses the property in 
the latter capacity for the entire year. A elects to itemize deductions 
for 1992. Because the property was not predominantly used in A's trade 
or business in 1992, A must recapture any benefit derived from expensing 
the property under section 179. Had A not elected to expense the $10,000 
in 1991, A would have been entitled to deduct, under section 168, 10 
percent of the $10,000 in 1991, and 20 percent of the $10,000 in 1992. 
Therefore, A must include $7,000 in ordinary income for the 1992 taxable 
year, the excess of $10,000 (the section 179 expense amount) over $3,000 
(30 percent of $10,000).

    (f) Basis--(1) In general. A taxpayer who elects to expense under 
section 179 must reduce the depreciable basis of the section 179 
property by the amount of the section 179 expense deduction.
    (2) Special rules for partnerships and S corporations. Generally, 
the basis of a partnership or S corporation's section 179 property must 
be reduced to reflect the amount of section 179 expense elected by the 
partnership or S corporation. This reduction must be made in the basis 
of partnership or S corporation property even if the limitations of 
section 179(b) and Sec. 1.179-2 prevent a partner in a partnership or a 
shareholder in an S corporation from deducting all or a portion of the 
amount of the section 179 expense allocated by the partnership or S 
corporation. See Sec. 1.179-3 for rules on applying the basis provisions 
of this paragraph (f) when a person has a carryover of disallowed 
deduction.
    (3) Special rules with respect to trusts and estates which are 
partners or S corporation shareholders. Since the section 179 election 
is not available for trusts or estates, a partner or S corporation 
shareholder that is a trust or estate may not deduct its allocable share 
of the section 179 expense elected by the partnership or S corporation. 
The partnership or S corporation's basis in section 179 property shall 
not be reduced to reflect any portion of the section 179 expense that is 
allocable to the trust or estate. Accordingly, the partnership or S 
corporation may claim a depreciation deduction under section 168 or a 
section 38 credit (if available) with respect to any depreciable basis 
resulting from the trust or estate's inability to claim its allocable 
portion of the section 179 expense.
    (g) Disallowance of the section 38 credit. If a taxpayer elects to 
expense under section 179, no section 38 credit is allowable for the 
portion of the cost expensed. In addition, no section 38 credit shall be 
allowed under section 48(d) to a lessee of property for the portion of 
the cost of the property that the lessor expensed under section 179.
    (h) Partnerships and S corporations--(1) In general. In the case of 
property purchased and placed in service by a partnership or an S 
corporation, the determination of whether the property is section 179 
property is made at the partnership or S corporation level. The election 
to expense the cost of section 179 property is made by the partnership 
or the S corporation. See sections 703(b), 1363(c), 6221, 6231(a)(3), 
6241, and 6245.
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

    Example. A owns certain residential rental property as an 
investment. A and others form ABC partnership whose function is to rent 
and manage such property. A and ABC partnership file their income tax 
returns on a calendar-year basis. In 1991, ABC partnership purchases and 
places in service office

[[Page 217]]

furniture costing $20,000 to be used in the active conduct of ABC's 
business. Although the office furniture is used with respect to an 
investment activity of A, the furniture is being used in the active 
conduct of ABC's trade or business. Therefore, because the determination 
of whether property is section 179 property is made at the partnership 
level, the office furniture is section 179 property and ABC may elect to 
expense a portion of its cost under section 179.


    (i) Leasing of section 179 property--(1) In general. A lessor of 
section 179 property who is treated as the owner of the property for 
Federal tax purposes will be entitled to the section 179 expense 
deduction if the requirements of section 179 and the regulations 
thereunder are met. These requirements will not be met if the lessor 
merely holds the property for the production of income. For certain 
leases entered into prior to January 1, 1984, the safe harbor provisions 
of section 168(f)(8) apply in determining whether an agreement is 
treated as a lease for Federal tax purposes.
    (2) Noncorporate lessor. In determining the class of taxpayers 
(other than an estate or trust) for which section 179 is applicable, 
section 179(d)(5) provides that if a taxpayer is a noncorporate lessor 
(i.e., a person who is not a corporation and is a lessor), the taxpayer 
shall not be entitled to claim a section 179 expense for section 179 
property purchased and leased by the taxpayer unless the taxpayer has 
satisfied all of the requirements of section 179(d)(5) (A) or (B).
    (j) Application of sections 263 and 263A. Under section 
263(a)(1)(G), expenditures for which a deduction is allowed under 
section 179 and this section are excluded from capitalization under 
section 263(a). Under this paragraph (j), amounts allowed as a deduction 
under section 179 and this section are excluded from the application of 
the uniform capitalization rules of section 263A.
    (k) Cross references. See section 453(i) and the regulations 
thereunder with respect to installment sales of section 179 property. 
See section 1033(g)(3) and the regulations thereunder relating to 
condemnation of outdoor advertising displays. See section 1245(a) and 
the regulations thereunder with respect to recapture rules for section 
179 property.

<R05>
Sec. 1.179-2  Limitations on amount subject to section 179 election.

    (a) In general. Sections 179(b) (1) and (2) limit the aggregate cost 
of section 179 property that a taxpayer may elect to expense under 
section 179 for any one taxable year (dollar limitation). See paragraph 
(b) of this section. Section 179(b)(3)(A) limits the aggregate cost of 
section 179 property that a taxpayer may deduct in any taxable year 
(taxable income limitation). See paragraph (c) of this section. Any cost 
that is elected to be expensed but that is not currently deductible 
because of the taxable income limitation may be carried forward to the 
next taxable year (carryover of disallowed deduction). See Sec. 1.179-3 
for rules relating to carryovers of disallowed deductions. See also 
sections 280F(a), (b), and (d)(1) relating to the coordination of 
section 179 with the limitations on the amount of depreciation for 
luxury automobiles and other listed property. The dollar and taxable 
income limitations apply to each taxpayer and not to each trade or 
business in which the taxpayer has an interest.
    (b) Dollar limitation--(1) In general. The aggregate cost of section 
179 property that a taxpayer may elect to expense under section 179 for 
any taxable year is $10,000 reduced (but not below zero) by the amount 
of any excess section 179 property (described in paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section) placed in service during the taxable year.
    (2) Excess section 179 property. The amount of any excess section 
179 property for a taxable year equals the excess (if any) of--
    (i) The cost of section 179 property placed in service by the 
taxpayer in the taxable year; over
    (ii) $200,000.
    (3) Application to partnerships--(i) In general. The dollar 
limitation of this paragraph (b) applies to the partnership as well as 
to each partner. In applying the dollar limitation to a taxpayer that is 
a partner in one or more partnerships, the partner's share of section 
179 expenses allocated to the

[[Page 218]]

partner from each partnership is aggregated with any nonpartnership 
section 179 expenses of the taxpayer for the taxable year. However, in 
determining the excess section 179 property placed in service by a 
partner in a taxable year, the cost of section 179 property placed in 
service by the partnership is not attributed to any partner.
    (ii) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

    Example. During 1991, CD, a calendar-year partnership, purchases and 
places in service section 179 property costing $150,000 and elects under 
section 179(c) and Sec. 1.179-5 to expense $10,000 of the cost of that 
property. CD properly allocates to C, a calendar-year taxpayer and a 
partner in CD, $5,000 of section 179 expenses (C's distributive share of 
CD's section 179 expenses for 1991). In applying the dollar limitation 
to C for 1991, C must include the $5,000 of section 179 expenses 
allocated from CD. However, in determining the amount of any excess 
section 179 property C placed in service during 1991, C does not include 
any of the cost of section 179 property placed in service by CD, 
including the $5,000 of cost represented by the $5,000 of section 179 
expenses allocated to C by the partnership.

    (iii) Partner's share of section 179 expenses. Section 704 and the 
regulations thereunder govern the determination of a partner's share of 
a partnership's section 179 expenses for any taxable year. However, no 
allocation among partners of the section 179 expenses may be modified 
after the due date of the partnership return (without regard to 
extensions of time) for the taxable year for which the election under 
section 179 is made.
    (iv) Taxable year. If the taxable years of a partner and the 
partnership do not coincide, then for purposes of section 179, the 
amount of the partnership's section 179 expenses attributable to a 
partner for a taxable year is determined under section 706 and the 
regulations thereunder (generally the partner's distributive share of 
partnership section 179 expenses for the partnership year that ends with 
or within the partner's taxable year).
    (v) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section.

    Example. AB partnership has a taxable year ending January 31. A, a 
partner of AB, has a taxable year ending December 31. AB purchases and 
places in service section 179 property on March 10, 1991, and elects to 
expense a portion of the cost of that property under section 179. Under 
section 706 and Sec. 1.706-1(a)(1), A will be unable to claim A's 
distributive share of any of AB's section 179 expenses attributable to 
the property placed in service on March 10, 1991, until A's taxable year 
ending December 31, 1992.

    (4) S Corporations. Rules similar to those contained in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section apply in the case of S corporations (as defined 
in section 1361(a)) and their shareholders. Each shareholder's share of 
the section 179 expenses of an S corporation is determined under section 
1366.
    (5) Joint returns--(i) In General. A husband and wife who file a 
joint income tax return under section 6013(a) are treated as one 
taxpayer in determining the amount of the dollar limitation under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, regardless of which spouse purchased 
the property or placed it in service.
    (ii) Joint returns filed after separate returns. In the case of a 
husband and wife who elect under section 6013(b) to file a joint income 
tax return for a taxable year after the time prescribed by law for 
filing the return for such taxable year has expired, the dollar 
limitation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is the lesser of--
    (A) The dollar limitation (as determined under paragraph (b)(5)(i) 
of this section); or
    (B) The aggregate cost of section 179 property elected to be 
expensed by the husband and wife on their separate returns.
    (iii) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.

    Example. During 1991, Mr. and Mrs. B, both calendar-year taxpayers, 
purchase and place in service section 179 property costing $100,000. On 
their separate returns for 1991, Mr. B elects to expense $3,000 of 
section 179 property as an expense and Mrs. B elects to expense $4,000. 
After the due date of the return they elect under section 6013(b) to 
file a joint income tax return for 1991. The dollar limitation for their 
joint income tax return is $7,000, the lesser of the dollar limitation 
($10,000) or the aggregate cost elected to be expensed under section 179 
on their separate returns ($3,000 elected by Mr. B plus $4,000 elected 
by Mrs. B, or $7,000).


[[Page 219]]


    (6) Married individuals filing separately--(i) In general. In the 
case of an individual who is married but files a separate income tax 
return for a taxable year, the dollar limitation of this paragraph (b) 
for such taxable year is the amount that would be determined under 
paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section if the individual filed a joint 
income tax return under section 6013(a) multiplied by either the 
percentage elected by the individual under this paragraph (b)(6) or 50 
percent. The election in the preceding sentence is made in accordance 
with the requirements of section 179(c) and Sec. 1.179-5. However, the 
amount determined under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section must be 
multiplied by 50 percent if either the individual or the individual's 
spouse does not elect a percentage under this paragraph (b)(6) or the 
sum of the percentages elected by the individual and the individual's 
spouse does not equal 100 percent. For purposes of this paragraph 
(b)(6), marital status is determined under section 7703 and the 
regulations thereunder.
    (ii) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.

    Example. Mr. and Mrs. D, both calendar-year taxpayers, file separate 
income tax returns for 1991. During 1991, Mr. D places $195,000 of 
section 179 property in service and Mrs. D places $9,000 of section 179 
property in service. Neither of them elects a percentage under paragraph 
(b)(6)(i) of this section. The 1991 dollar limitation for both Mr. D and 
Mrs. D is determined by multiplying by 50 percent the dollar limitation 
that would apply had they filed a joint income tax return. Had Mr. and 
Mrs. D filed a joint return for 1991, the dollar limitation would have 
been $6,000, $10,000 reduced by the excess section 179 property they 
placed in service during 1991 ($195,000 placed in service by Mr. D plus 
$9,000 placed in service by Mrs. D less $200,000, or $4,000). Thus, the 
1991 dollar limitation for Mr. and Mrs. D is $3,000 each ($6,000 
multiplied by 50 percent).

    (7) Component members of a controlled group--(i) In general. 
Component members of a controlled group (as defined in Sec. 1.179-4(f)) 
on December 31 are treated as one taxpayer in applying the dollar 
limitation of sections 179(b) (1) and (2) and this paragraph (b). The 
expense deduction may be taken by any one component member or allocated 
(for the taxable year of each member that includes that December 31) 
among the several members in any manner. Any allocation of the expense 
deduction must be pursuant to an allocation by the common parent 
corporation if a consolidated return is filed for all component members 
of the group, or in accordance with an agreement entered into by the 
members of the group if separate returns are filed. If a consolidated 
return is filed by some component members of the group and separate 
returns are filed by other component members, the common parent of the 
group filing the consolidated return must enter into an agreement with 
those members that do not join in filing the consolidated return 
allocating the amount between the group filing the consolidated return 
and the other component members of the controlled group that do not join 
in filing the consolidated return. The amount of the expense allocated 
to any component member, however, may not exceed the cost of section 179 
property actually purchased and placed in service by the member in the 
taxable year. If the component members have different taxable years, the 
term taxable year in sections 179(b) (1) and (2) means the taxable year 
of the member whose taxable year begins on the earliest date.
    (ii) Statement to be filed. If a consolidated return is filed, the 
common parent corporation must file a separate statement attached to the 
income tax return on which the election is made to claim an expense 
deduction under section 179. See Sec. 1.179-5. If separate returns are 
filed by some or all component members of the group, each component 
member not included in a consolidated return must file a separate 
statement attached to the income tax return on which an election is made 
to claim a deduction under section 179. The statement must include the 
name, address, employer identification number, and the taxable year of 
each component member of the controlled group, a copy of the allocation 
agreement signed by persons duly authorized to act on behalf of the 
component members, and a description of the manner in which the 
deduction under section 179 has been divided among the component 
members.

[[Page 220]]

    (iii) Revocation. If a consolidated return is filed for all 
component members of the group, an allocation among such members of the 
expense deduction under section 179 may not be revoked after the due 
date of the return (including extensions of time) of the common parent 
corporation for the taxable year for which an election to take an 
expense deduction is made. If some or all of the component members of 
the controlled group file separate returns for taxable years including a 
particular December 31 for which an election to take the expense 
deduction is made, the allocation as to all members of the group may not 
be revoked after the due date of the return (including extensions of 
time) of the component member of the controlled group whose taxable year 
that includes such December 31 ends on the latest date.
    (c) Taxable income limitation--(1) In general. The aggregate cost of 
section 179 property elected to be expensed under section 179 that may 
be deducted for any taxable year may not exceed the aggregate amount of 
taxable income of the taxpayer for such taxable year that is derived 
from the active conduct by the taxpayer of any trade or business during 
the taxable year. For purposes of section 179(b)(3) and this paragraph 
(c), the aggregate amount of taxable income derived from the active 
conduct by an individual, a partnership, or an S corporation of any 
trade or business is computed by aggregating the net income (or loss) 
from all of the trades or businesses actively conducted by the 
individual, partnership, or S corporation during the taxable year. Items 
of income that are derived from the active conduct of a trade or 
business include section 1231 gains (or losses) from the trade or 
business and interest from working capital of the trade or business. 
Taxable income derived from the active conduct of a trade or business is 
computed without regard to the deduction allowable under section 179, 
any section 164(f) deduction, any net operating loss carryback or 
carryforward, and deductions suspended under any section of the Code. 
See paragraph (c)(6) of this section for rules on determining whether a 
taxpayer is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business for 
this purpose.
    (2) Application to partnerships and partners--(i) In general. The 
taxable income limitation of this paragraph (c) applies to the 
partnership as well as to each partner. Thus, the partnership may not 
allocate to its partners as a section 179 expense deduction for any 
taxable year more than the partnership's taxable income limitation for 
that taxable year, and a partner may not deduct as a section 179 expense 
deduction for any taxable year more than the partner's taxable income 
limitation for that taxable year.
    (ii) Taxable year. If the taxable year of a partner and the 
partnership do not coincide, then for purposes of section 179, the 
amount of the partnership's taxable income attributable to a partner for 
a taxable year is determined under section 706 and the regulations 
thereunder (generally the partner's distributive share of partnership 
taxable income for the partnership year that ends with or within the 
partner's taxable year).
    (iii) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

    Example. AB partnership has a taxable year ending January 31. A, a 
partner of AB, has a taxable year ending December 31. For AB's taxable 
year ending January 31, 1992, AB has taxable income from the active 
conduct of its trade or business of $100,000, $90,000 of which was 
earned during 1991. Under section 706 and Sec. 1.706-1(a)(1), A includes 
A's entire share of partnership taxable income in computing A's taxable 
income limitation for A's taxable year ending December 31, 1992.

    (iv) Taxable income of a partnership. The taxable income (or loss) 
derived from the active conduct by a partnership of any trade or 
business is computed by aggregating the net income (or loss) from all of 
the trades or businesses actively conducted by the partnership during 
the taxable year. The net income (or loss) from a trade or business 
actively conducted by the partnership is determined by taking into 
account the aggregate amount of the partnership's items described in 
section 702(a) (other than credits, tax-exempt income, and guaranteed 
payments under section 707(c)) derived

[[Page 221]]

from that trade or business. For purposes of determining the aggregate 
amount of partnership items, deductions and losses are treated as 
negative income. Any limitation on the amount of a partnership item 
described in section 702(a) which may be taken into account for purposes 
of computing the taxable income of a partner shall be disregarded in 
computing the taxable income of the partnership.
    (v) Partner's share of partnership taxable income. A taxpayer who is 
a partner in a partnership and is engaged in the active conduct of at 
least one of the partnership's trades or businesses includes as taxable 
income derived from the active conduct of a trade or business the amount 
of the taxpayer's allocable share of taxable income derived from the 
active conduct by the partnership of any trade or business (as 
determined under paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section).
    (3) S corporations and S corporation shareholders--(i) In general. 
Rules similar to those contained in paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of 
this section apply in the case of S corporations (as defined in section 
1361(a)) and their shareholders. Each shareholder's share of the taxable 
income of an S corporation is determined under section 1366.
    (ii) Taxable income of an S corporation. The taxable income (or 
loss) derived from the active conduct by an S corporation of any trade 
or business is computed by aggregating the net income (or loss) from all 
of the trades or businesses actively conducted by the S corporation 
during the taxable year. The net income (or loss) from a trade or 
business actively conducted by an S corporation is determined by taking 
into account the aggregate amount of the S corporation's items described 
in section 1366(a) (other than credits, tax-exempt income, and 
deductions for compensation paid to an S corporation's shareholder-
employees) derived from that trade or business. For purposes of 
determining the aggregate amount of S corporation items, deductions and 
losses are treated as negative income. Any limitation on the amount of 
an S corporation item described in section 1366(a) which may be taken 
into account for purposes of computing the taxable income of a 
shareholder shall be disregarded in computing the taxable income of the 
S corporation.
    (iii) Shareholder's share of S corporation taxable income. Rules 
similar to those contained in paragraph (c)(2)(v) and (c)(6)(ii) of this 
section apply to a taxpayer who is a shareholder in an S corporation and 
is engaged in the active conduct of the S corporation's trades or 
businesses.
    (4) Taxable income of a corporation other than an S corporation. The 
aggregate amount of taxable income derived from the active conduct by a 
corporation other than an S corporation of any trade or business is the 
amount of the corporation's taxable income before deducting its net 
operating loss deduction and special deductions (as reported on the 
corporation's income tax return), adjusted to reflect those items of 
income or deduction included in that amount that were not derived by the 
corporation from a trade or business actively conducted by the 
corporation during the taxable year.
    (5) Ordering rule for certain circular problems--(i) In general. A 
taxpayer who elects to expense the cost of section 179 property (the 
deduction of which is subject to the taxable income limitation) also may 
have to apply another Internal Revenue Code section that has a 
limitation based on the taxpayer's taxable income. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, this section provides rules for 
applying the taxable income limitation under section 179 in such a case. 
First, taxable income is computed for the other section of the Internal 
Revenue Code. In computing the taxable income of the taxpayer for the 
other section of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxpayer's section 179 
deduction is computed by assuming that the taxpayer's taxable income is 
determined without regard to the deduction under the other Internal 
Revenue Code section. Next, after reducing taxable income by the amount 
of the section 179 deduction so computed, a hypothetical amount of 
deduction is determined for the other section of the Internal Revenue 
Code. The taxable income limitation of the taxpayer under section 
179(b)(3) and this paragraph (c) then is computed by including that 
hypothetical amount in determining taxable income.

[[Page 222]]

    (ii) Example. The following example illustrates the ordering rule 
described in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section.

    Example. X, a calendar-year corporation, elects to expense $10,000 
of the cost of section 179 property purchased and placed in service 
during 1991. Assume X's dollar limitation is $10,000. X also gives a 
charitable contribution of $5,000 during the taxable year. X's taxable 
income for purposes of both sections 179 and 170(b)(2), but without 
regard to any deduction allowable under either section 179 or section 
170, is $11,000. In determining X's taxable income limitation under 
section 179(b)(3) and this paragraph (c), X must first compute its 
section 170 deduction. However, section 170(b)(2) limits X's charitable 
contribution to 10 percent of its taxable income determined by taking 
into account its section 179 deduction. Paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this 
section provides that in determining X's section 179 deduction for 1991, 
X first computes a hypothetical section 170 deduction by assuming that 
its section 179 deduction is not affected by the section 170 deduction. 
Thus, in computing X's hypothetical section 170 deduction, X's taxable 
income limitation under section 179 is $11,000 and its section 179 
deduction is $10,000. X's hypothetical section 170 deduction is $100 (10 
percent of $1,000 ($11,000 less $10,000 section 179 deduction)). X's 
taxable income limitation for section 179 purposes is then computed by 
deducting the hypothetical charitable contribution of $100 for 1991. 
Thus, X's section 179 taxable income limitation is $10,900 ($11,000 less 
hypothetical $100 section 170 deduction), and its section 179 deduction 
for 1991 is $10,000. X's section 179 deduction so calculated applies for 
all purposes of the Code, including the computation of its actual 
section 170 deduction.

    (6) Active conduct by the taxpayer of a trade or business--(i) Trade 
or business. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.179-4(a), the term 
trade or business has the same meaning as in section 162 and the 
regulations thereunder. Thus, property held merely for the production of 
income or used in an activity not engaged in for profit (as described in 
section 183) does not qualify as section 179 property and taxable income 
derived from property held for the production of income or from an 
activity not engaged in for profit is not taken into account in 
determining the taxable income limitation.
    (ii) Active conduct. For purposes of this section, the determination 
of whether a trade or business is actively conducted by the taxpayer is 
to be made from all the facts and circumstances and is to be applied in 
light of the purpose of the active conduct requirement of section 
179(b)(3)(A). In the context of section 179, the purpose of the active 
conduct requirement is to prevent a passive investor in a trade or 
business from deducting section 179 expenses against taxable income 
derived from that trade or business. Consistent with this purpose, a 
taxpayer generally is considered to actively conduct a trade or business 
if the taxpayer meaningfully participates in the management or 
operations of the trade or business. Generally, a partner is considered 
to actively conduct a trade or business of the partnership if the 
partner meaningfully participates in the management or operations of the 
trade or business. A mere passive investor in a trade or business does 
not actively conduct the trade or business.
    (iii) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section.

    Example. A owns a salon as a sole proprietorship and employs B to 
operate it. A periodically meets with B to review developments relating 
to the business. A also approves the salon's annual budget that is 
prepared by B. B performs all the necessary operating functions, 
including hiring beauticians, acquiring the necessary beauty supplies, 
and writing the checks to pay all bills and the beauticians' salaries. 
In 1991, B purchased, as provided for in the salon's annual budget, 
equipment costing $9,500 for use in the active conduct of the salon. 
There were no other purchases of section 179 property during 1991. A's 
net income from the salon, before any section 179 deduction, totaled 
$8,000. A also is a partner in PRS, a calendar-year partnership, which 
owns a grocery store. C, a partner in PRS, runs the grocery store for 
the partnership, making all the management and operating decisions. PRS 
did not purchase any section 179 property during 1991. A's allocable 
share of partnership net income was $6,000. Based on the facts and 
circumstances, A meaningfully participates in the management of the 
salon. However, A does not meaningfully participate in the management or 
operations of the trade or business of PRS. Under section 179(b)(3)(A) 
and this paragraph (c), A's aggregate taxable income derived from the 
active conduct by A of any trade or business is $8,000, the net income 
from the salon.

    (iv) Employees. For purposes of this section, employees are 
considered to be engaged in the active conduct of the trade or business 
of their employment.

[[Page 223]]

Thus, wages, salaries, tips, and other compensation (not reduced by 
unreimbursed employee business expenses) derived by a taxpayer as an 
employee are included in the aggregate amount of taxable income of the 
taxpayer under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (7) Joint returns--(i) In general. The taxable income limitation of 
this paragraph (c) is applied to a husband and wife who file a joint 
income tax return under section 6013(a) by aggregating the taxable 
income of each spouse (as determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section).
    (ii) Joint returns filed after separate returns. In the case of a 
husband and wife who elect under section 6013(b) to file a joint income 
tax return for a taxable year after the time prescribed by law for 
filing the return for such taxable year, the taxable income limitation 
of this paragraph (c) for the taxable year for which the joint return is 
filed is determined under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section.
    (8) Married individuals filing separately. In the case of an 
individual who is married but files a separate tax return for a taxable 
year, the taxable income limitation for that individual is determined 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by treating the husband and wife 
as separate taxpayers.
    (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

    Example 1. (i) During 1991, PRS, a calendar-year partnership, 
purchases and places in service $50,000 of section 179 property. The 
taxable income of PRS derived from the active conduct of all its trades 
or businesses (as determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section) is 
$8,000.
    (ii) Under the dollar limitation of paragraph (b) of this section, 
PRS may elect to expense $10,000 of the cost of section 179 property 
purchased in 1991. Assume PRS elects under section 179( c) and 
Sec. 1.179-5 to expense $10,000 of the cost of section 179 property 
purchased in 1991.
    (iii) Under the taxable income limitation of paragraph (c) of this 
section, PRS may allocate to its partners as a deduction only $8,000 of 
the cost of section 179 property in 1991. Under section 179(b)(3)(B) and 
Sec. 1.179-3(a), PRS may carry forward the remaining $2,000 it elected 
to expense, which would have been deductible under section 179(a) for 
1991 absent the taxable income limitation.
    Example 2. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that 
on December 31, 1991, PRS allocates to A, a calendar-year taxpayer and a 
partner in PRS, $7,000 of section 179 expenses and $2,000 of taxable 
income. A was engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business of 
PRS during 1991.
    (ii) In addition to being a partner in PRS, A conducts a business as 
a sole proprietor. During 1991, A purchases and places in service 
$201,000 of section 179 property in connection with the sole 
proprietorship. A's 1991 taxable income derived from the active conduct 
of this business is $6,000.
    (iii) Under the dollar limitation, A may elect to expense only 
$9,000 of the cost of section 179 property purchased in 1991, the 
$10,000 limit reduced by $1,000 (the amount by which the cost of section 
179 property placed in service during 1991 ($201,000) exceeds $200,000). 
Under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the $7,000 of section 179 
expenses allocated from PRS is subject to the $9,000 limit. Assume that 
A elects to expense $2,000 of the cost of section 179 property purchased 
by A's sole proprietorship in 1991. Thus, A has elected to expense under 
section 179 an amount equal to the dollar limitation for 1991 ($2,000 
elected to be expensed by A's sole proprietorship plus $7,000, the 
amount of PRS's section 179 expenses allocated to A in 1991).
    (iv) Under the taxable income limitation, A may only deduct $8,000 
of the cost of section 179 property elected to be expensed in 1991, the 
aggregate taxable income derived from the active conduct of A's trades 
or businesses in 1991 ($2,000 from PRS and $6,000 from A's sole 
proprietorship). The entire $2,000 of taxable income allocated from PRS 
is included by A as taxable income derived from the active conduct by A 
of a trade or business because it was derived from the active conduct of 
a trade or business by PRS and A was engaged in the active conduct of a 
trade or business of PRS during 1991. Under section 179(b)(3)(B) and 
Sec. 1.179-3(a), A may carry forward the remaining $1,000 A elected to 
expense, which would have been deductible under section 179(a) for 1991 
absent the taxable income limitation.

Sec. 1.179-3  Carryover of disallowed deduction.

    (a) In general. Under section 179(b)(3)(B), a taxpayer may carry 
forward for an unlimited number of years the amount of any cost of 
section 179 property elected to be expensed in a taxable year but 
disallowed as a deduction in that taxable year because of the taxable 
income limitation of section 179(b)(3)(A) and Sec. 1.179-2(c) 
(``carryover

[[Page 224]]

of disallowed deduction''). This carryover of disallowed deduction may 
be deducted under section 179(a) and Sec. 1.179-1(a) in a future taxable 
year as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) Deduction of carryover of disallowed deduction--(1) In general. 
The amount allowable as a deduction under section 179(a) and Sec. 1.179-
1(a) for any taxable year is increased by the lesser of--
    (i) The aggregate amount disallowed under section 179(b)(3)(A) and 
Sec. 1.179-2(c) for all prior taxable years (to the extent not 
previously allowed as a deduction by reason of this section); or
    (ii) The amount of any unused section 179 expense allowance for the 
taxable year (as described in paragraph (c) of this section).
    (2) Cross references. See paragraph (f) of this section for rules 
that apply when a taxpayer disposes of or otherwise transfers section 
179 property for which a carryover of disallowed deduction is 
outstanding. See paragraph (g) of this section for special rules that 
apply to partnerships and S corporations and paragraph (h) of this 
section for special rules that apply to partners and S corporation 
shareholders.
    (c) Unused section 179 expense allowance. The amount of any unused 
section 179 expense allowance for a taxable year equals the excess (if 
any) of--
    (1) The maximum cost of section 179 property that the taxpayer may 
deduct under section 179 and Sec. 1.179-1 for the taxable year after 
applying the limitations of section 179(b) and Sec. 1.179-2; over
    (2) The amount of section 179 property that the taxpayer actually 
elected to expense under section 179 and Sec. 1.179-1(a) for the taxable 
year.
    (d) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

    Example. A, a calendar-year taxpayer, has a $3,000 carryover of 
disallowed deduction for an item of section 179 property purchased and 
placed in service in 1991. In 1992, A purchases and places in service an 
item of section 179 property costing $25,000. A's 1992 taxable income 
from the active conduct of all A's trades or businesses is $100,000. A 
elects, under section 179(c) and Sec. 1.179-5, to expense $8,000 of the 
cost of the item of section 179 property purchased in 1992. Under 
paragraph (b) of this section, A may deduct $2,000 of A's carryover of 
disallowed deduction from 1991 (the lesser of A's total outstanding 
carryover of disallowed deductions ($3,000), or the amount of any unused 
section 179 expense allowance for 1992 ($10,000 limit less $8,000 
elected to be expensed, or $2,000)). For 1993, A has a $1,000 carryover 
of disallowed deduction for the item of section 179 property purchased 
and placed in service in 1991.

    (e) Recordkeeping requirement and ordering rule. The properties and 
the apportionment of cost that will be subject to a carryover of 
disallowed deduction are selected by the taxpayer in the year the 
properties are placed in service. This selection must be evidenced on 
the taxpayer's books and records and be applied consistently in 
subsequent years. If no selection is made, the total carryover of 
disallowed deduction is apportioned equally over the items of section 
179 property elected to be expensed for the taxable year. For this 
purpose, the taxpayer treats any section 179 expense amount allocated 
from a partnership (or an S corporation) for a taxable year as one item 
of section 179 property. If the taxpayer is allowed to deduct a portion 
of the total carryover of disallowed deduction under paragraph (b) of 
this section, the taxpayer must deduct the cost of section 179 property 
carried forward from the earliest taxable year.
    (f) Dispositions and other transfers of section 179 property--(1) In 
general. Upon a sale or other disposition of section 179 property, or a 
transfer of section 179 property in a transaction in which gain or loss 
is not recognized in whole or in part (including transfers at death), 
immediately before the transfer the adjusted basis of the section 179 
property is increased by the amount of any outstanding carryover of 
disallowed deduction with respect to the property. This carryover of 
disallowed deduction is not available as a deduction to the transferor 
or the transferee of the section 179 property.
    (2) Recapture under section 179(d)(10). Under Sec. 1.179-1(e), if a 
taxpayer's section 179 property is subject to recapture under section 
179(d)(10), the taxpayer must recapture the benefit derived from 
expensing the property. Upon recapture, any outstanding carryover of 
disallowed deduction with respect to the property is no longer available 
for expensing. In determining the amount subject to recapture under

[[Page 225]]

section 179(d)(10) and Sec. 1.179-1(e), any outstanding carryover of 
disallowed deduction with respect to that property is not treated as an 
amount expensed under section 179.
    (g) Special rules for partnerships and S corporations--(1) In 
general. Under section 179(d)(8) and Sec. 1.179-2(c), the taxable income 
limitation applies at the partnership level as well as at the partner 
level. Therefore, a partnership may have a carryover of disallowed 
deduction with respect to the cost of its section 179 property. Similar 
rules apply to S corporations. This paragraph (g) provides special rules 
that apply when a partnership or an S corporation has a carryover of 
disallowed deduction.
    (2) Basis adjustment. Under Sec. 1.179-1(f)(2), the basis of a 
partnership's section 179 property must be reduced to reflect the amount 
of section 179 expense elected by the partnership. This reduction must 
be made for the taxable year for which the election is made even if the 
section 179 expense amount, or a portion thereof, must be carried 
forward by the partnership. Similar rules apply to S corporations.
    (3) Dispositions and other transfers of section 179 property by a 
partnership or an S corporation. The provisions of paragraph (f) of this 
section apply in determining the treatment of any outstanding carryover 
of disallowed deduction with respect to section 179 property disposed 
of, or transferred in a nonrecognition transaction, by a partnership or 
an S corporation.
    (4) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of 
this paragraph (g).

    Example. ABC, a calendar-year partnership, owns and operates a 
restaurant business. During 1992, ABC purchases and places in service 
two items of section 179 property--a cash register costing $4,000 and 
office furniture costing $6,000. ABC elects to expense under section 
179(c) the full cost of the cash register and the office furniture. For 
1992, ABC has $6,000 of taxable income derived from the active conduct 
of its restaurant business. Therefore, ABC may deduct only $6,000 of 
section 179 expenses and must carry forward the remaining $4,000 of 
section 179 expenses at the partnership level. ABC must reduce the 
adjusted basis of the section 179 property by the full amount elected to 
be expensed. However, ABC may not allocate to its partners any portion 
of the carryover of disallowed deduction until ABC is able to deduct it 
under paragraph (b) of this section.

    (h) Special rules for partners and S corporation shareholders--(1) 
In general. Under section 179(d)(8) and Sec. 1.179-2(c), a partner may 
have a carryover of disallowed deduction with respect to the cost of 
section 179 property elected to be expensed by the partnership and 
allocated to the partner. A partner who is allocated section 179 
expenses from a partnership must reduce the basis of his or her 
partnership interest by the full amount allocated regardless of whether 
the partner may deduct for the taxable year the allocated section 179 
expenses or is required to carry forward all or a portion of the 
expenses. Similar rules apply to S corporation shareholders.
    (2) Dispositions and other transfers of a partner's interest in a 
partnership or a shareholder's interest in an S corporation. A partner 
who disposes of a partnership interest, or transfers a partnership 
interest in a transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized in 
whole or in part (including transfers of a partnership interest at 
death), may have an outstanding carryover of disallowed deduction of 
section 179 expenses allocated from the partnership. In such a case, 
immediately before the transfer the partner's basis in the partnership 
interest is increased by the amount of the partner's outstanding 
carryover of disallowed deduction with respect to the partnership 
interest. This carryover of disallowed deduction is not available as a 
deduction to the transferor or transferee partner of the section 179 
property. Similar rules apply to S corporation shareholders.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of 
this paragraph (h).

    Example 1. (i) G is a general partner in GD, a calendar-year 
partnership, and is engaged in the active conduct of GD's business. 
During 1991, GD purchases and places section 179 property in service and 
elects to expense a portion of the cost of the property under section 
179. GD allocates $2,500 of section 179 expenses and $15,000 of taxable 
income (determined without regard to the section 179 deduction) to G. 
The income was derived from the active conduct by GD of a trade or 
business.

[[Page 226]]

    (ii) In addition to being a partner in GD, G conducts a business as 
a sole proprietor. During 1991, G purchases and places in service office 
equipment costing $25,000 and a computer costing $10,000 in connection 
with the sole proprietorship. G elects under section 179(c) and 
Sec. 1.179-5 to expense $7,500 of the cost of the office equipment. G 
has a taxable loss (determined without regard to the section 179 
deduction) derived from the active conduct of this business of $12,500.
    (iii) G has no other taxable income (or loss) derived from the 
active conduct of a trade or business during 1991. G's taxable income 
limitation for 1991 is $2,500 ($15,000 taxable income allocated from GD 
less $12,500 taxable loss from the sole proprietorship). Therefore, G 
may deduct during 1991 only $2,500 of the $10,000 of section 179 
expenses. G notes on the appropriate books and records that G expenses 
the $2,500 of section 179 expenses allocated from GD and carries forward 
the $7,500 of section 179 expenses with respect to the office equipment 
purchased by G's sole proprietorship.
    (iv) On January 1, 1992, G sells the office equipment G's sole 
proprietorship purchased and placed in service in 1991. Under paragraph 
(f) of this section, immediately before the sale G increases the 
adjusted basis of the office equipment by $7,500, the amount of the 
outstanding carryover of disallowed deduction with respect to the office 
equipment.
    Example 2. (i) Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that G 
notes on the appropriate books and records that G expenses $2,500 of 
section 179 expenses relating to G's sole proprietorship and carries 
forward the remaining $5,000 of section 179 expenses relating to G's 
sole proprietorship and $2,500 of section 179 expenses allocated from 
GD.
    (ii) On January 1, 1992, G sells G's partnership interest to A. 
Under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, immediately before the sale G 
increases the adjusted basis of G's partnership interest by $2,500, the 
amount of the outstanding carryover of disallowed deduction with respect 
to the partnership interest.

<R05>
Sec. 1.179-4  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply for purposes of section 179 and 
Secs. 1.179-1 through 1.179-6:
    (a) Section 179 property. The term section 179 property means any 
tangible property described in section 179(d)(1) that is acquired by 
purchase for use in the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or 
business (as described in Sec. 1.179-2(c)(6)). For purposes of this 
paragraph (a), the term trade or business has the same meaning as in 
section 162 and the regulations thereunder.
    (b) Section 38 property. The term section 38 property shall have the 
same meaning assigned to it in section 48(a) and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (c) Purchase. (1)(i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, the term purchase means any acquisition of the 
property, but only if all the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) (ii), 
(iii), and (iv) of this section are satisfied.
    (ii) Property is not acquired by purchase if it is acquired from a 
person whose relationship to the person acquiring it would result in the 
disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707(b). The property is 
considered not acquired by purchase only to the extent that losses would 
be disallowed under section 267 or 707(b). Thus, for example, if 
property is purchased by a husband and wife jointly from the husband's 
father, the property will be treated as not acquired by purchase only to 
the extent of the husband's interest in the property. However, in 
applying the rules of section 267 (b) and (c) for this purpose, section 
267(c)(4) shall be treated as providing that the family of an individual 
will include only his spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants. For 
example, a purchase of property from a corporation by a taxpayer who 
owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent in value of the 
outstanding stock of such corporation does not qualify as a purchase 
under section 179(d)(2); nor does the purchase of property by a husband 
from his wife. However, the purchase of section 179 property by a 
taxpayer from his brother or sister does qualify as a purchase for 
purposes of section 179(d)(2).
    (iii) The property is not acquired by purchase if acquired from a 
component member of a controlled group of corporations (as defined in 
paragraph (g) of this section) by another component member of the same 
group.
    (iv) The property is not acquired by purchase if the basis of the 
property in the hands of the person acquiring it is determined in whole 
or in part by reference to the adjusted basis of such property in the 
hands of the person from whom acquired, or is determined

[[Page 227]]

under section 1014(a), relating to property acquired from a decedent. 
For example, property acquired by gift or bequest does not qualify as 
property acquired by purchase for purposes of section 179(d)(2); nor 
does property received in a corporate distribution the basis of which is 
determined under section 301(d)(2)(B), property acquired by a 
corporation in a transaction to which section 351 applies, property 
acquired by a partnership through contribution (section 723), or 
property received in a partnership distribution which has a carryover 
basis under section 732(a)(1).
    (2) Property deemed to have been acquired by a new target 
corporation as a result of a section 338 election (relating to certain 
stock purchases treated as asset acquisitions) will be considered 
acquired by purchase.
    (d) Cost. The cost of section 179 property does not include so much 
of the basis of such property as is determined by reference to the basis 
of other property held at any time by the taxpayer. For example, X 
Corporation purchases a new drill press costing $10,000 in November 1984 
which qualifies as section 179 property, and is granted a trade-in 
allowance of $2,000 on its old drill press. The old drill press had a 
basis of $1,200. Under the provisions of sections 1012 and 1031(d), the 
basis of the new drill press is $9,200 ($1,200 basis of oil drill press 
plus cash expended of $8,000). However, only $8,000 of the basis of the 
new drill press qualifies as cost for purposes of the section 179 
expense deduction; the remaining $1,200 is not part of the cost because 
it is determined by reference to the basis of the old drill press.
    (e) Placed in service. The term placed in service means the time 
that property is first placed by the taxpayer in a condition or state of 
readiness and availability for a specifically assigned function, whether 
for use in a trade or business, for the production of income, in a tax-
exempt activity, or in a personal activity. See Sec. 1.46-3(d)(2) for 
examples regarding when property shall be considered in a condition or 
state of readiness and availability for a specifically assigned 
function.
    (f) Controlled group of corporations and component member of 
controlled group. The terms controlled group of corporations and 
component member of a controlled group of corporations shall have the 
same meaning assigned to those terms in section 1563 (a) and (b), except 
that the phrase ``more than 50 percent'' shall be substituted for the 
phrase ``at least 80 percent'' each place it appears in section 
1563(a)(1).

<R05>
Sec. 1.179-5  Time and manner of making election.

    (a) Election. A separate election must be made for each taxable year 
in which a section 179 expense deduction is claimed with respect to 
section 179 property. The election under section 179 and Sec. 1.179-1 to 
claim a section 179 expense deduction for section 179 property shall be 
made on the taxpayer's first income tax return for the taxable year to 
which the election applies (whether or not the return is timely) or on 
an amended return filed within the time prescribed by law (including 
extensions) for filing the return for such taxable year. The election 
shall be made by showing as a separate item on the taxpayer's income tax 
return the following items:
    (1) The total section 179 expense deduction claimed with respect to 
all section 179 property selected, and
    (2) The portion of that deduction allocable to each specific item.

The person shall maintain records which permit specific identification 
of each piece of section 179 property and reflect how and from whom such 
property was acquired and when such property was placed in service. 
However, for this purpose a partner (or an S corporation shareholder) 
treats partnership (or S corporation) section 179 property for which 
section 179 expenses are allocated from a partnership (or an S 
corporation) as one item of section 179 property. The election to claim 
a section 179 expense deduction under this section, with respect to any 
property, is irrevocable and will be binding on the taxpayer with 
respect to such property for the taxable year for which the election is 
made and for all subsequent taxable years, unless the Commissioner 
consents to the revocation of the election. Similarly, the selection of 
section

[[Page 228]]

179 property by the taxpayer to be subject to the expense deduction and 
apportionment scheme must be adhered to in computing the taxpayer's 
taxable income for the taxable year for which the election is made and 
for all subsequent taxable years, unless consent to change is given by 
the Commissioner.
    (b) Revocation. Any election made under section 179, and any 
specification contained in such election, may not be revoked except with 
the consent of the Commissioner. Such consent will be granted only in 
extraordinary circumstances. Requests for consent must be filed with the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The request must 
include the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the 
taxpayer and must be signed by the taxpayer or his duly authorized 
representative. It must be accompanied by a statement showing the year 
and property involved, and must set forth in detail the reasons for the 
request.

Sec. 1.179-6  Effective date.

    The provisions of Secs. 1.179-1 through 1.179-5 are effective for 
property placed in service in taxable years ending after January 25, 
1993. However, a taxpayer may apply the provisions of Secs. 1.179-1 
through 1.179-5 to property placed in service after December 31, 1986, 
in taxable years ending on or before January 25, 1993. Otherwise, for 
property placed in service after December 31, 1986, in taxable years 
ending on or before January 25, 1993, the final regulations under 
section 179 as in effect for the year the property was placed in service 
apply, except to the extent modified by the changes made to section 179 
by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue 
Act of 1988, and the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990. For that 
property, a taxpayer may apply any reasonable method that clearly 
reflects income in applying the changes to section 179, provided the 
taxpayer consistently applies the method to the property.

Sec. 1.179A-1  Recapture of deduction for qualified clean-fuel vehicle property and qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property.

    (a) In general. If a recapture event occurs with respect to a 
taxpayer's qualified clean-fuel vehicle property or qualified clean-fuel 
vehicle refueling property, the taxpayer must include the recapture 
amount in taxable income for the taxable year in which the recapture 
event occurs.
    (b) Recapture event--(1) Qualified clean-fuel vehicle property--(i) 
In general. A recapture event occurs if, within 3 full years from the 
date a vehicle of which qualified clean-fuel vehicle property is a part 
is placed in service, the property ceases to be qualified clean-fuel 
vehicle property. Property ceases to be qualified clean-fuel vehicle 
property if--
    (A) The vehicle is modified by the taxpayer so that it may no longer 
be propelled by a clean-burning fuel;
    (B) The vehicle is used by the taxpayer in a manner described in 
section 50(b);
    (C) The vehicle otherwise ceases to qualify as property defined in 
section 179A(c); or
    (D) The taxpayer receiving the deduction under section 179A sells or 
disposes of the vehicle and knows or has reason to know that the vehicle 
will be used in a manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) (A), (B), or 
(C) of this section.
    (ii) Exception for disposition. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i)(D) of this section, a sale or other disposition (including a 
disposition by reason of an accident or other casualty) of qualified 
clean-fuel vehicle property is not a recapture event.
    (2) Qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property--(i) In general. 
A recapture event occurs if, at any time before the end of its recovery 
period, the property ceases to be qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling 
property. Property ceases to be qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling 
property if--
    (A) The property no longer qualifies as property described in 
section 179A(d);
    (B) The property is no longer used predominantly in a trade or 
business (property will be treated as no longer

[[Page 229]]

used predominantly in a trade or business if 50 percent or more of the 
use of the property in a taxable year is for use other than in a trade 
or business);
    (C) The property is used by the taxpayer in a manner described in 
section 50(b); or
    (D) The taxpayer receiving the deduction under section 179A sells or 
disposes of the property and knows or has reason to know that the 
property will be used in a manner described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) (A), 
(B), or (C) of this section.
    (ii) Exception for disposition. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2)(i)(D) of this section, a sale or other disposition (including a 
disposition by reason of an accident or other casualty) of qualified 
clean-fuel vehicle refueling property is not a recapture event.
    (c) Recapture date--(1) Qualified clean-fuel vehicle property. The 
recapture date is the actual date of the recapture event unless an event 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section occurs, in which 
case the recapture date is the first day of the recapture year.
    (2) Qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property. The recapture 
date is the actual date of the recapture event unless the recapture 
occurs as a result of an event described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) (B) or 
(C) of this section, in which case the recapture date is the first day 
of the recapture year.
    (d) Recapture amount--(1) Qualified clean-fuel vehicle property. The 
recapture amount is equal to the benefit of the section 179A deduction 
allowable multiplied by the recapture percentage. The recapture 
percentage is--
    (i) 100, if the recapture date is within the first full year after 
the date the vehicle is placed in service;
    (ii) 66\2/3\, if the recapture date is within the second full year 
after the date the vehicle is placed in service; or
    (iii) 33\1/3\, if the recapture date is within the third full year 
after the date the vehicle is placed in service.
    (2) Qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property. The recapture 
amount is equal to the benefit of the section 179A deduction allowable 
multiplied by the following fraction. The numerator of the fraction 
equals the total recovery period for the property minus the number of 
recovery years prior to, but not including, the recapture year. The 
denominator of the fraction equals the total recovery period.
    (e) Basis adjustment. As of the first day of the taxable year in 
which the recapture event occurs, the basis of the vehicle of which 
qualified clean-fuel vehicle property is a part or the basis of 
qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property is increased by the 
recapture amount. For a vehicle or refueling property that is of a 
character that is subject to an allowance for depreciation, this 
increase in basis is recoverable over its remaining recovery period 
beginning as of the first day of the taxable year in which the recapture 
event occurs.
    (f) Application of section 1245 for sales and other dispositions. 
For purposes of section 1245, the amount of the deduction allowable 
under section 179A(a) with respect to any property that is (or has been) 
of a character subject to an allowance for depreciation is treated as a 
deduction allowed for depreciation under section 167. Therefore, upon a 
sale or other disposition of depreciable qualified clean-fuel vehicle 
refueling property or a depreciable vehicle of which qualified clean-
fuel vehicle property is a part, section 1245 will apply to any gain 
recognized to the extent the basis of the depreciable property or 
vehicle was reduced under section 179A(e)(6) net of any basis increase 
described in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (g) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of 
this section:

    Example 1. A, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and places in 
service for personal use on January 1, 1995, a clean-fuel vehicle, a 
portion of which is qualified clean-fuel vehicle property, costing 
$25,000. The qualified clean-fuel vehicle property costs $11,000. On A's 
1995 federal income tax return, A claims a section 179A deduction of 
$2,000. On January 2, 1996, A sells the vehicle to an unrelated third 
party who subsequently converts the vehicle into a gasoline-propelled 
vehicle on October 15, 1996. There is no recapture upon the sale of the 
vehicle by A provided A did not know or have reason to know that the 
purchaser intended to convert the vehicle to a gasoline-propelled 
vehicle.
    Example 2. B, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and places in 
service for personal use on October 11, 1994, a clean-fuel vehicle

[[Page 230]]

costing $20,000, a portion of which is qualified clean-fuel vehicle 
property. The qualified clean-fuel vehicle property costs $10,000. On 
B's 1994 federal income tax return, B claims a deduction of $2,000, 
which reduces B's gross income by $2,000. The basis of the vehicle is 
reduced to $18,000 ($20,000-$2,000). On January 31, 1996, B sells the 
vehicle to a tax-exempt entity. Because B knowingly sold the vehicle to 
a tax-exempt entity described in section 50(b) in the second full year 
from the date the vehicle was placed in service, B must recapture $1,333 
($2,000  x  66\2/3\ percent). This recapture amount increases B's gross 
income by $1,333 on B's 1996 federal income tax return and is added to 
the basis of the motor vehicle as of January 1, 1996, the beginning of 
the taxable year of recapture.
    Example 3. X, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and places in 
service for its business use on January 1, 1994, qualified clean-fuel 
vehicle refueling property costing $400,000. Assume this property has a 
5-year recovery period. On X's 1994 federal income tax return, X claims 
a deduction of $100,000, which reduces X's gross income by $100,000. The 
basis of the property is reduced to $300,000 ($400,000-$100,000) prior 
to any adjustments for depreciation. In 1996, more than 50 percent of 
the use of the property is other than in X's trade or business.
    Because the property is no longer used predominantly in X's 
business, X must recapture three-fifths of the section 179A deduction or 
$60,000 ($100,000 x (5-2)/5 = $60,000) and include that amount in gross 
income on its 1996 federal income tax return. The recapture amount of 
$60,000 is added to the basis of the property as of January 1, 1996, the 
beginning of the taxable year of recapture, and to the extent the 
property remains depreciable, the adjusted basis is recoverable over the 
remaining recovery period.
    Example 4. X, a calendar-year taxpayer, purchases and places in 
service for business use on January 1, 1994, qualified clean-fuel 
vehicle refueling property costing $350,000. Assume this property has a 
5-year recovery period. On X's 1994 federal income tax return, X claims 
a deduction of $100,000, which reduces X's gross income by $100,000. The 
basis of the property is reduced to $250,000 ($350,000-$100,000) prior 
to any adjustments for depreciation. In 1995, X converts the property to 
store and dispense gasoline. Because the property is no longer used as 
qualified clean-fuel vehicle refueling property in 1995, X must 
recapture four-fifths of the section 179A deduction or $80,000 
($100,000 x (5-1)/5 = $80,000) and include that amount in gross income 
on its 1995 federal income tax return. The recapture amount of $80,000 
is added to the basis of the property as of January 1, 1995, the 
beginning of the taxable year of recapture, and to the extent the 
property remains depreciable, the adjusted basis is recoverable over the 
remaining recovery period.
    Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 4. In 1996, X sells 
the refueling property for $351,000, recognizing a gain from this sale. 
Under paragraph (f) of this section, section 1245 will apply to any gain 
recognized on the sale of depreciable property to the extent the basis 
of the property was reduced by the section 179A deduction net of any 
basis increase from recapture of the section 179A deduction. 
Accordingly, the gain from the sale of the property is subject to 
section 1245 to the extent of the depreciation allowance for the 
property plus the deduction allowed under section 179A ($100,000), less 
the previous recapture amount ($80,000). Any remaining amount of gain 
may be subject to other applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue 
Code.

    (h) Effective date. This section is effective on October 14, 1994. 
If the recapture date is before the effective date of this section, a 
taxpayer may use any reasonable method to recapture the benefit of any 
deduction allowable under section 179A(a) consistent with section 179A 
and its legislative history. For this purpose, the recapture date is 
defined in paragraph (c) of this section.

Sec. 1.180-1   Expenditures by farmers for fertilizer, etc.

    (a) In general. A taxpayer engaged in the business of farming may 
elect, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1959, to treat 
as deductible expenses those expenditures otherwise chargeable to 
capital account which are paid or incurred by him during the taxable 
year for the purchase or acquisition of fertilizer, lime, ground 
limestone, marl, or other materials to enrich, neutralize, or condition 
land used in farming, and those expenditures otherwise chargeable to 
capital account paid or incurred for the application of such items and 
materials to such land. No election is required to be made for those 
expenditures which are not capital in nature. Section 180, Sec. 1.180-2, 
and this section are not applicable to those expenses which are 
deductible under section 162 and the regulations thereunder or which are 
subject to the method described in section 175 and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (b) Land used in farming. For purposes of section 180(a) and of 
paragraph (a) of

[[Page 231]]

this section, the term land used in farming means land used (before or 
simultaneously with the expenditures described in such section and such 
paragraph) by the taxpayer or his tenant for the production of crops, 
fruits, or other agricultural products or for the sustenance of 
livestock. See section 180(b). Expenditures for the initial preparation 
of land never previously used for farming purposes by the taxpayer or 
his tenant (although chargeable to capital account) are not subject to 
the election. The principles stated in Secs. 1.175-3 and 1.175-4 are 
equally applicable under this section in determining whether the 
taxpayer is engaged in the business of farming and whether the land is 
used in farming.

Sec. 1.180-2   Time and manner of making election and revocation.

    (a) Election. The claiming of a deduction on the taxpayer's return 
for an amount to which section 180 applies for amounts (otherwise 
chargeable to capital account) expended for fertilizer, lime, etc., 
shall constitute an election under section 180 and paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 1.180-1. Such election shall be effective only for the taxable year 
for which the deduction is claimed.
    (b) Revocation. Once the election is made for any taxable year such 
election may not be revoked without the consent of the district director 
for the district in which the taxpayer's return is required to be filed. 
Such requests for consent shall be in writing and signed by the taxpayer 
or his authorized representative and shall set forth:
    (1) The name and address of the taxpayer;
    (2) The taxable year to which the revocation of the election is to 
apply;
    (3) The amount of expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable 
year, or portions thereof (where applicable), previously taken as a 
deduction on the return in respect of which the revocation of the 
election is to be applicable; and
    (4) The reasons for the request to revoke the election.

Sec. 1.182-1   Expenditures by farmers for clearing land; in general.

    Under section 182, a taxpayer engaged in the business of farming may 
elect, in the manner provided in Sec. 1.182-6, to deduct certain 
expenditures paid or incurred by him in any taxable year beginning after 
December 31, 1962, in the clearing of land. The expenditures to which 
the election applies are all expenditures paid or incurred during the 
taxable year in clearing land for the purpose of making the ``land 
suitable for use in farming'' (as defined in Sec. 1.182-4) which are not 
otherwise deductible (exclusive of expenditures for or in connection 
with depreciable items referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.182-3), 
but only if such expenditures are made in furtherance of the taxpayer's 
business of farming. The term expenditures to which the election applies 
also includes a reasonable allowance for depreciation (not otherwise 
allowable) on equipment used in the clearing of land provided such 
equipment, if used in the carrying on of a trade or business, would be 
subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167. (See 
paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.182-3.) (See section 175 and the regulations 
thereunder for deductibility of certain expenditures for treatment or 
moving of earth by a farmer where the land already qualifies as land 
used in farming as defined in Sec. 1.175-4.) The amount deductible for 
any taxable year is limited to the lesser of $5,000 or 25 percent of the 
taxable income derived from farming (as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of 
Sec. 1.182-5) during the taxable year. Expenditures paid or incurred in 
a taxable year in excess of the amount deductible under section 182 for 
such taxable year shall be treated as capital expenditures and shall 
constitute an adjustment to the basis of the land under section 1016(a).

<R05>
Sec. 1.182-2   Definition of ``the business of farming.''

    Under section 182, the election to deduct expenditures incurred in 
the clearing of land is applicable only to a taxpayer who is engaged in 
``the business of farming'' during the taxable year. A taxpayer is 
engaged in the

[[Page 232]]

business of farming if he cultivates, operates, or manages a farm for 
gain or profit, either as owner or tenant. For purposes of section 182, 
a taxpayer who receives a rental (either in cash or in kind) which is 
based upon farm production is engaged in the business of farming. 
However, a taxpayer who receives a fixed rental (without reference to 
production) is engaged in the business of farming only if he 
participates to a material extent in the operation or management of the 
farm. A taxpayer engaged in forestry or the growing of timber is not 
thereby engaged in the business of farming. A person cultivating or 
operating a farm for recreation or pleasure rather than for profit is 
not engaged in the business of farming. For purposes of section 182 and 
this section, the term farm is used in its ordinary, accepted sense and 
includes stock, dairy, poultry, fish, fruit, and truck farms, and also 
plantations, ranches, ranges, and orchards. A fish farm is an area where 
fish are grown or raised, as opposed to merely caught or harvested; that 
is, an area where they are artificially fed, protected, cared for, etc. 
A taxpayer is engaged in ``the business of farming'' if he is a member 
of a partnership engaged in the business of farming. See Sec. 1.702-1.

<R05>
Sec. 1.182-3   Definition, exceptions, etc., relating to deductible expenditures.

    (a) Clearing of land. (1) For purposes of section 182, the term 
clearing of land includes (but is not limited to):
    (i) The removal of rocks, stones, trees, stumps, brush or other 
natural impediments to the use of the land in farming through blasting, 
cutting, burning, bulldozing, plowing, or in any other way;
    (ii) The treatment or moving of earth, including the construction, 
repair or removal of nondepreciable earthen structures, such as dikes or 
levies, if the purpose of such treatment or moving of earth is to 
protect, level, contour, terrace, or condition the land so as to permit 
its use as farming land; and
    (iii) The diversion of streams and watercourses, including the 
construction of nondepreciable drainage facilities, provided that the 
purpose is to remove or divert water from the land so as to make it 
available for use in farming.
    (2) The following are examples of land clearing activities:
    (i) The cutting of trees, the blasting of the resulting stumps, and 
the burning of the residual undergrowth;
    (ii) The leveling of land so as to permit irrigation or planting;
    (iii) The removal of salt or other minerals which might inhibit 
cultivation of the soil;
    (iv) The draining and filling in of a swamp or marsh; and
    (v) The diversion of a stream from one watercourse to another.
    (b) Expenditures not allowed as a deduction under section 182. (1) 
Section 182 applies only to expenditures for nondepreciable items. 
Accordingly, a taxpayer may not deduct expenditures for the purchase, 
construction, installation, or improvement of structures, appliances, or 
facilities which are of a character which is subject to the allowance 
for depreciation under section 167 and the regulations thereunder. 
Expenditures in respect of such depreciable property include those for 
materials, supplies, wages, fuel, freight, and the moving of earth, paid 
or incurred with respect to tanks, reservoirs, pipes, conduits, canals, 
dams, wells, or pumps constructed of masonry, concrete, tile, metal, 
wood, or other nonearthen material.
    (2) Expenditures which are deductible without regard to section 182 
are not deductible under section 182. Thus, such expenditures are 
deductible without being subject to the limitations imposed by section 
182(b) and Sec. 1.182-5. For example, section 182 does not apply to the 
ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in the business of farming 
which are deductible under section 162 even though they might otherwise 
be considered to be clearing of land expenditures. Section 182 also does 
not apply to interest (deductible under section 163) nor to taxes 
(deductible under section 164). Similarly, section 182 does not apply to 
any expenditures (whether or not currently deductible) paid or incurred 
for the purpose of soil or water conservation in respect of land used in 
farming, or for the prevention of erosion of land used in farming, 
within the

[[Page 233]]

meaning of section 175 and the regulations thereunder, nor to 
expenditures deductible under section 180 and the regulations 
thereunder, relating to expenditures for fertilizer, etc.
    (c) Depreciation. In addition to expenditures for the activities 
described in paragraph (a) of this section, there also shall be treated 
as an expenditure to which section 182 applies a reasonable allowance 
for depreciation not otherwise deductible on property of the taxpayer 
which is used in the clearing of land for the purpose of making such 
land suitable for use in farming, provided the property is property 
which, if used in a trade or business, would be subject to the allowance 
for depreciation under section 167. Depreciation allowable as a 
deduction under section 182 is limited to the portion of depreciation 
which is attributable to the use of the property in the clearing of 
land. The depreciation shall be computed in accordance with section 167 
and the regulations thereunder. To the extent an amount representing a 
reasonable allowance for depreciation with respect to property used in 
clearing land is treated as an expenditure to which section 182 applies, 
such depreciation shall, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, be 
treated as an amount allowed under section 167 for depreciation. Thus, 
if a deduction is allowed for depreciation under section 182 in respect 
of property used in clearing land, proper adjustment to the basis of the 
property so used shall be made under section 1016(a).

[T.D. 6794, 30 FR 791, Jan. 26, 1965]


<R05>
Sec. 1.182-4   Definition of ``land suitable for use in farming'', etc.

    For purposes of section 182, the term land suitable for use in 
farming means land which, as a result of the land clearing activities 
described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.182-3, could be used by the 
taxpayer or his tenant for the production of crops, fruits, or other 
agricultural products, including fish, or for the sustenance of 
livestock. The term livestock includes cattle, hogs, horses, mules, 
donkeys, sheep, goats, captive fur-bearing animals, chickens, turkeys, 
pigeons, and other poultry. Land used for the sustenance of livestock 
includes land used for grazing such livestock. Expenditures are 
considered to be for the purpose of making land suitable for use in 
farming by the taxpayer or his tenant only if made to prepare the land 
which is cleared for use by the taxpayer or his tenant in farming. Thus, 
if the taxpayer pays or incurs expenditures to clear land for the 
purpose of sale (whether or not for use in farming by the purchaser) or 
to be held by the taxpayer or his tenant other than for use in farming, 
section 182 does not apply to such expenditures. Whether the land is 
cleared for the purpose of making it suitable for use in farming by the 
taxpayer or his tenant, is a question of fact which must be resolved on 
the basis of all the relevant facts and circumstances. For purposes of 
section 182, it is not necessary that the land cleared actually be used 
in farming following the clearing activities. However, the fact that 
following the clearing operation, the land is used by the taxpayer or 
his tenant in the business of farming will, in most cases, constitute 
evidence that the purpose of the clearing was to make land suitable for 
use in farming by the taxpayer or his tenant. On the other hand, if the 
land cleared is sold or converted to nonfarming use soon after the 
taxpayer has completed his clearing activities, there will be a 
presumption that the expenditures were not made for the purpose of 
making the land suitable for use in farming by the taxpayer or his 
tenant. Other factors which will be considered in determining the 
taxpayer's purpose for clearing the land are, for example, the acreage, 
location, and character of the land cleared, the nature of the 
taxpayer's farming operation, and the use to which adjoining or nearby 
land is put.

<R05>
Sec. 1.182-5   Limitation.

    (a) Limitation--(1) General rule. The amount of land clearing 
expenditures which the taxpayer may deduct under section 182 in any one 
taxable year is limited to the lesser of $5,000 or 25 percent of his 
``taxable income derived from farming''. Expenditures in excess of the 
applicable limitation are to be charged to the capital account and 
constitute additions to the taxpayer's basis in the land.

[[Page 234]]

    (2) Definition of ``taxable income derived from farming''. For 
purposes of section 182, the term taxable income derived from farming 
means the gross income derived from the business of farming reduced by 
the deductions attributable to such gross income. Gross income derived 
from the business of farming is the gross income of the taxpayer derived 
from the production of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products, 
including fish, or from livestock (including livestock held for draft, 
breeding or dairy purposes). It does not include gains from sales of 
assets such as farm machinery or gains from the disposition of land. The 
deductions attributable to the business of farming are all the 
deductions allowed by Chapter 1 of the Code (other than the deduction 
allowed by section 182) for expenditures or charges (including 
depreciation and amortization) paid or incurred in connection with the 
production or raising of crops, fruits, or other agricultural products, 
including fish, or livestock. However, the deduction under section 1202 
(relating to the capital gains deduction) attributable to gain on the 
sale or other disposition of assets (other than draft, breeding, or 
dairy stock), and the net operating loss deduction (computed under 
section 172) shall not be taken into account in computing ``taxable 
income derived from farming.'' Similarly, deductible losses on the sale, 
disposition, destruction, condemnation, or abandonment of assets (other 
than draft, breeding, or dairy stock) shall not be considered as 
deductions attributable to the business of farming. A taxpayer shall 
compute his gross income from farming in accordance with his accounting 
method used in determining gross income. (See the regulations under 
section 61 relating to accounting methods used by farmers in determining 
gross income.)
    (b) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. For the taxable year 1963, A, who uses the cash receipts 
and disbursements method of accounting, incurs expenditures to which 
section 182 applies in the amount of $2,000 and makes the election under 
section 182. A has the following items of income and deductions (without 
regard to section 182 expenditures).

Income:                                                                 
  Proceeds from sale of his 1963 yield of corn......   $10,000          
  Proceeds from sales of milk.......................     8,000          
  Gain from disposition of old breeding cows........       500          
  Gain from sale of tractor.........................       100          
  Gain from sale of farmland........................     5,000

For purposes of computing taxable income derived from farming under 
section 182, the following items of income and deductions are not taken 
into account:


Income:

A's ``taxable income derived from farming'' for purposes of section 182 
is $5,750; income of $18,500 ($23,700-$5,200), less deductions of 
$12,750 ($16,950-$4,200). A may deduct $1,437.50 (25% of $5,750) under 
section 182. The excess expenditures in the amount of $562.50 are to be 
charged to capital account and serve to increase the taxpayer's basis of 
the land.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) and in addition, 
assume that A is allowed a deduction for a net operating loss carryback 
from the taxable year 1966 in the amount of $3,000. The net operating 
loss deduction will not be taken into account in computing A's ``taxable 
income derived from farming'' for 1963 Accordingly, A will not be 
required to recompute such taxable income for purposes of applying the 
limitation on

[[Page 235]]

the deduction provided in section 182 and the deduction of $1,437.50 
will not be reduced.

Sec. 1.182-6   Election to deduct land clearing expenditures.

    (a) Manner of making election. The election to deduct expenditures 
for land clearing provided by section 182(a) shall be made by means of a 
statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable 
year for which such election is to apply. The statement shall include 
the name and address of the taxpayer, shall be signed by the taxpayer 
(or his duly authorized representative), and shall be filed not later 
than the time prescribed by law for filing the income tax return 
(including extensions thereof) for the taxable year for which the 
election is to apply. The statement shall also set forth the amount and 
description of the expenditures for land clearing claimed as a deduction 
under section 182, and shall include a computation of ``taxable income 
derived from farming'', if the amount of such income is not the same as 
the net income from farming shown on Schedule F of Form 1040, increased 
by the amount of the deduction claimed under section 182.
    (b) Scope of election. An election under section 182(a) shall apply 
only to the taxable year for which made. However, once made, an election 
applies to all expenditures described in Sec. 1.182-3 paid or incurred 
during the taxable year, and is binding for such taxable year unless the 
district director consents to a revocation of such election. Requests 
for consent to revoke an election under section 182 shall be made by 
means of a letter to the district director for the district in which the 
taxpayer is required to file his return, setting forth the taxpayer's 
name, address and identification number, the year for which it is 
desired to revoke the election, and the reasons therefor. However, 
consent will not be granted where the only reason therefor is a change 
in tax consequences.

Sec. 1.183-1   Activities not engaged in for profit.

    (a) In general. Section 183 provides rules relating to the allowance 
of deductions in the case of activities (whether active or passive in 
character) not engaged in for profit by individuals and electing small 
business corporations, creates a presumption that an activity is engaged 
in for profit if certain requirements are met, and permits the taxpayer 
to elect to postpone determination of whether such presumption applies 
until he has engaged in the activity for at least 5 taxable years, or, 
in certain cases, 7 taxable years. Whether an activity is engaged in for 
profit is determined under section 162 and section 212 (1) and (2) 
except insofar as section 183(d) creates a presumption that the activity 
is engaged in for profit. If deductions are not allowable under sections 
162 and 212 (1) and (2), the deduction allowance rules of section 183(b) 
and this section apply. Pursuant to section 641(b), the taxable income 
of an estate or trust is computed in the same manner as in the case of 
an individual, with certain exceptions not here relevant. Accordingly, 
where an estate or trust engages in an activity or activities which are 
not for profit, the rules of section 183 and this section apply in 
computing the allowable deductions of such trust or estate. No inference 
is to be drawn from the provisions of section 183 and the regulations 
thereunder that any activity of a corporation (other than an electing 
small business corporation) is or is not a business or engaged in for 
profit. For rules relating to the deductions that may be taken into 
account by taxable membership organizations which are operated primarily 
to furnish services, facilities, or goods to members, see section 277 
and the regulations thereunder. For the definition of an activity not 
engaged in for profit, see Sec. 1.183-2. For rules relating to the 
election contained in section 183(e), see Sec. 1.183-3.
    (b) Deductions allowable--(1) Manner and extent. If an activity is 
not engaged in for profit, deductions are allowable under section 183(b) 
in the following order and only to the following extent:
    (i) Amounts allowable as deductions during the taxable year under 
Chapter 1 of the Code without regard to whether the activity giving rise 
to such amounts was engaged in for profit are allowable to the full 
extent allowed by

[[Page 236]]

the relevant sections of the Code, determined after taking into account 
any limitations or exceptions with respect to the allowability of such 
amounts. For example, the allowability-of-interest expenses incurred 
with respect to activities not engaged in for profit is limited by the 
rules contained in section 163(d).
    (ii) Amounts otherwise allowable as deductions during the taxable 
year under Chapter 1 of the Code, but only if such allowance does not 
result in an adjustment to the basis of property, determined as if the 
activity giving rise to such amounts was engaged in for profit, are 
allowed only to the extent the gross income attributable to such 
activity exceeds the deductions allowed or allowable under subdivision 
(i) of this subparagraph.
    (iii) Amounts otherwise allowable as deductions for the taxable year 
under Chapter 1 of the Code which result in (or if otherwise allowed 
would have resulted in) an adjustment to the basis of property, 
determined as if the activity giving rise to such deductions was engaged 
in for profit, are allowed only to the extent the gross income 
attributable to such activity exceeds the deductions allowed or 
allowable under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph. 
Deductions falling within this subdivision include such items as 
depreciation, partial losses with respect to property, partially 
worthless debts, amortization, and amortizable bond premium.
    (2) Rule for deductions involving basis adjustments--(i) In general. 
If deductions are allowed under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, 
and such deductions are allowed with respect to more than one asset, the 
deduction allowed with respect to each asset shall be determined 
separately in accordance with the computation set forth in subdivision 
(ii) of this subparagraph.
    (ii) Basis adjustment fraction. The deduction allowed under 
subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph is computed by multiplying the 
amount which would have been allowed, had the activity been engaged in 
for profit, as a deduction with respect to each particular asset which 
involves a basis adjustment, by the basis adjustment fraction:
    (a) The numerator of which is the total of deductions allowable 
under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph, and
    (b) The denominator of which is the total of deductions which 
involve basis adjustments which would have been allowed with respect to 
the activity had the activity been engaged in for profit.

The amount resulting from this computation is the deduction allowed 
under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph with respect to the 
particular asset. The basis of such asset is adjusted only to the extent 
of such deduction.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this 
paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:
    Example 1. A, an individual, maintains a herd of dairy cattle, which 
is an ``activity not engaged in for profit'' within the meaning of 
section 183(c). A sold milk for $1,000 during the year. During the year 
A paid $300 State taxes on gasoline used to transport the cows, milk, 
etc., and paid $1,200 for feed for the cows. For the year A also had a 
casualty loss attributable to this activity of $500. A determines the 
amount of his allowable deductions under section 183 as follows:
    (i) First, A computes his deductions allowable under subparagraph 
(1)(i) of this paragraph as follows:

State gasoline taxes specifically allowed under section                 
 164(a)(5) without regard to whether the activity is engaged            
 in for profit...............................................       $300
Casualty loss specifically allowed under section 165(c)(3)              
 without regard to whether the activity is engaged in for               
 profit ($500 less $100 limitation)..........................        400
                                                              ----------
Deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this                  
 paragraph...................................................        700
                                                                        

    (ii) Second, A computes his deductions allowable under subparagraph 
(1)(ii) of this paragraph (deductions which would be allowed under 
chapter 1 of the Code if the activity were engaged in for profit and 
which do not involve basis adjustments) as follows:
    Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(ii) of 
this paragraph:

Income from milk sales.......................................     $1,000
                                                              ==========
Gross income from activity...................................      1,000
Less: deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this

                                                              ----------
Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph               
 (1)(ii) of this paragraph...................................        300
                                                              ==========
Feed for cows................................................      1,200
Deduction allowed under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this                    
 paragraph...................................................        300
                                                                        


[[Page 237]]

$900 of the feed expense is not allowed as a deduction under section 183 
because the total feed expense ($1,200) exceeds the maximum amount of 
deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph 
($300). In view of these circumstances, it is not necessary to determine 
deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph which 
would be allowable under chapter 1 of the Code if the activity were 
engaged in for profit and which involve basis adjustment (the $100 of 
casualty loss not allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph 
because of the limitation in section 165(c)(3)) because none of such 
amount will be allowed as a deduction under section 183.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that A 
also had income from sales of hay grown on the farm of $1,200 and that 
depreciation of $750 with respect to a barn, and $650 with respect to a 
tractor would have been allowed with respect to the activity had it been 
engaged in for profit. A determines the amount of his allowable 
deductions under section 183 as follows:
    (i) First, A computes his deductions allowable under subparagraph 
(1)(i) of this paragraph as follows:

State gasoline taxes specifically allowed under section                 
 164(a)(5) without regard to whether the activity is engaged            
 in for profit...............................................       $300
Casualty loss specifically allowed under section 165(c)(3)              
 without regard to whether the activity is engaged in for               
 profit ($500 less $100 limitation)..........................        400

Deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this                  
 paragraph...................................................        700
                                                                        

    (ii) Second, A computes his deductions allowable under subparagraph 
(1)(ii) of this paragraph (deductions which would be allowable under 
chapter 1 of the Code if the activity were engaged in for profit and 
which do not involve basis adjustments) as follows:
    Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(ii) of 
this paragraph:

Income from milk sales.......................................     $1,000
Income from hay sales........................................      1,200
                                                              ----------
Gross income from activity...................................      2,200
Less: deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(i) of this            
 paragraph...................................................        700
                                                              ----------
Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph               
 (1)(ii) of this paragraph...................................      1,500
                                                              ==========
Feed for cows................................................      1,200
                                                                        

The entire $1,200 of expenses relating to feed for cows is allowable as 
a deduction under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, since it does 
not exceed the maximum amount of deductions allowable under such 
subparagraph.
    (iii) Last, A computes the deductions allowable under subparagraph 
(1)(iii) of this paragraph (deductions which would be allowable under 
chapter 1 of the Code if the activity were engaged in for profit and 
which involve basis adjustments) as follows:
    Maximum amount of deductions allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) 
of this paragraph:

Gross income from farming.........................                $2,200
Less: Deductions allowed under subparagraph (1)(i)                      
 of this paragraph................................       $700           
Deductions allowed under subparagraph (1)(ii) of                        
 this paragraph...................................      1,200      1,900
                                                   ---------------------
Maximum amount of deductions allowable under                            
 subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph..........                   300
                                                                        

    (iv) Since the total of A's deductions under chapter 1 of the Code 
(determined as if the activity was engaged in for profit) which involve 
basis adjustments ($750 with respect to barn, $650 with respect to 
tractor, and $100 with respect to limitation on casualty loss) exceeds 
the maximum amount of the deductions allowable under subparagraph 
(1)(iii) of this paragraph ($300), A computes his allowable deductions 
with respect to such assets as follows:

A first computes his basis adjustment fraction under subparagraph 
(2)(ii) of this paragraph as follows:

The numerator of the fraction is the maximum of deductions              
 allowable under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph                
 which involve basis adjustments.............................       $300
The denominator of the fraction is the total of deductions              
 that involve basis adjustments which would have been allowed           
 with respect to the activity had the activity been engaged             
 in for profit...............................................      1,500
                                                                        

The basis adjustment fraction is then applied to the amount of each 
deduction which would have been allowable if the activity were engaged 
in for profit and which involves a basis adjustment as follows:

Depreciation allowed with respect to barn (300/1,500 x $750).       $150
Depreciation allowed with respect to tractor (300/1,500 x               
 $650).......................................................        130
Deduction allowed with respect to limitation on casualty loss           
 (300/1,500 x $100)..........................................         20
                                                                        

The basis of the barn and of the tractor are adjusted only by the amount 
of depreciation actually allowed under section 183 with respect to each 
(as determined by the above computation). The basis of the asset with 
regard to which the casualty loss was suffered is adjusted only to the 
extent of the amount of the casualty loss actually allowed as a 
deduction under subparagraph (1) (i) and (iii) of this paragraph.

    (4) Rule for capital gains and losses--(i) In general. For purposes 
of section 183 and the regulations thereunder, the gross income from any 
activity not engaged in for profit includes the total of all capital 
gains attributable to such

[[Page 238]]

activity determined without regard to the section 1202 deduction. 
Amounts attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit which 
would be allowable as a deduction under section 1202, without regard to 
section 183, shall be allowable as a deduction under section 183(b)(1) 
in accordance with the rules stated in this subparagraph.
    (ii) Cases where deduction not allowed under section 183. No 
deduction is allowable under section 183(b)(1) with respect to capital 
gains attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit if:
    (a) Without regard to section 183 and the regulations thereunder, 
there is no excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term 
capital loss for the year, or
    (b) There is no excess of net long-term capital gain attributable to 
the activity over net short-term capital loss attributable to the 
activity.
    (iii) Allocation of deduction. If there is:
    (a) An excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term 
capital loss attributable to an activity not engaged in for profit, and
    (b) Such an excess attributable to all activities, determined 
without regard to section 183 and the regulations thereunder, the 
deduction allowable under section 183(b)(1) attributable to capital 
gains with respect to each activity not engaged in for profit (with 
respect to which there is an excess of net long-term capital gain over 
net short-term capital loss for the year) shall be an amount equal to 
the deduction allowable under section 1202 for the taxable year 
(determined without regard to section 183) multiplied by a fraction the 
numerator of which is the excess of the net long-term capital gain 
attributable to the activity over the net short-term capital loss 
attributable to the activity and the denominator of which is an amount 
equal to the total excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-
term capital loss for all activities with respect to which there is such 
excess. The amount of the total section 1202 deduction allowable for the 
year shall be reduced by the amount determined to be allocable to 
activities not engaged in for profit and accordingly allowed as a 
deduction under section 183(b)(1).
    (iv) Example. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated 
by the following example:

    Example. A, an individual who uses the cash receipts and 
disbursement method of accounting and the calendar year as the taxable 
year, has three activities not engaged in for profit. For his taxable 
year ending on December 31, 1973, A has a $200 net long-term capital 
gain from activity No. 1, a $100 net short-term capital loss from 
activity No. 2, and a $300 net long-term capital gain from activity No. 
3. In addition, A has a $500 net long-term capital gain from another 
activity which he engages in for profit. A computes his deductions for 
capital gains for calendar year 1973 as follows:
    Section 1202 deduction without regard to section 183 is determined

    (c) Presumption that activity is engaged in for profit--(1) In 
general. If for:
    (i) Any 2 of 7 consecutive taxable years, in the case of an activity 
which consists in major part of the breeding,

[[Page 239]]

training, showing, or racing of horses, or
    (ii) Any 2 of 5 consecutive taxable years, in the case of any other 
activity, the gross income derived from an activity exceeds the 
deductions attributable to such activity which would be allowed or 
allowable if the activity were engaged in for profit, such activity is 
presumed, unless the Commissioner establishes to the contrary, to be 
engaged in for profit. For purposes of this determination the deduction 
permitted by section 1202 shall not be taken into account. Such 
presumption applies with respect to the second profit year and all years 
subsequent to the second profit year within the 5- or 7-year period 
beginning with the first profit year. This presumption arises only if 
the activity is substantially the same activity for each of the relevant 
taxable years, including the taxable year in question. If the taxpayer 
does not meet the requirements of section 183(d) and this paragraph, no 
inference that the activity is not engaged in for profit shall arise by 
reason of the provisions of section 183. For purposes of this paragraph, 
a net operating loss deduction is not taken into account as a deduction. 
For purposes of this subparagraph a short taxable year constitutes a 
taxable year.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
may be illustrated by the following examples, in each of which it is 
assumed that the taxpayer has not elected, in accordance with section 
183(e), to postpone determination of whether the presumption described 
in section 183(d) and this paragraph is applicable.

    Example 1. For taxable years 1970-74, A, an individual who uses the 
cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting and the calendar 
year as the taxable year, is engaged in the activity of farming. In 
taxable years 1971, 1973, and 1974, A's deductible expenditures with 
respect to such activity exceed his gross income from the activity. In 
taxable years 1970 and 1972 A has income from the sale of farm produce 
of $30,000 for each year. In each of such years A had expenses for feed 
for his livestock of $10,000, depreciation of equipment of $10,000, and 
fertilizer cost of $5,000 which he elects to take as a deduction. A also 
has a net operating loss carryover to taxable year 1970 of $6,000. A is 
presumed, for taxable years 1972, 1973, and 1974, to have engaged in the 
activity of farming for profit, since for 2 years of a 5-consecutive-
year period the gross income from the activity ($30,000 for each year) 
exceeded the deductions (computed without regard to the net operating 
loss) which are allowable in the case of the activity ($25,000 for each 
year).
    Example 2. For the taxable years 1970 and 1971, B, an individual who 
uses the cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting and the 
calendar year as taxable year, engaged in raising pure-bred Charolais 
cattle for breeding purposes. The operation showed a loss during 1970. 
At the end of 1971, B sold a substantial portion of his herd and the 
cattle operation showed a profit for that year. For all subsequent 
relevant taxable years B continued to keep a few Charolais bulls at 
stud. In 1972, B started to raise Tennessee Walking Horses for breeding 
and show purposes, utilizing substantially the same pasture land, barns, 
and (with structural modifications) the same stalls. The Walking Horse 
operations showed a small profit in 1973 and losses in 1972 and 1974 
through 1976.
    (i) Assuming that under paragraph (d)(1) of this section the raising 
of cattle and raising of horses are determined to be separate 
activities, no presumption that the Walking Horse operation was carried 
on for profit arises under section 183(d) and this paragraph since this 
activity was not the same activity that generated the profit in 1971 and 
there are not, therefore, 2 profit years attributable to the horse 
activity.
    (ii) Assuming the same facts as in (i) above, if there were no stud 
fees received in 1972 with respect to Charolais bulls, but for 1973 stud 
fees with respect to such bulls exceed deductions attributable to 
maintenance of the bulls in that year, the presumption will arise under 
section 183(d) and this paragraph with respect to the activity of 
raising and maintaining Charolais cattle for 1973 and for all subsequent 
years within the 5-year period beginning with taxable year 1971, since 
the activity of raising and maintaining Charolais cattle is the same 
activity in 1971 and in 1973, although carried on by B on a much reduced 
basis and in a different manner. Since it has been assumed that the 
horse and cattle operations are separate activities, no presumption will 
arise with respect to the Walking Horse operation because there are not 
2 profit years attributable to such horse operation during the period in 
question.
    (iii) Assuming, alternatively, that the raising of cattle and 
raising of horses would be considered a single activity under paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section, B would receive the benefit of the presumption 
beginning in 1973 with respect to both the cattle and horses since there 
were profits in 1971 and 1973. The presumption would be effective 
through 1977 (and longer if there is an excess of income over deductions 
in this activity in 1974, 1975,

[[Page 240]]

1976, or 1977 which would extend the presumption) if, under section 
183(d) and subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, it was determined that 
the activity consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, 
or racing of horses. Otherwise, the presumption would be effective only 
through 1975 (assuming no excess of income over deductions in this 
activity in 1974 or 1975 which would extend the presumption).

    (3) Activity which consists in major part of the breeding, training, 
showing, or racing of horses. For purposes of this paragraph an activity 
consists in major part of the breeding, training, showing, or racing of 
horses for the taxable year if the average of the portion of 
expenditures attributable to breeding, training, showing, and racing of 
horses for the 3 taxable years preceding the taxable year (or, in the 
case of an activity which has not been conducted by the taxpayer for 3 
years, for so long as it has been carried on by him) was at least 50 
percent of the total expenditures attributable to the activity for such 
prior taxable years.
    (4) Transitional rule. In applying the presumption described in 
section 183(d) and this paragraph, only taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1969, shall be taken into account. Accordingly, in the case 
of an activity referred to in subparagraph (1) (i) or (ii) of this 
paragraph, section 183(d) does not apply prior to the second profitable 
taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, since taxable years 
prior to such date are not taken into account.
    (5) Cross reference. For rules relating to section 183(e) which 
permits a taxpayer to elect to postpone determination of whether any 
activity shall be presumed to be ``an activity engaged in for profit'' 
by operation of the presumption described in section 183(d) and this 
paragraph until after the close of the fourth taxable year (sixth 
taxable year, in the case of activity which consists in major part of 
breeding, training, showing, or racing of horses) following the taxable 
year in which the taxpayer first engages in the activity, see 
Sec. 1.183-3.
    (d) Activity defined--(1) Ascertainment of activity. In order to 
determine whether, and to what extent, section 183 and the regulations 
thereunder apply, the activity or activities of the taxpayer must be 
ascertained. For instance, where the taxpayer is engaged in several 
undertakings, each of these may be a separate activity, or several 
undertakings may constitute one activity. In ascertaining the activity 
or activities of the taxpayer, all the facts and circumstances of the 
case must be taken into account. Generally, the most significant facts 
and circumstances in making this determination are the degree of 
organizational and economic interrelationship of various undertakings, 
the business purpose which is (or might be) served by carrying on the 
various undertakings separately or together in a trade or business or in 
an investment setting, and the similarity of various undertakings. 
Generally, the Commissioner will accept the characterization by the 
taxpayer of several undertakings either as a single activity or as 
separate activities. The taxpayer's characterization will not be 
accepted, however, when it appears that his characterization is 
artificial and cannot be reasonably supported under the facts and 
circumstances of the case. If the taxpayer engages in two or more 
separate activities, deductions and income from each separate activity 
are not aggregated either in determining whether a particular activity 
is engaged in for profit or in applying section 183. Where land is 
purchased or held primarily with the intent to profit from increase in 
its value, and the taxpayer also engages in farming on such land, the 
farming and the holding of the land will ordinarily be considered a 
single activity only if the farming activity reduces the net cost of 
carrying the land for its appreciation in value. Thus, the farming and 
holding of the land will be considered a single activity only if the 
income derived from farming exceeds the deductions attributable to the 
farming activity which are not directly attributable to the holding of 
the land (that is, deductions other than those directly attributable to 
the holding of the land such as interest on a mortgage secured by the 
land, annual property taxes attributable to the land and improvements, 
and depreciation of improvements to the land).
    (2) Rules for allocation of expenses. If the taxpayer is engaged in 
more than one activity, an item of deduction or

[[Page 241]]

income may be allocated between two or more of these activities. Where 
property is used in several activities, and one or more of such 
activities is determined not to be engaged in for profit, deductions 
relating to such property must be allocated between the various 
activities on a reasonable and consistently applied basis.
    (3) Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. (i) A, an individual, owns a small house located near the 
beach in a resort community. Visitors come to the area for recreational 
purposes during only 3 months of the year. During the remaining 9 months 
of the year houses such as A's are not rented. Customarily, A arranges 
that the house will be leased for 2 months of 3-month recreational 
season to vacationers and reserves the house for his own vacation during 
the remaining month of the recreational season. In 1971, A leases the 
house for 2 months for $1,000 per month and actually uses the house for 
his own vacation during the other month of the recreational season. For 
1971, the expenses attributable to the house are $1,200 interest, $600 
real estate taxes, $600 maintenance, $300 utilities, and $1,200 which 
would have been allowed as depreciation had the activity been engaged in 
for profit. Under these facts and circumstances, A is engaged in a 
single activity, holding the beach house primarily for personal 
purposes, which is an ``activity not engaged in for profit'' within the 
meaning of section 183(c). See paragraph (b)(9) of Sec. 1.183-2.
    (ii) Since the $1,200 of interest and the $600 of real estate taxes 
are specifically allowable as deductions under sections 163 and 164(a) 
without regard to whether the beach house activity is engaged in for 
profit, no allocation of these expenses between the uses of the beach 
house is necessary. However, since section 262 specifically disallows 
personal, living, and family expenses as deductions, the maintenance and 
utilities expenses and the depreciation from the activity must be 
allocated between the rental use and the personal use of the beach 
house. Under the particular facts and circumstances, 2/3 (2 months of 
rental use over 3 months of total use) of each of these expenses are 
allocated to the rental use, and 1/3 (1 month of personal use over 3 
months of total use) of each of these expenses are allocated to the 
personal use as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          Rentaluse2/3 --               
                                             expenses     Personal use 1/
                                           allocable to    3 --expenses 
                                              section      allocable to 
                                             183(b)(2)      section 262 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maintenance expense $600................            $400            $200
Utilities expense $300..................             200             100
Depreciation $1,200.....................             800             400
                                         -------------------------------
    Total...............................           1,400             700
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The $700 of expenses and depreciation allocated to the personal use of 
the beach house are disallowed as a deduction under section 262. In 
addition, the allowability of each of the expenses and the depreciation 
allocated to section 183(b)(2) is determined under paragraph (b)(1) (ii) 
and (iii) of this section. Thus, the maximum amount allowable as a 
deduction under section 183(b)(2) is $200 ($2,000 gross income from 
activity, less $1,800 deductions under section 183(b)(1)). Since the 
amounts described in section 183(b)(2) ($1,400) exceed the maximum 
amount allowable ($200), and since the amounts described in paragraph 
(b)(1)(ii) of this section ($600) exceed such maximum amount allowable 
($200), none of the depreciation (an amount described in paragraph 
(b)(1)(iii) of this section) is allowable as a deduction.

    (e) Gross income from activity not engaged in for profit defined. 
For purposes of section 183 and the regulations thereunder, gross income 
derived from an activity not engaged in for profit includes the total of 
all gains from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property, and 
all other gross receipts derived from such activity. Such gross income 
shall include, for instance, capital gains, and rents received for the 
use of property which is held in connection with the activity. The 
taxpayer may determine gross income from any activity by subtracting the 
cost of goods sold from the gross receipts so long as he consistently 
does so and follows generally accepted methods of accounting in 
determining such gross income.
    (f) Rule for electing small business corporations. Section 183 and 
this section shall be applied at the corporate level in determining the 
allowable deductions of an electing small business corporation.

<R05>
Sec. 1.183-2   Activity not engaged in for profit defined.

    (a) In general. For purposes of section 183 and the regulations 
thereunder, the term activity not engaged in for profit means any 
activity other than one with respect to which deductions are allowable 
for the taxable year under section 162 or under paragraph (1) or (2) of 
section 212. Deductions are allowable under section 162 for expenses of 
carrying on activities which constitute a trade or business of the 
taxpayer and under section 212 for expenses incurred in connection with 
activities engaged in for the production or collection of income or for 
the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the 
production of income. Except as provided in section 183 and Sec. 1.183-
1, no deductions are allowable for expenses incurred in connection with 
activities which are not engaged in for profit. Thus, for example, 
deductions are not allowable under section 162 or 212 for activities 
which are carried on primarily as a sport, hobby, or for recreation. The 
determination whether an activity is engaged in for profit is to be made 
by reference to objective standards, taking into account all of the 
facts and circumstances of each case. Although a reasonable expectation 
of profit is not required, the facts and circumstances must indicate 
that the taxpayer entered into the activity, or continued the activity, 
with the objective of making a profit. In determining whether such an 
objective exists, it may be sufficient that there is a small chance of 
making a large profit. Thus it may be found that an investor in a 
wildcat oil well who incurs very substantial expenditures is in the 
venture for profit even though the expectation of a profit might be 
considered unreasonable. In determining whether an activity is engaged 
in for profit, greater weight is given to objective facts than to the 
taxpayer's mere statement of his intent.
    (b) Relevant factors. In determining whether an activity is engaged 
in for profit, all facts and circumstances with respect to the activity 
are to be taken into account. No one factor is determinative in making 
this determination. In addition, it is not intended that only the 
factors described in this paragraph are to be taken into account in 
making the determination, or that a determination is to be made on the 
basis that the number of factors (whether or not listed in this 
paragraph) indicating a lack of profit objective exceeds the number of 
factors indicating a profit objective, or vice versa. Among the factors 
which should normally be taken into account are the following:
    (1) Manner in which the taxpayer carries on the activity. The fact 
that the taxpayer carries on the activity in a businesslike manner and 
maintains complete and accurate books and records may indicate that the 
activity is engaged in for profit. Similarly, where an activity is 
carried on in a manner substantially similar to other activities of the 
same nature which are profitable, a profit motive may be indicated. A 
change of operating methods, adoption of new techniques or abandonment 
of unprofitable methods in a manner consistent with an intent to improve 
profitability may also indicate a profit motive.
    (2) The expertise of the taxpayer or his advisors. Preparation for 
the activity by extensive study of its accepted business, economic, and 
scientific practices, or consultation with those who are expert therein, 
may indicate that the taxpayer has a profit motive where the taxpayer 
carries on the activity in accordance with such practices. Where a 
taxpayer has such preparation or procures such expert advice, but does 
not carry on the activity in accordance with such practices, a lack of 
intent to derive profit may be indicated unless it appears that the 
taxpayer is attempting to develop new or superior techniques which may 
result in profits from the activity.
    (3) The time and effort expended by the taxpayer in carrying on the 
activity. The fact that the taxpayer devotes much of his personal time 
and effort to carrying on an activity, particularly if the activity does 
not have substantial personal or recreational aspects, may indicate an 
intention to derive a profit. A taxpayer's withdrawal from another 
occupation to devote most of his energies to the activity may also be 
evidence that the activity is engaged in for profit. The fact that the 
taxpayer

[[Page 243]]

devotes a limited amount of time to an activity does not necessarily 
indicate a lack of profit motive where the taxpayer employs competent 
and qualified persons to carry on such activity.
    (4) Expectation that assets used in activity may appreciate in 
value. The term profit encompasses appreciation in the value of assets, 
such as land, used in the activity. Thus, the taxpayer may intend to 
derive a profit from the operation of the activity, and may also intend 
that, even if no profit from current operations is derived, an overall 
profit will result when appreciation in the value of land used in the 
activity is realized since income from the activity together with the 
appreciation of land will exceed expenses of operation. See, however, 
paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.183-1 for definition of an activity in this 
connection.
    (5) The success of the taxpayer in carrying on other similar or 
dissimilar activities. The fact that the taxpayer has engaged in similar 
activities in the past and converted them from unprofitable to 
profitable enterprises may indicate that he is engaged in the present 
activity for profit, even though the activity is presently unprofitable.
    (6) The taxpayer's history of income or losses with respect to the 
activity. A series of losses during the initial or start-up stage of an 
activity may not necessarily be an indication that the activity is not 
engaged in for profit. However, where losses continue to be sustained 
beyond the period which customarily is necessary to bring the operation 
to profitable status such continued losses, if not explainable, as due 
to customary business risks or reverses, may be indicative that the 
activity is not being engaged in for profit. If losses are sustained 
because of unforeseen or fortuitous circumstances which are beyond the 
control of the taxpayer, such as drought, disease, fire, theft, weather 
damages, other involuntary conversions, or depressed market conditions, 
such losses would not be an indication that the activity is not engaged 
in for profit. A series of years in which net income was realized would 
of course be strong evidence that the activity is engaged in for profit.
    (7) The amount of occasional profits, if any, which are earned. The 
amount of profits in relation to the amount of losses incurred, and in 
relation to the amount of the taxpayer's investment and the value of the 
assets used in the activity, may provide useful criteria in determining 
the taxpayer's intent. An occasional small profit from an activity 
generating large losses, or from an activity in which the taxpayer has 
made a large investment, would not generally be determinative that the 
activity is engaged in for profit. However, substantial profit, though 
only occasional, would generally be indicative that an activity is 
engaged in for profit, where the investment or losses are comparatively 
small. Moreover, an opportunity to earn a substantial ultimate profit in 
a highly speculative venture is ordinarily sufficient to indicate that 
the activity is engaged in for profit even though losses or only 
occasional small profits are actually generated.
    (8) The financial status of the taxpayer. The fact that the taxpayer 
does not have substantial income or capital from sources other than the 
activity may indicate that an activity is engaged in for profit. 
Substantial income from sources other than the activity (particularly if 
the losses from the activity generate substantial tax benefits) may 
indicate that the activity is not engaged in for profit especially if 
there are personal or recreational elements involved.
    (9) Elements of personal pleasure or recreation. The presence of 
personal motives in carrying on of an activity may indicate that the 
activity is not engaged in for profit, especially where there are 
recreational or personal elements involved. On the other hand, a profit 
motivation may be indicated where an activity lacks any appeal other 
than profit. It is not, however, necessary that an activity be engaged 
in with the exclusive intention of deriving a profit or with the 
intention of maximizing profits. For example, the availability of other 
investments which would yield a higher return, or which would be more 
likely to be profitable, is not evidence that an activity is not engaged 
in for profit. An activity will not be treated as not engaged in for 
profit merely because the taxpayer has purposes or motivations other 
than

[[Page 244]]

solely to make a profit. Also, the fact that the taxpayer derives 
personal pleasure from engaging in the activity is not sufficient to 
cause the activity to be classified as not engaged in for profit if the 
activity is in fact engaged in for profit as evidenced by other factors 
whether or not listed in this paragraph.
    (c) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. The taxpayer inherited a farm from her husband in an area 
which was becoming largely residential, and is now nearly all so. The 
farm had never made a profit before the taxpayer inherited it, and the 
farm has since had substantial losses in each year. The decedent from 
whom the taxpayer inherited the farm was a stockbroker, and he also left 
the taxpayer substantial stock holdings which yield large income from 
dividends. The taxpayer lives on an area of the farm which is set aside 
exclusively for living purposes. A farm manager is employed to operate 
the farm, but modern methods are not used in operating the farm. The 
taxpayer was born and raised on a farm, and expresses a strong 
preference for living on a farm. The taxpayer's activity of farming, 
based on all the facts and circumstances, could be found not to be 
engaged in for profit.
    Example 2. The taxpayer is a wealthy individual who is greatly 
interested in philosophy. During the past 30 years he has written and 
published at his own expense several pamphlets, and he has engaged in 
extensive lecturing activity, advocating and disseminating his ideas. He 
has made a profit from these activities in only occasional years, and 
the profits in those years were small in relation to the amounts of the 
losses in all other years. The taxpayer has very sizable income from 
securities (dividends and capital gains) which constitutes the principal 
source of his livelihood. The activity of lecturing, publishing 
pamphlets, and disseminating his ideas is not an activity engaged in by 
the taxpayer for profit.
    Example 3. The taxpayer, very successful in the business of 
retailing soft drinks, raises dogs and horses. He began raising a 
particular breed of dogs many years ago in the belief that the breed was 
in danger of declining, and he has raised and sold the dogs in each year 
since. The taxpayer recently began raising and racing thoroughbred 
horses. The losses from the taxpayer's dog and horse activities have 
increased in magnitude over the years, and he has not made a profit on 
these operations during any of the last 15 years. The taxpayer generally 
sells the dogs only to friends, does not advertise the dogs for sale, 
and shows the dogs only infrequently. The taxpayer races his horses only 
at the ``prestige'' tracks at which he combines his racing activities 
with social and recreational activities. The horse and dog operations 
are conducted at a large residential property on which the taxpayer also 
lives, which includes substantial living quarters and attractive 
recreational facilities for the taxpayer and his family. Since (i) the 
activity of raising dogs and horses and racing the horses is of a 
sporting and recreational nature, (ii) the taxpayer has substantial 
income from his business activities of retailing soft drinks, (iii) the 
horse and dog operations are not conducted in a businesslike manner, and 
(iv) such operations have a continuous record of losses, it could be 
determined that the horse and dog activities of the taxpayer are not 
engaged in for profit.
    Example 4. The taxpayer inherited a farm of 65 acres from his 
parents when they died 6 years ago. The taxpayer moved to the farm from 
his house in a small nearby town, and he operates it in the same manner 
as his parents operated the farm before they died. The taxpayer is 
employed as a skilled machine operator in a nearby factory, for which he 
is paid approximately $8,500 per year. The farm has not been profitable 
for the past 15 years because of rising costs of operating farms in 
general, and because of the decline in the price of the produce of this 
farm in particular. The taxpayer consults the local agent of the State 
agricultural service from time to time, and the suggestions of the agent 
have generally been followed. The manner in which the farm is operated 
by the taxpayer is substantially similar to the manner in which farms of 
similar size, and which grow similar crops in the area, are operated. 
Many of these other farms do not make profits. The taxpayer does much of 
the required labor around the farm himself, such as fixing fences, 
planting crops, etc. The activity of farming could be found, based on 
all the facts and circumstances, to be engaged in by the taxpayer for 
profit.
    Example 5. A, an independent oil and gas operator, frequently 
engages in the activity of searching for oil on undeveloped and 
unexplored land which is not near proven fields. He does so in a manner 
substantially similar to that of others who engage in the same activity. 
The chances, based on the experience of A and others who engaged in this 
activity, are strong that A will not find a commercially profitable oil 
deposit when he drills on land not established geologically to be proven 
oil bearing land. However, on the rare occasions that these activities 
do result in discovering a well, the operator generally realizes a very 
large return from such activity. Thus, there is a small chance that A 
will make a large profit from his soil exploration activity. Under these 
circumstances, A is engaged in the activity of oil drilling for profit.
    Example 6. C, a chemist, is employed by a large chemical company and 
is engaged in a

[[Page 245]]

wide variety of basic research projects for his employer. Although he 
does no work for his employer with respect to the development of new 
plastics, he has always been interested in such development and has 
outfitted a workshop in his home at his own expense which he uses to 
experiment in the field. He has patented several developments at his own 
expense but as yet has realized no income from his inventions or from 
such patents. C conducts his research on a regular, systematic basis, 
incurs fees to secure consultation on his projects from time to time, 
and makes extensive efforts to ``market'' his developments. C has 
devoted substantial time and expense in an effort to develop a plastic 
sufficiently hard, durable, and malleable that it could be used in lieu 
of sheet steel in many major applications, such as automobile bodies. 
Although there may be only a small chance that C will invent new 
plastics, the return from any such development would be so large that it 
induces C to incur the costs of his experimental work. C is sufficiently 
qualified by his background that there is some reasonable basis for his 
experimental activities. C's experimental work does not involve 
substantial personal or recreational aspects and is conducted in an 
effort to find practical applications for his work. Under these 
circumstances, C may be found to be engaged in the experimental 
activities for profit.

<R05>
Sec. 1.183-4   Taxable years affected.

    The provisions of section 183 and the regulations thereunder shall 
apply only with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 
1969. For provisions applicable to prior taxable years, see section 270 
and Sec. 1.270-1.

<R05>
Sec. 1.186-1   Recoveries of damages for antitrust violations, etc.

    (a) Allowance of deduction. Under section 186, when a compensatory 
amount which is included in gross income is received or accrued during a 
taxable year for a compensable injury, a deduction is allowed in an 
amount equal to the lesser of (1) such compensatory amount, or (2) the 
unrecovered losses sustained as a result of such compensable injury.
    (b) Compensable injury--(1) In general. For purposes of this 
section, the term compensable injury means any of the injuries described 
in subparagraph (2), (3), or (4) of this paragraph.
    (2) Patent infringement. An injury sustained as a result of an 
infringement of a patent issued by the United States (whether or not 
issued to the taxpayer or another person or persons) constitutes a 
compensable injury. The term patent issued by the United States means 
any patent issued or granted by the United States under the authority of 
the Commissioner of Patents pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 153.
    (3) Breach of contract or of fiduciary duty or relationship. An 
injury sustained as a result of a breach of contract (including an 
injury sustained by a third party beneficiary) or a breach of fiduciary 
duty or relationship constitutes a compensable injury.
    (4) Injury suffered under certain antitrust law violations. An 
injury sustained in business, or to property, by reason of any conduct 
forbidden in the antitrust laws for which a civil action may be brought 
under section 4 of the Act of October 15, 1914 (15 U.S.C. 15), commonly 
known as the Clayton Act, constitutes a compensable injury.
    (c) Compensatory amount--(1) In general. For purposes of this 
section, the term, compensatory amount means any amount received or 
accrued during the taxable year as damages as a result of an award in, 
or in settlement of, a civil action for recovery for a compensable 
injury, reduced by any amounts paid or incurred in the taxable year in 
securing such award or settlement. The term compensatory amount includes 
only amounts compensating for actual economic injury. Thus, additional 
amounts representing punitive, exemplary, or treble damages are not 
included within the term. Where, for example, a taxpayer recovers treble 
damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act, only one-third of the 
recovery representing economic injury constitutes a compensatory amount. 
In the absence of any indication to the contrary, amounts received in 
settlement of an action shall be deemed to be a recovery for an actual 
economic injury except to the extent such settlement

[[Page 246]]

amounts exceed actual damages claimed by the taxpayer in such action.
    (2) Interest on a compensatory amount. Interest attributable to a 
compensatory amount shall not be included within the term compensatory 
amount.
    (3) Settlement of a civil action for damages--(i) Necessity for an 
action. The term compensatory amount does not include an amount received 
or accrued in settlement of a claim for a compensable injury if the 
amount is received or accrued prior to institution of an action. An 
action shall be considered as instituted upon completion of service of 
process, in accordance with the laws and rules of the court in which the 
action has been commenced or to which the action has been removed, upon 
all defendants who pay or incur an obligation to pay a compensatory 
amount.
    (ii) Specifications of the parties. If an action for a compensable 
injury is settled, the specifications of the parties will generally 
determine compensatory amounts unless such specifications are not 
reasonably supported by the facts and circumstances of the case. For 
example, the parties may provide that the sum of $1,000 represents 
actual damages sustained as the result of antitrust violations and that 
the total amount of the settlement after the trebling of damages is 
$3,000. In such case, only the sum of $1,000 would be a compensatory 
amount. In the absence of specifications of the parties, the complaint 
filed by the taxpayer may be considered in determining what portion of 
the amount of the settlement is a compensatory amount.
    (4) Amounts paid or incurred in securing the award or settlement. 
For purposes of this section, the term amounts paid or incurred in the 
taxable year in securing such award or settlement shall include legal 
expenses such as attorney's fees, witness fees, accountant fees, and 
court costs. Expenses incurred in securing a recovery of both a 
compensatory amount and other amounts from the same action shall be 
allocated among such amounts in the ratio each of such amounts bears to 
the total recovery. For instance, where a taxpayer incurs attorney's 
fees and other expenses of $3,000 in recovering $10,000 as a 
compensatory amount, $5,000 as a return of capital, and $25,000 as 
punitive damages from the same action, the taxpayer shall allocate $750 
of the expenses to the compensatory amount (10,000/40,000 x 3,000), $375 
to the return of capital (5,000/40,000 x 3,000), and $1,875 to the 
punitive damages (25,000/40,000 x  3,000).
    (d) Unrecovered losses--(1) In general. For purposes of this 
section, the term unrecovered losses sustained as a result of such 
compensable injury means the sum of the amounts of the net operating 
losses for each taxable year in whole or in part within the injury 
period, to the extent that such net operating losses are attributable to 
such compensable injury, reduced by (i) the sum of any amounts of such 
net operating losses which were allowed as a net operating loss 
carryback or carryover for any prior taxable year under the provisions 
of section 172, and (ii) the sum of any amounts allowed as deductions 
under section 186 (a) and this section for all prior taxable years with 
respect to the same compensable injury. Accordingly, a deduction is 
permitted under section 186(a) and this section with respect to net 
operating losses whether or not the period for carryover under section 
172 has expired.
    (2) Injury period. For purposes of this section, the term injury 
period means (i) with respect to an infringement of a patent, the period 
during which the infringement of the patent continued, (ii) with respect 
to a breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty or relationship, the 
period during which amounts would have been received or accrued but for 
such breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty or relationship, or 
(iii) with respect to injuries sustained by reason of a violation of 
section 4 of the Clayton Act, the period during which such injuries were 
sustained. The injury period will be determined on the basis of the 
facts and circumstances of the taxpayer's situation. The injury period 
may include a periods before and after the period covered by the civil 
action instituted.
    (3) Net operating losses attributable to compensable injuries. A net 
operating loss for any taxable year shall be treated as attributable 
(whether actually attributable or not) to a compensable injury to the 
extent the compensable injury is sustained during the taxable

[[Page 247]]

year. For purposes of determining the extent of the compensable injury 
sustained during a taxable year, a judgment for a compensable injury 
apportioning the amount of the recovery (not reduced by any amounts paid 
or incurred in securing such recovery) to specific taxable years within 
the injury period will be conclusive. If a judgment for a compensable 
injury does not apportion the amount of the recovery to specific taxable 
years within the injury period, the amount of the recovery will be 
prorated among the years within the injury period in the proportion that 
the net operating loss sustained in each of such years bear to the total 
net operating losses sustained for all such years. If an action is 
settled, the specifications of the parties will generally determine the 
apportionment of the amount of the recovery unless such specifications 
are not reasonably supported by the facts and circumstances of the case. 
In the absence of specifications of the parties, the amount of the 
recovery will be prorated among the years within the injury period in 
the proportion that the net operating loss sustained in each of such 
years bears to the total net operating losses sustained for all such 
years.
    (4) Application of losses attributable to a compensable injury. If 
only a portion of a net operating loss for any taxable year is 
attributable to a compensable injury, such portion shall (in applying 
section 172 for purposes of this section) be considered to be a separate 
net operating loss for such year to be applied after the other portion 
of such net operating loss. If, for example, in the year of the 
compensable injury the net operating loss was $1,000 and the amount of 
the compensable injury was $600, the amount of $400 not attributable to 
the compensable injury would be used first to offset profits in the 
carryover or carryback periods as prescribed by section 172. After the 
amount not attributable to the compensable injury is used to offset 
profits in other years, then the amount attributable to the compensable 
injury will be applied against profits in the carryover or carryback 
periods.
    (e) Effect on net operating loss carryovers--(1) In general. Under 
section 186 (e) if for the taxable year in which a compensatory amount 
is received or accrued any portion of the net operating loss carryovers 
to such year is attributable to the compensable injury for which such 
amount is received or accrued, such portion of the net operating loss 
carryovers must be reduced by the excess, if any, of (i) the amount 
computed under section 186(e)(1) with respect to such compensatory 
amount, over (ii) the amount computed under section 186(e)(2) with 
respect to such compensable injury.
    (2) Amount computed under section 186(e)(1). The amount computed 
under section 186(e)(1) is equal to the deduction allowed under section 
186(a) with respect to the compensatory amount received or accrued for 
the taxable year.
    (3) Amount computed under section 186(e)(2). The amount computed 
under section 186(e)(2) is equal to that portion of the unrecovered 
losses sustained as a result of the compensable injury with respect to 
which, as of the beginning of the taxable year, the period for carryover 
under section 172 has expired without benefit to the taxpayer, but only 
to the extent that such portion of the unrecovered losses did not reduce 
an amount computed under section 186(e)(1) for any prior taxable year.
    (4) Increase in income under section 172(b)(2). If there is a 
reduction for any taxable year under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
in the portion of the net operating loss carryovers to such year 
attributable to a compensable injury, then, solely for purposes of 
determining the amount of such portion which may be carried to 
subsequent taxable years, the income of such taxable year, as computed 
under section 172(b)(2), shall be increased by the amount of the 
reduction computed under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, for such 
year.
    (f) Illustration. The provisions of section 186 and this section may 
be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. (i) As of the beginning of his taxable year 1969, taxpayer 
A has a net operating loss carryover from his taxable year 1966 of $550 
of which $250 is attributable to a compensable injury. In addition, he 
has a net operating loss attributable to the compensable injury of $150 
with respect to which the period for carryover under section 172 has 
expired without benefit to the taxpayer. In

[[Page 248]]

1969, he receives a $100 compensatory amount with respect to that injury 
and he has $75 in other income. Thus, A has gross income of $175 and he 
is entitled to a $100 deduction (the compensatory amount received) under 
section 186(a) and this section since this amount is less than the 
unrecovered losses sustained as a result of the compensable injury 
($250+$150=$400). No portion of the net operating loss carryover to the 
current taxable year attributable to the compensable injury is reduced 
under section 186(e) since the amount determined under section 186(e)(1) 
($100) does not exceed the amount determined under section 186(e)(2) 
($150). Therefore, A applies a net operating loss carryover of $550 
against his remaining income of $75 and retains a net operating loss 
carryover of $475 to following years of which amount $250 remains 
attributable to the compensable injury. In addition, he retains $50 of 
net operating losses attributable to the compensable injury with respect 
to which the period for carryover under section 172 has expired without 
benefit to the taxpayer.
    (ii) In 1970, A receives a $200 compensatory amount with respect to 
the same compensable injury and has $75 of other income. Thus, A has 
gross income of $275 and he is entitled to a $200 deduction (the 
compensatory amount received) under section 186(a) and this section 
since this amount is less than the remaining unrecovered loss sustained 
as a result of the compensable injury ($250+$50=$300). The net operating 
loss carryover to the current taxable year of $250 attributable to the 
compensable injury is reduced under section 186(e) by $150, which is the 
excess of the amount determined under section 186(e)(1) ($200) over the 
amount determined under section 186(e)(2) ($50). Therefore, A applies 
net operating loss carryovers of $325 ($225 not attributable to the 
compensable injury, +$100 attributable to such injury) against his 
remaining income of $75. A retains net operating loss carryovers of $250 
for following years, of which amount $100 is attributable to the 
compensable injury. A has used all of his net operating losses 
attributable to the compensable injury with respect to which the period 
for carryover under section 172 has expired without benefit to the 
taxpayer.
    (iii) In 1971, A receives a $200 compensatory amount with respect to 
the same compensable injury and has $75 of other income. Thus, A has 
gross income of $275 and he is entitled to a $100 deduction (the amount 
of unrecovered losses) under section 186(a) and this section since this 
amount is less than the compensatory amount received ($200). The net 
operating loss carryover to the current taxable year of $100 
attributable to the compensable injury is reduced under section 186(e) 
by $100, which is the excess of the amount determined under section 
186(e)(1) ($100) over the amount determined under section 186(e)(2) 
($0). Therefore, A applies net operating loss carryovers of $150 against 
his remaining income of $175 ($100 compensatory amount plus $75 other 
income) which leaves $25 taxable income. No net operating loss carryover 
remains for following years.

    (g) Effective date. The provisions of this section are applicable as 
to compensatory amounts received or accrued in taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1968, even though the compensable injury was 
sustained in taxable years beginning before such date.

<R05>
Sec. 1.187-1   Amortization of certain coal mine safety equipment.

    (a) Allowance of deduction--(1) In general. Under section 187(a), 
every person, at his election, shall be entitled to a deduction with 
respect to the amortization of the adjusted basis (for determining gain) 
of any certified coal mine safety equipment (as defined in Sec. 1.187-
2), based on a period of 60 months. Such 60-month period shall, at the 
election of the taxpayer, begin either with the month following the 
month in which such equipment was placed in service or with the 
succeeding taxable year. For rules as to making or discontinuing the 
election, see paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For the 
computation of the adjusted basis (for determining gain) of any 
certified coal mine safety equipment, see paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.187-2.
    (2) Amount of deduction. (i) Such amortization deduction shall be an 
amount, with respect to each month of such 60-month period which falls 
within the taxable year, equal to the adjusted basis for determining 
gain of the certified coal mine safety equipment at the end of such 
month divided by the number of months (including the month for which the 
deduction is computed) remaining in such 60-month period. Such adjusted 
basis at the end of any month shall be computed without regard to the 
amortization deduction for such month. The total amortization deduction 
with respect to any certified coal mine safety equipment for a 
particular taxable year is the sum of the amortization deductions 
allowable for each month of the 60-month period which falls within such 
taxable year.

[[Page 249]]

    (ii) If any certified coal mine safety equipment is sold or 
exchanged or otherwise disposed of during a particular month, then the 
amortization deduction (if any) allowable to the transferor in respect 
of that month shall be that portion of the amount to which such person 
would be entitled for a full month which the number of days in such 
month during which the equipment was held by such person bears to the 
total number of days in such month.
    (3) Effect on other deductions. (i) The amortization deduction 
provided by section 187(a) with respect to any month shall be in lieu of 
the depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable with 
respect to such equipment under section 167 for such month.
    (ii) If the adjusted basis of such coal mine safety equipment as 
computed under section 1011 for purposes other than the amortization 
deduction provided by section 187(a) is in excess of the adjusted basis, 
as computed under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.187-2, then such excess shall 
be recovered through depreciation deductions under the rules of section 
167. See section 187(e), and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.187-2.
    (iii) See section 179 and paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of Sec. 1.179-1 for 
additional first-year depreciation in respect of certified coal mine 
safety equipment.
    (4) Special rules. (i) If the assets of a corporation which has 
elected to take the amortization deduction under section 187(a) are 
acquired by another corporation in a transaction to which section 381 
(relating to carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions) applies, the 
acquiring corporation is to be treated as if it were the transferor or 
distributor corporation for purposes of this section.
    (ii) For the right of estates and trusts to take the amortization 
deduction provided by section 187 see section 642(f) and Sec. 1.642(f)-
1.
    (iii) For the allowance of the amortization deduction in the case of 
coal mine safety equipment of partnerships see section 703 and 
Sec. 1.703-1.
    (iv) In the case of certified coal mine safety equipment held by one 
person for life with the remainder to another person, the amortization 
deduction under section 187(a) shall be computed as if the life tenant 
were the absolute owner of the property and shall be allowable to the 
life tenant during his life.
    (5) Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to 
taxable years ending after December 31, 1969.
    (6) Meaning of terms. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.187-2, 
all terms used in section 187 and the regulations thereunder shall have 
the meaning provided by this section and Sec. 1.187-2.
    (b) Election of amortization--(1) In general. Under section 187(b), 
an election by the taxpayer to make amortization deductions with respect 
to any certified coal mine safety equipment and to begin the 60-month 
amortization period shall be made by a statement to that effect attached 
to his return for the taxable year in which falls the first month of the 
60-month amortization period so elected. Such statement shall include 
the following information:
    (i) A description clearly identifying each piece of certified coal 
mine safety equipment for which an amortization deduction is claimed;
    (ii) The date on which such equipment was ``placed in service'' (see 
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of Sec. 1.187-2);
    (iii) The date on which the amortization period began;
    (iv) The total costs paid or incurred in the acquisition and 
installation of such equipment;
    (v) A computation showing the adjusted basis (as defined in 
paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.187-2) of the equipment as of the beginning of 
the amortization period;
    (vi) In the case of electric face equipment which is newly acquired 
by the taxpayer, a statement that the equipment has been certified by 
the Secretary of the Interior or the Director of the Bureau of Mines as 
being permissible within the meaning of section 305(a)(2) of the Federal 
Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969; and
    (vii) In the case of property placed in service in connection with 
used electric face equipment (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) 
of Sec. 1.187-2), a statement that such property has resulted in the 
used electric face equipment becoming permissible and a copy of the 
notification that such property is permissible.

[[Page 250]]

    (2) Late certification. If, 90 days before the date on which the 
return described in this paragraph is due, a piece of coal mine safety 
equipment has not been certified as permissible by the Secretary of the 
Interior or the Director of the Bureau of Mines, then the election may 
be made by a statement in an amended income tax return for the taxable 
year in which falls the first month of the 60-month amortization period 
so elected. The statement and amended return in such case must be filed 
not later than 90 days after the date the equipment is certified as 
permissible by the Secretary of the Interior or the Director of the 
Bureau of Mines. Amended income tax returns or claims for credit or 
refund should also be filed at this time for other taxable years which 
are within the amortization period and which are subsequent to the 
taxable year for which the election is made. Nothing in this paragraph 
shall be construed as extending the time specified in section 6511 
within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
    (3) Other requirements and considerations. No method of making the 
election provided for in section 187(a) other than that prescribed in 
this section shall be permitted on or after August 11, 1971. A taxpayer 
who does not elect in the manner prescribed in this section to take 
amortization deductions with respect to certified coal mine safety 
equipment shall not be entitled to such deductions. In the case of a 
taxpayer who has elected prior to August 11, 1971 the statement required 
by subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be attached to his income 
tax return for his taxable year in which August 11, 1971 occurs.
    (c) Election to discontinue or revoke amortization--(1) Election to 
discontinue. (i) Under section 187(c), if a taxpayer has elected to take 
the amortization deduction provided by section 187(a) with respect to 
any certified coal mine safety equipment, he may, after such election 
and prior to the expiration of the 60-month amortization period, elect 
to discontinue the amortization deduction for the remainder of the 60-
month period for such equipment.
    (ii) An election to discontinue the amortization deduction shall be 
made by a statement in writing filed with the District Director or with 
the director of the Internal Revenue Service center with whom the return 
of the taxpayer is required to be filed for its taxable year in which 
falls the first month for which the election terminates. In addition, a 
copy of such statement shall be attached to the taxpayer's income tax 
return filed for such taxable year. Such statement shall specify the 
month as of the beginning of which the taxpayer elects to discontinue 
such deductions, and shall be filed before the beginning of the month 
specified therein. In addition, such notice shall contain a description 
clearly identifying the certified coal mine safety equipment with 
respect to which the taxpayer elects to discontinue the amortization 
deduction. If the taxpayer so elects to discontinue the amortization 
deduction, he shall not be entitled to any further amortization 
deductions under section 187 with respect to such equipment.
    (2) Revocation of elections made prior to August 11, 1971. If before 
August 11, 1971 an election under section 187(a) has been made, consent 
is hereby given for the taxpayer to revoke such election without the 
consent of the Commissioner. Such election may be revoked by filing a 
notice of revocation on or before November 9, 1971. Such notice shall be 
in the form and shall be filed in the manner required by subparagraph 
(1)(ii) of this paragraph. If such revocation is for a period which 
falls within one or more taxable years for which an income tax return 
has been filed, an amended income tax return shall be filed for any 
taxable year in which a deduction was taken under section 187 on or 
before November 9, 1971.
    (3) Depreciation subsequent to discontinuance or in the case of 
revocation of amortization. (i) A taxpayer who elects in the manner 
prescribed under subparagraph (1) of this section to discontinue 
amortization deductions under section 187(a) or under subparagraph (2) 
of this paragraph to revoke an election made prior to August 11, 1971 
with respect to an item of certified coal mine safety equipment may be 
entitled to a deduction for depreciation with respect to such equipment. 
See section 167 and the regulations thereunder.

[[Page 251]]

    (ii) In the case of an election to discontinue an amortization 
deduction under section 187, the deduction for depreciation shall be 
computed beginning with the first month as to which such amortization 
deduction is not applicable, and shall be based upon the adjusted basis 
(see section 1011 and the regulations thereunder) of the property as of 
the beginning of such month. Such depreciation deduction shall be based 
upon the remaining portion of the period authorized under section 167 
for the facility, as determined as of the first day of the first month 
as of which the amortization deduction is not applicable.
    (iii) In the case of a revocation of an election under section 187 
referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this section the deduction for 
depreciation shall begin as of the time such depreciation deduction 
would have been taken but for the election under section 187. See 
subparagraph (2) of this section for rules as to filing amended returns 
for years for which amortization deductions have been taken.
    (d) Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. On September 30, 1970, the X Corporation, which uses the 
calendar year as its taxable year, places in service a piece of coal 
mine safety equipment required as a result of the Federal Coal Mine 
Health and Safety Act of 1969 which is certified as indicated in 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.187-2. The cost of the equipment is $120,000. On 
its income tax return filed for 1970, the corporation elects to take the 
amortization deductions allowed by section 187(a) with respect to the 
equipment and to begin the 60-month amortization period with October 
1970, the month following the month in which it was placed in service. 
The adjusted basis at the end of October 1970 (determined without regard 
to the amortization deduction allowed by section 187(a) for that month) 
is $120,000. The allowable amortization deduction with respect to such 
equipment for the taxable year 1970 is $6,000, computed as follows:

Monthly amortization deductions:                                        
  October: $120,000 divided by 60............................     $2,000
  November: $118,000 ($120,000 minus $2,000) divided by 59...      2,000
  December: $116,000 ($118,000 minus $2,000) divided by 58...      2,000
                                                              ----------
    Total amortization deduction for 1970....................      6,000
                                                                        

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1). Assume further 
that on May 20, 1972, X properly files notice of its election to 
discontinue the amortization deductions with the month of June 1972. The 
adjusted basis of the equipment as of June 1, 1972 (assuming no capital 
additions or improvements) is $80,000, computed as follows: Yearly 
amortization deductions computed in accordance with Example (1):

1970.........................................................     $6,000
1971.........................................................     24,000
1972 (for the first 5 months)................................     10,000
                                                              ----------
    Total amortization deductions for 20 months..............     40,000
                                                              ==========
Adjusted basis at beginning of amortization period...........    120,000
  Less: Amortization deductions..............................     40,000
                                                              ----------
Adjusted basis as of June 1, 1972............................     80,000
                                                                        

Beginning as of June 1, 1972, the deduction for depreciation under 
section 167 is allowable with respect to the property on its adjusted 
basis of $80,000.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that on 
its income tax return filed in 1970, X does not elect to take 
amortization deductions allowed by section 187(a) but that on its income 
tax return filed for 1971 X elects to begin the amortization period as 
of January 1, 1971, the taxable year succeeding the taxable year the 
equipment was placed in service. Assume further that the only adjustment 
to basis for the period October 1, 1970, to January 1, 1971, is $3,000 
for depreciation (the amount allowable, of which $2,000 is for 
additional first year depreciation under section 179) for the last 3 
months of 1970. The adjusted basis (for determining gain) for purposes 
of section 187 as of that date is $120,000 less $3,000 or $117,000.

Sec. 1.187-2   Definitions.

    (a) Certified coal mine safety equipment--(1) In general--(i) The 
term certified coal mine safety equipment means property which:
    (a) Is electric face equipment (within the meaning of section 305 of 
the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969) required in order 
to meet the requirements of section 305(a)(2) of such Act,
    (b) The Secretary of the Interior or the Director of the Bureau of 
Mines certifies is permissible within the meaning of such section 
305(a)(2), and
    (c) Is placed in service (as defined in subparagraph (2)(i) of this 
paragraph) before January 1, 1975.
    (ii) In addition, property placed in service in connection with any 
used

[[Page 252]]

electric face equipment which the Secretary of the Interior or the 
Director of the Bureau of Mines certifies makes such used electric face 
equipment permissible shall be treated as a separate item of certified 
coal mine safety equipment. See subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph.
    (2) Meaning of terms. (i) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(i)(c) of 
this paragraph, the term placed in service shall have the meaning 
assigned to such term in paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.46-3.
    (ii) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the 
term property includes those costs of converting existing nonpermissible 
electric face equipment to a permissible condition which are chargeable 
to capital account under the principles of Sec. 1.1016-2. Property is 
considered to be placed in service in connection with used electric face 
equipment (which was not permissible) if its use causes such electric 
face equipment to be certified as permissible.
    (b) Adjusted basis--(1) In general. The basis upon which the 
deduction with respect to amortization allowed by section 187 is to be 
computed with respect to any item of certified coal mine safety 
equipment shall be the adjusted basis provided in section 1011 for the 
purpose of determining gain on the sale or other disposition of such 
property (see part II (section 1011 and following) subchapter O, chapter 
1 of the Code) computed as of the first day of the amortization period. 
For an example showing the determination of the adjusted basis referred 
to in the preceding sentence in the case where the amortization period 
begins with the taxable year succeeding the taxable year in which the 
property is placed in service see Example (3) in paragraph (d) of 
Sec. 1.187-1.
    (2) Capital additions. The adjusted basis of any certified coal mine 
safety equipment, with respect to which an election is made under 
section 187(b), shall not be increased, for purposes of section 187, for 
amounts chargeable to the capital account for additions or improvements 
after the amortization period has begun. However, nothing contained in 
this section or Sec. 1.187-1 shall be deemed to disallow a deduction for 
depreciation for such capital additions. Thus, for example, if a 
taxpayer places a piece of certified coal mine safety equipment in 
service in 1971 and in 1972 makes improvements to it the expenditures 
for which are chargeable to the capital account, such improvements shall 
not increase the adjusted basis of the equipment for purposes of 
computing the amortization deduction allowed by section 187(a). However, 
the depreciation deduction provided by section 167 shall be allowed with 
respect to such improvements in accordance with the principles of 
section 167.

[T.D. 7137, 36 FR 14734, Aug. 11, 1971; 36 FR 19251, Oct. 1, 1971]


<R05>
Sec. 1.188-1  Amortization of certain expenditures for qualified on-the-job training and child care facilities.

    (a) Allowance of deduction--(1) In general. Under section 188, at 
the election of the taxpayer, any eligible expenditure (as defined in 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section) made by such taxpayer to acquire, 
construct, reconstruct, or rehabilitate section 188 property (as defined 
in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) shall be allowable as a deduction 
ratably over a period of 60 months. Such 60-month period shall begin 
with the month in which such property is placed in service. For rules 
for making the election, see paragraph (b) of this section. For rules 
relating to the termination of an election, see paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (2) Amount of deduction--(i) In general. For each eligible 
expenditure attributable to an item of section 188 property the 
amortization deduction shall be an amount, with respect to each month of 
the 60-month amortization period which falls within the taxable year, 
equal to the elgible expenditure divided by 60. The total amortization 
deduction with respect to each item of section 188 property for a 
particular taxable year is the sum of the amortization deductions 
allowable for each month of the 60-month period which falls within such 
taxable year. The total amortization deduction under section 188 for a 
particular taxable year is the sum of the amortization deductions 
allowable with respect to each item of section 188 property for that 
taxable year.

[[Page 253]]

    (ii) Separate amortization period for each expenditure. Each 
eligible expenditure attributable to an item of section 188 property to 
which an election relates shall be amortized over a 60-month period 
beginning with the month in which the item of section 188 property is 
placed in service. Thus, if a taxpayer makes an eligible expenditure for 
an addition to, or improvement of, section 188 property, such 
expenditure must be amortized over a separate 60-month period beginning 
with the month in which the section 188 property is placed in service.
    (iii) Separate items. The determination of what constitutes a 
separate item of section 188 property is to be made on the basis of the 
facts and circumstances of each individual case. Additions or 
improvements to an existing item of section 188 property are treated as 
a separate item of section 188 property. In general, each item of 
personal property is a separate item of property and each building, or 
separate element or structural component thereof, is a separate item of 
property. For purposes of subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this 
subparagraph, two or more items of property may be treated as a single 
item of property if such items (A) are placed in service within the same 
month of the taxable year, (B) have same estimated useful life, and (C) 
are to be used in a functionally related manner in the operation of a 
qualified on-the-job training or child care facility or are integrally 
related facilities (described in paragraph (d) (3) or (4) of this 
section.
    (iv) Disposition of property or termination of election. If an item 
of section 188 property is sold or exchanged or otherwise disposed of 
(or if the item of property ceases to be used as section 188 property by 
the taxpayer) during a particular month, then the amortization deduction 
(if any) allowable to the taxpayer in respect of that item for that 
month shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount to 
which the taxpayer would be entitled for a full month as the number of 
days in such month during which the property was held by him (or used by 
him as section 188 property) bears to the total number of days in such 
month.
    (3) Effect on other deductions. The amortization deduction provided 
by section 188(a) with respect to any month shall be in lieu of any 
depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable under sections 
167 or 179 with respect to that portion of the adjusted basis of the 
property attributable to an adjustment under section 1016(a)(1) made on 
account of an eligible expenditure.
    (4) Depreciation with respect to property ceasing to be used as 
section 188 property. A taxpayer is entitled to a deduction for the 
depreciation (to the extent allowable under section 167) of property 
with respect to which the election under section 188 is terminated under 
the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section. The deduction for 
depreciation shall begin with the date of such termination and shall be 
computed on the adjusted basis of the property as of such date. The 
depreciation deduction shall be based upon the estimated remaining 
useful life and salvage value authorized under section 167 for the 
property as of the termination date.
    (5) Investment credit not to be allowed. Any property with respect 
to which an election has been made under section 188(a) shall not be 
treated as section 38 property within the meaning of section 48(a).
    (6) Special rules--(i) Life estates. In the case of section 188 
property held by one person for life with the remainder to another 
person, the amortization deduction under section 188(a) shall be 
computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property 
and shall be allowable to the life tenant during his life.
    (ii) Certain corporate acquistions. If the assets of a corporation 
which has elected to take the amortization deduction under section 
188(a) are acquired by another corporation in a transaction to which 
section 381(a) (relating to carryovers in certain corporate 
acquisitions) applies, the acquiring corporation is to be treated as if 
it were the distributor or transferor corporation for purposes of this 
section.
    (iii) Estates and trusts. For the allowance of the amortization 
deduction in

[[Page 254]]

the case of estates and trusts, see section 642(f) and Sec. 1.642(f)-
(1).
    (iv) Partnerships. For the allowance of the amortization deduction 
in the case of partnerships, see section 703 and Sec. 1.703-1.
    (b) Time and manner of making election--(1) In general. Except as 
otherwise provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, an election to 
amortize an eligible expenditure under section 188 shall be made by 
attaching, to the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable period 
for which the deduction is first allowable to such taxpayer, a written 
statement containing:
    (i) A description clearly identifying each item of property (or two 
or more items of property treated as a single item) forming a part of a 
qualified on-the-job training or child care facility to which the 
election relates. e.g., building, classroom equipment, etc.;
    (ii) The date on which the eligible expenditure was made for such 
item of property (or the period during which eligible expenditures were 
made for two or more items of property treated as a single item of 
property);
    (iii) The date on which such item of property was ``placed in 
service'' (see paragraph (d)(5) of this section);
    (iv) The amount of the eligible expenditure of such item of property 
(or the total amount of expenditures for two or more items of property 
treated as a single item); and
    (v) The annual amortization deduction claimed with respect to such 
item of property.

If the taxpayer does not file a timely return (taking into account 
extensions of the time for filing) for the taxable year for which the 
election is first to be made, the election shall be filed at the time 
the taxpayer files his first return for that year. The election may be 
made with an amended return only if such amended return is filed no 
later than the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for 
filing the return for the taxable year of election.
    (2) Special rule. With respect to any return filed before (90 days 
after the date on which final regulations are filed with the Office of 
the Federal Register), the election to amortize an eligible expenditure 
for section 188 property shall be made by a statement on, or attached 
to, the income tax return (or an amended return) for the taxable year, 
indicating that an election is being made under section 188 and setting 
forth information to identify the election and the facility or 
facilities to which it applies. An election made under the provisions of 
this subparagraph, must be made not later than (i) the time, including 
extensions thereof, prescribed by law for filing the income tax return 
for the first taxable year for which the election is being made or (ii) 
before (90 days after the date on which final regulations under section 
188 are filed with the Office of the Federal Register), whichever is 
later. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as extending the 
time specified in section 6511 within which a claim for credit or refund 
may be filed.
    (3) No other method of making election. No method for making the 
election under section 188(a) other than the method prescribed in this 
paragraph shall be permitted. If an election to amortize section 188 
property is not made within the time and in the manner prescribed in 
this paragraph, no election may be made (by the filing of an amended 
return or in any other manner) with respect to such section 188 
property.
    (4) Effect of election. An election once made may not be revoked by 
a taxpayer with respect to any item of section 188 property to which the 
election relates. The election of the amortization deducted for an item 
of section 188 property shall not affect the taxpayer's right to elect 
or not to elect the amortization deduction as to other items of section 
188 property even though the items are part of the same facility. For 
rules relating to the termination of an election other than by 
revocation by the taxpayer, see paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) Termination of election. If the specific use of an item of 
section 188 property in connection with a qualified on-the-job training 
or child care facility is discontinued, the election made with respect 
to that item of property shall be terminated. The termination shall be 
effective with respect to such item of property as of the earliest date 
on

[[Page 255]]

which the taxpayer's specific use of the item is no longer in connection 
with the operation of a qualified on-the-job training or child care 
facility. If a facility ceases to meet the applicable requirements of 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section, relating to qualified on-the-job 
training facilities, or paragraph (d)(4) of this section, relating to 
qualified child care facilities, the election or elections made with 
respect to the items of section 188 property comprising such facility 
shall be terminated. The termination shall be effective with respect to 
such items of poperty as of the earliest date on which the facility is 
no longer qualified under the applicable rules. For rules relating to 
depreciation with respect to property ceasing to be used as section 188 
property, see paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
    (d) Definitions and special requirements--(1) Eligible expenditure. 
For purposes of this section, the term eligible expenditure means an 
expenditure:
    (i) Chargeable to capital account;
    (ii) Made after December 31, 1971, and before January 1, 1982, to 
acquire, construct, reconstruct, or rehabilitate section 188 property 
which is a qualified child care center facility (or, made after December 
31, 1971, and before January 1, 1977, to acquire, construct, 
reconstruct, or rehabilitate section 188 property which is a qualified 
on-the-job training facility); and
    (iii) For which, but only to the extent that, a grant or other 
reimbursement excludable from gross income is not, directly or 
indirectly, payable to, or for the benefit of, the taxpayer with respect 
to such expenditure under any job training or child care program 
established or funded by the United States, a State, or any 
instrumentality of the foregoing, or the District of Columbia.

For purposes of this subparagraph, an expenditure is considered to be 
made when actually paid by a taxpayer who computes his taxable income 
under the cash receipts and disbursements method or when the obligation 
therefore is incurred by a taxpayer who computes his taxable income 
under the accrual method. See subparagraph (5) of this paragraph for the 
determination of when section 188 property is placed in service for 
purposes of beginning the 60-month amortization period.
    (2) Section 188 property. Section 188 property is tangible property 
which is:
    (i) Of a character subject to depreciation;
    (ii) Located within the United States; and
    (iii) Specifically used as an integral part of a qualified on-the-
job training facility (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) 
or as an integral part of a qualified child care center facility (as 
defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.)
    (3) Qualified on-the-job training facility. A qualified on-the-job 
training facility is a facility specifically used by an employer as an 
on-the-job training facility in connection with an occupational training 
program for his employees or prospective employees provided that with 
respect to such program:
    (i) All of the following requirements are met:
    (A) There is offered at the training facility a systematic program 
comprised of work and training and related instruction;
    (B) The occupation, together with a listing of its basic skills, and 
the estimated schedule of time for accomplishments of such skills, are 
clearly identified;
    (C) The content of the training is adequate to qualify the employee, 
or prospective employee, for the occupation for which the individual is 
being trained;
    (D) The skills are to be imparted by competent instructors;
    (E) Upon completion of the training, placement is to be based 
primarily upon the skills learned through the training program;
    (F) The period of training is not less than the time necessary to 
acquire minimum job skills nor longer than the usual period of training 
for the same occupation; and
    (G) There is reasonable certainty that employment will be available 
with the employer in the occupation for which the training is provided; 
or
    (ii) The employer has entered into an agreement with the United 
States, or a State agency, under the provisions of

[[Page 256]]

the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962, as amended and 
supplemented (42 U.S.C. 2571 et seq.), the Economic Opportunity Act of 
1964, as amended and supplemented (42 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.), section 
432(b)(1) of the Social Security Act, as amended and supplemented (42 
U.S.C. 632(b)(1)), the National Apprenticeship Act of 1937, as amended 
and supplemented (29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.), or other similar Federal 
statute.

A facility consists of a building or any portion of a building and its 
structural components in which training is conducted, and equipment or 
other personal property necessary to teach a trainee the basic skills 
required for satisfactory performance in the occupation for which the 
training is being given. A facility also includes a building or portion 
of a building which provides essential services for trainees during the 
course of the training program, such as a dormitory or dining hall. For 
purposes of this section, a facility is considered to be specifically 
used as an on-the-job training facility if such facility is actually 
used for such purposes and is not used in a significant manner for any 
purpose other than job training or the furnishing of essential services 
for trainees such as meals and lodging. For purposes of the preceding 
sentence if a facility is used 20 percent of the time for a purpose 
other than on-the-job training or providing trainees with essential 
services, it would not satisfy the significant use test. Thus, a 
production facility is not an on-the-job training facility for purposes 
of section 188 simply because new employees receive training on the 
machines they will be using as fully productive employees. A facility is 
considered to be used by an employer in connection with an occupational 
training program for his employees or prospective employees if at least 
80 percent of the trainees participating in the program are employees or 
prospective employees. For purposes of this section, a prospective 
employee is a trainee with respect to whom it is reasonably expected 
that the trainee will be employed by the employer upon successful 
completion of the training program.
    (4) Qualified child care facility. A qualified child care facility 
is a facility which is:
    (i) Particulary suited to provide child care services and 
specifically used by an employer to provide such services primarily for 
his employees' children;
    (ii) Operated as a licensed or approved facility under applicable 
local law, if any, relating to the day care of children; and
    (iii) If directly or indirectly funded to any extent by the United 
States, established and operated in compliance with the requirements 
contained in Part 71 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 
relating to Federal Interagency Day Care Requirements. For purposes of 
this subparagraph, a facility consists of the buildings, or portions or 
structural components thereof, in which children receive such personal 
care protection, and supervision in the absence of their parents as may 
be required to meet their needs, and the equipment or other personal 
property necessary to render such services. Whether or not a facility, 
or any component property thereof, is particularly suited for the needs 
of the children being cared for depends upon the facts and circumstances 
of each individual case. Generally, a building and its structural 
component, or a room therein, and equipment are particulary suitable for 
furnishing child care service if they are designed or adapted for such 
use or satisfy requirements under local law for such use as a condition 
to granting a license for the operation of the facility. For example, 
such property includes special kitchen or toilet facilities connected to 
the building or room in which the services are rendered and equipment 
such as children's desks, chairs, and play or instructional equipment. 
Such property would not include general purpose rooms used for many 
purposes (for example, a room used as an employee recreation center 
during the evening) nor would it include a room or a part of a room 
which is simply screened off for use by children during the day. For 
purposes of this section, a facility is considered to be specifically 
used as a child care facility if such facility is actually used for such 
purpose and is not used in a significant manner for any purpose

[[Page 257]]

other than child care. For purposes of this subparagraph, a child care 
facility is used by an employer to provide child care services primarily 
for children of employees of the employer if, for any month, no more

Sec. 1.190-1  Expenditures to remove architectural and transportation barriers to the handicapped and elderly.

    (a) In general. Under section 190 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954, a taxpayer may elect, in the manner provided in Sec. 1.190-3 of 
this chapter, to deduct certain amounts paid or incurred by him in any 
taxable year beginning after December 31, 1976, and before January 1, 
1980, for qualified architectural and transportation barrier removal 
expenses (as defined in Sec. 1.190-2(b) of this chapter). In the case of 
a partnership, the election shall be made by the partnership. The 
election applies to expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable 
year which (but for the election) are chargeable to capital account.
    (b) Limitation. The maximum deduction for a taxpayer (including an 
affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return) for any 
taxable year is $25,000. The $25,000 limitation applies to a partnership 
and to each partner. Expenditures paid or incurred in a taxable year in 
excess of the amount deductible under section 190 for such taxable year 
are capital expenditures and are adjustments to basis under section 
1016(a). A partner must combine his distributive share of the 
partnership's deductible expenditures (after application of the $25,000 
limitation at the partnership level) with that partner's distributive 
share of deductible expenditures from any other partnership plus that 
partner's own section 190 expenditures, if any (if he makes the election 
with respect to his own expenditures), and apply the partner's $25,000 
limitation to the combined total to determine the aggregate amount 
deductible by that partner. In so doing, the partner may allocate the 
partner's $25,000 limitation among the partner's own section 190 
expenditures and the partner's distributive share of partnership 
deductible expenditures in any manner. If such allocation results in all 
or a portion of the partner's distributive share of a partnership's 
deductible expenditures not being an allowable deduction by the partner, 
the partnership may capitalize such unallowable portion by an 
appropriate adjustment to the basis of the relevant partnership property 
under section 1016. For purposes of adjustments to the basis of 
properties held by a partnership, however, it shall be presumed that 
each partner's distributive share of partnership deductible expenditures 
(after application of the $25,000 limitation at the partnership level) 
was allowable in full to the partner. This presumption can be rebutted 
only by clear and convincing evidence that all or any portion of a 
partner's distributive share of the partnership section 190 deduction 
was not allowable as a deduction to the partner because it exceeded that 
partner's $25,000 limitation as allocated by him. For example, suppose 
for 1978 A's distributive share of the ABC partnership's deductible 
section 190 expenditures (after application of the $25,000 limitation at 
the partnership level) is $15,000. A also made section 190 expenditures 
of $20,000 in 1978 which he elects to deduct. A allocates $10,000 of his 
$25,000 limitation to his distributive share of the ABC expenditures and 
$15,000 to his own expenditures. A may capitalize the excess $5,000 of 
his own expenditures. In addition, if ABC obtains from A evidence which 
meets the requisite burden of proof, it may capitalize the $5,000 of A's 
distributive

[[Page 258]]

share which is not allowable as a deduction to A.

general or special transportation service (including such service 
rendered to the customers of a taxpayer who is not in the trade or 
business of rendering transportation services).
    (3) The term handicapped individual means any individual who has:
    (i) A physical or mental disability (including, but not limited to, 
blindness or deafness) which for such individual constitutes or results 
in a functional limitation to employment, or
    (ii) A physical or mental impairment (including, but not limited to,

such individual's major life activities, such as performing manual 
tasks, walking, speaking, breathing, learning, or working.
    (4) The term elderly individual means an individual age 65 or over.
    (b) Qualified architectual and transportation barrier removal 
expense--(1) In general. The term qualified architectural and 
transportation barrier removal expense means an architectural or 
transportation barrier removal expense (as defined in paragraph (a) of 
this section) with respect to which the taxpayer establishes, to the 
satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate, that the resulting

vehicle to all the requirements set forth in one or more of paragraphs 
(b) (2) through (22) of this section or in one or more of the 
subdivisions of paragraph (b) (20) or (21). Such term includes only 
expenses specifically attributable to the removal of an existing 
architectural or transportation barrier. It does not include any part of 
any expense paid or incurred in connection with the construction or 
comprehensive renovation of a facility or public transportation vehicle 
or the normal replacement of depreciable property. Such term may include 
expenses of construction, as, for example, the construction of a ramp to 
remove the barrier posed for wheelchair users by steps. Major portions 
of the standards set forth in this paragraph were adapted from 
``American National Standard Specifications for Making Buildings and 
Facilities Accessible to, and Usable by, the Physically Handicapped''

a hazard.
    (iii) A ramp shall have a nonslip surface.
    (iv) A ramp shall have a level platform at the top and at the 
bottom. If a door swings out onto the platform or toward the ramp, such 
platform shall be at least 5 feet deep and 5 feet wide. If a door does 
not swing onto the platform or toward the ramp, such platform shall be 
at least 3 feet deep and 5 feet wide. A platform shall extend at least 1 
foot beyond the strike jamb side of any doorway.
    (v) A ramp shall have level platforms at not more than 30-foot 
intervals and at any turn.

Sec. 1.190-3  Election to deduct architectural and transportation barrier removal expenses.

    (a) Manner of making election. The election to deduct expenditures 
for removal of architectural and transportation barriers provided by 
section 190(a) shall be made by claiming the deduction as a separate 
item identified as such on the taxpayer's income tax return for the 
taxable year for which such election is to apply (or, in the case of a 
partnership, to the return of partnership income for such year). For the 
election to be valid, the return must be filed not later than the time 
prescribed by law for filing the return (including extensions thereof) 
for the taxable year for which the election is to apply.
    (b) Scope of election. An election under section 190(a) shall apply 
to all expenditures described in Sec. 1.190-2 (or in the case of a 
taxpayer whose architectural and transportation barrier removal expenses 
exceed $25,000 for the taxable year, to the $25,000 of such expenses 
with respect to which the deduction is claimed) paid or incurred during 
the taxable year for which made and shall be irrevocable after the date 
by which any such election must have been made.

[[Page 263]]

    (c) Records to be kept. In any case in which an election is made 
under section 190(a), the taxpayer shall have available, for the period 
prescribed by paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.6001-1 of this chapter (Income Tax 
Regulations), records and documentation, including architectural plans 
and blueprints, contracts, and any building permits, of all the facts 
necessary to determine the amount of any deduction to which he is 
entitled by reason of the election, as well as the amount of any 
adjustment to basis made for expenditures in excess of the amount 
deductible under section 190.

<R05>
Sec. 1.193-1  Deduction for tertiary injectant expenses.

    (a) In general. Subject to the limitations and restrictions of 
paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, there shall be allowed as a 
deduction from gross income an amount equal to the qualified tertiary 
injectant expenses of the taxpayer. This deduction is allowed for the 
later of:
    (1) The taxable year in which the injectant is injected, or
    (2) The taxable year in which the expenses are paid or incurred.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Qualified tertiary injectant expenses. Except 
as otherwise provided in this section, the term qualified tertiary 
injectant expense means any cost paid or incurred for any tertiary 
injectant which is used as part of a tertiary recovery method.
    (2) Tertiary recovery method. Tertiary recovery method means:
    (i) Any method which is described in subparagraphs (1) through (9) 
of section 212.78(c) of the June 1979 energy regulations (as defined by 
section 4996(b)(8)(C)),
    (ii) Any method for which the taxpayer has obtained the approval of 
the Associate Chief Counsel (Technical), under section 4993(d)(1)(B) for 
purposes of Chapter 45 of the Internal Revenue Code,
    (iii) Any method which is approved in the regulations under section 
4993(d)(1)(B), or
    (iv) Any other method to provide tertiary enhanced recovery for 
which the taxpayer obtains the approval of the Associate Chief Counsel 
(Technical) for purposes of section 193.
    (c) Special rules for hydrocarbons--(1) In general. If an injectant 
contains more than an insignificant amount of recoverable hydrocarbons, 
the amount deductible under section 193 and paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be limited to the cost of the injectant reduced by the 
lesser of:
    (i) The fair market value of the hydrocarbon component in the form 
in which it is recovered, or
    (ii) The cost to the taxpayer of the hydrocarbon component of the 
injectant. Price levels at the time of injection are to be used in 
determining the fair market value of the recoverable hydrocarbons.
    (2) Presumption of recoverability. Except to the extent that the 
taxpayer can demonstrate otherwise, all hydrocarbons shall be presumed 
recoverable and shall be presumed to have the same value on recovery 
that they would have if separated from the other components of the 
injectant before injection. Estimates based on generally accepted 
engineering practices may provide evidence of limitations on the amount 
or value of recoverable hydrocarbons.
    (3) Significant amount. For purposes of section 193 and this 
section, an injectant contains more than an insignificant amount of 
recoverable hydrocarbons if the fair market value of the recoverable 
hydrocarbon component of the injectant, in the form in which it is 
recovered, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the cost of the injectant.
    (4) Hydrocarbon defined. For purposes of section 193 and this 
section, the term hydrocarbon means all forms of natural gas and crude 
oil (which includes oil recovered from sources such as oil shale and 
condensate).
    (5) Injectant defined. For purposes of applying this paragraph (c), 
an injectant is the substance or mixture of substances injected at a 
particular time. Substances injected at different times are not treated 
as components of a single injectant even if the injections are part of a 
single tertiary recovery process.
    (d) Application with other deductions. No deduction shall be allowed 
under section 193 and this section for any expenditure:

[[Page 264]]

    (1) With respect to which the taxpayer has made an election under 
section 263(c) or
    (2) With respect to which a deduction is allowed or allowable under 
any other provision of chapter 1 of the Code.
    (e) Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. B, a calendar year taxpayer why uses the cash receipts 
and disbursements method of accounting, uses an approved tertiary 
recovery method for the enhanced recovery of crude oil from one of B's 
oil properties. During 1980, B pays $100x for a tertiary injectant which 
contains 1,000y units of hydrocarbon; if separated from the other 
components of the injectant before injection, the hydrocarbons would 
have a fair market value of $80x. B uses this injectant during the 
recovery effort during 1981. B has not made any election under section 
263(c) with respect to the expenditures for the injectant, and no 
section of chapter 1 of the Code other than section 193 allows a 
deduction for the expenditure. B is unable to demonstrate that the value 
of the injected hydrocarbons recovered during production will be less 
than $80x. B's deduction under section 193 is limited to the excess of 
the cost for the injectant over the fair market value of the hydrocarbon 
component expected to be recovered ($100x--$80x=$20x). B may claim the 
deduction only for 1981, the year of the injection.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that 
through engineering studies B has shown that 700y units or 70 percent of 
the hydrocarbon injected is nonrecoverable. The recoverable hydrocarbons 
have a fair market value of $24x (30 percent of $80x). The recoverable 
hydrocarbon portion of the injectant is 24 percent of the cost of the 
injectant ($24x divided by $100x). The injectant does not contain a 
significant amount of recoverable hydrocarbons. B may claim a deduction 
for $100x, the entire cost of the injectant.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that 
through laboratory studies B has shown that because of chemical changes 
in the course of production the injected hydrocarbons that are recovered 
will have a fair market value of only $40x. B may claim a deduction for 
$60x, the excess of the cost of the injectant ($100x) over the fair 
market value of the recoverable hydrocarbons ($40x).
    Example 4. B prepares an injectant from crude oil and certain non-
hydrocarbon materials purchased by B. The total cost of the injectant to 
B is $100x, of which $24x is attributable to the crude oil. The fair 
market value of the crude oil used in the injectant is $27x. B is unable 
to demonstrate that the value of the crude oil from the injectant that 
will be recovered is less than $27x. The injectant contains more than an 
insignificant amount of recoverable hydrocarbons because the value of 
the recoverable crude oil ($27x) exceeds $25x (25 percent of $100x, the 
cost of the injectant). Because the cost to B of the hydrocarbon 
component of the injectant ($24x) is less than the fair market value of 
the hydrocarbon component in the form in which it is recovered ($27x), 
the cost rather than the value is taken into account in the adjustment 
required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. B's deduction under 
section 193 is limited to the excess of the cost of the injectant over 
the cost of the hydrocarbon component ($100x--$24x=$76x).

Sec. 1.194-1  Amortization of reforestation expenditures.

    (a) In general. Section 194 allows a taxpayer to elect to amortize 
over an 84-month period, up to $10,000 of reforestation expenditures (as 
defined in Sec. 1.194-3(c)) incurred by the taxpayer in a taxable year 
in connection with qualified timber property (as defined in Sec. 1.194-
3(a)). The election is not available to trusts. Only those reforestation 
expenditures which result in additions to capital accounts after 
December 31, 1979 are eligible for this special amortization.
    (b) Determination of amortization period. The amortization period 
must begin on the first day of the first month of the last half of the 
taxable year during which the taxpayer incurs the reforestation 
expenditures. For example, the 84-month amortization period begins on 
July 1 of a taxable year for a calendar year taxpayer, regardless of 
whether the reforestation expenditures are incurred in January or 
December of that taxable year. Therefore, a taxpayer will be allowed to 
claim amortization deductions for only six months of each of the first 
and eighth taxable years of the period over which the reforestation 
expenditures will be amortized.
    (c) Recapture. If a taxpayer disposes of qualified timber property 
within ten years of the year in which the amortizable basis was created 
and the taxpayer has claimed amortization deductions under section 194, 
part or all of any

[[Page 265]]

gain on the disposition may be recaptured as ordinary income. See 
section 1245.

[T.D. 7927, 48 FR 55849, Dec. 16, 1983]


<R05>
Sec. 1.194-2  Amount of deduction allowable.

    (a) General rule. The allowable monthly deduction with respect to 
reforestation expenditures made in a taxable year is determined by 
dividing the amount of reforestation expenditures made in such taxable 
year (after applying the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section) 
by 84. In order to determine the total allowable amortization deduction 
for a given month, a taxpayer should add the monthly amortization 
deductions computed under the preceding sentence for qualifying 
expenditures made by the taxpayer in the taxable year and the preceding 
seven taxable years.
    (b) Dollar limitation--(1) Maximum amount subject to election. A 
taxpayer may elect to amortize up to $10,000 of qualifying reforestation 
expenditures each year under section 194. However, the maximum 
amortizable amount is $5,000 in the case of a married individual (as 
defined in section 143) filing a separate return. No carryover or 
carryback of expenditures in excess of $10,000 is permitted. The maximum 
annual amortization deduction for expenditures incurred in any taxable 
year is $1,428.57 ($10,000/7). The maximum deduction in the first and 
eighth taxable years of the amortization period is one-half that amount, 
or $714.29, because of the half-year convention provided in Sec. 1.194-
1(b). Total deductions for any one year under this section will reach 
$10,000 only if a taxpayer incurs and elects to amortize the maximum 
$10,000 of expenditures each year over an 8-year period.
    (2) Allocation of amortizable basis among taxpayer's timber 
properties. The limit of $10,000 on amortizable reforestation 
expenditures applies to expenditures paid or incurred during a taxable 
year on all of the taxpayer's timber properties. A taxpayer who incurs 
more than $10,000 in qualifying expenditures in connection with more 
than one qualified timber property during a taxable year may select the 
properties for which section 194 amortization will be elected as well as 
the manner in which the $10,000 limitation on amortizable basis is 
allocated among such properties. For example, A incurred $10,000 of 
qualifying reforestation expenditures on each of four properties in 
1981. A may elect under section 194 to amortize $2,500 of the amount 
spent on each property, $5,000 of the amount spent on any two 
properties, the entire $10,000 spent on any one property, or A may 
allocate the $10,000 maximum amortizable basis among some or all of the 
properties in any other manner.
    (3) Basis--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of this section, the basis of a taxpayer's interest in 
qualified timber property for which an election is made under section 
194 shall be adjusted to reflect the amount of the section 194 
amortization deduction allowable to the taxpayer.
    (ii) Special rule for trusts. Although a trust may be a partner of a 
partnership, income beneficiary of an estate, or (for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1982) shareholder of an S corporation, it 
may not deduct its allocable share of a section 194 amortization 
deduction allowable to such a partnership, estate, or S corporation. In 
addition, the basis of the interest held by the partnership, estate, or 
S corporation in the qualified timber property shall not be adjusted to 
reflect the portion of the section 194 amortization deduction that is 
allocable to the trust.
    (4) Allocation of amortizable basis among component members of a 
controlled group. Component members of a controlled group (as defined in 
Sec. 1.194-3(d)) on a December 31 shall be treated as one taxpayer in 
applying the $10,000 limitation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The 
amortizable basis may be allocated to any one such member or allocated 
(for the taxable year of each such member which includes such December 
31) among the several members in any manner, Provided That the amount of 
amortizable basis allocated to any member does not exceed the amount of 
amortizable basis actually acquired by the member in the taxable year. 
The allocation is to be made (i) by the common parent corporation if a 
consolidated return is filed for all component members of the group, or 
(ii) in

[[Page 266]]

accordance with an agreement entered into by the members of the group if 
separate returns are filed. If a consolidated return is filed by some 
component members of the group and separate returns are filed by other 
component members, then the common parent of the group filing the 
consolidated return shall enter into an agreement with those members who 
do not join in filing the consolidated return allocating the amount 
between the group filing the return and the other component members of 
the controlled group who do not join in filing the consolidated return. 
If a consolidated return is filed, the common parent corporation shall 
file a separate statement attached to the income tax return on which an 
election is made to amortize reforestation costs under section 194. See 
Sec. 1.194-4. If separate returns are filed by some or all component 
members of the group, each component member to which is allocated any 
part of the deduction under secton 194 shall file a separate statement 
attached to the income tax return in which an election is made to 
amortize reforestation expenditures. See Sec. 1.194-4. Such statement 
shall include the name, address, employer identification number, and the 
taxable year of each component member of the controlled group, a copy of 
the allocation agreement signed by persons duly authorized to act on 
behalf of those members who file separate returns, and a description of 
the manner in which the deduction under section 194 has been divided 
among them.
    (5) Partnerships--(i) Election to be made by partnership. A 
partnership makes the election to amortize qualified reforestation 
expenditures of the partnership. See section 703(b).
    (ii) Dollar limitations applicable to partnerships. The dollar 
limitations of section 194 apply to the partnership as well as to each 
partner. Thus, a partnership may not elect to amortize more than $10,000 
of reforestation expenditures under section 194 in any taxable year.
    (iii) Partner's share of amortizable basis. Section 704 and the 
regulations thereunder shall govern the determination of a partner's 
share of a partnership's amortizable reforestation expenditures for any 
taxable year.
    (iv) Dollar limitation applicable to partners. A partner shall in no 
event be entitled in any taxable year to claim a deduction for 
amortization based on more than $10,000 ($5,000 in the case of a married 
taxpayer who files a separate return) of amortizable basis acquired in 
such taxable year regardless of the source of the amortizable basis. In 
the case of a partner who is a member of two or more partnerships that 
elect under section 194, the partner's aggregate share of partnership 
amortizable basis may not exceed $10,000 or $5,000, whichever is 
applicable. In the case of a member of a partnership that elects under 
section 194 who also has separately acquired qualified timber property, 
the aggregate of the member's partnership and non-partnership 
amortizable basis may not exceed $10,000 or $5,000 whichever is 
applicable.
    (6) S corporations. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 
1982, rules similar to those contained in paragraph (b)(5) (ii) and (iv) 
of this section shall apply in the case of S corporations (as defined in 
section 1361(a)) and their shareholders.
    (7) Estates. Estates may elect to amortize in each taxable year up 
to a maximum of $10,000 of qualifying reforestation expenditures under 
section 194. Any amortizable basis acquired by an estate shall be 
apportioned between the estate and the income beneficiary on the basis 
of the income of the estate allocable to each. The amount of amortizable 
basis apportioned from an estate to a beneficiary shall be taken into 
account in determining the $10,000 (or $5,000) amount of amortizable 
basis allowable to such beneficiary under this section.
    (c) Life tenant and remainderman. If property is held by one person 
for life with remainder to another person, the life tenant is entitled 
to the full benefit of any amortization allowable under section 194 on 
qualifying expenditures he or she makes. Any remainder interest in the 
property is ignored for this purpose.

<R05>
Sec. 1.194-3  Definitions.

    (a) Qualified timber property. The term qualified timber property 
means property located in the United States which will contain trees in 
significant commercial quantities. The property may be a woodlot or 
other site but must consist of at least one acre which is planted with 
tree seedlings in the manner normally used in forestation or 
reforestation. The property must be held by the taxpayer for the growing 
and cutting of timber which will either be sold for use in, or used by 
the taxpayer in, the commercial production of timber products. A 
taxpayer does not have to own the property in order to be eligible to 
elect to amortize costs attributable to it under section 194. Thus, a 
taxpayer may elect to amortize qualifying reforestation expenditures 
incurred by such taxpayer on leased qualified timber property. Qualified 
timber property does not include property on which the taxpayer has 
planted shelter belts (for which current deductions are allowed under 
section 175) or ornamental trees, such as Christmas trees.
    (b) Amortizable basis. The term amortizable basis means that portion 
of the basis of qualified timber property which is attributable to 
reforestation expenditures.
    (c) Reforestation expenditures--(1) In general. The term 
reforestation expenditures means direct costs incurred to plant or seed 
for forestation or reforestation purposes. Qualifying expenditures 
include amounts spent for site preparation, seed or seedlings, and labor 
and tool costs, including depreciation on equipment used in planting or 
seeding. Only those costs which must be capitalized and are included in 
the adjusted basis of the property qualify as reforestation 
expenditures. Costs which are currently deductible do not qualify.
    (2) Cost-sharing programs. Any expenditures for which the taxpayer 
has been reimbursed under any governmental reforestation cost-sharing 
program do not qualify as reforestation expenditures unless the amounts 
reimbursed have been included in the gross income of the taxpayer.
    (d) Definitions of controlled group of corporations and component 
member of controlled group. For purposes of section 194, the terms 
controlled group of corporations and component member of a controlled 
group of corporations shall have the same meaning assigned to those 
terms in section 1563 (a) and (b), except that the phrase ``more than 50 
percent'' shall be substituted for the phrase ``at least 80 percent'' 
each place it appears in section 1563(a)(1).

<R05>
Sec. 1.194-4  Time and manner of making election.

    (a) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
an election to amortize reforestation expenditures under section 194 
shall be made by entering the amortization deduction claimed at the 
appropriate place on the taxpayer's income tax return for the year in 
which the expenditures were incurred, and by attaching a statement to 
such return. The statement should state the amounts of the expenditures, 
describe the nature of the expenditures, and give the date on which each 
was incurred. The statement should also state the type of timber being 
grown and the purpose for which it is being grown. A separate statement 
must be included for each property for which reforestation expenditures 
are being amortized under section 194. The election may only be made on 
a timely return (taking into account extensions of the time for filing) 
for the taxable year in which the amortizable expenditures were made.
    (b) Special rule. With respect to any return filed before March 15, 
1984, on which a taxpayer was eligible to, but did not make an election 
under section 194, the election to amortize reforestation expenditures 
under section 194 may be made by a statement on, or attached to, the 
income tax return (or an amended return) for the taxable year, 
indicating that an election is being made under section 194 and setting 
forth the information required under paragraph (a) of this section. An 
election made under the provisions of this paragraph (b) must be made 
not later than,
    (1) The time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for 
filing the income tax return for the year in which the reforestation 
expenditures were made, or

[[Page 268]]

    (2) March 15, 1984, whichever is later. Nothing in this paragraph 
shall be construed as extending the time specified in section 6511 
within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
    (c) Revocation. An application for consent to revoke an election 
under section 194 shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the 
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application 
shall set forth the name and address of the taxpayer, state the taxable 
years for which the election was in effect, and state the reason for 
revoking the election. The application shall be signed by the taxpayer 
or a duly authorized representative of the taxpayer and shall be filed 
at least 90 days prior to the time prescribed by law (without regard to 
extensions thereof) for filing the income tax return for the first 
taxable year for which the election is to terminate. Ordinarily, the 
request for consent to revoke the election will not be granted if it 
appears from all the facts and circumstances that the only reason for 
the desired change is to obtain a tax advantage.

<R05>
Sec. 1.197-1T  Certain elections for intangible property (temporary).

    (a) In general. This section provides rules for making the two 
elections under section 13261 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act 
of 1993 (OBRA '93). Paragraph (c) of this section provides rules for 
making the section 13261(g)(2) election (the retroactive election) to 
apply the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 to property acquired after 
July 25, 1991, and on or before August 10, 1993 (the date of enactment 
of OBRA '93). Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for making 
the section 13261(g)(3) election (binding contract election) to apply 
prior law to property acquired pursuant to a written binding contract in 
effect on August 10, 1993, and at all times thereafter before the date 
of acquisition. The provisions of this section apply only to property 
for which an election is made under paragraph (c) or (d) of this 
section.
    (b) Definitions and special rules--(1) Intangibles provisions of 
OBRA '93. The intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 are sections 167(f) and 
197 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) and all other pertinent 
provisions of section 13261 of OBRA '93 (e.g., the amendment of section 
1253 in the case of a franchise, trademark, or trade name).
    (2) Transition period property. The transition period property of a 
taxpayer is any property that was acquired by the taxpayer after July 
25, 1991, and on or before August 10, 1993.
    (3) Eligible section 197 intangibles. The eligible section 197 
intangibles of a taxpayer are any section 197 intangibles that--
    (i) Are transition period property; and
    (ii) Qualify as amortizable section 197 intangibles (within the 
meaning of section 197(c)) if an election under section 13261(g)(2) of 
OBRA '93 applies.
    (4) Election date. The election date is the date (determined after 
application of section 7502(a)) on which the taxpayer files the original 
or amended return to which the election statement described in paragraph 
(e) of this section is attached.
    (5) Election year. The election year is the taxable year of the 
taxpayer that includes August 10, 1993.
    (6) Common control. A taxpayer is under common control with the 
electing taxpayer if, at any time after August 2, 1993, and on or before 
the election date (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section), the 
two taxpayers would be treated as a single taxpayer under section 
41(f)(1) (A) or (B).
    (7) Applicable convention for sections 197 and 167(f) intangibles.  
For purposes of computing the depreciation or amortization deduction 
allowable with respect to transition period property described in 
section 167(f) (1) or (3) or with respect to eligible section 197 
intangibles--
    (i) Property acquired at any time during the month is treated as 
acquired as of the first day of the month and is eligible for 
depreciation or amortization during the month; and
    (ii) Property is not eligible for depreciation or amortization in 
the month of disposition.
    (8) Application to adjustment to basis of partnership property under 
section 734(b) or 743(b). Any increase in the basis of partnership 
property under section

[[Page 269]]

734(b) (relating to the optional adjustment to basis of undistributed 
partnership property) or section 743(b) (relating to the optional 
adjustment to the basis of partnership property) will be taken into 
account under this section by a partner as if the increased portion of 
the basis were attributable to the partner's acquisition of the 
underlying partnership property on the date the distribution or transfer 
occurs. For example, if a section 754 election is in effect and, as a 
result of its acquisition of a partnership interest, a taxpayer obtains 
an increased basis in an intangible held through the partnership, the 
increased portion of the basis in the intangible will be treated as an 
intangible asset newly acquired by that taxpayer on the date of the 
transaction.
    (9) Former member. A former member of a consolidated group is a 
corporation that was a member of the consolidated group at any time 
after July 25, 1991, and on or before August 2, 1993, but that is not 
under common control with the common parent of the group for purposes of 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (c) Retroactive election--(1) Effect of election--(i) On taxpayer. 
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, if a taxpayer 
makes the retroactive election, the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 
will apply to all the taxpayer's transition period property. Thus, for 
example, section 197 will apply to all the taxpayer's eligible section 
197 intangibles.
    (ii) On taxpayers under common control. If a taxpayer makes the 
retroactive election, the election applies to each taxpayer that is 
under common control with the electing taxpayer. If the retroactive 
election applies to a taxpayer under common control, the intangibles 
provisions of OBRA '93 apply to that taxpayer's transition period 
property in the same manner as if that taxpayer had itself made the 
retroactive election. However, a retroactive election that applies to a 
non-electing taxpayer under common control is not treated as an election 
by that taxpayer for purposes of re-applying the rule of this paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) to any other taxpayer.
    (iii) On former members of consolidated group. A retroactive 
election by the common parent of a consolidated group applies to 
transition period property acquired by a former member while it was a 
member of the consolidated group and continues to apply to that property 
in each subsequent consolidated or separate return year of the former 
member.
    (iv) On transferred assets--(A) In general. If property is 
transferred in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C) of 
this section and the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 applied to such 
property in the hands of the transferor, the property remains subject to 
the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 with respect to so much of its 
adjusted basis in the hands of the transferee as does not exceed its 
adjusted basis in the hands of the transferor. The transferee is not 
required to apply the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 to any other 
transition period property that it owns, however, unless such provisions 
are otherwise applicable under the rules of this paragraph (c)(1).
    (B) Transferee election. If property is transferred in a transaction 
described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C)(1) of this section and the 
transferee makes the retroactive election, the transferor is not 
required to apply the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 to any of its 
transition period property (including the property transferred to the 
transferee in the transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C)(1) of 
this section), unless such provisions are otherwise applicable under the 
rules of this paragraph (c)(1).
    (C) Transactions covered. This paragraph (c)(1)(iv) applies to--
    (1) Any transaction described in section 332, 351, 361, 721, 731, 
1031, or 1033; and
    (2) Any transaction between corporations that are members of the 
same consolidated group immediately after the transaction.
    (D) Exchanged basis property. In the case of a transaction involving 
exchanged basis property (e.g., a transaction subject to section 1031 or 
1033)--
    (1) Paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A) of this section shall not apply; and
    (2) If the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 applied to the 
property by reference to which the exchanged basis

[[Page 270]]

is determined (the predecessor property), the exchanged basis property 
becomes subject to the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 with respect 
to so much of its basis as does not exceed the predecessor property's 
basis.
    (E) Acquisition date. For purposes of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section (definition of transition period property), property (other than 
exchanged basis property) acquired in a transaction described in 
paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C)(1) of this section generally is treated as 
acquired when the transferor acquired (or was treated as acquiring) the 
property (or predecessor property). However, if the adjusted basis of 
the property in the hands of the transferee exceeds the adjusted basis 
of the property in the hands of the transferor, the property, with 
respect to that excess basis, is treated as acquired at the time of the 
transfer. The time at which exchanged basis property is considered 
acquired is determined by applying similar principles to the 
transferee's acquisition of predecessor property.
    (v) Special rule for property of former member of consolidated 
group--(A) Intangibles provisions inapplicable for certain periods. If a 
former member of a consolidated group makes a retroactive election 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or if an election 
applies to the former member under the common control rule of paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section, the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 
generally apply to all transition period property of the former member. 
The intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 do not apply, however, to the 
transition period property of a former member (including a former member 
that makes or is bound by a retroactive election) during the period 
beginning immediately after July 25, 1991, and ending immediately before 
the earlier of--
    (1) The first day after July 25, 1991, that the former member was 
not a member of a consolidated group; or
    (2) The first day after July 25, 1991, that the former member was a 
member of a consolidated group that is otherwise required to apply the 
intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 to its transition period property 
(e.g., because the common control election under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of 
this section applies to the group).
    (B) Subsequent adjustments. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section for 
adjustments when the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 first apply to 
the transition period property of the former member after the property 
is acquired.
    (2) Making the election--(i) Partnerships, S corporations, estates, 
and trusts. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, 
in the case of transition period property of a partnership, S 
corporation, estate, or trust, only the entity may make the retroactive 
election for purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (ii) Partnerships for which a section 754 election is in effect. In 
the case of increased basis that is treated as transition period 
property of a partner under paragraph (b)(8) of this section, only that 
partner may make the retroactive election for purposes of paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Consolidated groups. An election by the common parent of a 
consolidated group applies to members and former members as described in 
paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section. Further, for purposes 
of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, an election by the common 
parent is not treated as an election by any subsidiary member. A 
retroactive election cannot be made by a corporation that is a 
subsidiary member of a consolidated group on August 10, 1993, but an 
election can be made on behalf of the subsidiary member under paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section (e.g., by the common parent of the group). 
See paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section for rules concerning the 
effect of the common parent's election on transition period property of 
a former member.
    (3) Time and manner of election--(i) Time. In general, the 
retroactive election must be made by the due date (including extensions 
of time) of the electing taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the 
election year. If, however, the taxpayer's original Federal income tax 
return for the election year is filed before April 14, 1994, the 
election may be made by amending that return no later than September 12, 
1994.
    (ii) Manner. The retroactive election is made by attaching the 
election

[[Page 271]]

statement described in paragraph (e) of this section to the taxpayer's 
original or amended income tax return for the election year. In 
addition, the taxpayer must--
    (A) Amend any previously filed return when required to do so under 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section; and
    (B) Satisfy the notification requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of 
this section.
    (iii) Effect of nonconforming elections. An attempted election that 
does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3) (including an 
attempted election made on a return for a taxable year prior to the 
election year) is not valid.
    (4) Amended return requirements--(i) Requirements. A taxpayer 
subject to this paragraph (c)(4) must amend all previously filed income 
tax returns as necessary to conform the taxpayer's treatment of 
transition period property to the treatment required under the 
intangibles provisions of OBRA '93. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section 
for certain adjustments that may be required on the amended returns 
required under this paragraph (c)(4) in the case of certain consolidated 
group member dispositions and tax-free transactions.
    (ii) Applicability. This paragraph (c)(4) applies to a taxpayer if--
    (A) The taxpayer makes the retroactive election; or
    (B) Another person's retroactive election applies to the taxpayer or 
to any property acquired by the taxpayer.
    (5) Adjustment required with respect to certain consolidated group 
member dispositions and tax-free transactions--(i) Application. This 
paragraph (c)(5) applies to transition period property if the 
intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 first apply to the property while it 
is held by the taxpayer but do not apply to the property for some period 
(the ``interim period'') after the property is acquired (or considered 
acquired) by the taxpayer. For example, this paragraph (c)(5) may apply 
to transition period property held by a former member of a consolidated 
group if a retroactive election is made by or on behalf of the former 
member but is not made by the consolidated group. See paragraph 
(c)(1)(v) of this section.
    (ii) Required adjustment to income. If this paragraph (c)(5) 
applies, an adjustment must be taken into account in computing taxable 
income of the taxpayer for the taxable year in which the intangibles 
provisions of OBRA '93 first apply to the property. The amount of the 
adjustment is equal to the difference for the transition period property 
between--
    (A) The sum of the depreciation, amortization, or other cost 
recovery deductions that the taxpayer (and its predecessors) would have 
been permitted if the intangibles provisions of OBRA '93 applied to the 
property during the interim period; and
    (B) The sum of the depreciation, amortization, or other cost 
recovery deductions that the taxpayer (and its predecessors) claimed 
during that interim period.
    (iii) Required adjustment to basis. The taxpayer also must make a 
corresponding adjustment to the basis of its transition period property 
to reflect any adjustment to taxable income with respect to the property 
under this paragraph (c)(5).
    (6) Notification requirements--(i) Notification of commonly 
controlled taxpayers. A taxpayer that makes the retroactive election 
must provide written notification of the retroactive election (on or 
before the election date) to each taxpayer that is under common control 
with the electing taxpayer.
    (ii) Notification of certain former members, former consolidated 
groups, and transferees. This paragraph (c)(6)(ii) applies to a common 
parent of a consolidated group that makes or is notified of a 
retroactive election that applies to transition period property of a 
former member, a corporation that makes or is notified of a retroactive 
election that affects any consolidated group of which the corporation is 
a former member, or a taxpayer that makes or is notified of a 
retroactive election that applies to transition period property the 
taxpayer transfers in a transaction described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(C) 
of this section. Such common parent, former member, or transferor must 
provide written notification of the retroactive election to any affected 
former member, consolidated

[[Page 272]]

group, or transferee. The written notification must be provided on or 
before the election date in the case of an election by the common 
parent, former member, or transferor, and within 30 days of the election 
date in the case of an election by a person other than the common 
parent, former member, or transferor.
    (7) Revocation. Once made, the retroactive election may be revoked 
only with the consent of the Commissioner.
    (8) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
this paragraph (c).


    Example 1. (i) X is a partnership with 5 equal partners, A through 
E. X acquires in 1989, as its sole asset, intangible asset M. X has a 
section 754 election in effect for all relevant years. F, an unrelated 
individual, purchases A's entire interest in the X partnership in 
January 1993 for $700. At the time of F's purchase, X's inside basis for 
M is $2,000, and its fair market value is $3,500.
    (ii) Under section 743(b), X makes an adjustment to increase F's 
basis in asset M by $300, the difference between the allocated purchase 
price and M's inside basis ($700 - $400 = $300). Under paragraphs (b)(8) 
and (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if F makes the retroactive election, the 
section 743(b) basis increase of $300 in M is an amortizable section 197 
intangible even though asset M is not an amortizable section 197 
intangible in the hands of X. F's increase in the basis of asset M is 
amortizable over 15 years beginning with the month of F's acquisition of 
the partnership interest. With respect to the remaining $400 of basis, F 
is treated as stepping into A's shoes and continues A's amortization (if 
any) in asset M. F's retroactive election applies to all other 
intangibles acquired by F or a taxpayer under common control with F.
    Example 2. A, a calendar year taxpayer, is under common control with 
B, a June 30 fiscal year taxpayer. A files its original election year 
Federal income tax return on March 15, 1994, and does not make either 
the retroactive election or the binding contract election. B files its 
election year tax return on September 15, 1994, and makes the 
retroactive election. B is required by paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this 
section to notify A of its election. Even though A had already filed its 
election year return, A is bound by B's retroactive election under the 
common control rules. Additionally, if A had made a binding contract 
election, it would have been negated by B's retroactive election. 
Because of B's retroactive election, A must comply with the requirements 
of this paragraph (c), and file amended returns for the election year 
and any affected prior years as necessary to conform the treatment of 
transition period property to the treatment required under the 
intangibles provisions of OBRA '93.
    Example 3. (i) P and Y, calendar year taxpayers, are the common 
parents of unrelated calendar year consolidated groups. On August 15, 
1991, S, a subsidiary member of the P group, acquires a section 197 
intangible with an unadjusted basis of $180. Under prior law, no 
amortization or depreciation was allowed with respect to the acquired 
intangible. On November 1, 1992, a member of the Y group acquires the S 
stock in a taxable transaction. On the P group's 1993 consolidated 
return, P makes the retroactive election. The P group also files amended 
returns for its affected prior years. Y does not make the retroactive 
election for the Y group.
    (ii) Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, a retroactive 
election by the common parent of a consolidated group applies to all 
transition period property acquired by a former member while it was a 
member of the group. The section 197 intangible acquired by S is 
transition period property that S, a former member of the P group, 
acquired while a member of the P group. Thus, P's election applies to 
the acquired asset. P must notify S of the election pursuant to 
paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section.
    (iii) S amortizes the unadjusted basis of its eligible section 197 
intangible ($180) over the 15-year amortization period using the 
applicable convention beginning as of the first day of the month of 
acquisition (August 1, 1991). Thus, the P group amends its 1991 
consolidated tax return to take into account $5 of amortization ($180/15 
years  x  5/12 year = $5) for S.
    (iv) For 1992, S is entitled to $12 of amortization ($180/15). 
Assume that under Sec. 1.1502-76, $10 of S's amortization for 1992 is 
allocated to the P group's consolidated return and $2 is allocated to 
the Y group's return. The P group amends its 1992 consolidated tax 
return to reflect the $10 deduction for S. The Y group must amend its 
1992 return to reflect the $2 deduction for S.
    Example 4. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that 
the retroactive election is made for the Y group, not for the P group.
    (ii) The Y group amends its 1992 consolidated return to claim a 
section 197 deduction of $2 ($180/15 years  x  2/12 year = $2) for S.
    (iii) Under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the retroactive 
election by Y applies to all transition period property acquired by S. 
However, under paragraph (c)(1)(v)(A) of this section, the intangibles 
provisions of OBRA '93 do not apply to S's transition period property 
during the period when it held such property as a member of P group. 
Instead, these provisions become applicable to S's transition period 
property beginning on November 1, 1992, when S becomes a member of Y 
group.

[[Page 273]]

    (iv) Because the P group did not make the retroactive election, 
there is an interim period during which the intangibles provisions of 
OBRA '93 do not apply to the asset acquired by S. Thus, under paragraph 
(c)(5) of this section, the Y group must take into account in computing 
taxable income in 1992 an adjustment equal to the difference between the 
section 197 deduction that would have been permitted if the intangibles 
provisions of OBRA '93 applied to the property for the interim period 
(i.e., the period for which S was included in the P group's 1991 and 
1992 consolidated returns) and any amortization or depreciation 
deductions claimed by S for the transferred intangible for that period. 
The retroactive election does not affect the P group, and the P group is 
not required to amend its returns.
    Example 5. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that both 
P and Y make the retroactive election. P must notify S of its election 
pursuant to paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section. Further, both the P 
and Y groups must file amended returns for affected prior years. Because 
there is no period of time during which the intangibles provisions of 
OBRA '93 do not apply to the asset acquired by S, the Y group is 
permitted no adjustment under paragraph (c)(5) of this section for the 
asset.

    (d) Binding contract election--(1) General rule--(i) Effect of 
election. If a taxpayer acquires property pursuant to a written binding 
contract in effect on August 10, 1993, and at all times thereafter 
before the acquisition (an eligible acquisition) and makes the binding 
contract election with respect to the contract, the law in effect prior 
to the enactment of OBRA '93 will apply to all property acquired 
pursuant to the contract. A separate binding contract election must be 
made with respect to each eligible acquisition to which the law in 
effect prior to the enactment of OBRA '93 is to apply.
    (ii) Taxpayers subject to retroactive election. A taxpayer may not 
make the binding contract election if the taxpayer or a person under 
common control with the taxpayer makes the retroactive election under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (iii) Revocation. A binding contract election, once made, may be 
revoked only with the consent of the Commissioner.
    (2) Time and manner of election--(i) Time. In general, the binding 
contract election must be made by the due date (including extensions of 
time) of the electing taxpayer's Federal income tax return for the 
election year. If, however, the taxpayer's original Federal income tax 
return for the election year is filed before April 14, 1994, the 
election may be made by amending that return no later than September 12, 
1994.
    (ii) Manner. The binding contract election is made by attaching the 
election statement described in paragraph (e) of this section to the 
taxpayer's original or amended income tax return for the election year.
    (iii) Effect of nonconforming election. An attempted election that 
does not satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (d)(2) is not valid.
    (e) Election statement--(1) Filing requirements. For an election 
under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section to be valid, the electing 
taxpayer must:
    (i) File (with its Federal income tax return for the election year 
and with any affected amended returns required under paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section) a written election statement, as an attachment to Form 
4562 (Depreciation and Amortization), that satisfies the requirements of 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and
    (ii) Forward a copy of the election statement to the Statistics 
Branch (QAM:S:6111), IRS Ogden Service Center, ATTN: Chief, Statistics 
Branch, P.O. Box 9941, Ogden, UT 84409.
    (2) Content of the election statement. The written election 
statement must include the information in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through 
(vi) and (ix) of this section in the case of a retroactive election, and 
the information in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (vii) through (ix) of this 
section in the case of a binding contract election. The required 
information should be arranged and identified in accordance with the 
following order and numbering system--
    (i) The name, address and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of 
the electing taxpayer (and the common parent if a consolidated return is 
filed).
    (ii) A statement that the taxpayer is making the retroactive 
election.
    (iii) Identification of the transition period property affected by 
the retroactive election, the name and TIN of the person from which the 
property was acquired, the manner and date of acquisition, the basis at 
which the

[[Page 274]]

property was acquired, and the amount of depreciation, amortization, or 
other cost recovery under section 167 or any other provision of the Code 
claimed with respect to the property.
    (iv) Identification of each taxpayer under common control (as 
defined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section) with the electing taxpayer 
by name, TIN, and Internal Revenue Service Center where the taxpayer's 
income tax return is filed.
    (v) If any persons are required to be notified of the retroactive 
election under paragraph (c)(6) of this section, identification of such 
persons and certification that written notification of the election has 
been provided to such persons.
    (vi) A statement that the transition period property being amortized 
under section 197 is not subject to the anti-churning rules of section 
197(f)(9).
    (vii) A statement that the taxpayer is making the binding contract 
election.
    (viii) Identification of the property affected by the binding 
contract election, the name and TIN of the person from which the 
property was acquired, the manner and date of acquisition, the basis at 
which the property was acquired, and whether any of the property is 
subject to depreciation under section 167 or to amortization or other 
cost recovery under any other provision of the Code.
    (ix) The signature of the taxpayer or an individual authorized to 
sign the taxpayer's Federal income tax return.
    (f) Effective date. These regulations are effective March 15, 1994.

             Additional Itemized Deductions for Individuals


<R05>
Sec. 1.211-1   Allowance of deductions.

    In computing taxable income under section 63(a), the deductions 
provided by sections 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, and 217 shall be allowed 
subject to the exceptions provided in Part IX, Subchapter B, Chapter 1 
of the Code (section 261 and following, relating to items not 
deductible).

[T.D. 6796, 30 FR 1037, Feb. 2, 1965]


<R05>
Sec. 1.212-1   Nontrade or nonbusiness expenses.

    (a) An expense may be deducted under section 212 only if:
    (1) It has been paid or incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable 
year (i) for the production or collection of income which, if and when 
realized, will be required to be included in income for Federal income 
tax purposes, or (ii) for the management, conservation, or maintenance 
of property held for the production of such income, or (iii) in 
connection with the determination, collection, or refund of any tax; and
    (2) It is an ordinary and necessary expense for any of the purposes 
stated in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
    (b) The term income for the purpose of section 212 includes not 
merely income of the taxable year but also income which the taxpayer has 
realized in a prior taxable year or may realize in subsequent taxable 
years; and is not confined to recurring income but applies as well to 
gains from the disposition of property. For example, if defaulted bonds, 
the interest from which if received would be includible in income, are 
purchased with the expectation of realizing capital gain on their 
resale, even though no current yield thereon is anticipated, ordinary 
and necessary expenses thereafter paid or incurred in connection with 
such bonds are deductible. Similarly, ordinary and necessary expenses 
paid or incurred in the management, conservation, or maintenance of a 
building devoted to rental purposes are deductible notwithstanding that 
there is actually no income therefrom in the taxable year, and 
regardless of the manner in which or the purpose for which the property 
in question was acquired. Expenses paid or incurred in managing, 
conserving, or maintaining property held for investment may be 
deductible under section 212 even though the property is not currently 
productive and there is no likelihood that the property will be sold at 
a profit or will otherwise be productive of income and even though the 
property is held merely to minimize a loss with respect thereto.
    (c) In the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, 
expenses of carrying on transactions which do not constitute a trade or 
business of the

[[Page 275]]

taxpayer and are not carried on for the production or collection of 
income or for the management, conservation, or maintenance of property 
held for the production of income, but which are carried on primarily as 
a sport, hobby, or recreation are not allowable as nontrade or 
nonbusiness expenses. The question whether or not a transaction is 
carried on primarily for the production of income or for the management, 
conservation, or maintenance of property held for the production or 
collection of income, rather than primarily as a sport, hobby, or 
recreation, is not to be determined solely from the intention of the 
taxpayer but rather from all the circumstances of the case. For example, 
consideration will be given to the record of prior gain or loss of the 
taxpayer in the activity, the relation between the type of activity and 
the principal occupation of the taxpayer, and the uses to which the 
property or what it produces is put by the taxpayer. For provisions 
relating to activities not engaged in for profit applicable to taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1969, see section 183 and the 
regulations thereunder.
    (d) Expenses, to be deductible under section 212, must be ``ordinary 
and necessary''. Thus, such expenses must be reasonable in amount and 
must bear a reasonable and proximate relation to the production or 
collection of taxable income or to the management, conservation, or 
maintenance of property held for the production of income.
    (e) A deduction under section 212 is subject to the restrictions and 
limitations in part IX (section 261 and following), subchapter B, 
chapter 1 of the Code, relating to items not deductible. Thus, no 
deduction is allowable under section 212 for any amount allocable to the 
production or collection of one or more classes of income which are not 
includible in gross income, or for any amount allocable to the 
management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for the 
production of income which is not included in gross income. See section 
265. Nor does section 212 allow the deduction of any expenses which are 
disallowed by any of the provisions of subtitle A of the Code, even 
though such expenses may be paid or incurred for one of the purposes 
specified in section 212.
    (f) Among expenditures not allowable as deductions under section 212 
are the following: Commuter's expenses; expenses of taking special 
courses or training; expenses for improving personal appearance; the 
cost of rental of a safe-deposit box for storing jewelry and other 
personal effects; expenses such as those paid or incurred in seeking 
employment or in placing oneself in a position to begin rendering 
personal services for compensation, campaign expenses of a candidate for 
public office, bar examination fees and other expenses paid or incurred 
in securing admission to the bar, and corresponding fees and expenses 
paid or incurred by physicians, dentists, accountants, and other 
taxpayers for securing the right to practice their respective 
professions. See, however, section 162 and the regulations thereunder.
    (g) Fees for services of investment counsel, custodial fees, 
clerical help, office rent, and similar expenses paid or incurred by a 
taxpayer in connection with investments held by him are deductible under 
section 212 only if (1) they are paid or incurred by the taxpayer for 
the production or collection of income or for the management, 
conservation, or maintenance of investments held by him for the 
production of income; and (2) they are ordinary and necessary under all 
the circumstances, having regard to the type of investment and to the 
relation of the taxpayer to such investment.
    (h) Ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in connection 
with the management, conservation, or maintenance of property held for 
use as a residence by the taxpayer are not deductible. However, ordinary 
and necessary expenses paid or incurred in connection with the 
management, conservation, or maintenance of property held by the 
taxpayer as rental property are deductible even though such property was 
formerly held by the taxpayer for use as a home.
    (i) Reasonable amounts paid or incurred by the fiduciary of an 
estate or trust on account of administration expenses, including 
fiduciaries' fees and

[[Page 276]]

expenses of litigation, which are ordinary and necessary in connection 
with the performance of the duties of administration are deductible 
under section 212, notwithstanding that the estate or trust is not 
engaged in a trade or business, except to the extent that such expenses 
are allocable to the production or collection of tax-exempt income. But 
see section 642 (g) and the regulations thereunder for disallowance of 
such deductions to an estate where such items are allowed as a deduction 
under section 2053 or 2054 in computing the net estate subject to the 
estate tax.
    (j) Reasonable amounts paid or incurred for the services of a 
guardian or committee for a ward or minor, and other expenses of 
guardians and committees which are ordinary and necessary, in connection 
with the production or collection of income inuring to the ward or 
minor, or in connection with the management, conservation, or 
maintenance of property, held for the production of income, belonging to 
the ward or minor, are deductible.
    (k) Expenses paid or incurred in defending or perfecting title to 
property, in recovering property (other than investment property and 
amounts of income which, if and when recovered, must be included in 
gross income), or in developing or improving property, constitute a part 
of the cost of the property and are not deductible expenses. Attorneys' 
fees paid in a suit to quiet title to lands are not deductible; but if 
the suit is also to collect accrued rents thereon, that portion of such 
fees is deductible which is properly allocable to the services rendered 
in collecting such rents. Expenses paid or incurred in protecting or 
asserting one's right to property of a decedent as heir or legatee, or 
as beneficiary under a testamentary trust, are not deductible.
    (l) Expenses paid or incurred by an individual in connection with 
the determination, collection, or refund of any tax, whether the taxing 
authority be Federal, State, or municipal, and whether the tax be 
income, estate, gift, property, or any other tax, are deductible. Thus, 
expenses paid or incurred by a taxpayer for tax counsel or expenses paid 
or incurred in connection with the preparation of his tax returns or in 
connection with any proceedings involved in determining the extent of 
his tax liability or in contesting his tax liability are deductible.
    (m) An expense (not otherwise deductible) paid or incurred by an 
individual in determining or contesting a liability asserted against him 
does not become deductible by reason of the fact that property held by 
him for the production of income may be required to be used or sold for 
the purpose of satisfying such liability.
    (n) Capital expenditures are not allowable as nontrade or 
nonbusiness expenses. The deduction of an item otherwise allowable under 
section 212 will not be disallowed simply because the taxpayer was 
entitled under Subtitle A of the Code to treat such item as a capital 
expenditure, rather than to deduct it as an expense. For example, see 
section 266. Where, however, the item may properly be treated only as a 
capital expenditure or where it was properly so treated under an option 
granted in Subtitle A of the Code, no deduction is allowable under 
section 212; and this is true regardless of whether any basis adjustment 
is allowed under any other provision of the Code.
    (o) The provisions of section 212 are not intended in any way to 
disallow expenses which would otherwise be allowable under section 162 
and the regulations thereunder. Double deductions are not permitted. 
Amounts deducted under one provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954 cannot again be deducted under any other provision thereof.
    (p) Frustration of public policy. The deduction of a payment will be 
disallowed under section 212 if the payment is of a type for which a 
deduction would be disallowed under section 162(c), (f), or (g) and the 
regulations thereunder in the case of a business expense.

<R05>
Sec. 1.213-1   Medical, dental, etc., expenses.

    (a) Allowance of deduction. (1) Section 213 permits a deduction of 
payments for certain medical expenses (including

[[Page 277]]

expenses for medicine and drugs). Except as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section (relating to special rule for decedents) a deduction is 
allowable only to individuals and only with respect to medical expenses 
actually paid during the taxable year, regardless of when the incident 
or event which occasioned the expenses occurred and regardless of the 
method of accounting employed by the taxpayer in making his income tax 
return. Thus, if the medical expenses are incurred but not paid during 
the taxable year, no deduction for such expenses shall be allowed for 
such year.
    (2) Except as provided in subparagraphs (4)(i) and (5)(i) of this 
paragraph, only such medical expenses (including the allowable expenses 
for medicine and drugs) are deductible as exceed 3 percent of the 
adjusted gross income for the taxable year. For taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1966, the amounts paid during the taxable year for 
insurance that constitute expenses paid for medical care shall, for 
purposes of computing total medical expenses, be reduced by the amount 
determined under subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph. For the amounts 
paid during the taxable year for medicine and drugs which may be taken 
into account in computing total medical expenses, see paragraph (b) of 
this section. For the maximum deduction allowable under section 213 in 
the case of certain taxable years, see paragraph (c) of this section. As 
to what constitutes ``adjusted gross income'', see section 62 and the 
regulations thereunder.
    (3)(i) For medical expenses paid (including expenses paid for 
medicine and drugs) to be deductible, they must be for medical care of 
the taxpayer, his spouse, or a dependent of the taxpayer and not be 
compensated for by insurance or otherwise. Expenses paid for the medical 
care of a dependent, as defined in section 152 and the regulations 
thereunder, are deductible under this section even though the dependent 
has gross income equal to or in excess of the amount determined pursuant 
to Sec. 1.151-2 applicable to the calendar year in which the taxable 
year of the taxpayer begins. Where such expenses are paid by two or more 
persons and the conditions of section 152(c) and the regulations 
thereunder are met, the medical expenses are deductible only by the 
person designated in the multiple support agreement filed by such 
persons and such deduction is limited to the amount of medical expenses 
paid by such person.
    (ii) An amount excluded from gross income under section 105 (c) or 
(d) (relating to amounts received under accident and health plans) and 
the regulations thereunder shall not constitute compensation for 
expenses paid for medical care. Exclusion of such amounts from gross 
income will not affect the treatment of expenses paid for medical care.
    (iii) The application of the rule allowing a deduction for medical 
expenses to the extent not compensated for by insurance or otherwise may 
be illustrated by the following example in which it is assumed that 
neither the taxpayer nor his wife has attained the age of 65:

    Example. Taxpayer H, married to W and having one dependent child, 
had adjusted gross income for 1956 of $3,000. During 1956 he paid $300 
for medical care, of which $100 was for treatment of his dependent child 
and $200 for an operation on W which was performed in September 1955. In 
1956 he received a payment of $50 for health insurance to cover a 
portion of the cost of W's operation performed during 1955. The 
deduction allowable under section 213 for the calendar year 1956, 
provided the taxpayer itemizes his deductions and does not compute his 
tax under section 3 by use of the tax table, is $160, computed as 
follows:

Payments in 1956 for medical care............................       $300
Less: Amount of insurance received in 1956...................         50
                                                              ----------
    Payments in 1956 for medical care not compensated for               
     during 1956.............................................        250
Less: 3 percent of $3,000 (adjusted gross income)............         90
                                                              ----------
    Excess, allowable as a deduction for 1956................        160
                                                                        

    (4)(i) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, where 
either the taxpayer or his spouse has attained the age of 65 before the 
close of the taxable year, the 3-percent limitation on the deduction for 
medical expenses does not apply with respect to expenses for medical 
care of the taxpayer or his

[[Page 278]]

spouse. Moreover, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1959, 
and before January 1, 1967, the 3-percent limitation on the deduction 
for medical expenses does not apply to amounts paid for the medical care 
of a dependent (as defined in sec. 152) who is the mother or father of 
the taxpayer or his spouse and who has attained the age of 65 before the 
close of the taxpayer's taxable year. For taxable years beginning before 
January 1, 1964, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 
1966, all amounts paid by the taxpayer for medicine and drugs are 
subject to the 1-percent limitation provided by section 213(b). For 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, and before January 1, 
1967, the 1-percent limitation provided by section 213(b) does not 
apply, under certain circumstances, to amounts paid by the taxpayer for 
medicine and drugs for the taxpayer and his spouse or for a dependent 
(as defined in sec. 152) who is the mother or father of the taxpayer or 
of his spouse. (For additional provisions relating to the 1-percent 
limitation with respect to medicine and drugs, see paragraph (b) of this 
section.) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, whether or 
not the 3-percent or 1-percent limitation applies, the total medical 
expenses deductible under section 213 are subject to the limitations 
described in section 213(c) and paragraph (c) of this section and, where 
applicable, to the limitations described in section 213(g) and 
Sec. 1.213-2.
    (ii) The age of a taxpayer shall be determined as of the last day of 
his taxable year. In the event of the taxpayer's death, his taxable year 
shall end as of the date of his death. The age of a taxpayer's spouse 
shall be determined as of the last day of the taxpayer's taxable year, 
except that, if the spouse dies within such taxable year, her age shall 
be determined as of the date of her death. Likewise, the age of the 
taxpayer's dependent who is the mother or father of the taxpayer or of 
his spouse shall be determined as of the last day of the taxpayer's 
taxable year but not later than the date of death of such dependent.
    (iii) The application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Taxpayer A, who attained the age of 65 on February 22, 
1956, makes his return on the basis of the calendar year. During the 
year 1956, A had adjusted gross income of $8,000, and paid the following 
medical bills: (a) $560 (7 percent of adjusted gross income) for the 
medical care of himself and his spouse, and (b) $160 (2 percent of 
adjusted gross income) for the medical care of his dependent son. No 
part of these payments was for medicine and drugs nor compensated for by 
insurance or otherwise. The allowable deduction under section 213 for 
1956 is $560, the full amount of the medical expenses for the taxpayer 
and his spouse. No deduction is allowable for the amount of $160 paid 
for medical care of the dependent son since the amount of such payment 
(determined without regard to the payments for the care of the taxpayer 
and his spouse) does not exceed 3 percent of adjusted gross income.
    Example 2. H and W, who have a dependent child, made a joint return 
for the calendar year 1956. H became 65 years of age on August 15, 1956. 
The adjusted gross income of H and W in 1956 was $40,000 and they paid 
in such year the following amounts for medical care: (a) $3,000 for the 
medical care of H; (b) $2,000 for the medical care of W; and (c) $3,000 
for the medical care of the dependent child. No part of these payments 
was for medicine and drugs nor compensated for by insurance or 
otherwise. The allowable deduction under section 213 for medical 
expenses paid in 1956 is $6,800 computed as follows:

Payments for medical care of H and W in 1956.................     $5,000
Payments for medical care of the dependent in 1956     $3,000           
Less: 3 percent of $40,000 (adjusted gross income)      1,200           
                                                     --------      1,800
                                                              ----------
    Allowable deduction for 1956..................  .........      6,800
                                                                        

    Example 3. D and his wife, E, made a joint income tax return for the 
calendar year 1962, and reported adjusted gross income of $30,000. On 
December 13, 1962, D attained the age of 65. During the year 1962, D's 
father, F, who was 87 years of age, received over half of his support 
from, and was a dependent (as defined in section 152) of, D. However, D 
could not claim an exemption under section 151 for F because F had gross 
income from rents in 1962 of $800. D paid the following medical expenses 
in 1962, none of which were compensated for by insurance or otherwise: 
hospital and doctor bills for D and E, $6,500; hospital and doctor bills 
for F, $4,850; medicine and drugs for D and E, $225, and for F, $225. 
Since none of the medical expenses are subject to the 3-percent 
limitation, the amount of medical expenses to be taken into account 
(before computing the maximum deduction) is $11,500, computed as 
follows:

[[Page 279]]



Hospital and doctor bills--for D and E............  .........     $6,500
Hospital and doctor bills--for F..................  .........      4,850
Medicine and drugs--for D and E...................       $225           
Medicine and drugs--for F.........................       $225           
                                                   -----------          
    Total medicine and drugs......................        450           
Less: 1 percent of adjusted gross income ($30,000)        300           
                                                   -----------          
Allowable expenses for medicine and drugs.........                  $150
                                                              ----------
    Total medical expenses taken into account.....  .........     11,500
                                                                        

Since an exemption cannot be claimed for F on the 1962 return of D and 
E, their deduction for medical expenses (assuming that section 213(g) 
does not apply) is limited to $10,000 for that year ($5,000 multiplied 
by the two exemptions allowed for D and E under section 151(b)). If 
these identical facts had occurred in a taxable year beginning before 
January 1, 1962, the medical expense deduction for D and E would, for 
such taxable year, be limited to $5,000 ($2,500 multiplied by the two 
exemptions allowed for D and E under section 151(b)). See paragraph (c) 
of this section.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example 3, except that D 
furnished the entire support of his father's twin sister, G, who had no 
gross income during 1962 and for whom D was entitled to a dependency 
exemption. In addition, D paid $4,800 to doctors and hospitals during 
1962 for the medical care of G. No part of the $4,800 was for medicine 
and drugs, and no amount was compensated for by insurance or otherwise. 
For purposes of the maximum limitation under section 213(c), the maximum 
deduction for medical expenses on the 1962 return of D and E is limited 
to $15,000 ($5,000 multiplied by 3, the number of exemptions allowed 
under section 151, exclusive of the exemptions for old age or 
blindness). If these identical facts had occurred in a taxable year 
beginning before January 1, 1962, the medical expense deduction for D 
and E would, for such taxable year, be limited to $7,500 ($2,500 
multiplied by the three exemptions allowed under section 151, exclusive 
of the exemptions for old age or blindness). The medical expenses to be 
taken into account by D and E for 1962 and the maximum deductions 
allowable for such expenses are $15,400 and $15,000, respectively, 
computed as follows:

Medical expenses per Example (3)..................  .........    $11,500
Add: Expenses paid for G..........................     $4,800           
Less: 3 percent of adjusted gross income ($30,000)        900           
                                                     --------      3,900
                                                              ----------
    Total medical expenses taken into account................     15,400
Maximum deduction for 1962 ($5,000 multiplied by 3                      
 exemptions).................................................     15,000
                                                   ------------         
Medical expenses not deductible..............................        400
                                                                        

    Example 5. Assume that the facts set forth in Example 3 had occurred 
in respect of the calendar year 1964 rather than the calendar year 1962. 
Since both D and his father, F, had attained the age of 65 before the 
close of the taxable year, the 1-percent limitation does not apply to 
the amounts paid for medicine and drugs for D, E, and F. Accordingly, 
the total medical expenses taken into account by D and E for 1964 would 
be $11,800 (rather than $11,500 as in Example 3) computed as follows:

Hospital and doctor bills--for D and E......................      $6,500
Hospital and doctor bills--for F............................       4,350
Medicine and drugs--for D and E.............................         225
Medicine and drugs--for F...................................         225
                                                             -----------
  Total medical expenses taken into account.................      11,800
                                                                        

    (5)(i) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, there 
may be deducted without regard to the 3-percent limitation the lesser 
of--(a) One-half of the amounts paid during the taxable year for 
insurance which constitute expenses for medical care for the taxpayer, 
his spouse, and dependents; or (b) $150.
    (ii) The application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. H and W made a joint return for the calendar year 1967. The 
adjusted gross income of H and W for 1967 was $10,000 and they paid in 
such year $370 for medical care of which amount $350 was paid for 
insurance which constitutes medical care for H and W. No part of the 
payment was for medicine and drugs or was compensated for by insurance 
or otherwise. The allowable deduction under section 213 for medical 
expenses paid in 1967 is $150, computed as follows:

(1) Lesser of $175 (one-half of amounts paid for insurance) or          
 $150...........................................................    $150
(2) Payments for medical care...................    $370                
(3) Less line 1.................................     150                
                                                 --------               
(4) Medical expenses to be taken into account under 3-                  
 percent limitation (line 2 minus line 3)...............    $220        
(5) Less: 3 percent of $10,000 (adjusted gross income)..     300        
                                                         --------       
(6) Excess allowable as a deduction for 1967 (excess of line 4          
 over line 5)...................................................       0
                                                 ---------              
(7) Allowable medical expense deduction for 1967 (line 1 plus           
 line 6)........................................................    $150
                                                                        

    (b) Limitation with respect to medicine and drugs--(1) Taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 1964. (i) Amounts paid during taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 1964, for medicine and drugs are to be taken 
into account in computing the allowable deduction for

[[Page 280]]

medical expenses paid during the taxable year only to the extent that 
the aggregate of such amounts exceeds 1 percent of the adjusted gross 
income for the taxable year. Thus, if the aggregate of the amounts paid 
for medicine and drugs exceeds 1 percent of adjusted gross income, the 
excess is added to other medical expenses for the purpose of computing 
the medical expense deduction. The application of this subdivision may 
be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. The taxpayer, a single individual with no dependents, had 
an adjusted gross income of $6,000 for the calendar year 1956. During 
1956, he paid a doctor $300 for medical services, a hospital $100 for 
hospital care, and also spent $100 for medicine and drugs. These 
payments were not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The 
deduction allowable under section 213 for the calendar year 1956 is 
$260, computed as follows:

    Payments for medical care in 1956:

Doctor..........................................................    $300
Hospital........................................................     100
Medicine and drugs......................................    $100        
Less: 1 percent of $6,000 (adjusted gross income).......      60      40
                                                         ---------------
  Total medical expenses taken into account.....................     440
Less: 3 percent of $6,000 (adjusted gross income)...............     180
                                                         ---------      
Allowable deduction for 1956....................................     260
                                                                        

    (ii) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, the 1-
percent limitation is applicable to all amounts paid by a taxpayer 
during the taxable year for medicine and drugs. Moreover, this 
limitation applies regardless of the fact that the amounts paid are for 
medicine and drugs for the taxpayer, his spouse, or dependent parent 
(the mother or father of the taxpayer or of his spouse) who has attained 
the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. In a case where 
either a taxpayer or his spouse has attained the age of 65 and the 
taxpayer pays an amount in excess of 1 percent of adjusted gross income 
for medicine and drugs for himself, his spouse, and his dependents, it 
is necessary to apportion the 1 percent of adjusted gross income (the 
portion which is not taken into account as expenses paid for medical 
care) between the taxpayer and his spouse on the one hand and his 
dependents on the other. The part of the 1 percent allocable to the 
taxpayer and his spouse is an amount which bears the same ratio to 1 
percent of his adjusted gross income which the amount paid for medicine 
and drugs for the taxpayer and his spouse bears to the total amount paid 
for medicine and drugs for the taxpayer, his spouse, and his dependents. 
The balance of the 1 percent shall be allocated to his dependents. The 
amount paid for medicine and drugs in excess of the allocated part of 
the 1 percent shall be taken into account as payments for medical care 
for the taxpayer and his spouse on the one hand and his dependents on 
the other, respectively. A similar apportionment must be made in the 
case of a dependent parent (65 years of age or over) of the taxpayer or 
his spouse. The application of this subdivision (ii) may be illustrated 
by the following example:

    Example. H and W, who have a dependent child, made a joint return 
for the calendar year 1956. H became 65 years of age on September 15, 
1956. The adjusted gross income of H and W for 1956 is $10,000. During 
the year, H and W paid the following amounts for medical care: (i) 
$1,000 for doctors and hospital expenses and $180 for medicine and drugs 
for themselves; and (ii) $500 for doctors and hospital expenses and $140 
for medicine and drugs for the dependent child. These payments were not 
compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The deduction allowable under 
section 213(a)(2) for medical expenses paid in 1956 is $1,420, computed 
as follows:

H and W:                                                                
  Payments for doctors and hospital.  ..........  ..........   $1,000.00
  Payments for medicine and drugs...  ..........     $180.00

    (2) Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963. (i) Except as 
otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, amounts 
paid during taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, for 
medicine and drugs are to be taken into account in computing the 
allowable deduction for medical expenses paid during the taxable year 
only to the extent that the aggregate of such amounts exceeds 1 percent 
of the adjusted gross income for the taxable year. Thus, if the 
aggregate of the amounts paid for medicine and drugs which are subject 
to the 1-percent limitation exceeds 1 percent of adjusted gross income, 
the excess is added to other medical expenses for the purpose of 
computing the medical expense deduction.
    (ii) The 1-percent limitation provided by section 213 does not apply 
to amounts paid by a taxpayer during a taxable year beginning after 
December 31, 1963, and before January 1, 1967, for medicine and drugs 
for the medical care of the taxpayer and his spouse if either has 
attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year. Moreover, 
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, and before January 
1, 1967, the 1-percent limitation with respect to medicine and drugs 
does not apply to amounts paid for the medical care of a dependent (as 
defined in sec. 152) who is the mother or father of the taxpayer or of 
his spouse and who has attained the age of 65 before the close of the 
taxpayer's taxable year. Amounts paid for medicine and drugs which are 
not subject to the limitation on medicine and drugs are added to other 
medical expenses of a taxpayer and his spouse or the dependent (as the 
case may be) for the purpose of computing the medical expense deduction.
    (iii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. H and W, who have a dependent child, C, were both under 
65 years of age at the close of the calendar year 1964 and made a joint 
return for that calendar year. During the year 1964, H's mother, M, 
attained the age of 65, and was a dependent (as defined in section 152) 
of H. The adjusted gross income of H and W in 1964 was $12,000. During 
1964 H and W paid the following amounts for medical care: (i) $600 for 
doctors and hospital expenses and $120 for medicine and drugs for 
themselves; (ii) $350 for doctors and hospital expenses and $60 for 
medicine and drugs for C; and (iii) $400 for doctors and hospital 
expenses and $100 for medicine and drugs for M. These payments were not 
compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The deduction allowable under 
section 213(a) (1) for medical expenses paid in 1964 is $1,150, computed 
as follows:

H, W, and C:

    Example 2. H and W, who have a dependent child, C, made a joint 
return for the calendar year 1964, and reported adjusted gross income of 
$12,000. H became 65 years of age on January 23, 1964. F, the 87 year 
old father of

[[Page 282]]

W, was a dependent of H. During 1964, H and W paid the following amounts 
for medical care: (i) $400 for doctors and hospital expenses and $75 for 
medicine and drugs for H; (ii) $200 for doctors and hospital expenses 
and $100 for medicine and drugs for W; (iii) $200 for doctors and 
hospital expenses and $175 for medicine and drugs for C; and (iv) $700 
for doctors and hospital expenses and $150 for medicine and drugs for F. 
These payments were not compensated for by insurance or otherwise. The 
deduction allowable under section 213(a) (2) for medical expenses paid 
in 1964 is $1,625, computed as follows:

H and W:

    Example 3. Assume the same facts as example (2) except that the 
calendar year of the return is 1967 and the amounts paid for medical 
care were paid during 1967. The deduction allowable under section 213(a) 
for medical expenses paid in 1967 is $1,520, computed as follows:

    (3) Definition of medicine and drugs. For definition of medicine and 
drugs, see paragraph (e) (2) of this section.
    (c) Maximum limitations. (1) For taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1966, there shall be no maximum limitation on the amount of 
the deduction allowable for payment of medical expenses.
    (2) Except as provided in section 213(g) and Sec. 1.213-2 (relating 
to maximum limitations with respect to certain aged and disabled 
individuals for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967), for 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 
1967, the maximum deduction allowable for medical expenses paid in any 
one taxable year is the lesser of:
    (i) $5,000 multiplied by the number of exemptions allowed under 
section 151 (exclusive of exemptions allowed under section 151(c) for a 
taxpayer or spouse attaining the age of 65, or section 151(d) for a 
taxpayer who is blind or a spouse who is blind);
    (ii) $10,000, if the taxpayer is single, not the head of a household 
(as defined in section 1(b) (2)) and not a surviving spouse (as defined 
in section 2(b)), or is married and files a separate return; or
    (iii) $20,000 if the taxpayer is married and files a joint return 
with his spouse under section 6013, or is the head of a household (as 
defined in section 1(b) (2)), or a surviving spouse (as defined in 
section 2(b)).
    (3) The application of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. H and W made a joint return for the calendar year 1962 and 
were allowed five exemptions (exclusive of exemptions under sec. 151 (c) 
and (d)), one for each taxpayer and three for their dependents. The 
adjusted gross income of H and W in 1962 was $80,000. They paid during 
such year $26,000 for medical care, no part of which is compensated for 
by insurance or otherwise. The deduction allowable under section 213 for 
the calendar year 1962 is $20,000, computed as follows:

Payments for medical care in 1962............................    $26,000
Less: 3 percent of $80,000 (adjusted gross income)...........      2,400
                                                              ----------
Excess of medical expenses in 1962 over 3 percent of adjusted           
 gross income................................................     23,600

Allowable deduction for 1962 ($5,000 multiplied by five                 
 exemptions allowed under sec. 151 (b) and (e) but not in               
 excess of $20,000)..........................................     20,000
                                                                        

    (4) Except as provided in section 213(g) and Sec. 1.213-2 (relating 
to certain aged and disabled individuals), for taxable years beginning 
before January 1, 1962, the maximum deduction allowable for medical 
expenses paid in any 1 taxable year is the lesser of:
    (i) $2,500 multiplied by the number of exemptions allowed under 
section 151 (exclusive of exemptions allowed under section 151(c) for a 
taxpayer or spouse attaining the age of 65, or section 151(d) for a 
taxpayer who is blind or a spouse who is blind);
    (ii) $5,000, if the taxpayer is single, not the head of a household 
(as defined in section 1(b) (2)) and not a surviving spouse (as defined 
in section 2(b)) or is married and files a separate return; or
    (iii) $10,000, if the taxpayer is married and files a joint return 
with his spouse under section 6013, or is head of a household (as 
defined in section 1(b) (2)), or a surviving spouse (as defined in 
section 2(b)).
    (5) For the maximum deduction allowable for taxable years beginning 
before January 1, 1967, if the taxpayer or his spouse is age 65 or over 
and is disabled, see Sec. 1.213-2.
    (d) Special rule for decedents. (1) For the purpose of section 213 
(a), expenses for medical care of the taxpayer which are paid out of his 
estate during the 1-year period beginning with the day after the date of 
his death shall be treated as paid by the taxpayer at the time the 
medical services were rendered. However, no credit or refund of tax 
shall be allowed for any taxable year for which the statutory period for 
filing a claim has expired. See section 6511 and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (2) The rule prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall 
not apply where the amount so paid is allowable under section 2053 as a 
deduction in computing the taxable estate of the decedent unless there 
is filed in duplicate (i) a statement that such amount has not been 
allowed as a deduction under section 2053 in computing the taxable 
estate of the decedent and (ii) a waiver of the right to have such 
amount allowed at any time as a deduction under section 2053. The 
statement and waiver shall be filed with or for association with the 
return, amended return, or claim for credit or refund for the decedent 
for any taxable year for which such an amount is claimed as a deduction.
    (e) Definitions--(1) General. (i) The term medical care includes the 
diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. 
Expenses paid for ``medical care'' shall include those paid for the 
purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body or for 
transportation primarily for and essential to medical care. See 
subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for provisions relating to medical 
insurance.
    (ii) Amounts paid for operations or treatments affecting any portion 
of the body, including obstetrical expenses and expenses of therapy or 
X-ray treatments, are deemed to be for the purpose of affecting any 
structure or function of the body and are therefore paid for medical 
care. Amounts expended for illegal operations or treatments are not 
deductible. Deductions for expenditures for medical care allowable under 
section 213 will be confined strictly to expenses incurred primarily for 
the prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness. 
Thus, payments for the following are payments for medical care: hospital 
services, nursing services (including nurses' board where paid by the 
taxpayer), medical, laboratory, surgical, dental and other diagnostic 
and healing services, X-rays, medicine and drugs (as defined in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, subject to the 1-percent limitation 
in paragraph (b) of this section), artificial teeth or limbs, and 
ambulance hire. However, an expenditure which is merely beneficial to 
the general health of an individual, such as an expenditure for a 
vacation, is not an expenditure for medical care.
    (iii) Capital expenditures are generally not deductible for Federal 
income tax purposes. See section 263 and the regulations thereunder. 
However, an expenditure which otherwise qualifies as a medical expense 
under section 213 shall not be disqualified merely because it is a 
capital expenditure. For purposes of section 213 and this paragraph, a 
capital expenditure made by the taxpayer may qualify as a medical

[[Page 284]]

expense, if it has as its primary purpose the medical care (as defined 
in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) of the taxpayer, his 
spouse, or his dependent. Thus, a capital expenditure which is related 
only to the sick person and is not related to permanent improvement or 
betterment of property, if it otherwise qualifies as an expenditure for 
medical care, shall be deductible; for example, an expenditure for eye 
glasses, a seeing eye dog, artificial teeth and limbs, a wheel chair, 
crutches, an inclinator or an air conditioner which is detachable from 
the property and purchased only for the use of a sick person, etc. 
Moreover, a capital expenditure for permanent improvement or betterment 
of property which would not ordinarily be for the purpose of medical 
care (within the meaning of this paragraph) may, nevertheless, qualify 
as a medical expense to the extent that the expenditure exceeds the 
increase in the value of the related property, if the particular 
expenditure is related directly to medical care. Such a situation could 
arise, for example, where a taxpayer is advised by a physician to 
install an elevator in his residence so that the taxpayer's wife who is 
afflicted with heart disease will not be required to climb stairs. If 
the cost of installing the elevator is $1,000 and the increase in the 
value of the residence is determined to be only $700, the difference of 
$300, which is the amount in excess of the value enhancement, is 
deductible as a medical expense. If, however, by reason of this 
expenditure, it is determined that the value of the residence has not 
been increased, the entire cost of installing the elevator would qualify 
as a medical expense. Expenditures made for the operation or maintenance 
of a capital asset are likewise deductible medical expenses if they have 
as their primary purpose the medical care (as defined in subdivisions 
(i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) of the taxpayer, his spouse, or his 
dependent. Normally, if a capital expenditure qualifies as a medical 
expense, expenditures for the operation or maintenance of the capital 
asset would also qualify provided that the medical reason for the 
capital expenditure still exists. The entire amount of such operation 
and maintenance expenditures qualifies, even if none or only a portion 
of the original cost of the capital asset itself qualified.
    (iv) Expenses paid for transportation primarily for and essential to 
the rendition of the medical care are expenses paid for medical care. 
However, an amount allowable as a deduction for ``transportation 
primarily for and essential to medical care'' shall not include the cost 
of any meals and lodging while away from home receiving medical 
treatment. For example, if a doctor prescribes that a taxpayer go to a 
warm climate in order to alleviate a specific chronic ailment, the cost 
of meals and lodging while there would not be deductible. On the other 
hand, if the travel is undertaken merely for the general improvement of 
a taxpayer's health, neither the cost of transportation nor the cost of 
meals and lodging would be deductible. If a doctor prescribes an 
operation or other medical care, and the taxpayer chooses for purely 
personal considerations to travel to another locality (such as a resort 
area) for the operation or the other medical care, neither the cost of 
transportation nor the cost of meals and lodging (except where paid as 
part of a hospital bill) is deductible.
    (v) The cost of in-patient hospital care (including the cost of 
meals and lodging therein) is an expenditure for medical care. The 
extent to which expenses for care in an institution other than a 
hospital shall constitute medical care is primarily a question of fact 
which depends upon the condition of the individual and the nature of the 
services he receives (rather than the nature of the institution). A 
private establishment which is regularly engaged in providing the types 
of care or services outlined in this subdivision shall be considered an 
institution for purposes of the rules provided herein. In general, the 
following rules will be applied:
    (a) Where an individual is in an institution because his condition 
is such that the availability of medical care (as defined in 
subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) in such institution is a 
principal reason for his presence there, and meals and lodging are 
furnished as a necessary incident to such care, the entire cost of 
medical care

[[Page 285]]

and meals and lodging at the institution, which are furnished while the 
individual requires continual medical care, shall constitute an expense 
for medical care. For example, medical care includes the entire cost of 
institutional care for a person who is mentally ill and unsafe when left 
alone. While ordinary education is not medical care, the cost of medical 
care includes the cost of attending a special school for a mentally or 
physically handicapped individual, if his condition is such that the 
resources of the institution for alleviating such mental or physical 
handicap are a principal reason for his presence there. In such a case, 
the cost of attending such a special school will include the cost of 
meals and lodging, if supplied, and the cost of ordinary education 
furnished which is incidental to the special services furnished by the 
school. Thus, the cost of medical care includes the cost of attending a 
special school designed to compensate for or overcome a physical 
handicap, in order to qualify the individual for future normal education 
or for normal living, such as a school for the teaching of braille or 
lip reading. Similarly, the cost of care and supervision, or of 
treatment and training, of a mentally retarded or physically handicapped 
individual at an institution is within the meaning of the term medical 
care.
    (b) Where an individual is in an institution, and his condition is 
such that the availability of medical care in such institution is not a 
principal reason for his presence there, only that part of the cost of 
care in the institution as is attributable to medical care (as defined 
in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph) shall be considered 
as a cost of medical care; meals and lodging at the institution in such 
a case are not considered a cost of medical care for purposes of this 
section. For example, an individual is in a home for the aged for 
personal or family considerations and not because he requires medical or 
nursing attention. In such case, medical care consists only of that part 
of the cost for care in the home which is attributable to medical care 
or nursing attention furnished to him; his meals and lodging at the home 
are not considered a cost of medical care.
    (c) It is immaterial for purposes of this subdivision whether the 
medical care is furnished in a Federal or State institution or in a 
private institution.
    (vi) See section 262 and the regulations thereunder for disallowance 
of deduction for personal living, and family expenses not falling within 
the definition of medical care.
    (2) Medicine and drugs. The term medicine and drugs shall include 
only items which are legally procured and which are generally accepted 
as falling within the category of medicine and drugs (whether or not 
requiring a prescription). Such term shall not include toiletries or 
similar preparations (such as toothpaste, shaving lotion, shaving cream, 
etc.) nor shall it include cosmetics (such as face creams, deodorants, 
hand lotions, etc., or any similar preparation used for ordinary 
cosmetic purposes) or sundry items. Amounts expended for items which, 
under this subparagraph, are excluded from the term medicine and drugs 
shall not constitute amounts expended for ``medical care''.
    (3) Status as spouse or dependent. In the case of medical expenses 
for the care of a person who is the taxpayer's spouse or dependent, the 
deduction under section 213 is allowable if the status of such person as 
``spouse'' or ``dependent'' of the taxpayer exists either at the time 
the medical services were rendered or at the time the expenses were 
paid. In determining whether such status as ``spouse'' exists, a 
taxpayer who is legally separated from his spouse under a decree of 
separate maintenance is not considered as married. Thus, payments made 
in June 1956 by A, for medical services rendered in 1955 to B, his wife, 
may be deducted by A for 1956 even though, before the payments were 
made, B may have died or in 1956 secured a divorce. Payments made in 
July 1956 by C, for medical services rendered to D in 1955 may be 
deducted by C for 1956 even though C and D were not married until June 
1956.
    (4) Medical insurance. (i)(a) For taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1966, expenditures for insurance shall constitute expenses 
paid for medical care only to the extent that such amounts are paid for 
insurance covering expenses of medical care referred to

[[Page 286]]

in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. In the case of an insurance 
contract under which amounts are payable for other than medical care 
(as, for example, a policy providing an indemnity for loss of income or 
for loss of life, limb, or sight):
    (1) No amount shall be treated as paid for insurance covering 
expenses of medical care referred to in subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph unless the charge for such insurance is either separately 
stated in the contract or furnished to the policyholder by the insurer 
in a separate statement,
    (2) The amount taken into account as the amount paid for such 
medical insurance shall not exceed such charge, and
    (3) No amount shall be treated as paid for such medical insurance if 
the amount specified in the contract (or furnished to the policyholder 
by the insurer in a separate statement) as the charge for such insurance 
is unreasonably large in relation to the total charges under the 
contract.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, amounts will be considered 
payable for other than medical care under the contract if the contract 
provides for the waiver of premiums upon the occurrence of an event. In 
determining whether a separately stated charge for insurance covering 
expenses of medical care is unreasonably large in relation to the total 
premium, the relationship of the coverages under the contract together 
with all of the facts and circumstances shall be considered. In 
determining whether a contract constitutes an ``insurance'' contract it 
is irrelevant whether the benefits are payable in cash or in services. 
For example, amounts paid for hospitalization insurance, for membership 
in an association furnishing cooperative or so-called free-choice 
medical service, or for group hospitalization and clinical care are 
expenses paid for medical care. Premiums paid under Part B, Title XVIII 
of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395j-1395w), relating to 
supplementary medical insurance benefits for the aged, are amounts paid 
for insurance covering expenses of medical care. Taxes imposed by any 
governmental unit do not, however, constitute amounts paid for such 
medical insurance.
    (b) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966, subject to 
the rules of (a) of this subdivision, premiums paid during a taxable 
year by a taxpayer under the age of 65 for insurance covering expenses 
of medical care for the taxpayer, his spouse, or a dependent after the 
taxpayer attains the age of 65 are to be treated as expenses paid during 
the taxable year for insurance covering expenses of medical care if the 
premiums for such insurance are payable (on a level payment basis) under 
the contract:
    (1) For a period of 10 years or more, or
    (2) Until the year in which the taxpayer attains the age of 65 (but 
in no case for a period of less than 5 years).

For purposes of this subdivision (b), premiums will be considered 
payable on a level payment basis if the total premium under the contract 
is payable in equal annual or more frequent installments. Thus, a total 
premium of $10,000 payable over a period of 10 years at $1,000 a year 
shall be considered payable on a level payment basis.
    (ii) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, expenses 
paid for medical care shall include amounts paid for accident or health 
insurance. In determining whether a contract constitutes an 
``insurance'' contract it is irrelevant whether the benefits are payable 
in cash or in services. For example, amounts paid for hospitalization 
insurance, for membership in an association furnishing cooperative or 
so-called free-choice medical service, or for group hospitalization and 
clinical care are expenses paid for medical care.
    (f) Exclusion of amounts allowed for care of certain dependents. 
Amounts taken into account under section 44A in computing a credit for 
the care of certain dependents shall not be treated as expenses paid for 
medical care.
    (g) Reimbursement for expenses paid in prior years. (1) Where 
reimbursement, from insurance or otherwise, for medical expenses is 
received in a taxable year subsequent to a year in which a deduction was 
claimed on account of such expenses, the reimbursement must be included 
in gross income in

[[Page 287]]

such subsequent year to the extent attributable to (and not in excess 
of) deductions allowed under section 213 for any prior taxable year. See 
section 104, relating to compensation for injuries or sickness, and 
section 105(b), relating to amounts expended for medical care, and the 
regulations thereunder, with regard to amounts in excess of or not 
attributable to deductions allowed.
    (2) If no medical expense deduction was taken in an earlier year, 
for example, if the standard deduction under section 141 was taken for 
the earlier year, the reimbursement received in the taxable year for the 
medical expense of the earlier year is not includible in gross income.
    (3) In order to allow the same aggregate medical expense deductions 
as if the reimbursement received in a subsequent year or years had been 
received in the year in which the payments for medical care were made, 
the following rules shall be followed:
    (i) If the amount of the reimbursement is equal to or less than the 
amount which was deducted in a prior year, the entire amount of the 
reimbursement shall be considered attributable to the deduction taken in 
such prior year (and hence includible in gross income); or
    (ii) If the amount of the reimbursement received in such subsequent 
year or years is greater than the amount which was deducted for the 
prior year, that portion of the reimbursement received which is equal in 
amount to the deduction taken in the prior year shall be considered as 
attributable to such deduction (and hence includible in gross income); 
but
    (iii) If the deduction for the prior year would have been greater 
but for the limitations on the maximum amount of such deduction provided 
by section 213 (c), then the amount of the reimbursement attributable to 
such deduction (and hence includible in gross income) shall be the 
amount of the reimbursement received in a subsequent year or years 
reduced by the amount disallowed as a deduction because of the maximum 
limitation, but not in excess of the deduction allowed for the previous 
year.
    (4) The application of subparagraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this 
paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples. Examples (1) and 
(2) reflect the maximum limitation on the medical expense deduction 
applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961. Examples 
(3) and (4) reflect the maximum limitation on the medical expense 
deduction applicable to taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 
1962. For explanation of such maximum medical expense limitations, see 
paragraph (c) of this section.

    Example 1. Taxpayer A, a single individual (not the head of a 
household and not a surviving spouse) with one dependent, is entitled to 
two exemptions under the provisions of section 151. He had an adjusted 
gross income of $35,000 for the calendar year 1962. During 1962 he paid 
$16,000 for medical care. A received no reimbursement for such medical 
expenses in 1962, but in 1963 he received $6,000 upon an insurance 
policy covering the medical expenses which he paid in 1962. A was 
allowed a deduction of $10,000 (the maximum) from his adjusted gross 
income for 1962. The amount which A must include in his gross income for 
1963 is $1,050, and the amount to be excluded from gross income for 1963 
is $4,950, computed as follows:

    Example 2. Assuming that A, in example (1), received $15,000 in 1963 
as reimbursement for the medical expenses which he paid in 1962, the 
amount which A must include in his gross income for 1963 is $10,000, and

$9,000 for medical care. A received no reimbursement for such medical 
expenses in 1956, but in 1957 he received $6,000 upon an insurance 
policy covering the medical expenses which he paid in 1956. A was 
allowed a deduction of $5,000 (the maximum) from his adjusted gross

    (h) Substantiation of deductions. In connection with claims for 
deductions under section 213, the taxpayer shall furnish the name and 
address of each person to whom payment for medical expenses was made and 
the amount and date of the payment thereof in each case. If payment was 
made in kind, such fact shall be so reflected. Claims for deductions 
must be substantiated, when requested by the district director, by a 
statement or itemized invoice from the individual or entity to which 
payment for medical expenses was made showing the nature of the service 
rendered, and to or for whom rendered; the nature of any other item of 
expense and for whom incurred and for what specific purpose, the amount 
paid therefor and the date of the payment thereof; and by such other 
information as the district director may deem necessary.

<R05>
Sec. 1.214-1   Expenses for the care of certain dependents incurred during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1972.

    (a) General rule. (1) This section applies only for expenses 
incurred during taxable years beginning before January 1, 1972. For 
expenses incurring in taxable years beginning after December 31,

[[Page 289]]

1971, see section 1.214A, and Secs. 214A-1 through 1.214A-5.
    (2) Section 214 allows, subject to certain limitations, a deduction 
from gross income of expenses paid for the care of certain dependents 
where the care is for the purpose of enabling the taxpayer to be 
gainfully employed. Such expenses are referred to in this section as 
``child care'' expenses. The deduction is allowed only for expenses 
incurred while the taxpayer is gainfully employed or in active search of 
gainful employment. The employment which is the cause of the incurring 
of the expenses may, however, consist of service either within or 
without the home of the taxpayer. Self-employment constitutes employment 
for purposes of section 214.
    (b) Taxpayers who may qualify for the deduction. The deduction 
provided in section 214 is allowed only to a taxpayer who is a woman, a 
widower, or, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, a 
husband whose wife is incapacitated or institutionalized. For purposes 
of this paragraph, the following rules apply:
    (1) A widower. The deduction is allowed for expenses paid by a 
taxpayer who is a widower at the time the expenses are incurred. The 
term widower includes (i) a man whose wife has died and who has not 
remarried, (ii) a man who is divorced from his wife and has not 
remarried, and (iii) a man who is legally separated from his wife under 
a decree of legal separation.
    (2) A married woman whose husband is capable of self-support. If the 
expenses are paid by a woman (i) who is married at the time the expenses 
are incurred, (ii) whose husband at that time is not incapable of self-
support because he is mentally defective or physically disabled, (iii) 
who is not divorced or legally separated at the end of the taxable year, 
and (iv) in the case of a woman who has been deserted by her husband and 
who does not meet all of the conditions set forth in subparagraph 
(4)(ii) of this paragraph, the deduction is allowed, but only if she 
files a joint income tax return with her husband for the taxable year in 
which the expenses are paid. Further, the amount otherwise deductible 
shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which the combined adjusted 
gross income of the taxpayer and her spouse for the taxable year in 
which the expenses are paid exceeds $4,500 (for taxable years beginning 
before January 1, 1964) or $6,000 (for taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1963). The amount otherwise deductible is the amount 
expended for child care or the maximum deduction allowable for any 
taxable year (see paragraph (c) of this section), whichever is the 
lesser. The determination of whether the taxpayer's husband is incapable 
of self-support because of a mental defect or physical disability shall 
be made without regard to his income from sources other than his own 
earnings. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term earnings means 
wages, salaries, commissions, professional fees, and other amounts 
received as compensation for personal services actually rendered. It 
does not include income such as pensions, annuities, sick pay, interest, 
dividends, or rents.
    (3) A married woman whose husband is incapable of self-support. (i) 
The deduction is allowed without regard to the limitations described in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph for expenses paid by a married woman 
whose husband is incapable of self-support because he is mentally 
defective or physically disabled (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph) at the time the expenses are incurred.
    (ii) A married woman claiming a deduction under this subparagraph 
shall submit with her income tax return in which the deduction is 
claimed information disclosing (a) the nature of her husband's 
disability, (b) the period of the disability, (c) the amount of her 
husband's earnings (if any) during the period he was incapable of self-
support, and (d) such other information as is required by the return or 
instructions relating to the return. Where the husband is capable of 
self-support for part of a taxable year the child care expenses incurred 
for such part shall be treated under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. 
See example (8) of paragraph (c)(3)(i) or example (8) of paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii) (whichever is applicable) of this section.
    (4) A single woman. (i) The deduction is also allowed without regard 
to the limitation described in subparagraph

[[Page 290]]

(2) of this paragraph for expenses paid by a woman who (a) is unmarried 
at the time the expenses are incurred, or (b) is, at the close of the 
taxable year, legally separated from her husband under a decree of 
divorce or of separate maintenance.
    (ii) For taxable years ending after April 2, 1963, the deduction is 
also allowed without regard to the limitation described in subparagraph 
(2) of this paragraph for expenses paid by a woman who (a) has been 
deserted by her husband, (b) at the time her return for the taxable year 
is filed, does not know the whereabouts of her husband, (c) has not 
known the whereabouts of her husband at any time during the taxable 
year, and (d) has applied to a court of competent jurisdiction for 
appropriate process to compel her husband to pay support or otherwise to 
comply with the law or a judicial order. In general, a wife shall be 
considered to be deserted by her husband during any period of time 
during which there is an actual, willful, and voluntary abandonment of 
the wife by her husband which abandonment is in violation of a legal 
obligation without legal justification or excuse. The determination as 
to whether a wife has been deserted by her husband is a question of fact 
which will not necessarily be governed by provisions of state law 
relating to desertion or abandonment. The determination as to whether a 
wife knew the whereabouts of her husband at any particular moment of 
time will be determined in the light of the particular facts of each 
case. A wife will be considered to have known the whereabouts of her 
husband if on a particular day she knew the address at which he was, on 
such day, residing or carrying on his trade or business, or if she knew 
the name and address of the person by whom he was employed on such day. 
A wife will not be considered to have known the whereabouts of her 
husband merely because she had information that he was residing or 
working in a particular city or state. To satisfy the requirement of (d) 
of this subdivision the wife must have initiated legal proceedings 
consistent with the applicable state law for the purpose of compelling 
her husband to pay support or, upon failure of the husband to comply 
with an order or decree of a court requiring the payment of support, 
must have initiated legal proceedings, consistent with the applicable 
state law, for the purpose of requiring compliance by the husband of the 
order or decree of the court. As used in this subdivision, the term 
legal proceedings includes criminal and quasi criminal proceedings as 
well as civil proceedings.
    (5) A husband whose wife is incapacitated or institutionalized--(i) 
In general. Subject to certain limitations, the deduction is allowed for 
expenses paid in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, by a 
husband if the expenses are incurred during a period in which his wife 
is incapacitated. However, the deduction is allowed only if the wife is 
incapacitated for a period of at least 90 consecutive days or a shorter 
period if the period of incapacitation is terminated by her death. The 
period of incapacitation need not occur entirely within one taxable 
year.
    (ii) Limitation on deduction. Except as otherwise provided in this 
subdivision, the deduction is allowed only if the husband files a joint 
income tax return with his wife for the taxable year in which the 
expenses are paid. Further, the amount otherwise deductible shall be 
reduced by the amount, if any, by which the combined adjusted gross 
income of the husband and his spouse exceeds $6,000 for the taxable year 
in which the expenses are paid. The amount otherwise deductible is the 
amount expended for child care (and incurred during the period the wife 
was incapacitated) or the maximum deduction allowable for any taxable 
year beginning after December 31, 1963 (see paragraph (c) (2) of this 
section), whichever is the lesser. The limitations set forth in this 
subdivision do not apply to any expenses incurred in any period during 
which the taxpayer's wife is institutionalized if (a) the 
institutionaliza- tion is for a period of at least 90 consecutive days, 
or (b) the period of institutionalization (regardless of its length) is 
terminated by her death. The period of institutionalization referred to 
in subdivision (a) or (b) of this subdivision need not occur entirely 
within one taxable year.
    (iii) Incapacitated wife. A wife is considered to be incapacitated 
during any

[[Page 291]]

period of time during which she is incapable of caring for herself 
because of a mental or physical defect. A wife is not considered to be 
incapacitated solely by reason of the fact that she has a mental or 
physical defect. A wife is incapacitated only if she is mentally or 
physically defective and as a result of the mental or physical defect is 
incapable of caring for herself. The fact that a wife, by reason of a 
mental or physical defect, is incapable of self-support, is unable to 
engage in any substantial gainful activity, or is unable to perform the 
normal household functions of a housewife or to care for her minor 
children, does not, of itself, establish that the wife is incapable of 
caring for herself. A wife who is mentally or physically defective to 
the extent that she cannot dress herself or cannot provide for her 
personal hygienical or nutritional needs will, ordinarily, be considered 
as incapable of caring for herself. Thus, a wife who because of an 
injury (whether temporary or permanent) is confined to a bed or to a 
wheel chair, even though otherwise enjoying good health, is incapable of 
caring for herself. In addition, a wife who is physically handicapped, 
or a wife who is mentally defective and has suicidal or other dangerous 
tendencies, and for such reason requires constant attention of another 
person is considered to be incapable of caring for herself. A wife is 
also considered to be incapacitated during any period of time (whether 
or not for 90 consecutive days) during which she is institutionalized.
    (iv) Institutionalized wife. A wife is considered to be 
institutionalized only while she is, for purposes of receiving medical 
care or treatment, an inpatient, resident, or inmate of a public or 
private hospital, or other similar institution. A wife who resides at a 
hospital, sanitarium, or other similar institution other than for 
purposes of receiving medical care or treatment, as, for example, by 
reason of her employment, is not institutionalized. Generally, a wife is 
not considered institutionalized while residing at a health or beauty 
ranch or similar establishment even though some medical care or 
treatment is provided.
    (v) Information to be submitted with return. A married man claiming 
a deduction under this subparagraph shall submit with his income tax 
return in which the deduction is claimed information disclosing, if his 
wife is institutionalized, the period of institutionalization and the 
name and address of the institution where the wife received medical care 
or treatment, or, if his wife is incapacitated (but not 
institutionalized), the nature and period of her incapacitation. There 
shall also be submitted such other information as is required by the 
return or instructions relating to the return. In addition, there should 
be submitted, wherever possible, a certificate of the attending 
physician indicating the nature and duration of the wife's mental or 
physical defect.
    (vi) Computation of 90-day period--(a) Incapacitation. For the 
purpose of determining whether a wife is incapacitated for a period of 
at least 90 consecutive days, different periods of incapacitation which 
are separated by a period of time during which the wife is not 
incapacitated cannot be added together. Thus, if a wife is incapacitated 
during the months of March and April (61 days) and is incapacitated 
during the entire month of October (31 days), she is not incapacitated 
for a period of at least 90 consecutive days. Since a wife who is 
institutionalized is considered to be incapacitated, the period during 
which a wife is institutionalized is added to a consecutive period 
during which she is incapacitated (but not institutionalized) for the 
purpose of determining whether the wife is incapacitated for a period of 
at least 90 consecutive days. Thus, the 90-consecutive-day requirement 
is met where a wife remains at home unable to care for herself because 
of a mental or physical defect for 60 consecutive days and immediately 
thereafter enters an institution where she continuously remains for an 
additional 30 days receiving medical care or treatment, whether or not 
she is able to care for herself during such 30 days.
    (b) Institutionalization. For the purpose of determining whether a 
wife is institutionalized for a period of at least 90 consecutive days, 
different periods of

[[Page 292]]

institutionalization which are separated by a period of time during 
which the wife was not institutionalized cannot be added together. Thus, 
if a wife is institutionalized during the months of March and April (61 
days), spends the months of May and June at home, and is 
institutionalized during the entire month of July (31 days), she is not 
institutionalized for a period of at least 90 consecutive days. However, 
if the wife is incapacitated during all of May and June, the entire 
period (March through July) constitutes a continuous period of 
incapacitation, see subdivision (a) of this subdivision. The running of 
a period of institutionalization is not discontinued because of, but 
rather such period includes, brief absences from the institution such as 
on weekends or holidays, and transfers from one institution to another.
    (vii) Rule where period of incapacitation does not occur in one 
taxable year. The 90-consecutive-day period of incapacitation or of 
institutionalization need not occur entirely within one taxable year. If 
part of a period of at least 90 days of incapacitation, or part of a 
period of incapacitation of less than 90 days which is terminated by 
reason of the death of the wife, occurs in one taxable year and the 
remainder occurs in the succeeding taxable year, a deduction is allowed 
for the child care expenses incurred during the part of the period 
occurring in each such year, subject, however, to all other conditions 
and limitations. However, no deduction is allowed for expenses paid in 
any taxable year which begins before January 1, 1964 (see subdivision 
(i) of this subparagraph).
    (6) Determination of status. If child care expenses are incurred in 
one taxable year and paid in another, the status of a taxpayer described 
in subparagraphs (1) to (5) of this paragraph, inclusive, shall be 
determined as of the time at which the expenses are incurred and not 
when such expenses are paid.
    (c) Computation of deduction--(1) In general. The deduction for 
child care expenses is allowable only with respect to such expenses 
actually paid during the taxable year regardless of when the event which 
occasioned the expenses occurred and regardless of the method of 
accounting employed by the taxpayer in making his income tax return. If 
child care expenses are incurred but not paid during the taxable year, 
no deduction can be taken for such year. Thus, if an expenditure was 
incurred in December of a particular year, but not paid until January of 
the following calendar year, no deduction may be taken for the earlier 
calendar year.
    (2) Dollar limitation on amount of deduction--(i) Taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 1964. For any taxable year beginning before 
January 1, 1964, the deduction for child care expenses may not exceed 
$600 regardless of the number of dependents for whose care the expenses 
are incurred.
    (ii) Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963. Except as 
otherwise provided in this subdivision, the deduction for child care 
expenses, for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, may 
not exceed $600. If the taxpayer has two or more dependents at any time 
during the taxable year, the $600 limit is increased by the amount of 
child care expenses incurred by the taxpayer for the period or periods 
during which the taxpayer has two or more dependents. The $600 limit may 
not be increased to an amount in excess of $900. For a further 
limitation on the amount of the allowable deduction, see subparagraphs 
(2) and (5) of paragraph (b) of this section.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the computation of 
the deduction allowed by section 214 in the case of a taxpayer making 
his return on the basis of the calendar year. In each example it is 
assumed that the expenses are of the type which would qualify for the 
deduction.
    (i) The following examples apply to taxable years beginning before 
January 1, 1964:

    Example 1. M was a widower during 1954, until September 1, when he 
remarried. He paid $50 each month in 1954 for child care expenses. He 
may take into account, for purposes of the deduction allowed by section 
214, only the expenses paid during the taxable year which were incurred 
while he was unmarried. Since the expenses were $400 ($50 per month from 
January to August, inclusive), the amount of the deduction is $400. If M 
had paid $100 per month during 1954, the deduction would be limited to 
$600, although

[[Page 293]]

the expenses incurred while M was unmarried amount to $800.
    Example 2. H and W were married during the entire year 1954. W, the 
wife, paid $900 for child care expenses incurred during the year. The 
combined adjusted gross income of H and W for 1954 was $5,000. The 
allowable deduction under section 214 is $100 ($600, the maximum 
deduction allowable, reduced by $500, the excess of adjusted gross 
income of $5,000 over $4,500). The deduction of $100 is allowable only 
if H and W made a joint return for 1954.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in example (2), except that the 
child care expenses paid during the year were $400. No deduction is 
allowable under section 214, since the amount of expenses paid, $400, is 
less than $500 (the excess of the adjusted gross income over $4,500).
    Example 4. During 1954, W, a woman, paid $50 each month for child 
care expenses. She was unmarried until April 1, 1954, and was married 
for the remainder of the year. H, her husband, was capable of self-
support, and the combined adjusted gross income of husband and wife was 
$4,700. H and W made a joint return for 1954. The total deduction 
allowable to W under section 214 is $400, computed as follows: $150 as 
expenses incurred while W was a single woman, and $250 as expenses 
incurred while W was married; the $250 is arrived at by taking the 
amount expended while H and W were married, $450, and reducing it by 
$200 (the excess of adjusted gross income, $4,700 over $4,500).
    Example 5. The facts are the same as in example (4), except that the 
amounts paid are $75 per month ($225 being paid for expenses incurred 
while W was single and $675 while she was married). The total allowable 
deduction in this case is $600. $225 is deductible as expenses incurred 
while W was a single woman. $400 of the expenses incurred during the 
period of marriage is also deductible. However, the maximum deduction 
allowable to W is $600. The allowable amount for expenses incurred 
during the period of marriage is determined as follows: $675 (the amount 
expended during the period) is reduced to $600 (the maximum deduction 
allowable) and $600 is then reduced by $200 (the excess of adjusted 
gross income $4,700 over $4,500) to $400.
    Example 6. H and W were married during 1954 prior to July 1, when 
they received a decree of divorce. She did not remarry during 1954. W 
paid $100 per month for child care expenses during 1954. The allowable 
deduction is $600. Since W is considered to have been a single woman 
during all of 1954, the limitations with respect to the deduction 
allowed to a married woman are not applicable, and only the $600 
limitation applies.
    Example 7. H and W married on July 1, 1954. At all times in 1954, 
until July 1, H was a widower and W was a widow. H and W each paid $750 
for child care in 1954, prior to their marriage. Each is allowed a 
deduction for 1954 of $600, regardless of their adjusted gross income 
and of the amount of their child care expenditures while married, and 
whether or not a joint return was filed. However, no additional 
deduction would be allowed for child care expenses paid after their 
marriage.
    Example 8. H and W were married at all times during the year 1954. 
As a result of an accident, H incurred injuries which rendered him 
incapable of self-support during 1954 until September 1. The adjusted 
gross income of H and W for 1954 was $4,700. W paid $60 each month in 
1954 for child care expenses. The deduction allowable to W by section 
214 is $520. This amount is composed of $480, representing the amounts 
paid during H's period of disability, and $40, representing the 
allowable deduction of expenses paid in the amount of $240 from 
September to December, inclusive ($240 is reduced by $200, the excess of 
the adjusted gross income ($4,700) over $4,500).
    Example 9. H and W were married from January 1, 1954 to October 1, 
1954, when H died. The combined adjusted gross income of the spouses was 
$4,800. W paid $50 per month for child care expenses throughout the 
entire year. The deduction allowed to W if she filed a separate return 
is $150, the amount paid while she was a widow. If a joint return is 
filed on behalf of the widow and her deceased husband, the deduction 
allowable is $300 which includes $150 deductible as a married woman (the 
amount expended during marriage, $450, being reduced by $300, the excess 
of $4,800 over $4,500).

    (ii) The following examples apply to taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1963:

    Example 1. B was a widower during 1964, until August 1, when he 
remarried. He had two dependent children aged 7 and 10. He paid $90 each 
month in 1964 for child care expenses. His wife was not incapacitated or 
institutionalized at any time during 1964. He may take into account, for 
purposes of the deduction allowed by section 214, only those expenses 
paid during the taxable year which were incurred while he was unmarried. 
Therefore, the amount of the deduction allowable is $630 ($90 per month 
from January to July, inclusive). If B had only one dependent during the 
period he was unmarried, the amount of the deduction allowable would be 
limited to $600.
    Example 2. H and W were married during the entire year 1964. They 
have one dependent child age 11. W, the wife, paid $800 for child care 
expenses incurred during the year. The combined adjusted gross income of 
H and W was $6,400. The allowable deduction under section 214 is $200, 
computed as follows: $600, the maximum deduction allowable

[[Page 294]]

for one dependent, is reduced by $400, the excess of adjusted gross 
income ($6,400) over $6,000. The deduction of $200 is allowable only if 
H and W made a joint return for 1964.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in example (2), except that the 
child care expenses paid during the year were $400. No deduction is 
allowable under section 214, since the amount of expenses paid, $400, 
does not exceed the excess of the adjusted gross income ($6,400) over 
$6,000.
    Example 4. During 1964, W, a woman paid $60 each month for child 
care expenses for her dependent child age 11. She was a widow from 
January 1, through March 31, and was married for the remainder of the 
year. H, her husband, was capable of self-support, and the combined 
adjusted gross income of H and W for 1964 was $6,200. H and W made a 
joint return for 1964. The total deduction allowable to W under section 
214 is $520, computed as follows: $180, as expenses incurred while W was 
a single woman, plus $340, as expenses incurred while W was married. The 
$340 is arrived at by reducing the amount expended while H and W were 
married, $540, by $200 (the excess of adjusted gross income ($6,200) 
over $6,000).
    Example 5. The facts are the same as in example (4), except that the 
amounts paid for child care expenses are $75 per month ($225 being paid 
for expenses incurred while W was single and $675 while she was 
married). The total allowable deduction in this case is $600. $225 is 
deductible as expenses incurred while W was a single woman. $400 of the 
expenses incurred during the period of marriage is also deductible. 
However, the maximum deduction allowable to W is $600. The allowable 
amount for expenses incurred during the period of marriage is determined 
as follows: $675 (the amount expended during such period) is reduced to 
$600 (the maximum deduction allowable for one dependent) and $600 is 
then reduced by $200 (the excess of adjusted gross income ($6,200) over 
$6,000) to $400.
    Example 6. H and W were married during 1964 prior to July 1, when 
they received a decree of divorce. W did not remarry during 1964. She 
had two dependent children age 6 and 8. W paid $100 per month for child 
care expenses during 1964. The allowable deduction is $900. Since W is 
considered to have been a single woman during all of 1964, the 
limitations with respect to the deduction allowed to a married woman are 
not applicable, and only the maximum dollar limitation applies ($900 for 
two dependents for the entire year). If W had only one dependent during 
the entire year, the allowable deduction would be limited to $600.
    Example 7. H and W were married on July 1, 1964. At all times in 
1964, until July 1, H was a widower and W was a widow. H and W each paid 
$600 for child care expenses in 1964, prior to their marriage. W had a 
dependent child age 6, and H had a dependent child age 8. Their combined 
adjusted gross income for 1964 was $6,400, and they made a joint return. 
From July 1, to the end of 1964, W paid $100 per month for child care 
expenses for both children. If a joint return is not made, H and W are 
each allowed a deduction of $600, regardless of their adjusted gross 
income, but no additional deduction would be allowed for child care 
expenses paid after their marriage. If a joint return is made, H is 
allowed a deduction of $600 for the expenses paid by him as a widower, 
and W is allowed a deduction of $800, computed as follows: $600 for 
expenses paid by her as a widow, and $200 for expenses incurred and paid 
by her after her marriage. The $200 is arrived at by reducing the amount 
expended by W from July 1, to the remainder of 1964 (when she had two 
dependents), $600, by $400, the excess of the adjusted gross income 
($6,400) over $6,000. If after her marriage W had incurred and paid 
child care expenses in the amount of $1,000, W would be allowed a 
deduction of $900, computed as follows: $600 for expenses paid by her as 
a widow, and $300 for expenses incurred and paid by her after her 
marriage. The $300 is arrived at by reducing the $1,000 to $900 (the 
maximum deduction allowed for two dependents) and the $900 is reduced by 
$400 (the excess of adjusted gross income, $6,400 over $6,000); and the 
remainder, $500, is then reduced to $300, which represents the 
difference between the maximum dollar limitation for two dependents 
($900) and the amount paid by W as a widow, $600.
    Example 8. H and W were married at all times during 1964. As a 
result of an accident, H incurred injuries which rendered him incapable 
of self-support during 1964 until September 1. They had one dependent 
child age 10. The adjusted gross income of H and W for 1964 was $6,200. 
W paid $60 each month in 1964 for child care expenses. The deduction 
allowable to W under section 214 is $520. This amount is composed of 
$480, the amounts paid during H's period of disability and $40, the 
expenses paid from September to December, inclusive ($240) reduced by 
$200, the excess of the adjusted gross income ($6,200) over $6,000.
    Example 9. H and W were married from January 1, 1964, until October 
1, 1964, when H died. H and W had one child age 10. The combined 
adjusted gross income of H and W was $6,300. W paid $50 per month for 
child care expenses throughout the entire year. The deduction allowed to 
W if she filed a separate return is $150, the amount paid while she was 
a widow. If a joint return is filed on behalf of the widow and her 
deceased husband, the deduction allowable is $300, computed as follows: 
$150 for expenses incurred while W was a widow, and $150 for expenses 
incurred while W was married (the amount expended during marriage, $450, 
is reduced by $300, the excess of the adjusted gross income ($6,300) 
over $6,000).

[[Page 295]]

    Example 10. H and W were married at all times during 1964 and have 
two children. On March 1, 1964, the older child attained age 13 and 
during the remainder of the year was not a dependent as defined in 
section 214(d)(1). W incurred and paid $90 each month for child care 
expenses. H and W's adjusted gross income for 1964 was $6,100, and they 
made a joint return. The deduction allowable to W under section 214 is 
$680, computed as follows: $900 (the amount expended from March 1, to 
the end of 1964) is reduced to $600 (the maximum amount allowable for 
one dependent) to which is added $180 (the amount expended while H and W 
had two dependent children under age 13); a total of $780, which amount 
is reduced by $100 (the excess of the adjusted gross income ($6,100) 
over $6,000).
    Example 11. H and W were married during the entire year 1964 and 
have two dependents. On March 1, 1964, W became incapacitated and 
remained unable to care for herself until April 1, 1964, at which time 
she was admitted to a hospital for medical treatment. W remained in the 
hospital continuously until June 1, 1964, at which time she returned 
home. On June 1, 1964, and for the remainder of 1964, W was capable of 
caring for herself. H incurred and paid $90 a month for child care 
expenses during 1964. H and W's adjusted gross income for 1964 was 
$6,100, and they made a joint return for 1964. For purposes of section 
214, W is considered to be incapacitated from March 1, 1964 to May 31, 
1964, inclusive (a period of at least 90 consecutive days). The 
allowable deduction is $170, computed as follows: $270, the amount 
incurred while W was incapacitated, is reduced by $100, the excess of 
adjusted gross income ($6,100) over $6,000).
    Example 12. The facts are the same as in example (11), except that W 
was in the hospital until August 1, 1964. On August 1, 1964, and for the 
remainder of 1964, W was capable of caring for herself. The allowable 
deduction is $360 (the amount incurred while W was institutionalized). 
No deduction is allowed for the $90 of expenses incurred during March, 
1964, because such amount is less than $100 (the excess of the adjusted 
gross income ($6,100) over $6,000).

    (d) Dependents--(1) In general. The deduction provided by section 
214 is allowed only for expenses paid for the care of an individual who 
(for the taxable year of the taxpayer in which the expenses are 
incurred) is a dependent of the taxpayer for whom an exemption is 
allowed under section 151(e)(1). Furthermore, the dependent must, at the 
time the expenses are incurred, be:
    (i) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, under the 
age of 12 years,
    (ii) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, under the 
age of 13 years, or
    (iii) Mentally or physically unable to care for himself.
    (2) Special rules. (i) It is not necessary that the dependent be 
permanently disabled in order for the amount expended for his care to be 
deductible. However, the mere fact that the disability, whether 
temporary or permanent, renders him incapable of self-support does not 
necessarily mean that he is incapable of self-care within the meaning of 
subparagraph (1)(iii) of this paragraph.
    (ii) A dependent who has not attained the age of 13 years (for 
taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, who has not attained the 
age of 12 years) is deemed mentally or physically unable to care for 
himself. Thus, the deduction for expenses paid for the care of a 
dependent under the age of 13 years (for taxable years beginning before 
January 1, 1964, under the age of 12 years) is allowable even though the 
dependent is not a child or stepchild of the taxpayer.
    (iii) The rules provided in sections 151 and 152, with respect to 
the definition and qualification of an individual as a dependent, govern 
for the purpose of section 214. Thus, expenses for the care of a child 
or stepchild under the age of 13 years (for taxable years beginning 
before Jan. 1, 1964, under the age of 12 years) whom the taxpayer 
supports are deductible even though the child or stepchild has gross 
income equal to or in excess of the amount determined pursuant to 
Sec. 1.151-2 applicable to the calendar year in which the taxable year 
of the taxpayer begins. On the other hand, expenses for the care of an 
aged parent would not be deductible if the gross income condition of 
Sec. 1.151-2 is not met.
    (iv) The term dependent does not include the spouse of a taxpayer.
    (e) Payments to a dependent. No deduction is allowed under section 
214 for expenses paid to an individual for whom the taxpayer is allowed, 
for the taxable year in which the expenses are paid, an exemption under 
section 151. Thus, if the taxpayer, a working widow, supports her mother 
and is entitled to claim her as a dependent, she may not

[[Page 296]]

deduct amounts paid to the mother for the care of the taxpayer's 
children.
    (f) What expenses are deductible--(1) In general. In order for an 
expense to be deductible under section 214, it must meet three 
conditions: First, the expense must be for the care of a dependent; 
second, it must be for a dependent's care while the taxpayer is 
gainfully employed or in search of gainful employment; and third, the 
expense must be for the purpose of enabling the taxpayer to be gainfully 
employed. In determining whether an expense meets these conditions, all 
the facts and circumstances of the case must be taken into 
consideration.
    (2) Definition of care of a dependent. (i) In general, the phrase 
expenses for the care of a dependent means amounts expended for the 
primary purpose of assuring the dependent's well being and protection. 
It does not include all benefits which may be bestowed upon him. 
Accordingly, amounts expended to provide food, clothing, or education, 
are not, in themselves, amounts expended for ``care'' so as to be 
deductible under section 214. However, where the manner of providing 
care is such that the expense which must be incurred includes payments 
for other benefits which are inseparably a part of the care, the full 
amount of the expense will be considered to be incurred for care. Thus, 
the full amount paid to a nursery school will be considered to be for 
the care of the child, even though the school also furnishes lunch, 
recreational activities, and other benefits.
    (ii) The manner of providing the care need not be the least 
expensive method available to the taxpayer. For example, the taxpayer's 
mother may reside at the taxpayer's home and be available to afford the 
taxpayer's child adequate care. Regardless of this fact, the expense 
incurred for the child at a nursery school or day camp may be expense 
for the care of the child. See, however, subparagraph (4) of this 
paragraph with respect to the requirement that the expense must be for 
the purpose of enabling the taxpayer to be gainfully employed.
    (iii) Where a portion of an expenditure is for the care of a 
dependent and a portion is for other unrelated purposes, a reasonable 
allocation shall be made and only the portion of the amount paid which 
is attributable to the care shall be considered an amount to which 
section 214 is applicable. This rule is applicable if, for example, a 
servant performs household duties and also cares for the children of the 
taxpayer. In this case, however, where one of the children is under 13 
(for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, under 12), and the 
other (or others) is over such age, there need be no further allocation 
between the children under such age and those over such age.
    (3) Period of employment. Since the deduction is allowed only for 
expenses for care for those periods during which the taxpayer is 
gainfully employed (or in active search of gainful employment), an 
allocation may be required when an expense covers periods of care in 
which no employment is involved. Thus, if a taxpayer pays $50 each month 
during the year for care of his child at a foster home, and the taxpayer 
is employed (or in search of employment) for only two months during the 
year, the deduction is limited to $100.
    (4) Purpose of expenditure. Even if an expense is incurred for the 
care of a dependent, it is not deductible unless it is incurred for the 
purpose of permitting the taxpayer to be gainfully employed. Whether 
that is the true purpose of the expense depends upon the facts and 
circumstances of the particular case. Thus, the fact that the cost of 
providing care for a dependent is greater than the amounts anticipated 
to be received from the employment of the taxpayer may indicate that the 
purpose of the expenditure is other than to permit the taxpayer to be 
gainfully employed.
    (5) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
this paragraph:

    Example 1. A widow has a child who is too young to attend public 
school. In order that she may be gainfully employed, the widow places 
the child in a nursery school while she is at work. The expenses paid to 
the nursery school are child care expenses to which the deduction under 
section 214 is applicable. Assuming the nursery school provides lunch 
for the child, no allocation is required between that part of the 
expense which might be considered to be for the lunch as distinguished 
from the expense of assuring the child's protection.

[[Page 297]]

    Example 2. The taxpayer, a single woman, in order to be gainfully 
employed employs a housekeeper who cares for the taxpayer's two 
children, aged 9 and 13 years, respectively, in addition to performing 
regular household duties of cleaning and cooking. If it is assumed that 
the compensation paid to the housekeeper is $1,200 during the year, and 
that $500 is allocated to the care of the children, a deduction of $500 
is allowed under section 214. No allocation is required for purposes of 
determining which part of the $500 is for the care of the 9 year old 
child. If the expenses allocable to the care of the children were $700, 
the amount of the deduction would be $600, the maximum amount allowable 
for one dependent.
    Example 3. The taxpayer, a single woman, has a dependent grandchild 
10 years of age who has been attending public school. The taxpayer who 
has been working part time is offered a position involving full-time 
employment which she can accept only if arrangements are made for the 
care of the child from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Such arrangements are made at 
a private school to which she sends the child. The expenses paid to the 
school are for the care of the child without allocation between that 
part of the expense which represents tuition and that part which 
represents true care. The expense is considered to be incurred for the 
purpose of enabling the taxpayer to be gainfully employed.
    Example 4. The taxpayer, a widow with a substantial income, has a 
child aged 11 who has been attending boarding school for several years. 
The taxpayer, who has been performing gratuitous services for a 
philanthropic organization, accepts a part-time job with the 
organization for which she is paid a small salary. From these facts it 
would appear that the expense of continuing the child in the boarding 
school is not for the purpose of enabling the taxpayer to be gainfully 
employed, whether or not the expense is considered to be incurred for 
the care of the child.
    Example 5. The taxpayer, a widower, has a child who is physically 
incapable of caring for himself. In order to be gainfully employed the 
taxpayer sends the child to a school for children who are physically 
handicapped. The expense of the school, whether a day school or a 
boarding school, is a child care expense.
    Example 6. The taxpayer, a single woman, lives with her mother who 
is an invalid incapable of caring for herself. In order to be gainfully 
employed the taxpayer hires a practical nurse whose sole duty consists 
of providing for the care of the mother while the taxpayer is at work. 
The expense paid to the nurse may be a ``child care'' expense.

    (g) Expenses qualifying under section 213. (1) An expense which may 
constitute an amount otherwise deductible under section 213, relating to 
medical, etc., expenses, may also, as in example (6) of paragraph (f) of 
this section, constitute an expense for which a deduction is allowable 
under section 214. In such a case, that part of the amount for which a 
deduction is allowed under section 214 shall not be treated as an 
expense under section 213.
    (2) On the other hand, where an amount is treated as a medical 
expense under section 213 for purposes of determining the amount 
deductible under that section, it shall not be allowed as a deduction 
under section 214.
    (3) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. W, a single woman, pays $720 during the taxable year for 
the care of her child who suffers from infantile paralysis. It is 
assumed that the expenses are of a nature which qualify as medical 
expenses under section 213. It is also assumed that these expenses are 
for the purpose of permitting W to be gainfully employed. W's adjusted 
gross income for the taxable year is $5,000. She is allowed a deduction 
of $600 for child care expenses under section 214. The balance of the 
expenses, or $120, she treats as medical expenses. However, this amount 
does not exceed 3 percent of her adjusted gross income and is thus not 
allowable as a deduction under section 213.
    Example 2. It would not be proper in the case presented in (1) for W 
first to determine under section 213 her deductible medical expenses 
(which would be $570 ($720 less 3%  x  $5,000)), and then claim as a 
deduction under section 214 the $150 which is not deductible under 
section 213. The $150 would be disallowed under section 214 for the 
reason that it was treated as a medical expense in determining the 
amount deductible under section 213.
    Example 3. W, a single woman under the age of 65 years, is also the 
head of a household. She pays $12,000 during the taxable year for child 
care expenses which also qualify as medical expenses under section 213. 
W's adjusted gross income for the taxable year is $18,000. She is 
allowed a deduction of $600 for child care expenses under section 214. 
The balance, or $11,400, is treated as medical expenses. The allowable 
deduction under section 213 for such expenses is the excess of 3 percent 
of W's adjusted gross income, or $10,860, but subject to the maximum 
limitation in section 213.

<R05>
Sec. 1.214A-1   Certain expenses to enable individuals to be gainfully employed incurred during taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971, and before 
          January 1, 1976.

    (a) In general. (1) For expenses incurred during taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1971, and before January 1, 1976, section 
214 allows (subject to the requirements of this section and 
Secs. 1.214A-2 through 1.214A-5) a deduction for employment-related 
expenses (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) which are paid 
during the taxable year by an individual who maintains a household 
(within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this section) that includes as a 
member one or more qualifying individuals (as defined in paragraph (b) 
of this section). The deduction for expenses allowed under section 214 
may be taken only as an itemized deduction and may not be taken into 
account in determining adjusted gross income under section 62. No 
deduction shall be allowed under section 214 in respect of any expenses 
incurred during a taxable year beginning after March 29, 1975, and 
before January 1, 1976, for which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income 
is $44,600 or more (or incurred during a taxable year beginning after 
December 31, 1971, and before March 30, 1975, for which the taxpayer's 
adjusted gross income is $27,600 or more). Expenses which are taken into 
account in determining the deduction under section 214:
    (i) Must first be reduced by that amount by which a disabled 
dependent's (age 15 or over) adjusted gross income and nontaxable 
disability payments for the taxable year exceed $750 or by the total 
amount of a disabled spouse's nontaxable disability payments (see 
section 214(e)(5) and Sec. 1.214A-3),
    (ii) Are then disallowed to the extent that, for any calendar month, 
they exceed $400, determined after taking into account the $200 (or 
more) per calendar-month limitation on the amount of expenses incurred 
outside the household for the care of a dependent (or dependents) under 
the age of 15 (see section 214(c)(1) and (2) and Sec. 1.214A-2 (a) and 
(b)), and
    (iii) Finally, when the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the 
taxable year exceeds the sum of $35,000 (or $18,000 in the case of a 
taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971, and before March 30, 
1975), must be further reduced, on a monthly basis, by one-half of the 
amount by which the adjusted gross income for the calendar year exceeds 
such sum (see section 214(d) and Sec. 1.214A-2(c)).
    (2) The deduction for employment-related expenses is allowable only 
for such expenses as are actually paid during the taxable year 
regardless of when the event which occasions the expenses occurs and of 
the taxpayer's method of accounting. If such expenses are incurred but 
not paid during the taxable year, no deduction may be taken for such 
year. Thus, if such an expense is incurred in the last month of a 
taxable year but not paid until the following taxable year, a deduction 
for such expense shall not be allowed for the earlier taxable year. 
However, if the requirements for deductibility, other than payment, are 
satisfied in the last month of the taxable year, and the item is paid in 
the following taxable year, a deduction is allowed under section 214 for 
such following taxable year.
    (3) The requirements of section 214, this section, and Secs. 1.214A-
2 through 1.214A-5 are to be applied to such expenses as of the time 
they are incurred regardless of when they are paid.
    (4) For special rules relating to the deduction of employment-
related expenses which may also qualify as medical expenses deductible 
under section 213, see Sec. 1.214A-5(b).
    (5) For substantiation of the deduction, see paragraph (e) of this 
section.
    (b) Qualifying individual--(1) In general. A person is considered to 
be a qualifying individual if he is either (i) the taxpayer's dependent 
who is under the age of 15 and is an individual for whom the taxpayer is 
entitled to a deduction for a personal exemption under section 151(e); 
(ii) the taxpayer's dependent (not described in subdivision (i)) who is 
physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself; or (iii) the 
taxpayer's spouse who is physically or mentally incapable of caring for 
himself. The term dependent, as used in this subparagraph, includes any 
individual who is a dependent within the meaning of section 152. For the 
rules

[[Page 299]]

for determining which parent may claim a child as a dependent where the 
parents are divorced, legally separated, or separated under a written 
separation agreement, see section 152(e) and the regulations thereunder.
    (2) Qualification on a daily basis. The status of a person as a 
qualifying individual will be determined on a daily basis. Thus, if a 
dependent or spouse of a taxpayer ceases to be a qualifying individual 
on September 16, the dependent or spouse will be treated as a qualifying 
individual through September 15 only.
    (3) Physical or mental incapacity. An individual will be considered 
to be physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself if as a 
result of a physical or mental defect he is incapable of caring for his 
hygienical or nutritional needs, or requires full time attention of 
another person for his own safety or the safety of others. The fact that 
an individual, by reason of a physical or mental defect, is unable to 
engage in any substantial gainful activity, or is unable to perform the 
normal household functions of a homemaker or to care for minor children, 
will not of itself establish that the individual is physically or 
mentally incapable of caring for himself. An individual who is 
physically handicapped or is mentally defective, and for such reason 
requires constant attention of another person, is considered to be 
physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself.
    (c) Employment-related expenses--(1) Gainful employment--(i) In 
general. Expenses are considered to be employment-related expenses only 
if they are incurred to enable the taxpayer to be gainfully employed and 
are paid for household services or for the care of one or more 
qualifying individuals. The expenses must be incurred while the taxpayer 
is gainfully employed or is in active search of gainful employment. The 
employment may consist of service either within or without the home of 
the taxpayer and may include self-employment. Unpaid volunteer work or 
work for a nominal salary does not constitute qualifying employment. An 
expense will not be considered to be employment-related merely because 
it is incurred while the taxpayer is gainfully employed. Whether the 
purpose of the expense is to enable the taxpayer to be gainfully 
employed depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular 
case. Thus, the fact that the cost of providing care for a qualifying 
individual is greater than the amounts anticipated to be received from 
the employment of the taxpayer may indicate that the purpose of the 
expenditure is other than to permit the taxpayer to be gainfully 
employed. Any tax required to be paid by the taxpayer under section 3111 
(relating to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act) in respect of any 
wages which otherwise constitute employment-related expenses shall be 
considered to be an employment-related expense.
    (ii) Determination of period of employment on a daily basis. An 
allocation of expenses is required on a daily basis when such expenses 
cover any period during part of which the taxpayer is gainfully employed 
or is in active search of gainful employment and during the other part 
of which there is no employment or active search for gainful employment. 
Thus, for example, if a taxpayer incurs during each month of the taxable 
year $60 of expenses which would be employment-related if he were 
gainfully employed all year, and the taxpayer is gainfully employed, or 
in active search of gainful employment, for only 2 months and 10 days 
during such year, the amount of employment-related expenses is limited 
to $140. If a taxpayer is married, both he and his spouse must be 
gainfully employed on a substantially full-time basis (see Sec. 1.214A-
4(b)). However, certain married individuals living apart are treated as 
not married for this purpose (see Sec. 1.214A-4(c)).
    (2) Household services. Expenses will be considered to be paid for 
household services if they are paid for the performance in and about the 
taxpayer's home of ordinary and usual services necessary to the 
maintenance of the household. However, expenses will not be considered 
as paid for household services unless the expenses are attributable in 
part to the care of the qualifying individual. Thus, amounts paid for 
the services of a domestic maid or cook will be considered to be 
expenses paid for household services if a part of

[[Page 300]]

those services is provided to the qualifying individual. Amounts paid 
for the services of an individual who is employed as a chauffeur, 
bartender, or gardener, however, will not be considered to be expenses 
paid for household services.
    (3) Care of qualifying individual--(i) In general. The primary 
purpose of expenses for the care of a qualifying individual must be to 
assure that individual's well-being and protection. Not all benefits 
bestowed upon such an individual will be considered as provided for his 
care. Accordingly, amounts paid to provide food, clothing, or education 
are not expenses paid for the care of a qualifying individual. However, 
where the manner of providing care is such that the expense which is 
incurred includes expense for other benefits which are inseparably a 
part of the care, the full amount of the expense will be considered to 
be incurred for care. Thus, for example, the full amount paid to a 
nursery school in which a qualifying child is enrolled will be 
considered to be for the care of the child, even though the school also 
furnishes lunch, recreational activities, and other benefits. 
Educational expenses incurred for a child in the first or higher grade 
level are not expenses incurred for the care of one or more qualifying 
individuals. Expenses incurred for transportation of a qualifying 
individual described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section between the 
taxpayer's household and a place outside the taxpayer's household where 
services for the care of such qualifying individual are provided will 
not be considered to be incurred for the care of such qualifying 
individual.
    (ii) Manner of providing care. The manner of providing the care need 
not be the least expensive alternative available to the taxpayer. For 
example, the taxpayer's mother may reside at the taxpayer's home and be 
available to provide adequate care at no cost for the taxpayer's wife 
who is physically or mentally incapable of caring for herself. 
Nevertheless, the expenses incurred in providing a nurse for the wife 
may be an expense for the care of the wife. See, however, paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section with respect to the requirement that the 
expense must be for the purpose of permitting the taxpayer to be 
gainfully employed.
    (4) Allocation of expenses. Where a portion of an expense is for 
household services or for the care of a qualifying individual and a 
portion of such expense is for other unrelated purposes, a reasonable 
allocation must be made and only the portion of the expense paid which 
is attributable to such household services or care will be considered to 
be an employment-related expense. No such allocation is required to be 
made, however, if the portion of expense for the unrelated purpose is 
minimal or insignificant. Such an allocation must be made, for example, 
if a servant performs household duties, cares for the children of the 
taxpayer, and also performs social services for the taxpayer (for which 
a deduction is not allowable) and clerical services in the office of the 
taxpayer outside the home (for which a deduction may be allowable under 
section 162). Since a household service expense may be considered 
employment-related in its entirety even though it is only in part 
attributable to the care of a qualifying individual, no allocation is 
required between the part of the household service expense which is 
attributable to that care of a qualifying individual and that part which 
is not so attributable.
    (5) Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. The taxpayer lives with her mother who is physically 
incapable of caring for herself. In order to be gainfully employed the 
taxpayer hires a practical nurse whose sole duty consists of providing 
for the care of the mother in the home while the taxpayer is at work. 
All amounts spent for the services of the nurse are employment-related 
expenses.
    Example 2. The taxpayer has a dependent child 10 years of age who 
has been attending public school. The taxpayer who has been working part 
time is offered a position involving full-time employment which she can 
accept only if the child is placed in a boarding school. The taxpayer 
accepts the position, and the child is sent to a boarding school. The 
expenses paid to the school must be allocated between that part of the 
expenses which represents care for the child and that part which 
represents tuition for

[[Page 301]]

education. The part of the expense representing care of the child is 
considered to be incurred for the purpose of permitting the taxpayer to 
be gainfully employed.
    Example 3. The taxpayer, in order to be gainfully employed, employs 
a housekeeper who cares for the taxpayer's two children, aged 9 and 15 
years, respectively, performs regular household services of cleaning and 
cooking, and chauffeurs the taxpayer to and from his place of 
employment. The chauffeuring service never requires more than 30 minutes 
out of the total period of employment each day. No allocation is 
required for purposes of determining the portion of the expense 
attributable to the chauffeuring (not a household service expense) since 
it is de minimis. Further, no allocation is required for the purpose of 
determining the portion of the expense attributable to the care of the 
15 year old child (not a qualifying individual) since the household 
expense is in part attributable to the care of the 9 year old child, who 
is a qualifying individual. Accordingly, the entire expense of employing 
the housekeeper is an employment-related expense.

    (d) Maintenance of a household--(1) In general. An individual is 
considered to have maintained a household for his taxable year (or 
lesser period) only if he (and his spouse if he is married) have 
furnished over one-half of the cost incurred for such taxable year (or 
lesser period) in maintaining the household. The household must actually 
constitute for the taxable year the principal place of abode of the 
taxpayer and the qualifying individual or individuals described in 
paragraph (b) of this section. It is not sufficient that the taxpayer 
maintain the household without being its occupant. A physical change in 
the location of the home will not, however, prevent the home from 
constituting the principal place of abode of the taxpayer and a 
qualifying individual. The fact that an individual is born or dies 
during the taxable year will not prevent a home from constituting his 
principal place of abode for such year. An individual will not be 
considered to have terminated a household as his principal place of 
abode merely by reason of temporary absences therefrom by reason of 
illness, education, business, vacation, military service, or a custody 
agreement.
    (2) Two or more families. Solely for purposes of section 214 and 
this section, if two or more families occupy living quarters in common, 
each of such families will be treated as constituting a separate 
household, and the taxpayer who provides more than one-half of the costs 
of maintaining such a separate household will be treated as maintaining 
such household. Thus, for example, if two unrelated women each with 
children occupy living quarters in common and each woman pays more than 
one-half of her proportionate share of household costs incurred by both 
families, each woman will be treated as maintaining her separate 
household.
    (3) Costs of maintaining a household. The cost of maintaining a 
household shall be the expenses incurred for the mutual benefit of the 
occupants thereof by reason of its operation as the principal place of 
abode of such occupants. The expenses of maintaining a household include 
property taxes, mortgage interest, rent, utility charges, upkeep and 
repairs, property insurance, and food consumed on the premises. Such 
expenses do not include the cost of clothing, education, medical 
treatment, vacations, life insurance, or transportation or payments on 
mortgage principal or for the purchase, permanent improvement, 
betterment, or replacement of property. However, the cost of maintaining 
a household shall not include any amount which represents the value of 
services performed in the household by the taxpayer or by a qualifying 
individual described in paragraph (b) of this section. Expenses incurred 
in respect of which money or other property is received as compensation 
or reimbursement may not be included as a cost of maintaining a 
household.
    (4) Monthly proration of annual costs. In determining the cost 
incurred for a period of less than a taxable year in maintaining a 
household, the cost incurred during the entire taxable year must be 
prorated on the basis of the number of calendar months within such 
lesser period. For this purpose a period of less than a calendar month 
will be treated as a calendar month. Thus, for example, if the cost of 
maintaining a household for a taxable year is $6,600, and the period in 
respect of which a determination is being made under section 214 is from 
June 20 to December 31, the taxpayer must furnish more than $1,925 
([$6,600 x 7/12] x 50%) in

[[Page 302]]

maintaining the household from June 1 to December 31.
    (e) Substantiation. A taxpayer claiming a deduction under paragraph 
(a) of this section for employment-related expenses must substantiate by 
adequate records or other sufficient evidence any deductions taken under 
this section. For example, if requested, the taxpayer must furnish 
information as to the nature and period of the physical or mental 
incapacitation of any dependent or spouse in respect of whom a deduction 
is claimed, including necessary information from the attending physician 
as to the nature of the physical or mental incapacity.

[T.D. 7411, 41 FR 5405, Apr. 13, 1976, as amended by T.D. 7643, 44 FR 
50337, Aug. 28, 1979]


<R05>
Sec. 1.214A-2   Limitations on deductible amounts.

    (a) Overall monthly limitation of $400. The deduction under section 
214(a) and Sec. 1.214A-1(a) for employment-related expenses is not 
allowed in respect of any such expenses in excess of $400 incurred 
during any one calendar month. For purposes of the limitation of $400, a 
period of less than a calendar month will be treated as a calendar 
month. Any amount by which employment-related expenses incurred during 
any calendar month exceed $400 may not be carried to another calendar 
month and used in determining the employment-related expenses incurred 
in such other calendar month. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer incurs 
employment-related expenses of $500 during each of the first 6 months of 
the taxable year and only $200 of such expenses during each of the last 
6 months, the amount of his deduction for the payment during such 
taxable year of such expenses shall be limited by this paragraph to 
$3,600, consisting of $2,400 ($400 x 6) incurred during the first 6 
months of the taxable year and $1,200 ($200 x 6) incurred during the 
last 6 months of the taxable year. The limitation provided by this 
paragraph must be applied after making the reduction in the amount of 
employment-related expenses provided by paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.214A-3 
(relating to disability payments) and after the application of the 
limitation upon the amount deductible provided by paragraph (b) of this 
section.
    (b) Restriction to expenses incurred for services in the household--
(1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, deduction shall be allowed under Sec. 1.214 A-1(a) only for 
employment-related expenses incurred for services performed in the 
household of the taxpayer. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer places his 
invalid father in a nursing home, he is not entitled to deduct his 
employment-related expenses incurred for his father's care provided by 
the nursing home. If, however, the taxpayer's father remains in the home 
used as the household, the taxpayer is allowed to deduct his employment-
related expenses attributable to the employment in the household of a 
nurse to care for his father.
    (2) Exception for certain expenses incurred outside the household. A 
deduction shall be allowed under Sec. 1.214A-1(a) for employment-related 
expenses incurred for services performed outside the household of the 
taxpayer only if such expenses are incurred for the care of one or more 
dependents of the taxpayer who are under the age of 15 and who are 
persons for whom the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction for a personal 
exemption under section 151(e). The amount of such expenses incurred 
during a calendar month for services performed outside the household of 
the taxpayer which may be deducted is limited to:
    (i) $200, in the case of one such dependent,
    (ii) $300, in the case of two such dependents, or
    (iii) $400, in the case of three or more such dependents.

For purposes of the limitation under this subparagraph, a period of less 
than a calendar month will be treated as a calendar month. Any amount 
which is taken into account after the application of such limitation is 
also subject to the monthly limitation of $400 provided by paragraph (a) 
of this section.
    (3) Illustrations. The application of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. If during a calendar month a taxpayer incurs employment-
related expenses of $150 for services performed within his household and 
$300 for services performed outside the household for the care of his

[[Page 303]]

child, age 5, the taxpayer is entitled to deduct only $350 of such 
expenses. In such case the $300 for services performed outside the 
household is limited to $200 by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    Example 2. If the facts are the same as in example (1) except that 
during the month the taxpayer incurs employment-related expenses of $250 
for services performed within his household, the taxpayer is entitled to 
deduct only $400 of the total expenses incurred. In such case the total 
expenses incurred during the month which may be taken into account 
($450) are limited to $400 by paragraph (a) of this section.

    (c) Taxpayer's income limitation--(1) In general. This paragraph 
applies only if the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer for the 
taxable year exceeds the amount of $35,000, in the case of a taxable 
year beginning after March 29, 1975, and before January 1, 1976 (or the 
amount of $18,000 in the case of a taxable year beginning after December 
31, 1971, and before March 30, 1975). In either case, in determining the 
deduction allowable under Sec. 1.214A-1(a) for employment-related 
expenses, the amount of such expenses incurred during any calendar month 
of the taxable year must be reduced by an amount equal to the excess of 
the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year over the 
applicable income limitation ($35,000 or $18,000 as the case may be) 
divided by twice the number of calendar months in the taxable year. For 
purposes of applying the taxpayer's income limitation a period of less 
than a calendar month will be treated as a calendar month. The 
limitation provided by this paragraph must be applied after making the 
reduction in the amount of employment-related expenses provided by 
paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.214A-3 and after the application of the 
limitations upon the amount deductible provided by paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 1.214A-3 and after the application of the limitations upon the 
amount deductible provided by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. 
The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. A, a single individual who uses the fiscal year ending 
March 31 as the taxable year, incurs (and pays) during May 1975 
employment-related expenses of $600. He has adjusted gross income of 
$41,000 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1976. Under these 
circumstances the amount of employment-related expenses for the month of 
May 1975 which may be taken into account under paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 1.214A-1 is $150, determined as follows:

Employment-related expenses incurred during May ($600, but              
 not to exceed $400 under par. (a) of this section)..........       $400
                                                              ==========

    Excess divided by twice the number of calendar months in            
     taxable year ($6,000+[2 x 12])..........................        250

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1) except that A 
incurs employment-related expenses of only $200 during May 1975. Under 
these circumstances no amount of employment-related expenses may be 
taken into account for the month of May under paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 1.214A-1 because the expenses of $200 for the month are fully 
offset by the reduction of $250 required under this subparagraph.
    Example 3. B, a single individual who uses the calendar year as the 
taxable year, incurs and pays during June, 1975, employment-related 
expenses of $500. On August 31, 1975, B dies. His adjusted gross income 
for the taxable year ending August 31 is $22,800. Under such 
circumstances the amount of employment-related expenses for the month of 
June which may be taken into account under paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.214A-
1 is $100, determined as follows:

Employment-related expenses incurred during June ($500, but             
 not to exceed $400 under par. (a) of this sec.).............       $400

    Excess adjusted gross income over income limitation......      4,800

    Excess divided by twice the number of calendar months in            
     taxable year ($4,800+[2 x 8])...........................        300
Employment-related expenses to be taken into account.........        100
                                                                        

    (2) Marital status. For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer for his taxable year 
shall include the adjusted gross income of his spouse for such year if 
he is married for the entire

[[Page 304]]

taxable year. If the taxpayer is married during only a part of his 
taxable year, his adjusted gross income for the taxable year shall 
include the adjusted gross income of his spouse for only such period 
within the taxable year during which he is married. Thus, if the 
taxpayer and his wife use the calendar year as the taxable year and the 
taxpayer's wife dies on May 15 and he does not remarry before the close 
of his taxable year, the adjusted gross income of the wife for the 
period from January 1 to May 15 must be included in applying the income 
limitation for the taxable year under section 214(d) and paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section. If, however, in such case the taxpayer were to 
remarry on October 15 of his taxable year and file a single return 
jointly with the second wife, the adjusted gross income of the first 
wife for the period from January 1 to May 15 and the adjusted gross 
income of the second wife for the period from October 15 to December 31 
must be included in applying the income limitation for the taxable year 
under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1.214A-3   Reduction of expenses for certain disability payments and adjusted gross income.

    (a) Amount of reduction. This section applies only if the taxpayer 
incurs employment-related expenses during a taxable year solely 
attributable to a qualifying individual who is either a dependent (other 
than a dependent described in Sec. 1.214A-1(b)(1)(i)) of the taxpayer or 
a spouse of the taxpayer and who is physically or mentally incapable of 
caring for himself. The amount of such expenses, which may be taken into 
account under section 214 shall be reduced:
    (1) In the case of such expenses attributable to a dependent who is 
physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself, by the excess, 
if any, over $750 of the sum of (i) such dependent's adjusted gross 
income for such taxable year and (ii) the disability payments (as 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section) he receives during such year, 
and
    (2) In the case of such expenses attributable to a spouse who is 
physically or mentally incapable of caring for himself, by the 
disability payments (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) such 
spouse receives during such taxable year.

The reduction so required must be made on the basis of a calendar month. 
Thus, the employment-related expenses attributable to a spouse which are 
incurred during any calendar month of the taxable year must be reduced 
by an amount equal to the disability payments received by the spouse 
during such taxable year divided by the number of calendar months 
therein during which such employment-related expenses are incurred. 
Further, the employment-related expenses attributable to a dependent 
which are incurred during any calendar month of the taxable year must be 
reduced by an amount equal to the excess described in paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section divided by the number of calendar months therein during 
which such employment-related expenses are incurred. For purposes of 
this reduction, a period of less than a calendar month will be treated 
as a calendar month. The reduction is not required to be made in respect 
of any employment-related expenses solely attributable to a dependent 
under the age of 15 for whom the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction for 
a personal exemption under section 151(e). The reduction required by 
this paragraph must be made before applying the limitations under 
section 214 (c) and (d) and Sec. 1.214A-2 for the taxable year. The 
application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. A, a taxpayer who uses the calendar year as the taxable 
year, incurs $250 of employment-related expenses during each month of 
1972 for services within his household. B, his wife, is physically 
incapable of caring for herself. During 1972, B receives total 
disability payments of $1,200, consisting of a lump-sum disability 
payment of $300 received in June and disability payments of $75 received 
each month. Under such circumstances, A may take into account $150 of 
his employment-related expenses for each month of 1972, determined as 
follows:

Employment-related expenses attributable to B incurred during           
 each month..................................................       $250

Less: Disability payments received by B in 1972 divided by              
 number of calendar months in 1972 during which employment-             
 related expenses attributable to B are incurred

    Example 2. B, a single individual who uses the calendar year as the 
taxable year, incurs $200 of employment-related expenses during each 
month of 1972 for services within his household. C, his son aged 15, is 
physically incapable of caring for himself. During 1972, C receives 
total disability payments of $1,200, consisting of a lump-sum disability 
payment of $300 received in June and disability payments of $75 received 
each month. For 1972, C has adjusted gross income of $1,050. Under such 
circumstances, B may take into account $75 of his employment-related 
expenses for each month of 1972, determined as follows:

Employment-related expenses attributable to C incurred during           
 each month..................................................       $200

    Example 3. H, a taxpayer who uses the calendar year as the taxable 
year, incurs employment-related expenses attributable to W, his wife, 
during five months of 1972, including $350 for the month of July, for 
services within his household. W, who is physically incapable of caring 
for herself, receives during 1972 total disability payments of $625. 
Under such circumstances, H may take into account $225 of his 
employment-related expenses for July, determined as follows:

Employment-related expenses attributable to W incurred during           
 July........................................................       $350
Less: Disability payments received by W in 1972 divided by

    Example 4. S, a single individual who uses the calendar year as the 
taxable year, incurs and pays during 1972 $450 of employment-related 
expenses attributable to P, his father, for each of the six months 
during which his father is incapacitated. During 1972, P receives 
adjusted gross income of $1,266, a gift of $300, and a disability 
payment of $55 for each month of disability. During 1972 S receives 
adjusted gross income of less than $18,000. Under such circumstances, S 
may deduct $1,854 for 1972 under section 214, determined as follows:

Employment-related expenses attributable to P incurred during           
 each month of his incapacity................................       $450

    (b) Disability payment defined. For purposes of paragraph (a) of 
this section, the term disability payment means any payment not 
includible in gross income which is made on account of the physical or 
mental incapacity of an individual. A disability payment may include 
social security payments, State or local payments, private disability 
insurance payments, or payments from a private person on account of a 
civil wrong, if attributable to the mental or physical disability of the 
individual. Gifts are not considered to be disability payments for 
purposes of this paragraph.
    (c) Expenses not solely attributable. An employment-related expense 
which is not solely attributable to a qualifying individual to whom 
paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section applies shall not be reduced 
under this section. Thus, for example, if household expenses are 
incurred with respect to a qualifying individual to whom paragraph (a) 
(1) or (2) of this section applies and also with respect to a qualifying 
dependent under the age of 15, such expenses shall not be considered to 
be solely attributable to a qualifying individual to whom

[[Page 306]]

paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section applies, and such expenses 
shall not be reduced under this section. The application of this 
paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A taxpayer has a child, aged 6, and his spouse is 
physically incapable of caring for herself. During the taxable year he 
incurs employment-related expenses of $500 solely attributable to the 
care of the child, of $1,000 solely attributable to the care of his 
spouse, and of $1,500 for household services attributable to both the 
child and spouse. Of the taxpayer's total employment-related expenses of 
$3,000, only the $1,000 solely attributable to his spouse must be 
reduced as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
    Example 2. A taxpayer has a dependent, aged 15, and a spouse both of 
whom are physically incapable of caring for themselves. During the 
taxable year he incurs employment-related expenses of $500 solely 
attributable to the care of the dependent, of $1,000 solely attributable 
to the care of his spouse, and of $1,500 for household services equally 
attributable to both the dependent and spouse. The $1,500 of household 
expenses must be allocated one-half to the dependent and one-half to the 
spouse. Accordingly, employment-related expenses of $1,250 are 
attributable to the dependent, and employment-related expenses of $1,750 
are attributable to the spouse. The expenses attributable to each must 
be reduced as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (d) Ordering of reductions and limitations. For purposes of 
determining the amount of employment-related expenses which may be taken 
into account under section 214, the employment-related expenses incurred 
by the taxpayer during any calendar month of the taxable year are first 
to be reduced by the amount of reduction determined under section 
214(e)(5) and paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section in respect of 
disability payments and adjusted gross income, then by the outside-of-
household limitation prescribed by section 214(c)(2)(B) and Sec. 1.214A-
2(b)(2), then by the overall monthly limitation of $400 prescribed by 
section 214(c)(1) and Sec. 1.214A-2(a), and finally by the taxpayer's 
income limitation ($35,000 or $18,000, as the case may be) prescribed by 
section 214(d) and Sec. 1.214A-2(c), in that order. The application of 
this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. The taxpayer's wife is physically incapable of caring for 
herself. He incurs employment-related expenses of $1,000 during the 
calendar month for services within the household. Disability payments of 
the wife applicable to such month under paragraph (a)(2) of this section 
amount to $350. The taxpayer's excess adjusted gross income (over the 
taxpayer's income limitation) applicable to such month under 
Sec. 1.214A-2(c)(1) amounts to $300. Under such circumstances, the 
amount of employment-related expenses for such month which may be taken 
into account for purposes of section 214 is $100, determined as follows:

Employment-related expenses..................................     $1,000
  Less: Reduction under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.....        350

 related expenses of $650, but not to exceed $400)...........        400
Less: Reduction under Sec.  1.214A-2(c)(1)...................        300

    Example 2. The taxpayer's child, aged 15, is physically incapable of 
caring for himself the taxpayer incurs employment-related expenses of 
$487 duing June for services within the household. The excess of the 
adjusted gross income and disability payments of the dependent child for 
the taxable year (over the $750 limitation) applicable to June under 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section amounts to $112. The taxpayer's excess 
adjusted gross income (over the taxpayer's income limitation) applicable 
to June under Sec. 1.214A-2(c)(1) amounts to $125. Under such 
circumstances, the amount of employment-related expenses for June which 
may be taken into account for purposes of section 214 is $250, 
determined as follows:

Employment-related expenses..................................       $487
Less: Reduction under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.......        112

Sec. 1.214A-4   Special rules applicable to married individuals.

    (a) Joint return requirement. This section applies only if the 
taxpayer is married at the close of a taxable year in which employment-
related expenses are paid. In such a case the deduction provided by 
section 214(a) and Sec. 1.214A-1(a) for such expenses shall be allowed 
only if for such taxable year the taxpayer files a single return jointly 
with

[[Page 307]]

his spouse. If either spouse dies during the taxable year and a joint 
return may be made for such year under section 6013(a)(2) for the 
survivor and the deceased spouse, the deduction shall be allowed for 
such year only if a joint return is made. If, however, the surviving 
spouse remarries before the end of his taxable year in which his first 
spouse dies, a deduction is allowed under section 214(a) on the separate 
return which is made for the decedent spouse. For purposes of this 
section, certain married individuals living apart are treated as not 
married, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
    (b) Gainful employment requirement--(1) In general. The employment-
related expenses incurred during any month of any period within the 
taxable year of a taxpayer who is married for such period shall be taken 
into account under section 214(a) and Sec. 1.214A-1(a) only if both the 
taxpayer and his spouse are gainfully employed on a substantially full-
time basis or are in active search of gainful employment on a 
substantially full-time basis, or if his spouse is physically or 
mentally incapable of caring for herself. For such purposes, an 
individual is considered to be gainfully employed on a substantially 
full-time basis if he is employed for three-quarters or more of the 
normal or customary work week (or the equivalent on the average during a 
month).
    (2) Determination of qualifying periods on a daily basis. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the determination as to whether an 
individual is gainfully employed on a substantially full-time basis 
shall be made on a daily basis in accordance with the provisions of 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of Sec. 1.214A-1, and the determination as to 
whether a spouse is physically or mentally incapable of caring for 
himself shall be made on a daily basis in accordance with paragraph 
(b)(2) of such section. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer is gainfully 
employed throughout the taxable year on a substantially full-time basis 
but his spouse ceases on August 17 of such year to be employed on a 
substantially full-time basis and on November 16 of the same year 
becomes physically or mentally incapable of caring for herself, an 
allocation must be made to determine the period ending on August 17 
during which both spouses are gainfully employed on a substantially 
full-time basis, and the incapacitated spouse is to be treated as a 
qualifying individual described in section 214(b)(1)(C) only for the 
period commencing with November 16. Employment-related expenses incurred 
from August 18 through November 15 may not be taken into account since 
only one spouse is gainfully employed on a substantially full-time basis 
during such period and the other spouse is not physically or mentally 
incapable of caring for herself during such period.
    (c) Certain married individuals living apart. For purposes of 
section 214 an individual who for his taxable year would be treated as 
not married under section 143(a)(2), or would be treated as not married 
under section 143(b) if paragraph (1) of such section referred to any 
dependent of the taxpayer (and not simply to a son, stepson, daughter, 
or stepdaughter of such individual), shall be treated as not married for 
such taxable year. Thus, an individual who is married within the meaning 
of section 143(a) will be treated as not married for his entire taxable 
year for purposes of section 214, if:
    (1) He files a separate return for such year,
    (2) He maintains as his home a household which constitutes for more 
than one-half of such year the principal place of abode of one or more 
of his dependents with respect to whom he is entitled to a deduction 
under section 151 for such year,
    (3) He furnishes over one-half of the cost of maintaining such 
household for such year, and
    (4) His spouse is not a member of such household for any part of 
such year.

Thus, for example, an individual who is married during the taxable year 
and is living apart from his spouse, but is not legally separated under 
a decree of divorce or separate maintenance, may, if he is treated as 
not married by reason of this paragraph, determine the limitation upon 
the amount of his employment-related expenses without taking into 
account the adjusted gross income of his spouse under Sec. 1.214A-
2(c)(2),

[[Page 308]]

without complying with the requirement under paragraph (a) of this 
section for filing a joint return with his spouse, and without complying 
with the requirement under paragraph (b) of this section that his spouse 
be gainfully employed. The principles of Sec. 1.143-1(b) shall apply in 
making determinations under this paragraph.

[T.D. 7411, 41 FR 15409, Apr. 13, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 1.214A-5   Other special rules relating to employment-related expenses.

    (a) Payments to related individuals. No deduction will be allowed 
under section 214(a) and Sec. 1.214A-1(a) for the amount of any 
employment-related expenses paid by the taxpayer to an individual who 
bears to the taxpayer any relationship described in section 152(a) (1) 
through (8). These relationships are those of a son or daughter or 
descendant thereof; a stepson or stepdaughter; a brother, sister, 
stepbrother, or stepsister; a father or mother or an ancestor of either; 
a stepfather or stepmother; a nephew or niece; an uncle or aunt; or a 
son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-
law, or sister-in-law. In addition, no deduction will be allowed under 
section 214(a) for the amount of any employment-related expenses paid by 
the taxpayer to an individual who qualifies as a dependent of the 
taxpayer for the taxable year within the meaning of section 152(a)(9), 
which relates to an individual (other than the taxpayer's spouse) whose 
principal place of abode for the taxable year is the home of the 
taxpayer and who is a member of the taxpayer's household.
    (b) Expenses qualifying as medical expenses. An expense which may 
constitute an amount otherwise deductible under section 213, relating to 
medical, etc., expenses, may also constitute an expense for which a 
deduction is allowable under section 214(a) and Sec. 1.214A-1(a). In 
such a case, that part of the amount for which a deduction is allowed 
under section 214(a) will not be considered as an expense allowable as a 
deduction under section 213. On the other hand, where an amount is 
treated as a medical expense under section 213 for purposes of 
determining the amount deductible under that section, it may not be 
treated as an employment-related expense for purposes of section 214. 
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. A Taxpayer pays $520 of employment-related expenses in 
the taxable year for the care of his child during one month of such year 
when the child is physically incapable of caring for himself. These 
expenses are incurred for services performed in the taxpayer's household 
and are of a nature which qualify as medical expenses under section 213. 
The taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year is $5,000. Of 
the total expenses, the taxpayer may take $400 into account under 
section 214; the balance of the expenses, or $120, may be treated as 
medical expenses to which section 213 applies. However, this amount does 
not exceed 3 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the 
taxable year and is thus not allowable as a deduction under section 213.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1). In such case it 
is not proper for the taxpayer first to determine under section 213 his 
deductible medical expenses of $370 ($520--[$5,000 x 3%]) and then claim 
the $150 balance as employment-related expenses for purposes of section 
214. This result is reached because the $150 balance has been treated as 
a medical expense in determining the amount deductible under section 
213.
    Example 3. A taxpayer incurs and pays $1,000 of employment-related 
expenses each month during the taxable year for the care of his child. 
These expenses are incurred for services performed in the taxpayer's 
household, and they also qualify as medical expenses under section 213. 
The taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year is $18,000. No 
reduction in the amount of the expenses is required under Sec. 1.214A-3, 
and the taxpayer takes $4,800 ($400 x 12) of such expenses into account 
under section 214. The balance, or $7,200, he treats as medical expenses 
for purposes of section 213. The allowable deduction under section 213 
for such expenses is limited to the excess of such balance of $7,200 
over $540 (3 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income of 
$18,000), or $6,600.

[T.D. 7411, 41 FR 15410, Apr. 13, 1976]


<R05>
Sec. 1.215-1  Periodic alimony, etc., payments.

    (a) A deduction is allowable under section 215 with respect to 
periodic payments in the nature of, or in lieu of, alimony or an 
allowance for support actually paid by the taxpayer during his taxable 
year and required to be included in the income of the payee wife or 
former wife, as the case may be,

[[Page 309]]

under section 71. As to the amounts required to be included in the 
income of such wife or former wife, see section 71 and the regulations 
thereunder. For definition of husband and wife see section 7701(a) (17).
    (b) The deduction under section 215 is allowed only to the obligor 
spouse. It is not allowed to an estate, trust, corporation, or any other 
person who may pay the alimony obligation of such obligor spouse. The 
obligor spouse, however, is not allowed a deduction for any periodic 
payment includible under section 71 in the income of the wife or former 
wife, which payment is attributable to property transferred in discharge 
of his obligation and which, under section 71(d) or section 682, is not 
includible in his gross income.
    (c) The following examples, in which both H and W file their income 
tax returns on the basis of a calendar year, illustrate cases in which a 
deduction is or is not allowed under section 215:

    Example 1. Pursuant to the terms of a decree of divorce, H, in 1956, 
transferred securities valued at $100,000 in trust for the benefit of W, 
which fully discharged all his obligations to W. The periodic payments 
made by the trust to W are required to be included in W's income under 
section 71. Such payments are stated in section 71(d) not to be 
includible in H's income and, therefore, under section 215 are not 
deductible from his income.
    Example 2. A decree of divorce obtained by W from H incorporated a 
previous agreement of H to establish a trust, the trustees of which were 
instructed to pay W $5,000 a year for the remainder of her life. The 
court retained jurisdiction to order H to provide further payments if 
necessary for the support of W. In 1956 the trustee paid to W $4,000 
from the income of the trust and $1,000 from the corpus of the trust. 
Under the provisions of sections 71 and 682(b), W would include $5,000 
in her income for 1956. H would not include any part of the $5,000 in 
his income nor take a deduction therefor. If H had paid the $1,000 to W 
pursuant to court order rather than allowing the trustees to pay it out 
of corpus, he would have been entitled to a deduction of $1,000 under 
the provisions of section 215.

    (d) For other examples, see sections 71 and 682 and the regulations 
thereunder.

Sec. 1.215-1T  Alimony, etc., payments (temporary).

    Q-1  What information is required by the Internal Revenue Service 
when an alimony or separate maintenance payment is claimed as a 
deduction by a payor?
    A-1  The payor spouse must include on his/her first filed return of 
tax (Form 1040) for the taxable year in which the payment is made the 
payee's social security number, which the payee is required to furnish 
to the payor. For penalties applicable to a payor spouse who fails to 
include such information on his/her return of tax or to a payee spouse 
who fails to furnish his/her social security number to the payor spouse, 
see section 6676.

<R05>
Sec. 1.216-1   Amounts representing taxes and interest paid to cooperative housing corporation.

    (a) General rule. A tenant-stockholder of a cooperative housing 
corporation may deduct from his gross income amounts paid or accrued 
within his taxable year to a cooperative housing corporation 
representing his proportionate share of:
    (1) The real estate taxes allowable as a deduction to the 
corporation under section 164 which are paid or incurred by the 
corporation before the close of the taxable year of the tenant-
stockholder on the houses (or apartment building) and the land on which 
the houses (or apartment building) are situated, or
    (2) The interest allowable as a deduction to the corporation under 
section 163 which is paid or incurred by the corporation before the 
close of the taxable year of the tenant-stockholder on its indebtedness 
contracted in the acquisition, construction, alteration, rehabilitation, 
or maintenance of the houses (or apartment building), or in the 
acquisition of the land on which the houses (or apartment building) are 
situated.
    (b) Limitation. The deduction allowable under section 216 shall not 
exceed the amount of the tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of the 
taxes and interest described therein. If a tenant-stockholder pays or 
incurs only a part of his proportionate share of such taxes and interest 
to the corporation, only

[[Page 310]]

the amount so paid or incurred which represents taxes and interest is 
allowable as a deduction under section 216. If a tenant-stockholder pays 
an amount, or incurs an obligation for an amount, to the corporation on 
account of such taxes and interest and other items, such as maintenance, 
overhead expenses, and reduction of mortgage indebtedness, the amount 
representing such taxes and interest is an amount which bears the same 
ratio to the total amount of the tenant-stockholder's payment or 
liability, as the case may be, as the total amount of the tenant-
stockholder's proportionate share of such taxes and interest bears to 
the total amount of the tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of the 
taxes, interest, and other items on account of which such payment is 
made or liability incurred. No deduction is allowable under section 216 
for that part of amounts representing the taxes or interest described in 
that section which are deductible by a tenant-stockholder under any 
other provision of the Code.
    (c) Disallowance of deduction for certain payments to the 
corporation. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, no 
deduction shall be allowed to a stockholder during any taxable year for 
any amount paid or accrued to a cooperative housing corporation (in 
excess of the stockholder's proportionate share of the items described 
in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section) which is allocable to 
amounts that are paid or incurred at any time by the cooperative housing 
corporation and which is chargeable to the corporation's capital 
account. Examples of expenditures chargeable to the corporation's 
capital account include the cost of paving a community parking lot, the 
purchase of a new boiler or roof, and the payment of the principal of 
the corporation's building mortgage. The adjusted basis of the 
stockholder's stock in such corporation shall be increased by the amount 
of such disallowance. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following 
example:

    Example. The X corporation is a cooperative housing corporation 
within the meaning of section 216. In 1988 X uses $275,000 that it 
received from its shareholders in such year to purchase and place in 
service a new boiler. The $275,000 will be chargeable to the 
corporation's capital account. A owns 10% of the shares of X and uses in 
a trade or business the dwelling unit appurtenant to A's shares and was 
responsible for paying 10% of the cost of the boiler. A is thus 
responsible for $27,500 of the cost of the boiler, which amount A will 
not be able to deduct currently. A will, however, add the $27,500 to A's 
basis for A's shares in X.

    (d) Tenant-stockholder's proportionate share--(1) General rule. The 
tenant-stockholder's proportionate share is that proportion which the 
stock of the cooperative housing corporation owned by the tenant-
stockholder is of the total outstanding stock of the corporation, 
including any stock held by the corporation. For taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1969, if the cooperative housing corporation had 
issued stock to a governmental unit, as defined in paragraph (g) of this 
section, then in determining the total outstanding stock of the 
corporation, the governmental unit shall be deemed to hold the number of 
shares that it would have held, with respect to the apartments or houses 
it is entitled to occupy, if it had been a tenant-stockholder. That is, 
the number of shares the governmental unit is deemed to hold is 
determined in the same manner as if stock had been issued to it as a 
tenant-stockholder. For example, if a cooperative housing corporation 
requires each tenant-stockholder to buy one share of stock for each one 
thousand dollars of value of the apartment he is entitled to occupy, a 
governmental unit shall be deemed to hold one share of stock for each 
one thousand dollars of value of the apartments it is entitled to 
occupy, regardless of the number of shares formally issued to it.
    (2) Special rule--(i) In general. For taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1986, if a cooperative housing corporation allocates to 
each tenant-stockholder a portion of the real estate taxes or interest 
(or both) that reasonably reflects the cost to the corporation of the 
taxes or interest attributable to each tenant-stockholder's dwelling 
unit (and the unit's share of the common areas), the cooperative housing 
corporation may elect to treat the amounts so allocated as the tenant-
stockholders' proportionate shares.

[[Page 311]]

    (ii) Time and manner of making election. The election referred to in 
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is effective only if, by January 31 
of the year following the first calendar year that includes any period 
to which the election applies, the cooperative housing corporation 
furnishes to each person that is a tenant-stockholder during that period 
a written statement showing the amount of real estate taxes or interest 
(or both) allocated to the tenant-stockholder with respect to the 
tenant-stockholder's dwelling unit or units and share of common areas 
for that period. The election must be made by attaching a statement to 
the corporation's timely filed tax return (taking extensions into 
account) for the first taxable year for which the election is to be 
effective. The statement must contain the name, address, and taxpayer 
identification number of the cooperative housing corporation, identify 
the election as an election under section 216(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Code, 
indicate whether the election is being made with respect to the 
allocation of real estate taxes or interest (or both), and include a 
description of the method of allocation being elected. The election 
applies for the taxable year and succeeding taxable years. It is 
revocable only with the consent of the Commissioner and will be binding 
on all tenant-stockholders.
    (iii) Reasonable allocation. It is reasonable to allocate to each 
tenant-stockholder a portion of the real estate taxes or interest (or 
both) that bears the same ratio to the cooperative housing corporation's 
total interest or real estate taxes as the fair market value of each 
dwelling unit (including the unit's share of the common areas) bears to 
the fair market value of all the dwelling units with respect to which 
stock is outstanding (including stock held by the corporation) at the 
time of allocation. If real estate taxes are separately assessed on each 
dwelling unit by the relevant taxing authority, an allocation of real 
estates taxes to tenant-stockholders based on separate assessments is a 
reasonable allocation. If one or more of the tenant-stockholders prepays 
any portion of the principal of the indebtedness and gives rise to 
interest, an allocation of interest to those tenant-stockholders will be 
a reasonable allocation of interest if the allocation is reduced to 
reflect the reduction in the debt service attributable to the 
prepayment. In addition, similar kinds of allocations may also be 
reasonable, depending on the facts and circumstances.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. The X Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation 
within the meaning of section 216. In 1970, it acquires a building 
containing 40 category A apartments and 25 category B apartments, for 
$750,000. The value of each category A apartment is $12,500, and of each 
category B apartment is $10,000. X values each share of stock issued 
with respect to the category A apartments at $125, and sells 4,000 
shares of its stock, along with the right to occupy the 40 category A 
apartments, to 40 tenant-stockholders for $500,000. X also sells 1,000 
shares of nonvoting stock to G, a State housing authority qualifying as 
a governmental unit under paragraph (f) of this section, for $250,000. 
The purchase of this stock gives G the right to occupy all the category 
B apartments. G is deemed to hold the number of shares that it would 
have held if it had been a tenant-stockholder. G is therefore deemed to 
own 2,000 shares of stock of X. All stockholders are required to pay a 
specified part of the corporation's expenses. F, one of the tenant-
stockholders, purchased 100 shares of the category A stock for $12,500 
in order to obtain a right to occupy a category A apartment. Since there 
are 6,000 total shares deemed outstanding, F's proportionate share is 1/
60 (100/6,000).
    Example 2. The X Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation 
within the meaning of section 216. In 1960 it acquired a housing 
development containing 100 detached houses, each house having the same 
value. X issued one share of stock to each of 100 tenant-stockholders, 
each share carrying the right to occupy one of the houses. In 1971 X 
redeemed 40 of its 100 shares. It then sold to G, a municipal housing 
authority qualifying as a governmental unit under paragraph (f) of this 
section, 1,000 shares of preferred stock and the right to occupy the 40 
houses with respect to which the stock had been redeemed. X sold the 
preferred stock to G for an amount equal to the cost of redeeming the 40 
shares. G also agreed to pay 40 percent of X's expenses. For purposes of 
determining the total stock which X has outstanding, G is deemed to hold 
40 shares of X.
    Example 3. The X Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation 
within the meaning of section 216. In 1987, it acquires for $1,000,000 a 
building containing 10 category A

[[Page 312]]

apartments, 10 category B apartments, and 10 category C apartments. The 
value of each category A apartment is $20,000, of each category B 
apartment is $30,000 and of each category C apartment is $50,000. X 
issues 1 share of stock to each of the 30 tenant-stockholders, each 
share carrying the right to occupy one of the apartments. X allocates 
the real estate taxes and interest to the tenant-stockholders on the 
basis of the fair market value of their respective apartments. Since the 
total fair market value of all of the apartments is $1,000,000, the 
allocation of taxes and interest to each tenant-stockholder that has the 
right to occupy a category A apartment is 2/100 ($20,000/$1,000,000). 
Similarly, the allocation of taxes and interest to each tenant-
stockholder who has a right to occupy a category B apartment is 3/100 
($30,000/$1,000,000) and of a category C apartment is 5/100 ($50,000/
$1,000,000). X may elect in accordance with the rules described in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section to treat the amounts so allocated as 
each tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of real estate taxes and 
interest.
    Example 4. The Y Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation 
within the meaning of section 216. In 1987, it acquires a housing 
development containing 5 detached houses for $1,500,000, incurring an 
indebtedness of $1,000,000 for the purchase of the property. Each house 
is valued at $300,000, although the shares appurtenant to those houses 
have been sold to tenant-stockholders for $100,000. Y issues one share 
of stock to each of the five tenant-stockholders, each share carrying 
the right to occupy one of the houses. A, a tenant-stockholder, prepays 
all of the corporation's indebtedness allocable to A's house. The 
periodic charges payable to Y by A are reduced commensurately with the 
reduction in Y's debt service. Because no part of the indebtedness 
remains outstanding with respect to A's house, A's share of the interest 
expense is $0. The other four tenant-stockholders do not prepay their 
share of the indebtedness. Accordingly, 1/4 of the interest is allocated 
to each of the tenant-stockholders other than A. Y may elect in 
accordance with the rules described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section 
to treat the amounts so allocated as each tenant-stockholder's 
proportionate share of interest.
    Example 5. The Z Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation 
within the meaning of section 216. In 1987, it acquires a building 
containing 10 apartments. One of the apartments is occupied by a senior 
citizen. Under local law, a senior citizen who owns and occupies a 
residential apartment is entitled to a $500 reduction in local property 
taxes assessed upon the apartment. As a result, Z corporation is 
eligible under local law for a reduction in local property taxes 
assessed upon the building. Z's real estate tax assessment for the year 
would have been $10,000, however, with the senior citizen reduction, the 
assessment is $9,500. The proprietary lease provides for a reduced 
maintenance fee to the senior citizen tenant-stockholder in accordance 
with the real estate tax reduction. Accordingly, each apartment owner is 
assessed $1,000 for local real estate taxes, except the senior citizen 
tenant-stockholder, who is assessed $500. Z may elect in accordance with 
the rules described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to treat the 
amounts so allocated as each tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of 
taxes.

    (e) Cooperative housing corporation. In order to qualify as a 
``cooperative housing corporation'' under section 216, the requirements 
of subparagraphs (1) through (4) of this paragraph must be met.
    (1) One class of stock. The corporation shall have one and only one 
class of stock outstanding. However, a special classification of 
preferred stock, in a nominal amount not exceeding $100, issued to a 
Federal housing agency or other governmental agency solely for the 
purpose of creating a security device on the mortgage indebtedness of 
the corporation, shall be disregarded for purposes of determining 
whether the corporation has one class of stock outstanding and such 
agency will not be considered a stockholder for purposes of section 216 
and this section. Furthermore, for taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1969, a special class of stock issued to a governmental 
unit, as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, shall also be 
disregarded for purposes of this paragraph in determining whether the 
corporation has one class of stock outstanding.
    (2) Right of occupancy. Each stockholder of the corporation, whether 
or not the stockholder qualifies as a tenant-stockholder under section 
216(b)(2) and paragraph (f) of this section, must be entitled to occupy 
for dwelling purposes an apartment in a building or a unit in a housing 
development owned or leased by such corporation. The stockholder is not 
required to occupy the premises. The right as against the corporation to 
occupy the premises is sufficient. Such right must be conferred on each 
stockholder solely by reasons of his or her ownership of stock in the 
corporation. That is, the stock must entitle the owner thereof either to 
occupy the premises or to a lease of

[[Page 313]]

the premises. The fact that the right to continue to occupy the premises 
is dependent upon the payment of charges to the corporation in the 
nature of rentals or assessments is immaterial. For taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1986, the fact that, by agreement with the 
cooperative housing corporation, a person or his nominee may not occupy 
the house or apartment without the prior approval of such corporation 
will not be taken into account for purposes of this paragraph in the 
following cases.
    (i) In any case where a person acquires stock of the cooperative 
housing corporation by operation of law, by inheritance, or by 
foreclosure (or by instrument in lieu of foreclosure),
    (ii) In any case where a person other than an individual acquires 
stock in the cooperative housing corporation, and
    (iii) In any case where the person from whom the corporation has 
acquired the apartments or houses (or leaseholds therein) acquires any 
stock of the cooperative housing corporation from the corporation not 
later than one year after the date on which the apartments or houses (or 
leaseholds therein) are transferred to the corporation by such person. 
For purposes of the preceding sentence, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) 
of this section will not apply to acquisitions of stock by foreclosure 
by the person from whom the corporation has acquired the apartments or 
houses (or leaseholds therein).
    (3) Distributions. None of the stockholders of the corporation may 
be entitled, either conditionally or unconditionally, except upon a 
complete or partial liquidation of the corporation, to receive any 
distribution other than out of earnings and profits of the corporation.
    (4) Gross income. Eighty percent or more of the gross income of the 
corporation for the taxable year of the corporation in which the taxes 
and interest are paid or incurred must be derived from the tenant-
stockholders. For purposes of the 80-percent test, in taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1969, gross income attributable to any 
house or apartment which a governmental unit is entitled to occupy, 
pursuant to a lease or stock ownership, shall be disregarded.
    (f) Tenant-stockholder. The term tenant-stockholder means a person 
that is a stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation, as defined 
in section 216(b)(1) and paragraph (e) of this section, and whose stock 
is fully paid up in an amount at least equal to an amount shown to the 
satisfaction of the district director as bearing a reasonable 
relationship to the portion of the fair market value, as of the date of 
the original issuance of the stock, of the corporation's equity in the 
building and the land on which it is situated that is attributable to 
the apartment or housing unit which such person is entitled to occupy 
(within the meaning of paragraph (e)(2) of this section). 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for taxable years beginning 
before January 1, 1987, tenant-stockholders include only individuals, 
certain lending institutions, and certain persons from whom the 
cooperative housing corporation has acquired the apartments or houses 
(or leaseholds thereon).
    (g) Governmental unit. For purposes of section 216(b) and this 
section, the term governmental unit means the United States or any of 
its possessions, a State or any political subdivision thereof, or any 
agency or instrumentality of the foregoing empowered to acquire shares 
in a cooperative housing corporation for the purpose of providing 
housing facilities.
    (h) Examples. The application of section 216(a) and (b) and this 
section may be illustrated by the following examples, which refer to 
apartments but which are equally applicable to housing units:

    Example 1. The X Corporation is a cooperative housing corporation 
within the meaning of section 216. In 1970, at a total cost of $200,000, 
it purchased a site and constructed thereon a building with 15 
apartments. The fair market value of the land and building was $200,000 
at the time of completion of the building. The building contains five 
category A apartment units, each of equal value, and 10 category B 
apartment units. The total value of all of the category A apartment 
units is $100,000. The total value of all of the category B apartments 
is also $100,000. Upon completion of the building, the X Corporation 
mortgaged the land and building for $100,000, and sold its total 
authorized capital stock for $100,000. The stock attributable to

[[Page 314]]

the category A apartments was purchased by five individuals, each of 
whom paid $10,000 for 100 shares, or $100 a share. Each certificate for 
100 shares of such stock provides that the holder thereof is entitled to 
a lease of a particular apartment in the building for a specified term 
of years. The stock attributable to the category B apartments was 
purchased by a governmental unit for $50,000. Since the shares sold to 
the tenant-stockholders are valued at $100 per share, the governmental 
unit is deemed to hold a total of 500 shares. The certificate of such 
stock provides that the governmental unit is entitled to a lease of all 
of the category B apartments. All leases provide that the lessee shall 
pay his proportionate part of the corporation's expenses. In 1970 the 
original owner of 100 shares of stock attributable to the category A 
apartments and to the lease to apartment No. 1 made a gift of the stock 
and lease to A, an individual. The taxable year of A and of the X 
Corporation is the calendar year. The corporation computes its taxable 
income on an accrual method, while A computes his taxable income on the 
cash receipts and disbursements method. In 1971, the X Corporation 
incurred expenses aggregating $13,800, including $4,000 for the real 
estate taxes on the land and building, and $5,000 for the interest on 
the mortgage. In 1972, A pays the X Corporation $1,380, representing his 
proportionate part of the expenses incurred by the corporation. The 
entire gross income of the X Corporation for 1971 was derived from the 
five tenant-stockholders and from the governmental unit. A is entitled 
under section 216 to a deduction of $900 in computing his taxable income 
for 1972. The deduction is computed as follows:

Shares of X Corporation owned by A...........................        100
Shares of X Corporation owned by four other tenant-                     
 stockholders................................................        400
Shares of X Corporation deemed owned by governmental unit....        500
                                                   ------------         
      Total shares of X Corporation outstanding..............      1,000
                                                   ============         
A's proportionate share of the stock of X Corporation (100/             
 1,000)......................................................       1/10

                                                   -----------          
        Total.....................................  .........    $13,800
                                                              ----------
Amount paid by A.............................................      1,380
A's proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest               
 based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $9,000)...............       $900
A's proportionate share of total corporate expenses based on            
 his stock ownership (1/10 of $13,800).......................      1,380
Amount of A's payment representing real estate taxes and                
 interest (900/1,380 of $1,380)..............................       $900
A's allowable deduction......................................       $900
                                                                        

Since the stock which A acquired by gift was fully paid up by his donor 
in an amount equal to the portion of the fair market value, as of the 
date of the original issuance of the stock, of the corporation's equity 
in the land and building which is attributable to apartment No. 1, the 
requirement of section 216 in this regard is satisfied. The fair market 
value at the time of the gift of the corporation's equity attributable 
to the apartment is immaterial.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that the 
building constructed by the X Corporation contained, in addition to the 
15 apartments, business space on the ground floor, which the corporation 
rented at $2,400 for the calendar year 1971. The corporation deducted 
the $2,400 from its expenses in determining the amount of the expenses 
to be prorated among its tenant-stockholders. The amount paid by A to 
the corporation in 1972 is $1,140 instead of $1,380. More than 80 
percent of the gross income of the corporation for 1971 was derived from 
tenant-stockholders. A is entitled under section 216 to a deduction of 
$743.48 in computing his taxable income for 1972. The deduction is 
computed as follows:

Expenses incurred by X Corporation............   $13,800.00             
Less: Rent from business space................     2,400.00             
                                               -------------            
Expenses to be prorated among tenant-stockholders..........   $11,400.00
                                               --------------           
Amount paid by A...........................................     1,140.00
A's proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest               
 based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $9,000).............       900.00
A's proportionate share of total corporate expenses based               
 on his stock ownership (1/10 of $13,800)..................     1,380.00
Amount of A's payment representing real estate taxes and                
 interest (900/1380 of $1,140).............................       743.48
A's allowable deduction....................................       743.48
                                                                        

Since the portion of A's payment allocable to real estate taxes and 
interest is only $743.48, that amount instead of $900 is allowable as a 
deduction in computing A's taxable income for 1972.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that the 
amount paid by A to the X Corporation in 1972 is $1,000 instead of 
$1,380. A is entitled under section 216 to a deduction of $652.17 in 
computing his taxable income for 1972. The deduction is computed as 
follows:

Amount paid by A...........................................    $1,000.00
A's proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest               
 based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $9,000).............       900.00
A's proportionate share of total corporate expenses based               
 on his stock ownership (1/10 of $13,800)..................     1,380.00
Amount of A's payment representing real estate taxes and                
 interest (900/1380 of $1,000).............................       652.17
A's allowable deduction....................................       652.17
                                                                        


[[Page 315]]

Since the portion of A's payment allocable to real estate taxes and 
interest is only $652.17, that amount instead of $900 is allowable as a 
deduction in computing A's taxable income for 1972.
    Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that X 
Corporation leases recreational facilities from Y Corporation for use by 
the tenant-stockholders of X. Under the terms of the lease, X is 
obligated to pay an annual rental of $5,000 plus all real estate taxes 
assessed against the facilities. In 1971 X paid, in addition to the 
$13,800 of expenses enumerated in Example (1), $5,000 rent and $1,000 
real estate taxes. In 1972 A pays the X Corporation $2,000, no part of 
which is refunded to him in 1972. A is entitled under section 216 to a 
deduction of $900 in computing his taxable income for 1972. The 
deduction is computed as follows:

Expenses to be prorated among tenant-stockholders..........      $19,800
Amount paid by A...........................................        2,000
A's proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest               
 based on his stock ownership (1/10 of $9,000).............          900
A's proportionate share of total corporate expenses based               
 on his stock ownership (1/10 of $19,800)..................        1,980
Amount of A's payment representing real estate taxes and                
 interest (900/1,980 of $1,980)............................          900
A's allowable deduction....................................          900
                                                                        

The $1,000 of real estate taxes assessed against the recreational 
facilities constitutes additional rent and hence is not deductible by A 
as taxes under section 216. A's allowable deduction is limited to his 
proportionate share of real estate taxes and interest based on stock 
ownership and cannot be increased by the payment of an amount in excess 
of his proportionate share.

<R05>
Sec. 1.216-2   Treatment as property subject to depreciation.

    (a) General rule. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 
1961, stock in a cooperative housing corporation (as defined by section 
216(b) (1) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.216-1) owned by a tenant-
stockholder (as defined by section 216(b) (2) and paragraph (d) of 
Sec. 1.216-1) who uses the proprietary lease or right of tenancy, which 
was conferred on him solely by reason of his ownership of such stock, in 
a trade or business or for the production of income shall be treated as 
property subject to the allowance for depreciation under section 167(a) 
in the manner and to the extent prescribed in this section.
    (b) Determination of allowance for depreciation--(1) In general. 
Subject to the special rules provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of 
this paragraph and the limitation provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, the allowance for depreciation for the taxable year with 
respect to stock of a tenant-stockholder, subject to the extent provided 
in this section to an allowance for depreciation, shall be determined:
    (i) By computing the amount of depreciation (amortization in the 
case of a leasehold) which would be allowable under one of the methods 
of depreciation prescribed in section 167(b) and the regulations 
thereunder (in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.162-11 and Sec. 1.167(a)-4 in the 
case of a leasehold) in respect of the depreciable (amortizable) real 
property owned by the cooperative housing corporation in which such 
tenant-stockholder has a proprietary lease or right of tenancy,
    (ii) By reducing the amount of depreciation (amortization) so 
computed in the same ratio as the rentable space in such property which 
is not subject to a proprietary lease or right of tenancy by reason of 
stock ownership but which is held for rental purposes bears to the total 
rentable space in such property, and
    (iii) By computing such tenant-stockholder's proportionate share of 
such annual depreciation (amortization), so reduced.

As used in this section, the terms depreciation and depreciable real 
property include amortization and amortizable leasehold of real 
property. As used in this section, the tenant-stockholder's 
proportionate share is that proportion which stock of the cooperative 
housing corporation owned by the tenant-stockholder is of the total 
outstanding stock of the corporation, including any stock held by the 
corporation. In order to determine whether a tenant-stockholder may use 
one of the methods of depreciation prescribed in section 167(b) (2), 
(3), or (4) for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the 
limitations provided in section 167(c) on the use of such methods of 
depreciation shall be applied with respect to the depreciable real 
property owned by the cooperative housing corporation in which the 
tenant-stockholder has a

[[Page 316]]

proprietary lease or right of tenancy, rather than with respect to the 
stock in the cooperative housing corporation owned by the tenant-
stockholder or with respect to the proprietary lease or right of tenancy 
conferred on the tenant-stockholder by reason of his ownership of such 
stock. The allowance for depreciation determined under this subparagraph 
shall be properly adjusted where only a portion of the property occupied 
under a proprietary lease or right of tenancy is used in a trade or 
business or for the production of income.
    (2) Stock acquired subsequent to first offering. Except as provided 
in subparagraph (3), in the case of a tenant-stockholder who purchases 
stock other than as part of the first offering of stock by the 
corporation, the basis of the depreciable real property for purposes of 
the computation required by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall 
be the amount obtained by:
    (i) Multiplying the taxpayer's cost per share by the total number of 
outstanding shares of stock of the corporation, including any shares 
held by the corporation,
    (ii) Adding thereto the mortgage indebtedness to which such 
depreciable real property is subject on the date of purchase of such 
stock, and
    (iii) Subtracting from the sum so obtained the portion thereof not 
properly allocable as of the date such stock was purchased to the 
depreciable real property owned by the cooperative housing corporation 
in which such tenant-stockholder has a proprietary lease or right of 
tenancy.

In order to prevent an overstatement or understatement of the basis of 
the depreciable real property for purposes of the computation required 
by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, appropriate adjustment for 
purposes of the computations described in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of 
this subparagraph shall be made in respect of prepayments and 
delinquencies on account of the corporation's mortgage indebtedness. 
Thus, for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the 
taxpayer's cost per share shall be reduced by an amount determined by 
dividing the total mortgage indebtedness prepayments in respect of the 
shares purchased by the taxpayer by the number of such shares. For 
purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the mortgage 
indebtedness shall be increased by the sum of all prepayments applied in 
reduction of the mortgage indebtedness and shall be decreased by any 
amount due under the terms of the mortgage and unpaid.
    (3) Conversion subsequent to date of acquisition. In the case of a 
tenant-stockholder whose proprietary lease or right of tenancy is 
converted, in whole or in part, to use in a trade or business or for the 
production of income on a date subsequent to the date on which he 
acquired the stock conferring on him such lease or right of tenancy, the 
basis of the depreciable real property for purposes of the computation 
required by subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph shall be the fair 
market value of such depreciable real property on the date of the 
conversion if the fair market value is less than the adjusted basis of 
such property in the hands of the cooperative housing corporation 
provided in section 1011 without taking into account any adjustment for 
depreciation required by section 1016(a)(2). Such fair market value 
shall be deemed to be equal to the adjusted basis of such property, 
taking into account adjustments required by section 1016(a)(2) computed 
as if the corporation had used the straight line method of depreciation, 
in the absence of evidence establishing that the fair market value so 
attributed to the property is unrealistic. In the case of a tenant-
stockholder who purchases stock other than as part of the first offering 
of stock of the corporation, and at a later date converts his 
proprietary lease to use for business or production of income:
    (i) The adjusted basis of the cooperative housing corporation's 
depreciable real property without taking into account any adjustment for 
depreciation shall be the amount determined in accordance with 
subdivisions (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, 
and
    (ii) The fair market value shall be deemed to be equal to such 
adjusted basis reduced by the amount of depreciation, computed under the 
straight line method, which would have been allowable in respect of 
depreciable real

[[Page 317]]

property having a cost or other basis equal to the amount representing 
such adjusted basis in the absence of evidence establishing that the 
fair market value so attributed to the property is unrealistic.
    (c) Limitation. If the allowance for depreciation for the taxable 
year determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of 
this section exceeds the adjusted basis (provided in section 1011) of 
the stock described in paragraph (a) of this section allocable to the 
tenant-stockholder's proprietary lease or right of tenancy used in a 
trade or business or for the production of income, such excess is not 
allowable as a deduction. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 
1986, such excess, subject to the provisions of this paragraph (c), is 
allowable as a deduction for depreciation in the succeeding taxable 
year. To determine the portion of the adjusted basis of such stock which 
is allocable to such proprietary lease or right of tenancy, the adjusted 
basis is reduced by taking into account the same factors as are taken 
into account under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in determining the 
allowance for depreciation.
    (d) Examples. The provisions of section 216(c) and this section may 
be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. The Y corporation, a cooperative housing corporation 
within the meaning of section 216, in 1961 purchased a site and 
constructed thereon a building with 10 apartments at a total cost of 
$250,000 ($200,000 being allocable to the building and $50,000 being 
allocable to the land). Such building was completed on January 1, 1962, 
and at that time had an estimated useful life of 50 years, with an 
estimated salvage value of $20,000. Each apartment is of equal value. 
Upon completion of the building, Y corporation mortgaged the land and 
building for $150,000 and sold its total authorized capital stock, 
consisting of 1000 shares of common stock, for $100,000. The stock was 
purchased by 10 individuals each of whom paid $10,000 for 100 shares. 
Each certificate for 100 shares provides that the holder thereof is 
entitled to a proprietary lease of a particular apartment in the 
building. Each lease provides that the lessee shall pay his 
proportionate share of the corporation's expenses including an amount on 
account of the curtailment of Y's mortgage indebtedness. B, a calendar 
year taxpayer, is the original owner of 100 shares of stock in Y 
corporation. On January 1, 1962, B subleases his apartment for a term of 
5 years. B's stock in Y corporation is treated as property subject to 
the allowance for depreciation under section 167(a), and B, who uses the 
straight line method of depreciation for purposes of the computation 
prescribed by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, computes the 
allowance for depreciation for the taxable year 1962 with respect to 
such stock as follows:

Y's basis in the building...................................    $200,000
Less: Estimated salvage value...............................     $20,000
                                                             -----------
      Y's basis for depreciation............................    $180,000
                                                             ===========
Annual straight line depreciation on Y's building (1/50 of              
 $180,000)..................................................      $3,600
Proportion of outstanding shares of stock of Y corporation

    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that the 
building constructed by Y corporation contained, in addition to the 10 
apartments, space on the ground floor for 2 stores which were rented to 
persons who do not have a proprietary lease of such space by reason of 
stock ownership. Y corporation's building has a total area of 16,000 
square feet, the 10 apartments in such building have an area of 10,000 
square feet, and the 2 stores on the ground floor have an area of 2,000 
square feet. Thus, the total rentable space in Y corporation's building 
is 12,000 square feet. B, who uses the straight line method of 
depreciation for purposes of the computation prescribed by paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, computes the allowance for depreciation for 
the taxable year 1962 with respect to his stock in Y corporation as 
follows:

Y's basis in the building...................................    $200,000

    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that B 
occupies his apartment from January 1, 1962, until December 31, 1966, 
and that on January 1, 1967, B sells his stock to C, an individual, for 
$15,000. C thereby obtains a proprietary lease from Y

[[Page 318]]

corporation with the same rights and obligations as B's lease provided. 
Y corporation's records disclose that its outstanding mortgage 
indebtedness is $135,000 on January 1, 1967. C, a physician, uses the 
entire apartment solely as an office. C's stock in Y corporation is 
treated as property subject to the allowance for depreciation under 
section 167(a), and C, who uses the straight line method of depreciation 
for purposes of the computation prescribed by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of 
this section, computes the allowance for depreciation for the taxable 
year 1967 with respect to such stock as follows:

Price paid for each share of stock in Y corporation                     
 purchased by C on 1-1-67 ($15,000<divide>100)..............        $150

Y's mortgage indebtedness outstanding on 1-1-67.............     135,000

<R05>
Sec. 1.217-1   Deduction for moving expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970.

    (a) Allowance of deduction--(1) In general. Section 217(a) allows a 
deduction from gross income for moving expenses paid or incurred by the 
taxpayer during the taxable year in connection with the commencement of 
work as an employee at a new principal place of work. Except as provided 
in section 217, no deduction is allowable for any expenses incurred by 
the taxpayer in connection with moving himself, the members of his 
family or household, or household goods and personal effects. The 
deduction allowable under this section is only for expenses incurred 
after December 31, 1963, in taxable years ending after such date and 
beginning before January 1, 1970, except in cases where a taxpayer makes 
an election under paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.217-2 with respect to moving 
expenses paid or incurred before January 1, 1971, in connection with the 
commencement of work by such taxpayer as an employee at a new principal 
place of work of which such taxpayer has been notified by his employer 
on or before December 19, 1969. To qualify for the deduction the 
expenses must meet the definition of the term ``moving expenses'' 
provided in section 217(b); the taxpayer must meet the conditions set 
forth in section 217(c); and, if the taxpayer receives a reimbursement 
or other expense allowance for an item of expense, the deduction for the 
portion of the expense reimbursed is allowable only to the extent that 
such reimbursement or other expense allowance is included in his gross 
income as provided in section 217(e). The deduction is allowable only to 
a taxpayer who pays or incurs moving expenses in connection with his 
commencement of work as an employee and is not allowable to a taxpayer 
who pays or incurs such expenses in connection with his commencement of 
work as a self-employed individual. The term employee as used in this 
section has the same meaning as in Sec. 31.3401(c)-1 of this chapter 
(Employment Tax Regulations). All references to section 217 in this 
section are to section 217 prior to the effective date of section 231 of 
the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 577).
    (2) Commencement of work. To be deductible, the moving expenses must 
be paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the commencement 
of work by him at a new principal place of work (see paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section for a discussion of the term principal place of work). 
While it is not necessary that the taxpayer have a contract or 
commitment of employment prior to his moving to a new location, the 
deduction is not allowable unless employment actually does occur. The 
term commencement includes (i) the beginning of work by a taxpayer for 
the first time or after a substantial period of unemployment or part-
time employment, (ii) the beginning of work by a taxpayer for a 
different employer, or (iii) the beginning of work by a taxpayer for the 
same employer at a new

[[Page 319]]

location. To qualify as being in connection with the commencement of 
work, the move for which moving expenses are incurred must bear a 
reasonable proximity both in time and place to such commencement. In 
general, moving expenses incurred within one year of the date of the 
commencement of work are considered to be reasonably proximate to such 
commencement. Moving expenses incurred in relocating the taxpayer's 
residence to a location which is farther from his new principal place of 
work than was his former residence are not generally to be considered as 
incurred in connection with such commencement of work. For example, if A 
is transferred by his employer from place X to place Y and A's old 
residence while he worked at place X is 25 miles from Y, A will not 
generally be entitled to deduct moving expenses in moving to a new 
residence 40 miles from Y even though the minimum distance limitation 
contained in section 217(c)(1) is met. If, however, A is required, as a 
condition of his employment, to reside at a particular place, or if such 
residency will result in an actual decrease in his commuting time or 
expense, the expenses of the move may be considered as incurred in 
connection with his commencement of work at place Y.
    (b) Definition of moving expenses--(1) In general. Section 217(b) 
defines the term moving expenses to mean only the reasonable expenses 
(i) of moving household goods and personal effects from the taxpayer's 
former residence to his new residence, and (ii) of traveling (including 
meals and lodging) from the taxpayer's former residence to his new place 
of residence. The test of deductibility thus is whether the expenses are 
reasonable and are incurred for the items set forth in (i) and (ii) 
above.
    (2) Reasonable expenses. (i) The term moving expenses includes only 
those expenses which are reasonable under the circumstances of the 
particular move. Generally, expenses are reasonable only if they are 
paid or incurred for movement by the shortest and most direct route 
available from the taxpayer's former residence to his new residence by 
the conventional mode or modes of transportation actually used and in 
the shortest period of time commonly required to travel the distance 
involved by such mode. Expenses paid or incurred in excess of a 
reasonable amount are not deductible. Thus, if moving or travel 
arrangements are made to provide a circuitous route for scenic, 
stopover, or other similar reasons, the additional expenses resulting 
therefrom are not deductible since they do not meet the test of 
reasonableness.
    (ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. A, an employee of the M Company works and maintains his 
principal residence in Boston, Massachusetts. Upon receiving orders from 
his employer that he is to be transferred to M's Los Angeles, California 
office, A motors to Los Angeles with his family with stopovers at 
various cities between Boston and Los Angeles to visit friends and 
relatives. In addition, A detours into Mexico for sight-seeing. Because 
of the stopovers and tour into Mexico, A's travel time and distance are 
increased over what they would have been had he proceeded directly to 
Los Angeles. To the extent that A's route of travel between Boston and 
Los Angeles is in a generally southwesterly direction it may be said 
that he is traveling by the shortest and most direct route available by 
motor vehicle. Since A's excursion into Mexico is away from the usual 
Boston-Los Angeles route, the portion of the expenses paid or incurred 
attributable to such excursion is not deductible. Likewise, that portion 
of the expenses attributable to A's delays en route not necessitated by 
reasons of rest or repair of his vehicle are not deductible.

    (3) Expenses of moving household goods and personal effects. 
Expenses of moving household goods and personal effects include expenses 
of transporting such goods and effects owned by the taxpayer or a member 
of his household from the taxpayer's former residence to his new 
residence, and expenses of packing, crating and in-transit storage and 
insurance for such goods and effects. Expenses paid or incurred in 
moving household goods and personal effects to a taxpayer's new 
residence from a place other than his former residence are allowable, 
but only to the extent that such expenses do not exceed the amount which 
would be allowable had such goods and effects been moved from the 
taxpayer's former residence. Examples of items not deductible as moving 
expenses include, but are not

[[Page 320]]

limited to, storage charges (other than in-transit), costs incurred in 
the acquisition of property, costs incurred and losses sustained in the 
disposition of property, penalties for breaking leases, mortgage 
penalties, expenses of refitting rugs or draperies, expenses of 
connecting or disconnecting utilities, losses sustained on the disposal 
of memberships in clubs, tuition fees, and similar items.
    (4) Expenses of traveling. Expenses of traveling include the cost of 
transportation and of meals and lodging en route (including the date of 
arrival) of both the taxpayer and members of his household, who have 
both the taxpayer's former residence and the taxpayer's new residence as 
their principal place of abode, from the taxpayer's former residence to 
his new place of residence. Expenses of traveling do not include, for 
example: living or other expenses of the taxpayer and members of his 
household following their date of arrival at the new place of residence 
and while they are waiting to enter the new residence or waiting for 
their household goods to arrive; expenses in connection with house or 
apartment hunting; living expenses preceding the date of departure for 
the new place of residence; expenses of trips for purposes of selling 
property; expenses of trips to the former residence by the taxpayer 
pending the move by his family to the new place of residence; or any 
allowance for depreciation. The deduction for traveling expenses is 
allowable for only one trip made by the taxpayer and members of his 
household; however, it is not necessary that the taxpayer and all 
members of his household travel together or at the same time.
    (5) Residence. The term former residence refers to the taxpayer's 
principal residence before his departure for his new principal place of 
work. The term new residence refers to the taxpayer's principal 
residence within the general location of his new principal place of 
work. Thus, neither term includes other residences owned or maintained 
by the taxpayer or members of his family or seasonal residences such as 
a summer beach cottage. Whether or not property is used by the taxpayer 
as his residence, and whether or not property is used by the taxpayer as 
his principal residence (in the case of a taxpayer using more than one 
property as a residence), depends upon all the facts and circumstances 
in each case. Property used by the taxpayer as his principal residence 
may include a houseboat, a house trailer, or similar dwelling. The term 
new place of residence generally includes the area within which the 
taxpayer might reasonably be expected to commute to his new principal 
place of work. The application of the terms former residence, new 
residence and new place of residence as defined in this paragraph and as 
used in section 217(b)(1) may be illustrated in the following manner: 
Expenses of moving household goods and personal effects are moving 
expenses when paid or incurred for transporting such items from the 
taxpayer's former residence to the taxpayer's new residence (such as 
from one street address to another). Expenses of traveling, on the other 
hand, are limited to those incurred between the taxpayer's former 
residence (a geographic point) and his new place of residence (a 
commuting area) up to and including the date of arrival. The date of 
arrival is the day the taxpayer secures lodging within that commuting 
area, even if on a temporary basis.
    (6) Individuals other than taxpayer. In addition to the expenses set 
forth in section 217(b)(1) which are attributable to the taxpayer alone, 
the same type of expenses attributable to certain individuals other than 
the taxpayer, if paid or incurred by the taxpayer, are deductible. Those 
other individuals must (i) be members of the taxpayer's household, and 
(ii) have both the taxpayer's former residence and his new residence as 
their principal place of abode. A member of the taxpayer's household may 
not be, for example, a tenant residing in the taxpayer's residence, nor 
an individual such as a servant, governess, chauffeur, nurse, valet, or 
personal attendant.
    (c) Conditions for allowance--(1) In general. Section 217(c) 
provides two conditions which must be satisfied in order for a deduction 
of moving expenses to be allowed under section 217(a). The first is a 
minimum distance requirement prescribed by section 217(c)(1), and the 
second is a minimum

[[Page 321]]

period of employment requirement prescribed by section 217(c)(2).
    (2) Minimum distance. For purposes of applying the minimum distance 
requirement of section 217(c)(1) all taxpayers are divided into one or 
the other of the following categories: taxpayers having a former 
principal place of work, and taxpayers not having a former principal 
place of work. In this latter category are individuals who are seeking 
full-time employment for the first time (for example, recent high school 
or college graduates), or individuals who are re-entering the labor 
force after a substantial period of unemployment or part-time 
employment.
    (i) In the case of a taxpayer having a former principal place of 
work, section 217(c)(1)(A) provides that no deduction is allowable 
unless the distance between his new principal place of work and his 
former residence exceeds by at least 20 miles the distance between his 
former principal place of work and such former residence.
    (ii) In the case of a taxpayer not having a former principal place 
of work, section 217(c)(1)(B) provides that no deduction is allowable 
unless the distance between his new principal place of work and his 
former residence is at least 20 miles.
    (iii) For purposes of measuring distances under section 217(c)(1) 
all computations are to be made on the basis of a straight-line 
measurement.
    (3) Principal place of work. (i) A taxpayer's ``principal place of 
work'' usually is the place at which he spends most of his working time. 
Generally, where a taxpayer performs services as an employee, his 
principal place of work is his employer's plant, office, shop, store or 
other property. However, a taxpayer may have a principal place of work 
even if there is no one place at which he spends a substantial portion 
of his working time. In such case, the taxpayer's principal place of 
work is the place at which his business activities are centered-- for 
example, because he reports there for work, or is otherwise required 
either by his employer or the nature of his employment to ``base'' his 
employment there. Thus, while a member of a railroad crew, for example, 
may spend most of his working time aboard a train, his principal place 
of work is his home terminal, station, or other such central point where 
he reports in, checks out, or receives instructions. In those cases 
where the taxpayer is employed by a number of employers on a relatively 
short-term basis, and secures employment by means of a union hall system 
(such as a construction or building trades worker), the taxpayer's 
principal place of work would be the union hall.
    (ii) In cases where a taxpayer has more than one employment (i.e., 
more than one employer at any particular time) his principal place of 
work is usually determined with reference to his principal employment. 
The location of a taxpayer's principal place of work is necessarily a 
question of fact which must be determined on the basis of the particular 
circumstances in each case. The more important factors to be considered 
in making a factual determination regarding the location of a taxpayer's 
principal place of work are (a) the total time ordinarily spent by the 
taxpayer at each place, (b) the degree of the taxpayer's business 
activity at each place, and (c) the relative significance of the 
financial return to the taxpayer from each place.
    (iii) In general, a place of work is not considered to be the 
taxpayer's principal place of work for purposes of this section if the 
taxpayer maintains an inconsistent position, for example, by claiming an 
allowable deduction under section 162 (relating to trade or business 
expenses) for traveling expenses ``while away from home'' with respect 
to expenses incurred while he is not away from such place of work and 
after he has incurred moving expenses for which a deduction is claimed 
under this section.
    (4) Minimum period of employment. Under section 217(c)(2), no 
deduction is allowed unless, during the 12-month period immediately 
following the taxpayer's arrival in the general location of his new 
principal place of work, he is a full-time employee, in such general 
location, during at least 39 weeks.
    (i) The 12-month period and the 39-week period set forth in section 
217(c)(2) are measured from the date of the taxpayer's arrival in the 
general location of his new principal place of

[[Page 322]]

work. Generally, the taxpayer's date of arrival is the date of the 
termination of the last trip preceding the taxpayer's commencement of 
work on a regular basis, regardless of the date on which the taxpayer's 
family or household goods and effects arrive.
    (ii) It is not necessary that the taxpayer remain in the employ of 
the same employer for 39 weeks, but only that he be employed in the same 
general location of his new principal place of work during such period. 
The general location of the new principal place of work refers to the 
area within which an individual might reasonably be expected to commute 
to such place of work, and will usually be the same area as is known as 
the new place of residence; see paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (iii) Only a week during which the taxpayer is a full-time employee 
qualifies as a week of work for purposes of the 39-week requirement of 
section 217(c)(2). Whether an employee is a full-time employee during 
any particular week depends upon the customary practices of the 
occupation in the geographic area in which the taxpayer works. In the 
case of occupations where employment is on a seasonal basis, weeks 
occuring in the off-season when no work is required or available (as the 
case may be) may be counted as weeks of full-time employment only if the 
employee's contract or agreement of employment covers the off-season 
period and the off-season period is less than 6 months. Thus, a school 
teacher whose employment contract covers a 12-month period and who 
teaches on a full-time basis for more than 6 months in fulfillment of 
such contract is considered a full-time employee during the entire 12-
month period. A taxpayer will not be deemed as other than a full-time 
employee during any week merely because of periods of involuntary 
temporary absence from work, such as those due to illness, strikes, 
shutouts, layoffs, natural disasters, etc.
    (iv) In the case of taxpayers filing a joint return, either spouse 
may satisfy this 39-week requirement. However, weeks worked by one 
spouse may not be added to weeks worked by the other spouse in order to 
satisfy such requirement.
    (v) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. A is an electrician residing in New York City. Having 
heard of the possibility of better employment prospects in Denver, 
Colorado, he moves himself, his family and his household goods and 
personal effects, at his own expense, to Denver where he secures 
employment with the M Aircraft Corporation. After working full-time for 
30 weeks his job is terminated, and he subsequently moves to and secures 
employment in Los Angeles, California, which employment lasts for more 
than 39 weeks. Since A was not employed in the general location of his 
new principal place of employment while in Denver for at least 39 weeks, 
no deduction is allowable for moving expenses paid or incurred between 
New York City and Denver. A will be allowed to deduct only those moving 
expenses attributable to his move from Denver to Los Angeles, assuming 
all other conditions of section 217 are met.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that B, 
A's wife, secures employment in Denver at the same time as A, and that 
she continues to work in Denver for at least 9 weeks after A's departure 
for Los Angeles. Since she has met the 39-week requirement in Denver, 
and assuming all other requirements of section 217 are met, the moving 
expenses paid by A attributable to the move from New York City to Denver 
will be allowed as a deduction, provided A and B filed a joint return.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that B, 
A's wife, secures employment in Denver on the same day that A departs 
for Los Angeles, and continues to work in Denver for 9 weeks thereafter. 
Since neither A (who has worked 30 weeks) nor B (who has worked 9 weeks) 
has independently satisfied the 39-week requirement, no deduction for 
moving expenses attributable to the move from New York City to Denver is 
allowable.

    (d) Rules for application of section 217(c)(2)--(1) Inapplicability 
of 39-week test to reimbursed expenses. (i) Paragraph (1) of section 
217(d) provides that the 39-week employment condition of section 
217(c)(2) does not apply to any moving expense item to the extent that 
the taxpayer receives reimbursement or other allowance from his employer 
for such item. A reimbursement or other allowance to an employee for 
expenses of moving, in the absence of a specific allocation by the 
employer, is allocated first to items deductible

[[Page 323]]

under section 217(a) and then, if a balance remains, to items not so 
deductible.
    (ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. A, a recent college graduate, with his residence in 
Washington, DC, is hired by the M Corporation in San Francisco, 
California. Under the terms of the employment contract, M agrees to 
reimburse A for three-fifths of his moving expenses from Washington to 
San Francisco. A moves to San Francisco, and pays $1,000 for expenses 
incurred, for which he is reimbursed $600 by M. After working for M for 
a period of 3 months, A becomes dissatisfied with the job and returns to 
Washington to continue his education. Since he has failed to satisfy the 
39-week requirement of section 217(c)(2) the expenses totaling $400 for 
which A has received no reimbursement are not deductible. Under the 
special rule of section 217(d)(1), however, the deduction for the $600 
reimbursed moving expenses is not disallowed by reason of section 
217(c)(2).
    Example 2. B, a self-employed accountant, who works and resides in 
Columbus, Ohio, is hired by the N Company in St. Petersburg, Florida. 
Pursuant to its policy with respect to newly hired employees, N agrees 
to reimburse B to the extent of $1,000 of the expenses incurred by him 
in connection with his move to St. Petersburg, allocating $700 for the 
items specified in section 217(b)(1), and $300 for ``temporary living 
expenses.'' B moves to St. Petersburg, and incurs $800 of ``moving 
expenses'' and $300 of ``temporary living expenses'' in St. Petersburg. 
B receives reimbursement of $1,000 from N, which amount is included in 
his gross income. Assuming B fails to satisfy the 39-week test of 
section 217(c)(2), he will nevertheless be allowed to deduct $700 as a 
moving expense. On the other hand, had N made no allocation between 
deductible and non-deductible items, B would have been allowed to deduct 
$800 since, in the absence of a specific allocation of the reimbursement 
by N, it is presumed that the reimbursement was for items specified in 
section 217(b)(1) to the extent thereof.

    (2) Election of deduction before 39-week test is satisfied. (i) 
Paragraph (2) of section 217(d) provides a special rule which applies in 
those cases where a taxpayer paid or incurred, in a particular taxable 
year, moving expenses which would be deductible in that taxable year 
except for the fact that the 39-week employment condition of section 
217(c)(2) has not been satisfied before the time prescribed by law 
(including extensions thereof) for filing the return for such taxable 
year. The rule provides that where a taxpayer has paid or incurred 
moving expenses and as of the date prescribed by section 6072 for filing 
his return for such taxable year, including extensions thereof as may be 
allowed under section 6081, there remains unexpired a sufficient portion 
of the 12-month period so that it is still possible for the taxpayer to 
satisfy the 39-week requirement, then the taxpayer may elect to claim a 
deduction for such moving expenses on the return for such taxable year. 
The election shall be exercised by taking the deduction on the return 
filed within the time prescribed by section 6072 (including extensions 
as may be allowed under section 6081). It is not necessary that the 
taxpayer wait until the date prescribed by law for filing his return in 
order to make the election. He may make the election on an early return 
based upon the facts known on the date such return is filed. However, an 
election made on an early return will become invalid if, as of the date 
prescribed by law for filing the return, it is not possible for the 
taxpayer to satisfy the 39-week requirement.
    (ii) In the event that a taxpayer does not elect to claim a 
deduction for moving expenses on the return for the taxable year in 
which such expenses were paid or incurred in accordance with (i) of this 
subparagraph, and the 39-week employment condition of section 217(c)(2) 
(as well as all other requirements of section 217) is subsequently 
satisfied, then the taxpayer may file an amended return for the taxable 
year in which such moving expenses were paid or incurred on which he may 
claim a deduction under section 217. The taxpayer may, in lieu of filing 
an amended return, file a claim for refund based upon the deduction 
allowable under section 217.
    (iii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. A is transferred by his employer, M, from Boston, 
Massachusetts, to Cleveland, Ohio, and begins working there on November 
1, 1964, followed by his family and household goods and personal effects 
on November 15, 1964. Moving expenses are paid or incurred by A in 1964 
in connection with this move. On April 15, 1965, when A files his income 
tax return for the year 1964, A has been

[[Page 324]]

a full-time employee in Cleveland for approximately 24 weeks. 
Notwithstanding the fact that as of April 15, 1965, A has not satisfied 
the 39-week employment condition of section 217(c)(2) he may 
nevertheless elect to claim his 1964 moving expenses on his 1964 income 
tax return since there is still sufficient time remaining before 
November 1, 1965, within which to satisfy the 39-week requirement.
    Example 2. Assume the facts are the same as in Example (1), except 
that as of April 15, 1965, A has left the employ of M, and is in the 
process of seeking further employment in Cleveland. Since, under these 
conditions, A may be unsure whether or not he will be able to satisfy 
the 39-week requirement by November 1, 1965, he may not wish to avail 
himself of the election provided by section 217(d)(2). In such event, A 
may wait until he has actually satisfied the 39-week requirement, at 
which time he may file an amended return claiming as a deduction the 
moving expenses paid or incurred in 1964. A may, in lieu of filing an 
amended return, file a claim for refund based upon a deduction for such 
expenses. Should A fail to satisfy the 39-week requirement on or before 
November 1, 1965, no deduction is allowable for moving expenses incurred 
in 1964.

    (3) Recapture of deduction where 39-week test is not met. Paragraph 
(3) of section 217(d) provides a special rule which applies in cases 
where a taxpayer has deducted moving expenses under the election 
provided in section 217(d)(2) prior to his satisfying the 39-week 
employment condition of section 217(c)(2), and the 39-week test is not 
satisfied during the taxable year immediately following the taxable year 
in which the expenses were deducted. In such cases an amount equal to 
the expenses which were deducted must be included in the taxpayer's 
gross income for the taxable year immediately following the taxable year 
in which the expenses were deducted. In the event the taxpayer has 
deducted moving expenses under the election provided in section 
217(d)(2) for the taxable year, and subsequently files an amended return 
for such year on which he eliminates such deduction, such expenses will 
not be deemed to have been deducted for purposes of the recapture rule 
of the preceding sentence.
    (e) Disallowance of deduction with respect to reimbursements not 
included in gross income. Section 217(e) provides that no deduction 
shall be allowed under section 217 for any item to the extent that the 
taxpayer receives reimbursement or other expense allowance for such item 
unless the amount of such reimbursement or other expense allowance is 
included in his gross income. A reimbursement or other allowance to an 
employee for expenses of moving, in the absence of a specific allocation 
by the employer, is allocated first to items deductible under section 
217(a) and then, if a balance remains, to items not so deductible. For 
purposes of this section, moving services furnished in-kind, directly or 
indirectly, by a taxpayer's employer to the taxpayer or members of his 
household are considered as being a reimbursement or other allowance 
received by the taxpayer for moving expenses. If a taxpayer pays or 
incurs moving expenses and either prior or subsequent thereto receives 
reimbursement or other expense allowance for such item, no deduction is 
allowed for such moving expenses unless the amount of the reimbursement 
or other expense allowance is included in his gross income in the year 
in which such reimbursement or other expense allowance is received. In 
those cases where the reimbursement or other expense allowance is 
received by a taxpayer for an item of moving expense subsequent to his 
having claimed a deduction for such item, and such reimbursement or 
other expense allowance is properly excluded from gross income in the 
year in which received, the taxpayer must file an amended return for the 
taxable year in which the moving expenses were deducted and decrease 
such deduction by the amount of the reimbursement or other expense 
allowance not included in gross income. This does not mean, however, 
that a taxpayer has an option to include or not include in his gross 
income an amount received as reimbursement or other expense allowance in 
connection with his move as an employee. This question remains one which 
must be resolved under section 61(a) (relating to the definition of 
gross income).

<R05>
Sec. 1.217-2   Deduction for moving expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.

    (a) Allowance of deduction--(1) In general. Section 217(a) allows a 
deduction from gross income for moving expenses paid or incurred by the 
taxpayer during the taxable year in connection with his commencement of 
work as an employee or as a self-employed individual at a new principal 
place of work. For purposes of this section, amounts are considered as 
being paid or incurred by an individual whether goods or services are 
furnished to the taxpayer directly (by an employer, a client, a 
customer, or similar person) or indirectly (paid to a third party on 
behalf of the taxpayer by an employer, a client, a customer, or similar 
person). A cash basis taxpayer will treat moving expenses as being paid 
for purposes of section 217 and this section in the year in which the 
taxpayer is considered to have received such payment under section 82 
and Sec. 1.82-1. No deduction is allowable under section 162 for any 
expenses incurred by the taxpayer in connection with moving from one 
residence to another residence unless such expenses are deductible under 
section 162 without regard to such change in residence. To qualify for 
the deduction under section 217 the expenses must meet the definition of 
the term moving expenses provided in section 217(b) and the taxpayer 
must meet the conditions set forth in section 217(c). The term employee 
as used in this section has the same meaning as in Sec. 31.3401(c)-1 of 
this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations). The term self-employed 
individual as used in this section is defined in paragraph (f)(1) of 
this section.
    (2) Expenses paid in a taxable year other than the taxable year in 
which reimbursement representing such expenses is received. In general, 
moving expenses are deductible in the year paid or incurred. If a 
taxpayer who uses the cash receipts and disbursements method of 
accounting receives reimbursement for a moving expense in a taxable year 
other than the taxable year the taxpayer pays such expense, he may elect 
to deduct such expense in the taxable year that he receives such 
reimbursement, rather than the taxable year when he paid such expense in 
any case where:
    (i) The expense is paid in a taxable year prior to the taxable year 
in which the reimbursement is received, or
    (ii) The expense is paid in the taxable year immediately following 
the taxable year in which the reimbursement is received, provided that 
such expense is paid on or before the due date prescribed for filing the 
return (determined with regard to any extension of time for such filing) 
for the taxable year in which the reimbursement is received.

An election to deduct moving expenses in the taxable year that the 
reimbursement is received shall be made by claiming the deduction on the 
return, amended return, or claim for refund for the taxable year in 
which the reimbursement is received.
    (3) Commencement of work. (i) To be deductible the moving expenses 
must be paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with his 
commencement of work at a new principal place of work (see paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section for a discussion of the term principal place of 
work). Except for those expenses described in section 217(b)(1) (C) and 
(D) it is not necessary for the taxpayer to have made arrangements to 
work prior to his moving to a new location; however, a deduction is not 
allowable unless employment or self-employment actually does occur. The 
term commencement includes (a) the beginning of work by a taxpayer as an 
employee or as a self-employed individual for the first time or after a 
substantial period of unemployment or part-time employment, (b) the 
beginning of work by a taxpayer for a different employer or in the case 
of a self-employed individual in a new trade or business, or (c) the 
beginning of work by a taxpayer for the same employer or in the case of 
a self-employed individual in the same trade or business at a new 
location. To qualify as being in connection with the commencement of 
work, the move must bear a reasonable proximity both in time and place 
to such commencement at the new principal place of work. In general, 
moving expenses incurred within 1 year of the date of the commencement 
of work are considered to be reasonably proximate in time to

[[Page 326]]

such commencement. Moving expenses incurred after the 1-year period may 
be considered reasonably proximate in time if it can be shown that 
circumstances existed which prevented the taxpayer from incurring the 
expenses of moving within the 1-year period allowed. Whether 
circumstances existed which prevented the taxpayer from incurring the 
expenses of moving within the period allowed is dependent upon the facts 
and circumstances of each case. The length of the delay and the fact 
that the taxpayer may have incurred part of the expenses of the move 
within the 1-year period allowed shall be taken into account in 
determining whether expenses incurred after such period are allowable. 
In general, a move is not considered to be reasonably proximate in place 
to the commencement of work at the new princpal place of work where the 
distance between the taxpayer's new residence and his new principal 
place of work exceeds the distance between his former residence and his 
new principal place of work. A move to a new residence which does not 
satisfy this test may, however, be considered reasonably proximate in 
place to the commencement of work if the taxpayer can demonstrate, for 
example, that he is required to live at such residence as a condition of 
employment or that living at such residence will result in an actual 
decrease in commuting time or expense. For example, assume that in 1977 
A is transferred by his employer to a new principal place of work and 
the distance between his former residence and his new principal place of 
work is 35 miles greater than was the distance between his former 
residence and his former principal place of work. However, the distance 
between his new residence and his new principal place of work is 10 
miles greater than was the distance between his former residence and his 
new principal place of work. Although the minimum distance requirement 
of section 217(c)(1) is met the expenses of moving to the new residence 
are not considered as incurred in connection with A's commencement of 
work at his new principal place of work since the new residence is not 
proximate in place to the new place of work. If, however, A can 
demonstrate, for example, that he is required to live at such new 
residence as a condition of employment or if living at such new 
residence will result in an actual decrease in commuting time or 
expense, the expenses of the move may be considered as incurred in 
connection with A's commencement of work at his new principal place of 
work.
    (ii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Assume that A is tranferred by his employer from Boston, 
MA, to Washington, DC. A moves to a new residence in Washington, DC, and 
commences work on February 1, 1971. A's wife and his two children remain 
in Boston until June 1972 in order to allow A's children to complete 
their grade school education in Boston. On June 1, 1972, A sells his 
home in Boston and his wife and children move to the new residence in 
Washington, DC. The expenses incurred on June 1, 1972, in selling the 
old residence and in moving A's family, their household goods, and 
personal effects to the new residence in Washington are allowable as a 
deduction although they were incurred 16 months after the date of the 
commencement of work by A since A has moved to and established a new 
residence in Washington, DC, and thus incurred part of the total 
expenses of the move prior to the expiration of the 1-year period.
    Example 2. Assume that A is transferred by his employer from 
Washington, DC, to Baltimore, MD. A commences work on January 1, 1971, 
in Baltimore. A commutes from his residence in Washington to his new 
principal place of work in Baltimore for a period of 18 months. On July 
1, 1972, A decides to move to and establish a new residence in 
Baltimore. None of the moving expenses otherwise allowable under section 
217 may be deducted since A neither incurred the expenses within 1 year 
nor has shown circumstances under which he was prevented from moving 
within such period.

    (b) Definition of moving expenses--(1) In general. Section 217(b) 
defines the term moving expenses to mean only the reasonable expenses 
(i) of moving household goods and personal effects from the taxpayer's 
former residence to his new residence, (ii) of traveling (including 
meals and lodging) from the taxpayer's former residence to his new place 
of residence, (iii) of traveling (including meals and lodging), after 
obtaining employment, from the taxpayer's former residence to the 
general location of his new principal place of

[[Page 327]]

work and return, for the principal purpose of searching for a new 
residence, (iv) of meals and lodging while occupying temporary quarters 
in the general location of the new principal place of work during any 
period of 30 consecutive days after obtaining employment, or (v) of a 
nature constituting qualified residence sale, purchase, or lease 
expenses. Thus, the test of deductibility is whether the expenses are 
reasonable and are incurred for the items set forth in subdivisions (i) 
through (v) of this subparagraph.
    (2) Reasonable expenses. (i) The term moving expenses includes only 
those expenses which are reasonable under the circumstances of the 
particular move. Expenses paid or incurred in excess of a reasonable 
amount are not deductible. Generally, expenses paid or incurred for 
movement of household goods and personal effects or for travel 
(including meals and lodging) are reasonable only to the extent that 
they are paid or incurred for such movement or travel by the shortest 
and most direct route available from the former residence to the new 
residence by the conventional mode or modes of transportation actually 
used and in the shortest period of time commonly required to travel the 
distance involved by such mode. Thus, if moving or travel arrangements 
are made to provide a circuitous route for scenic, stopover, or other 
similar reasons, additional expenses resulting therefrom are not 
deductible since they are not reasonable nor related to the commencement 
of work at the new principal place of work. In addition, expenses paid 
or incurred for meals and lodging while traveling from the former 
residence to the new place of residence or to the general location of 
the new principal place of work and return or occupying temporary 
quarters in the general location of the new principal place of work are 
reasonable only if under the facts and circumstances involved such 
expenses are not lavish or extravagant.
    (ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. A, an employee of the M Company works and maintains his 
residence in Boston, MA. Upon receiving orders from his employer that he 
is to be transferred to M's Los Angeles, CA, office, A motors to Los 
Angeles with his family with stopovers at various cities between Boston 
and Los Angeles to visit friends and relatives. In addition, A detours 
into Mexico for sightseeing. Because of the stopovers and tour into 
Mexico, A's travel time and distance are increased over what they would 
have been had he proceeded directly to Los Angeles. To the extent that 
A's route of travel between Boston and Los Angeles is in a generally 
southwesterly direction it may be said that he is traveling by the 
shortest and most direct route available by motor vehicle. Since A's 
excursion into Mexico is away from the usual Boston-Los Angeles route, 
the portion of the expenses paid or incurred attributable to such 
excursion is not deductible. Likewise, that portion of the expenses 
attributable to A's delay en route in visiting personal friends and 
sightseeing are not deductible.

    (3) Expense of moving household goods and personal effects. Expenses 
of moving household goods and personal effects include expenses of 
transporting such goods and effects from the taxpayer's former residence 
to his new residence, and expenses of packing, crating, and in-transit 
storage and insurance for such goods and effects. Such expenses also 
include any costs of connecting or disconnecting utilities required 
because of the moving of household goods, appliances, or personal 
effects. Expenses of storing and insuring household goods and personal 
effects constitute in-transit expenses if incurred within any 
consecutive 30-day period after the day such goods and effects are moved 
from the taxpayer's former residence and prior to delivery at the 
taxpayer's new residence. Expenses paid or incurred in moving household 
goods and personal effects to the taxpayer's new residence from a place 
other than his former residence are allowable, but only to the extent 
that such expenses do not exceed the amount which would be allowable had 
such goods and effects been moved from the taxpayer's former residence. 
Expenses of moving household goods and personal effects do not include, 
for example, storage charges (other than in-transit), costs incurred in 
the acquisition of property, costs incurred and losses sustained in the 
disposition of property, penalties for breaking leases, mortgage 
penalties, expenses of refitting rugs or draperies, losses sustained on 
the disposal of memberships in clubs, tuition fees, and

[[Page 328]]

similar items. The above expenses may, however, be described in other 
provisions of section 217(b) and if so a deduction may be allowed for 
them subject to the allowable dollar limitations.
    (4) Expenses of traveling from the former residence to the new place 
of residence. Expenses of traveling from the former residence to the new 
place of residence include the cost of transportation and of meals and 
lodging en route (including the date of arrival) from the taxpayer's 
former residence to his new place of residence. Expenses of meals and 
lodging incurred in the general location of the former residence within 
1 day after the former residence is no longer suitable for occupancy 
because of the removal of household goods and personal effects shall be 
considered as expenses of traveling for purposes of this subparagraph. 
The date of arrival is the day the taxpayer secures lodging at the new 
place of residence, even if on a temporary basis. Expenses of traveling 
from the taxpayer's former residence to his new place of residence do 
not include, for example, living or other expenses following the date of 
arrival at the new place of residence and while waiting to enter the new 
residence or waiting for household goods to arrive, expenses in 
connection with house or apartment hunting, living expenses preceding 
date of departure for the new place of residence (other than expenses of 
meals and lodging incurred within 1 day after the former residence is no 
longer suitable for occupancy), expenses of trips for purposes of 
selling property, expenses of trips to the former residence by the 
taxpayer pending the move by his family to the new place of residence, 
or any allowance for depreciation. The above expenses may, however, be 
described in other provisions of section 217(b) and if so a deduction 
may be allowed for them subject to the allowable dollar limitations. The 
deduction for traveling expenses from the former residence to the new 
place of residence is allowable for only one trip made by the taxpayer 
and members of his household; however, it is not necessary that the 
taxpayer and all members of his household travel together or at the same 
time.
    (5) Expenses of traveling for the principal purpose of looking for a 
new residence. Expenses of traveling, after obtaining employment, from 
the former residence to the general location of the new principal place 
of work and return, for the principal purpose of searching for a new 
residence include the cost of transportation and meals and lodging 
during such travel and while at the general location of the new place of 
work for the principal purpose of searching for a new residence. 
However, such expenses do not include, for example, expenses of meals 
and lodging of the taxpayer and members of his household before 
departing for the new principal place of work, expenses for trips for 
purposes of selling property, expenses of trips to the former residence 
by the taxpayer pending the move by his family to the place of 
residence, or any allowance for depreciation. The above expenses may, 
however, be described in other provisions of section 217(b) and if so a 
deduction may be allowed for them. The deduction for expenses of 
traveling for the principal purpose of looking for a new residence is 
not limited to any number of trips by the taxpayer and by members of his 
household. In addition, the taxpayer and all members of his household 
need not travel together or at the same time. Moreover, a trip need not 
result in acquisition of a lease of property or purchase of property. An 
employee is considered to have obtained employment in the general 
location of the new principal place of work after he has obtained a 
contract or agreement of employment. A self-employed individual is 
considered to have obtained employment when he has made substantial 
arrangements to commence work at the new principal place of work (see 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section for a discussion of the term made 
substantial arrangements to commence to work).
    (6) Expenses of occupying temporary quarters. Expenses of occupying 
temporary quarters include only the cost of meals and lodging while 
occupying temporary quarters in the general location of the new 
principal place of work during any period of 30 consecutive days after 
the taxpayer has obtained employment in such general location. Thus, 
expenses of occupying temporary

[[Page 329]]

quarters do not include, for example, the cost of entertainment, 
laundry, transportation, or other personal, living family expenses, or 
expenses of occupying temporary quarters in the general location of the 
former place of work. The 30 consecutive day period is any one period of 
30 consecutive days which can begin, at the option of the taxpayer, on 
any day after the day the taxpayer obtains employment in the general 
location of the new principal place of work.
    (7) Qualified residence sale, purchase, or lease expenses. Qualified 
residence sale, purchase, or lease expenses (hereinafter ``qualified 
real estate expenses'') are only reasonable amounts paid or incurred for 
any of the following purposes:
    (i) Expenses incident to the sale or exchange by the taxpayer or his 
spouse of the taxpayer's former residence which, but for section 217 (b) 
and (e), would be taken into account in determining the amount realized 
on the sale or exchange of the residence. These expenses include real 
estate commissions, attorneys' fees, title fees, escrow fees, so called 
``points'' or loan placement charges which the seller is required to 
pay, State transfer taxes and similar expenses paid or incurred in 
connection with the sale or exchange. No deduction, however, is 
permitted under section 217 and this section for the cost of physical 
improvements intended to enhance salability by improving the condition 
or appearance of the residence.
    (ii) Expenses incident to the purchase by the taxpayer or his spouse 
of a new residence in the general location of the new principal place of 
work which, but for section 217 (b) and (e), would be taken into account 
in determining either the adjusted basis of the new residence or the 
cost of a loan. These expenses include attorney's fees, escrow fees, 
appraisal fees, title costs, so-called ``points'' or loan placement 
charges not representing payments or prepayments of interest, and 
similar expenses paid or incurred in connection with the purchase of the 
new residence. No deduction, however, is permitted under section 217 and 
this section for any portion of real estate taxes or insurance, so-
called ``points'' or loan placement charges which are, in essence, 
prepayments of interest, or the purchase price of the residence.
    (iii) Expenses incident to the settlement of an unexpired lease held 
by the taxpayer or his spouse on property used by the taxpayer as his 
former residence. These expenses include consideration paid to a lessor 
to obtain a release from a lease, attorneys' fees, real estate 
commissions, or similar expenses incident to obtaining a release from a 
lease or to obtaining an assignee or a sublessee such as the difference 
between rent paid under a primary lease and rent received under a 
sublease. No deduction, however, is permitted under section 217 and this 
section for the cost of physical improvement intended to enhance 
marketability of the leasehold by improving the condition or appearance 
of the residence.
    (iv) Expenses incident to the acquisition of a lease by the taxpayer 
or his spouse. These expenses include the cost of fees or commissions 
for obtaining a lease, a sublease, or an assignment of an interest in 
property used by the taxpayer as his new residence in the general 
location of the new principal place of work. No deduction, however, is 
permitted under section 217 and this section for payments or prepayments 
of rent or payments representing the cost of a security or other similar 
deposit.

Qualified real estate expenses do not include losses sustained on the 
disposition of property or mortgage penalties, to the extent that such 
penalties are otherwise deductible as interest.
    (8) Residence. The term former residence refers to the taxpayer's 
principal residence before his departure for his new principal place of 
work. The term new residence refers to the taxpayer's principal 
residence within the general location of his new principal place of 
work. Thus, neither term includes other residences owned or maintained 
by the taxpayer or members of his family or seasonal residences such as 
a summer beach cottage. Whether or not property is used by the taxpayer 
as his principal residence depends upon all the facts and circumstances 
in each case. Property used by the taxpayer as his principal residence 
may include a houseboat, a housetrailer, or similar

[[Page 330]]

dwelling. The term new place of residence generally includes the area 
within which the taxpayer might reasonably be expected to commute to his 
new principal place of work.
    (9) Dollar limitations. (i) Expenses described in subparagraphs (A) 
and (B) of section 217(b)(1) are not subject to an overall dollar 
limitation. Thus, assuming all other requirements of section 217 are 
satisfied, a taxpayer who, in connection with his commencement of work 
at a new principal place of work, pays or incurs reasonable expenses of 
moving household goods and personal effects from his former residence to 
his new place of residence and reasonable expenses of traveling, 
including meals and lodging, from his former residence to his new place 
of residence is permitted to deduct the entire amount of these expenses.
    (ii) Expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of 
section 217(b)(1) are subject to an overall dollar limitation for each 
commencement of work of 3,000 ($2,500 in the case of a commencement of 
work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977), of which the 
expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section 217(b)(1) 
cannot exceed $1,500 ($1,000 in the case of a commencement of work in a 
taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977). The dollar limitation 
applies to the amount of expenses paid or incurred in connection with 
each commencement of work and not to the amount of expenses paid or 
incurred in each taxable year. Thus, for example, a taxpayer who paid or 
incurred $2,000 of expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) 
of section 217(b)(1) in taxable year 1977 in connection with his 
commencement of work at a principal place of work and paid or incurred 
an additional $2,000 of such expenses in taxable year 1978 in connection 
with the same commencement of work is permitted to deduct the $2,000 of 
such expenses paid or incurred in taxable year 1977 and only $1,000 of 
such expenses paid or incurred in taxable year 1978.
    (iii) A taxpayer who pays or incurs expenses described in 
subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) in connection with 
the same commencement of work may choose to deduct any combination of 
such expenses within the dollar amounts specified in subdivision (ii) of 
this subparagraph. For example, a taxpayer who pays or incurs such 
expenses in connection with the same commencement of work may either 
choose to deduct: (a) Expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of 
section 217(b)(1) to the extent of $1,500 ($1,000 in the case of a 
commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977) 
before deducting any of the expenses described in subparagraph (E) of 
such section, or (b) expenses described in subparagraph (E) of section 
217(b)(1) to the extent of $3,000 ($2,500 in the case of a commencement 
of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977) before 
deducting any of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of 
such section.
    (iv) For the purpose of computing the dollar limitation contained in 
subparagraph (A) of section 217(b)(3) a commencement of work by a 
taxpayer at a new principal place of work and a commencement of work by 
his spouse at a new principal place of work which are in the same 
general location constitute a single commencement of work. Two principal 
places of work are treated as being in the same general location where 
the taxpayer and his spouse reside together and commute to their 
principal places of work. Two principal places of work are not treated 
as being in the same general location where, as of the close of the 
taxable year, the taxpayer and his spouse have not shared the same new 
residence nor made specific plans to share the same new residence within 
a determinable time. Under such circumstances, the separate 
commencements of work by a taxpayer and his spouse will be considered 
separately in assigning the dollar limitations and expenses to the 
appropriate return in the manner described in subdivisions (v) and (vi) 
of this subparagraph.
    (v) Moving expenses (described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of 
section 217(b)(1)), paid or incurred with respect to the commencement of 
work by both a husband and wife which is considered a single 
commencement of

[[Page 331]]

work under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph are subject to an 
overall dollar limitation of $3,000 ($2,500 in the case of a 
commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 
1977), per move of which the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and 
(D) of section 217(b)(1) cannot exceed $1,500 ($1,000 in the case of a 
commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 
1977). If separate returns are filed with respect to the commencement of 
work by both a husband and wife which is considered a single 
commencement of work under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph, moving 
expenses (described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 
217(b)(1)) are subject to an overall dollar limitation of $1,500 ($1,250 
in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before 
January 1, 1977), per move of which the expenses described in 
subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section 217(b)(1) cannot exceed $750 ($500 
in the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before 
January 1, 1977) with respect to each return. Where moving expenses are 
paid or incurred in more than 1 taxable year with respect to a single 
commencement of work by a husband and wife they shall, for purposes of 
applying the dollar limitations to such move, be subject to a $3,000 and 
$1,500 limitation ($2,500 and $1,000, respectively, in the case of a 
commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1977) 
for all such years that they file a joint return and shall be subject to 
a separate $1,500 and $750 limitation ($1,250 and $500, respectively, in 
the case of a commencement of work in a taxable year beginning before 
January 1, 1977) for all such years that they file separate returns. If 
a joint return is filed for the first taxable year moving expenses are 
paid or incurred with respect to a move but separate returns are filed 
in a subsequent year, the unused portion of the amount which may be 
deducted shall be allocated equally between the husband and wife in the 
later year. If separate returns are filed for the first taxable year 
such moving expenses are paid or incurred but a joint return is filed in 
a subsequent year, the deductions claimed on their separate returns 
shall be aggregated for purposes of determining the unused portion of 
the amount which may be deducted in the later year.
    (vi) The application of subdivisions (iv) and (v) of this 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, who was transferred by his employer, effective January 
15, 1977, moved from Boston, MA, to Washington, DC. A's wife was 
transferred by her employer, effective January 15, 1977, from Boston, 
MA, to Baltimore, MD. A and his wife reside together at the same new 
residence. A and his wife are cash basis taxpayers and file a joint 
return for taxable year 1977. Because A and his wife reside together at 
the new residence, the commencement of work by both is considered a 
single commencement of work under subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph. 
They are permitted to deduct with respect to their commencement of work 
in Washington and Baltimore up to $3,000 of the expenses described in 
subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) of which the 
expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of such section cannot 
exceed $1,500.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that for 
taxable year 1977, A and his wife file separate returns. Because A and 
his wife reside together, the commencement of work by both is considered 
a single commencement of work under subdivision (iv) of this 
subparagraph. A is permitted to deduct with respect to his commencement 
of work in Washington up to $1,500 of the expenses described in 
subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) of which the 
expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) cannot exceed $750. A is 
not permitted to deduct any of the expenses described in subparagraphs 
(C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) paid by his wife in connection 
with her commencement of work at a new principal place of work. A's wife 
is permitted to deduct with respect to her commencement of work in 
Baltimore up to $1,500 of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C), 
(D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) that are paid by her of which the 
expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) cannot exceed $750. A's 
wife is not permitted to deduct any of the expenses described in 
subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) paid by A in 
connection with his commencement of work in Washington, DC.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that A and 
his wife take up separate residences in Washington and Baltimore, do not 
reside together during the entire taxable year, and have no specific 
plans to reside together. The commencement of work by A in Washington, 
DC, and by his wife in Baltimore are considered separate

[[Page 332]]

commencements of work since their principal places of work are not 
treated as being in the same general location. If A and his wife file a 
joint return for taxable year 1977, the moving expenses described in 
subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of section 217(b)(1) paid in connection 
with the commencement of work by A in Washington, DC, and his wife in 
Baltimore, MD, are subject to an overall limitation of $6,000 of which 
the expenses described in subparagrahs (C) and (D) cannot exceed $3,000. 
If A and his wife file separate returns for taxable year 1977, A may 
deduct up to $3,000 of the expenses described in subparagraphs (C), (D), 
and (E) of which the expenses described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) 
cannot exceed $1,500. A's wife may deduct up to $3,000 of the expenses 
described in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E) of which the expenses 
described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) cannot exceed $1,500.

    (10) Individuals other than taxpayer. (i) In addition to the 
expenses set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of section 217(b)(1) 
attributable to the taxpayer alone, the same type of expenses 
attributable to certain individuals other than the taxpayer, if paid or 
incurred by the taxpayer, are deductible. These other individuals must 
be members of the taxpayer's household, and have both the taxpayer's 
former residence and his new residence as their principal place of 
abode. A member of the taxpayer's household includes any individual 
residing at the taxpayer's residence who is neither a tenant nor an 
employee of the taxpayer. Thus, for example, a member of the taxpayer's 
household may not be an individual such as a servant, governess, 
chauffeur, nurse, valet, or personal attendant. However, for purposes of 
this paragraph, a tenant or employee will be considered a member of the 
taxpayer's household where the tenant or employee is a dependent of the 
taxpayer as defined in section 152.
    (ii) In addition to the expenses set forth in section 217(b)(2) paid 
or incurred by the taxpayer attributable to property sold, purchased, or 
leased by the taxpayer alone, the same type of expenses paid or incurred 
by the taxpayer attributable to property sold, purchased, or leased by 
the taxpayer's spouse or by the taxpayer and his spouse are deductible 
providing such property is used by the taxpayer as his principal place 
of residence.
    (c) Conditions for allowance--(1) In general. Section 217(c) 
provides two conditions which must be satisfied in order for a deduction 
of moving expenses to be allowed under section 217(a). The first is a 
minimum distance condition prescribed by section 217(c)(1), and the 
second is a minimum period of employment condition prescribed by section 
217(c)(2).
    (2) Minimum distance. For purposes of applying the minimum distance 
condition of section 217(c)(1) all taxpayers are divided into one or the 
other of the following categories: Taxpayers having a former principal 
place of work, and taxpayers not having a former principal place of 
work. Included in this latter category are individuals who are seeking 
fulltime employment for the first time either as an employee or on a 
self- employed basis (for example, recent high school or college 
graduates), or individuals who are reentering the labor force after a 
substantial period of unemployment or part-time employment.
    (i) In the case of a taxpayer having a former principal place of 
work, section 217(c)(1)(A) provides that no deduction is allowable 
unless the distance between the former residence and the new principal 
place of work exceeds by at least 35 miles (50 miles in the case of 
expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 
1977) the distance between the former residence and the former principal 
place of work.
    (ii) In the case of a taxpayer not having a former principal place 
of work, section 217(c)(1)(B) provides that no deduction is allowable 
unless the distance between the former residence and the new principal 
place of work is at least 35 miles (50 miles in the case of expenses 
paid or incurred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1977).
    (iii) For purposes of measuring distances under section 217(c)(1) 
the distance between two geographic points is measured by the shortest 
of the more commonly traveled routes between such points. The shortest 
of the more commonly traveled routes refers to the line of travel and 
the mode or modes of transportation commonly used to go between two 
geographic points comprising the shortest distance between

[[Page 333]]

such points irrespective of the route used by the taxpayer.
    (3) Principal place of work. (i) A taxpayer's principal place of 
work usually is the place where he spends most of his working time. The 
principal place of work of a taxpayer who performs services as an 
employee is his employer's plant, office, shop, store, or other 
property. The principal place of work of a taxpayer who is self-employed 
is the plant, office, shop, store, or other property which serves as the 
center of his business activities. However, a taxpayer may have a 
principal place of work even if there is no one place where he spends a 
substantial portion of his working time. In such case, the taxpayer's 
principal place of work is the place where his business activities are 
centered--for example, because he reports there for work, or is required 
either by his employer or the nature of his employment to ``base'' his 
employment there. Thus, while a member of a railroad crew may spend most 
of his working time aboard a train, his principal place of work is his 
home terminal, station, or other such central point where he reports in, 
checks out, or receives instructions. The principal place of work of a 
taxpayer who is employed by a number of employers on a relatively short-
term basis, and secures employment by means of a union hall system (such 
as a construction or building trades worker) would be the union hall.
    (ii) Where a taxpayer has more than one employment (i.e., the 
taxpayer is employed by more than one employer, or is self-employed in 
more than one trade or business, or is an employee and is self-employed 
at any particular time) his principal place of work is determined with 
reference to his principal employment. The location of a taxpayer's 
principal place of work is a question of fact determined on the basis of 
the particular circumstances in each case. The more important factors to 
be considered in making this determination are (a) the total time 
ordinarily spent by the taxpayer at each place, (b) the degree of the 
taxpayer's business activity at each place, and (c) the relative 
significance of the financial return to the taxpayer from each place.
    (iii) Where a taxpayer maintains inconsistent positions by claiming 
a deduction for expenses of meals and lodging while away from home 
(incurred in the general location of the new principal place of work) 
under section 162 (relating to trade or business expenses) and by 
claiming a deduction under this section for moving expenses incurred in 
connection with the commencement of work at such place of work, it will 
be a question of facts and circumstances as to whether such new place of 
work will be considered a principal place of work, and accordingly, 
which category of deductions he will be allowed.
    (4) Minimum period of employment. (i) Under section 217(c)(2) no 
deduction is allowed unless:
    (a) Where a taxpayer is an employee, during the 12-month period 
immediately following his arrival in the general location of the new 
principal place of work, he is a full-time employee, in such general 
location, during at least 39 weeks, or
    (b) Where a taxpayer is a self-employed individual (including a 
taxpayer who is also an employee, but is unable to satisfy the 
requirements of the 39-week test of (a) of this subdivision (i)), during 
the 24-month period immediately following his arrival in the general 
location of the new principal place of work, he is a full-time employee 
or performs services as a self-employed individual on a full-time basis, 
in such general location, during at least 78 weeks, of which not less 
than 39 weeks are during the 12-month period referred to above.

Where a taxpayer works as an employee and at the same time performs 
services as a self-employed individual his principal employment 
(determined according to subdivision (i) of subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph) governs whether the 39-week or 78-week test is applicable.
    (ii) The 12-month period and the 39- week period set forth in 
subparagraph (A) of section 217(c)(2) and the 12- and 24-month periods 
as well as 39- and 78- week periods set forth in subparagraph (B) of 
such section are measured from the date of the taxpayer's arrival in the 
general location of the new principal place of work. Generally, date of 
arrival is the date of the termination

[[Page 334]]

of the last trip preceding the taxpayer's commencement of work on a 
regular basis and is not the date the taxpayer's family or household 
goods and effects arrive.
    (iii) The taxpayer need not remain in the employ of the same 
employer or remain self-employed in the same trade or business for the 
required number of weeks. However, he must be employed in the same 
general location of the new principal place of work during such period. 
The general location of the new principal place of work refers to a 
general commutation area and is usually the same area as the ``new place 
of residence''; see paragraph (b)(8) of this section.
    (iv) Only those weeks during which the taxpayer is a full-time 
employee or during which he performs services as a self-employed 
individual on a full-time basis qualify as a week of work for purposes 
of the minimum period of employment condition of section 217(c)(2).
    (a) Whether an employee is a full-time employee during any 
particular week depends upon the customary practices of the occupation 
in the geographic area in which the taxpayer works. Where employment is 
on a seasonal basis, weeks occurring in the off-season when no work is 
required or available may be counted as weeks of full-time employment 
only if the employee's contract or agreement of employment covers the 
off-season period and such period is less than 6 months. Thus, for 
example, a schoolteacher whose employment contract covers a 12-month 
period and who teaches on a full-time basis for more than 6 months is 
considered a full-time employee during the entire 12-month period. A 
taxpayer will be treated as a full-time employee during any week of 
involuntary temporary absence from work because of illness, strikes, 
shutouts, layoffs, natural disasters, etc. A taxpayer will, also, be 
treated as a full-time employee during any week in which he voluntarily 
absents himself from work for leave or vacation provided for in his 
contract or agreement of employment.
    (b) Whether a taxpayer performs services as a self-employed 
individual on a full-time basis during any particular week depends on 
the practices of the trade or business in the geographic area in which 
the taxpayer works. For example, a self-employed dentist maintaining 
office hours 4 days a week is considered to perform services as a self-
employed individual on a full-time basis providing it is not unusual for 
other self-employed dentists in the geographic area in which the 
taxpayer works to maintain office hours only 4 days a week. Where a 
trade or business is seasonal, weeks occurring during the off-season 
when no work is required or available may be counted as weeks of 
performance of services on a full-time basis only if the off-season is 
less than 6 months and the taxpayer performs services on a full-time 
basis both before and after the off-season. For example, a taxpayer who 
owns and operates a motel at a beach resort is considered to perform 
services as a self-employed individual on a full-time basis if the motel 
is closed for a period not exceeding 6 months during the off-season and 
if he performs services on a full-time basis as the operator of a motel 
both before and after the off-season. A taxpayer will be treated as 
performing services as a self-employed individual on a full-time basis 
during any week of involuntary temporary absence from work because of 
illness, strikes, natural disasters, etc.
    (v) Where taxpayers file a joint return, either spouse may satisfy 
the minimum period of employment condition. However, weeks worked by one 
spouse may not be added to weeks worked by the other spouse in order to 
satisfy such condition. The taxpayer seeking to satisfy the minimum 
period of employment condition must satisfy the condition applicable to 
him. Thus, if a taxpayer is subject to the 39-week condition and his 
spouse is subject to the 78-week condition and the taxpayer satisfies 
the 39-week condition, his spouse need not satisfy the 78-week 
condition. On the other hand, if the taxpayer does not satisfy the 39-
week condition, his spouse in such case must satisfy the 78-week 
condition.
    (vi) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. A is an electrician residing in New York City. He moves 
himself, his family, and his household goods and personal effects, at 
his own expense, to Denver where he

[[Page 335]]

commences employment with the M Aircraft Corporation. After working 
full-time for 30 weeks he voluntarily leaves his job, and he 
subsequently moves to and commences employment in Los Angeles, CA, which 
employment lasts for more than 39 weeks. Since A was not employed in the 
general location of his new principal place of employment in Denver for 
at least 39 weeks, no deduction is allowable for moving expenses paid or 
incurred between New York City and Denver. A will be allowed to deduct 
only those moving expenses attributable to his move from Denver to Los 
Angeles, assuming all other conditions of section 217 are met.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that A's 
wife commences employment in Denver at the same time as A, and that she 
continues to work in Denver for at least 9 weeks after A's departure for 
Los Angeles. Since she has met the 39-week requirement in Denver, and 
assuming all other requirements of section 217 are met, the moving 
expenses paid by A attributable to the move from New York City to Denver 
will be allowed as a deduction, provided A and his wife file a joint 
return. If A and his wife file separate returns moving expenses paid by 
A's wife attributable to the move from New York City to Denver will be 
allowed as a deduction on A's wife's return.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that A's 
wife commences employment in Denver on the same day that A departs for 
Los Angeles, and continues to work in Denver for 9 weeks thereafter. 
Since neither A (who has worked 30 weeks) nor his wife (who has worked 9 
weeks) has independently satisfied the 39-week requirement, no deduction 
for moving expenses attributable to the move from New York City to 
Denver is allowable.

    (d) Rules for application of section 217(c)(2)--(1) Inapplicability 
of minimum period of employment condition in certain cases. Section 
217(d)(1) provides that the minimum period of employment condition of 
section 217(c)(2) does not apply in the case of a taxpayer who is unable 
to meet such condition by reason of:
    (i) Death or disability, or
    (ii) Involuntary separation (other than for willfull misconduct) 
from the service of an employer or separation by reason of transfer for 
the benefit of an employer after obtaining full-time employment in which 
the taxpayer could reasonably have been expected to satisfy such 
condition.

For purposes of subdivision (i) of this paragraph disability shall be 
determined according to the rules in section 72(m)(7) and Sec. 1.72-
17(f). Subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph applies only where the 
taxpayer has obtained full-time employment in which he could reasonably 
have been expected to satisfy the minimum period of employment 
condition. A taxpayer could reasonably have been expected to satisfy the 
minimum period of employment condition if at the time he commences work 
at the new principal place of work he could have been expected, based 
upon the facts known to him at such time, to satisfy such condition. 
Thus, for example, if the taxpayer at the time of transfer was not 
advised by his employer that he planned to transfer him within 6 months 
to another principal place of work, the taxpayer could, in the absence 
of other factors, reasonably have been expected to satisfy the minimum 
employment period condition at the time of the first transfer. On the 
other hand, a taxpayer could not reasonably have been expected to 
satisfy the minimum employment condition if at the time of the 
commencement of the move he knew that his employer's retirement age 
policy would prevent his satisfying the minimum employment period 
condition.
    (2) Election of deduction before minimum period of employment 
condition is satisfied. (i) Paragraph (2) of section 217(d) provides a 
rule which applies where a taxpayer paid or incurred, in a taxable year, 
moving expenses which would be deductible in that taxable year except 
that the minimum period of employment condition of section 217(c)(2) has 
not been satisfied before the time prescribed by law for filing the 
return for such taxable year. The rule provides that where a taxpayer 
has paid or incurred moving expenses and as of the date prescribed by 
section 6072 for filing his return for such taxable year (determined 
with regard to extensions of time for filing) there remains unexpired a 
sufficient portion of the 12-month or the 24-month period so that it is 
still possible for the taxpayer to satisfy the applicable period of 
employment condition, the taxpayer may elect to claim a deduction for 
such moving expenses on the return for such taxable year. The election 
is exercised by taking the deduction on the return.

[[Page 336]]

    (ii) Where a taxpayer does not elect to claim a deduction for moving 
expenses on the return for the taxable year in which such expenses were 
paid or incurred in accordance with subdivision (i) of this subparagraph 
and the applicable minimum period of employment condition of section 
217(c)(2) (as well as all other requirements of section 217) is 
subsequently satisfied, the taxpayer may file an amended return or a 
claim for refund for the taxable year such moving expenses were paid or 
incurred on which he may claim a deduction under section 217.
    (iii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. A is transferred by his employer from Boston, MA, to 
Cleveland, OH. He begins working there on November 1, 1970. Moving 
expenses are paid by A in 1970 in connection with this move. On April 
15, 1971, when he files his income tax return for the year 1970, A has 
been a full-time employee in Cleveland for approximately 24 weeks. 
Although he has not satisfied the 39-week employment condition at this 
time, A may elect to claim his 1970 moving expenses on his 1970 income 
tax return as there is still sufficient time remaining before November 
1, 1971, to satisfy such condition.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that on 
April 15, 1971, A has voluntarily left his employer and is looking for 
other employment in Cleveland. A may not be sure he will be able to meet 
the 39-week employment condition by November 1, 1971. Thus, he may if he 
wishes wait until such condition is met and file an amended return 
claiming as a deduction the expenses paid in 1970. Instead of filing an 
amended return A may file a claim for refund based on a deduction for 
such expenses. If A fails to meet the 39-week employment condition on or 
before November 1, 1971, no deduction is allowable for such expenses.
    Example 3. B is a self-employed accountant. He moves from Rochester, 
NY, to New York, NY, and begins to work there on December 1, 1970. 
Moving expenses are paid by B in 1970 and 1971 in connection with this 
move. On April 15, 1971, when he files his income tax return for the 
year 1970, B has been performing services as a self-employed individual 
on a full-time basis in New York City for approximately 20 weeks. 
Although he has not satisfied the 78-week employment condition at this 
time, A may elect to claim his 1970 moving expenses on his 1970 income 
tax return as there is still sufficient time remaining before December 
1, 1972, to satisfy such condition. On April 15, 1972, when he files his 
income tax return for the year 1971, B has been performing services as a 
self-employed individual on a full-time basis in New York City for 
approximately 72 weeks. Although he has not met the 78-week employment 
condition at this time, B may elect to claim his 1971 moving expenses on 
his 1971 income tax return as there is still sufficient time remaining 
before December 1, 1972, to satisfy such requirement.

    (3) Recapture of deduction. Paragraph (3) of section 217(d) provides 
a rule which applies where a taxpayer has deducted moving expenses under 
the election provided in section 217(d)(2) prior to satisfying the 
applicable minimum period of employment condition and such condition 
cannot be satisfied at the close of a subsequent taxable year. In such 
cases an amount equal to the expenses deducted must be included in the 
taxpayer's gross income for the taxable year in which the taxpayer is no 
longer able to satisfy such minimum period of employment condition. 
Where the taxpayer has deducted moving expenses under the election 
provided in section 217(d)(2) for the taxable year and subsequently 
files an amended return for such year on which he does not claim the 
deduction, such expenses are not treated as having been deducted for 
purposes of the recapture rule of the preceding sentence.
    (e) Denial of double benefit--(1) In general. Section 217(e) 
provides a rule for computing the amount realized and the basis where 
qualified real estate expenses are allowed as a deduction under section 
217(a).
    (2) Sale or exchange of residence. Section 217(e) provides that the 
amount realized on the sale or exchange of a residence owned by the 
taxpayer, by the taxpayer's spouse, or by the taxpayer and his spouse 
and used by the taxpayer as his principal place of residence is not 
decreased by the amount of any expenses described in subparagraph (A) of 
section 217(b)(2) and deducted under section 217(a). For the purposes of 
section 217(e) and of this paragraph the term amount realized'' has the 
same meaning as under section 1001(b) and the regulations thereunder. 
Thus, for example, if the taxpayer sells a residence used as his 
principal place of residence and real estate commissions or similar 
expenses described in subparagraph (A) of section 217(b)(2)

[[Page 337]]

are deducted by him pursuant to section 217(a), the amount realized on 
the sale of the residence is not reduced by the amount of such real 
estate commissions or such similar expenses described in subparagraph 
(A) of section 217(b)(2).
    (3) Purchase of a residence. Section 217(e) provides that the basis 
of a residence purchased or received in exchange for other property by 
the taxpayer, by the taxpayer's spouse, or by the taxpayer and his 
spouse and used by the taxpayer as his principal place of residence is 
not increased by the amount of any expenses described in subparagraph 
(B) of section 217(b)(2) and deducted under section 217(a). For the 
purposes of section 217(e) and of this paragraph the term basis has the 
same meaning as under section 1011 and the regulations thereunder. Thus, 
for example, if a taxpayer purchases a residence to be used as his 
principal place of residence and attorneys' fees or similar expenses 
described in subparagraph (B) of section 217(b)(2) are deducted pursuant 
to section 217(a), the basis of such residence is not increased by the 
amount of such attorneys' fees or such similar expenses described in 
subparagraph (B) of section 217(b)(2).
    (4) Inapplicability of section 217(e). (i) Section 217(e) and 
subparagraphs (1) through (3) of this paragraph do not apply to any 
expenses with respect to which an amount is included in gross income 
under section 217(d)(3). Thus, the amount of any expenses described in 
subparagraph (A) of section 217(b)(2) deducted in the year paid or 
incurred pursuant to the election under section 217(d)(2) and 
subsequently recaptured pursuant to section 217(d)(3) may be taken into 
account in computing the amount realized on the sale or exchange of the 
residence described in such subparagraph. Also, the amount of expenses 
described in subparagraph (B) of section 217(b)(2) deducted in the year 
paid or incurred pursuant to such election under section 217(d)(2) and 
subsequently recaptured pursuant to section 217(d)(3) may be taken into 
account as an adjustment to the basis of the residence described in such 
subparagraph.
    (ii) The application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A was notified of his transfer effective December 15, 
1972, from Seattle, WA, to Philadelphia, PA. In connection with the 
transfer A sold his house in Seattle on November 10, 1972. Expenses 
incident to the sale of the house of $2,500 were paid by A prior to or 
at the time of the closing of the contract of sale on December 10, 1972. 
The amount realized on the sale of the house was $47,500 and the 
adjusted basis of the house was $30,000. Pursuant to the election 
provided in section 217(d)(2), A deducted the expenses of moving from 
Seattle to Philadelphia including the expenses incident to the sale of 
his former residence in taxable year 1972. Dissatisfied with his 
position with his employer in Philadelphia, A took a position with an 
employer in Chicago, IL, on July 15, 1973. Since A was no longer able to 
satisfy the minimum period employment condition at the close of taxable 
year 1973 he included an amount equal to the amount deducted as moving 
expenses including the expenses incident to the sale of his former 
residence in gross income for taxable year 1973. A is permitted to 
decrease the amount realized on the sale of the house by the amount of 
the expenses incident to the sale of the house deducted from gross 
income and subsequently included in gross income. Thus, the amount 
realized on the sale of the house is decreased from $47,500 to $45,000 
and thus, the gain on the sale of the house is reduced from $17,500 to 
$15,000. A is allowed to file an amended return or a claim for refund in 
order to reflect the recomputation of the amount realized.
    Example 2. B, who is self-employed decided to move from Washington, 
DC, to Los Angeles, CA. In connection with the commencement of work in 
Los Angeles on March 1, 1973, B purchased a house in a suburb of Los 
Angeles for $65,000. Expenses incident to the purchase of the house in 
the amount of $1,500 were paid by B prior to or at the time of the 
closing of the contract of sale on September 15, 1973. Pursuant to the 
election provided in section 217(d)(2), B deducted the expenses of 
moving from Washington to Los Angeles including the expenses incident to 
the purchase of his new residence in taxable year 1973. Dissatisfied 
with his prospects in Los Angeles, B moved back to Washington on July 1, 
1974. Since B was no longer able to satisfy the minimum period of 
employment condition at the close of taxable year 1974 he included an 
amount equal to the amount deducted as moving expenses incident to the 
purchase of the former residence in gross income for taxable year 1974. 
B is permitted to increase the basis of the house by the

[[Page 338]]

amount of the expenses incident to the purchase of the house deducted 
from gross income and subsequently included in gross income. Thus, the 
basis of the house is increased to $66,500.

    (f) Rules for self-employed individuals--(1) Definition. Section 
217(f)(1) defines the term self-employed individual for purposes of 
section 217 to mean an individual who performs personal services either 
as the owner of the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or 
business or as a partner in a partnership carrying on a trade or 
business. The term self-employed individual does not include the 
semiretired, part-time students, or other similarly situated taxpayers 
who work only a few hours each week. The application of this 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. A is the owner of the entire interest in an unincorporated 
construction business. A hires a manager who performs all of the daily 
functions of the business including the negotiation of contracts with 
customers, the hiring and firing of employees, the purchasing of 
materials used on the projects, and other similar services. A and his 
manager discuss the operations of the business about once a week over 
the telephone. Otherwise A does not perform any managerial services for 
the business. For the purposes of section 217, A is not considered to be 
a self-employed individual.

    (2) Rule for application of subsection (b)(1) (C) and (D). Section 
217(f)(2) provides that for purposes of subparagraphs (C) and (D) of 
section 217(b)(1) an individual who commences work at a new principal 
place of work as a self-employed individual is treated as having 
obtained employment when he has made substantial arrangements to 
commence such work. Whether the taxpayer has made substantial 
arrangements to commence work at a new principal place of work is 
determined on the basis of all the facts and circumstances in each case. 
The factors to be considered in this determination depend upon the 
nature of the taxpayer's trade or business and include such 
considerations as whether the taxpayer has: (i) Leased or purchased a 
plant, office, shop, store, equipment, or other property to be used in 
the trade or business, (ii) made arrangements to purchase inventory or 
supplies to be used in connection with the operation of the trade or 
business, (iii) entered into commitments with individuals to be employed 
in the trade or business, and (iv) made arrangements to contact 
customers or clients in order to advertise the business in the general 
location of the new principal place of work. The application of this 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, a partner in a growing chain of drug stores decided to 
move from Houston, TX, to Dallas, TX, in order to open a drug store in 
Dallas. A made several trips to Dallas for the purpose of looking for a 
site for the drug store. After the signing of a lease on a building in a 
shopping plaza, suppliers were contacted, equipment was purchased, and 
employees were hired. Shortly before the opening of the store A and his 
wife moved from Houston to Dallas and took up temporary quarters in a 
motel until the time their apartment was available. By the time he and 
his wife took up temporary quarters in the motel A was considered to 
have made substantial arrangements to commence work at the new principal 
place of work.
    Example 2. B, who is a partner in a securities brokerage firm in New 
York, NY, decided to move to Rochester, NY, to become the resident 
partner in the firm's new Rochester office. After a lease was signed on 
an office in downtown Rochester B moved to Rochester and took up 
temporary quarters in a motel until his apartment became available. 
Before the opening of the office B supervised the decoration of the 
office, the purchase of equipment and supplies necessary for the 
operation of the office, the hiring of personnel for the office, as well 
as other similar activities. By the time B took up temporary quarters in 
the motel he was considered to have made substantial arrangements to 
commence to work at the new principal place of work.
    Example 3. C, who is about to complete his residency in 
ophthalmology at a hospital in Pittsburgh, PA, decided to fly to 
Philadelphia, PA, for the purpose of looking into opportunities for 
practicing in that city. Following his arrival in Philadelphia C decided 
to establish his practice in that city. He leased an office and an 
apartment. At the time he departed Pittsburgh for Philadelphia C was not 
considered to have made substantial arrangements to commence work at the 
new principal place of work, and, therefore, is not allowed to deduct 
expenses described in subparagraph (C) of section 217(b)(1) (relating to 
expenses of traveling (including meals and lodging), after obtaining 
employment, from the former residence to the general location of the new 
principal place of work and return, for the principal purpose of 
searching for a new residence).

    (g) Rules for members of the Armed Forces of the United States--(1) 
In general. The rules in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2), (b), and (e) of this 
section apply to moving expenses paid or incurred by members of the 
Armed Forces of the United States on active duty who move pursuant to a 
military order and incident to a permament change of station, except as 
provided in this paragraph (g). However, if the moving expenses are not 
paid or incurred incident to a permanent change of station, this 
paragraph (g) does not apply, but all other paragraphs of this section 
do apply. The provisions of this paragraph apply to taxable years 
beginning December 31, 1975.
    (2) Treatment of services or reimbursement provided by Government--
(i) Services in kind. The value of any moving or storage services 
furnished by the United States Government to members of the Armed 
Forces, their spouses, or their dependents in connection with a 
permanent change of station is not includible in gross income. The 
Secretary of Defense and (in cases involving members of the peacetime 
Coast Guard) the Secretary of Transportation are not required to report 
or withhold taxes with respect to those services. Services furnished by 
the Government include services rendered directly by the Government or 
rendered by a third party who is compensated directly by the Government 
for the services.
    (ii) Reimbursements. The following rules apply to reimbursements or 
allowances by the Government to members of the Armed Forces, their 
spouses, or their dependents for moving or storage expenses paid or 
incurred by them in connection with a permanent change of station. If 
the reimbursement or allowance exceeds the actual expenses paid or 
incurred, the excess is includible in the gross income of the member, 
and the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of Transportation must report 
the excess as payment of wages and withhold income taxes under section 
3402 and the employee taxes under section 3102 with respect to that 
excess. If the reimbursemet or allowance does not exceed the actual 
expenses, the reimbursement or allowance in not includible in gross 
income, and no reporting or withholding by the Secretary of Defense or 
Secretary of Transportation is required. If the actual expenses, as 
limited by paragraph (b)(9) of this section, exceed the reimbursement of 
allowance, the member may deduct the excess if the other requirements of 
this section, as modified by this paragraph, are met. The determination 
of the limitation on actual expenses under paragraph (b)(9) of this 
section is made without regard to any services in kind furnished by the 
Government.
    (3) Permanent change of station. For purposes of this section, the 
term permanent change of station includes the following situations.
    (i) A move from home to the first post of duty when appointed, 
reappointed, reinstated, or inducted.
    (ii) A move from the last post of duty to home or a nearer point in 
the United States in connection with retirement, discharge, resignation, 
separation under honorable conditions, transfer, relief from active 
duty, temporary disability retirement, or transfer to a Fleet Reserve, 
if such move occurs within 1 year of such termination of active duty or 
within the period prescribed by the Joint Travel Regulations promulgated 
under the authority contained in sections 404 through 411 of Title 37 of 
the United States Code.
    (iii) A move from one permanent post of duty to another permanent 
post of duty at a different duty station, even if the member separates 
from the Armed Forces immediately or shortly after the move.

The term permanent, post of duty, duty station, and honorable have the 
meanings given them in appropriate Department of Defense or Department 
of Transportation rules and regulations.
    (4) Storage expenses. This paragraph applies to storage expenses as 
well as to moving expenses described in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section. the term storage expenses means the cost of storing personal 
effects of members of the Armed Forces, their spouses, and their 
dependents.
    (5) Moves of spouses and dependents. (i) The following special rule 
applies for purposes of paragraphs (b)(9) and (10) of this section, if 
the spouse or dependents of a member of the Armed Forces move to or from 
a different location

[[Page 340]]

than does the member. In this case, the spouse is considered to have 
commenced work as an employee at a new principal place of work that is 
within the same general location as the location to which the member 
moves.
    (ii) The following special rule applies for purposes of this 
paragraph to moves by spouses or dependents of members of the Armed 
Forces who die, are imprisoned, or desert while on active duty. In these 
cases, a move to a member's place of enlistment or induction or the 
member's, spouse's, or dependent's home of record or nearer point in the 
United States is considered incident to a permanent change of station.
    (6) Disallowance of deduction. No deduction is allowed under this 
section for any moving or storage expense reimbursed by an allowance 
that is excluded from gross income.
    (h) Special rules for foreign moves--(1) Increase in limitations. In 
the case of a foreign move (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this 
section), paragraph (b)(6) of this section shall be applied by 
substituting ``90 consecutive'' for ``30 consecutive'' each time it 
appears. Paragraph (b)(9) (ii), (iii) and (v) of this section shall be 
applied by substituting ``$6,000'' for ``$3,000'' each time it appears 
and by substituting ``$4,500'' for ``$1,500'' each time it appears. 
Paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section shall be applied by substituting 
``$5,000'' for ``$2,000'' each time it appears and by substituting 
``1979'' for ``1977'' and ``1980'' for ``1978'' each time they appear in 
the last sentence. Paragraph (b)(9)(v) of this section shall be applied 
by substituting ``$2,250'' for ``$750'' each time it appears. Paragraph 
(b)(9)(vi) of this section does not apply.
    (2) Allowance of certain storage fees. In the case of a foreign 
move, for purposes of this section, the moving expenses described in 
paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall include the reasonable expenses 
of moving household goods and personal effects to and from storage, and 
of storing such goods and effects for part or all of the period during 
which the new place of work continues to be the taxpayer's principal 
place of work.
    (3) Foreign move. For purposes of this paragraph, the term foreign 
move means a move in connection with the commencement of work by the 
taxpayer at a new principal place of work located outside the United 
States. Thus, a move from the United States to a foreign country or from 
one foreign country to another foreign country qualifies as a foreign 
move. A move within a foreign country also qualifies as a foreign move. 
A move from a foreign country to the United States does not qualify as a 
foreign move.
    (4) United States. For purposes of this paragraph, the term United 
States includes the possessions of the United States.
    (5) Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph apply to 
expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 
1978. The paragraph also applies to the expenses paid or incurred in the 
taxable year beginning during 1978 of taxpayers who do not make an 
election pursuant to section 209(c) of the Foreign Earned Income Act of 
1978 (Pub. L. 95-615, 92 Stat. 3109) to have section 911 under prior law 
apply to that taxable year.
    (i) Allowance of deductions in case of retirees or decedents who 
were working abroad--(1) In general. In the case of any qualified 
retiree moving expenses or qualified survivor moving expenses, this 
section (other than paragraph (h)) shall be applied to such expenses as 
if they were incurred in connection with the commencement of work by the 
taxpayer as an employee at a new principal place of work located within 
the United States and the limitations of paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section (relating to the minimum period of employment) shall not apply.
    (2) Qualified retiree moving expenses. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term qualified retiree moving expenses means any moving 
expenses which are incurred by an individual whose former principal 
place of work and former residence were outside the United States and 
which are incurred for a move to a new residence in the United States in 
connection with the bona fide retirement of the individual. Bona fide 
retirement means the permanent withdrawal from gainful full-time 
employment and self-employment. An individual who at the time of 
withdrawal from gainful full-time employment or self-employment, intends 
the withdrawal to be

[[Page 341]]

permanent shall be considered to be a bona fide retiree even though the 
individual ultimately resumes gainful full-time employment or self-
employment. An individual's intention may be evidenced by relevant facts 
and circumstances which include the age and health of the individual, 
the customary retirement age of employees engaged in similar work, 
whether the individual is receiving a retirement allowance under a 
pension annuity, retirement or similar fund or system, and the length of 
time before resuming full-time employment or self-employment.
    (3) Qualified survivor moving expenses. (i) For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term qualified survivor moving expenses means any moving 
expenses:
    (A) Which are paid or incurred by the spouse or any dependent (as 
defined in section 152) of any decedent who (as of the time of his 
death) had a principal place of work outside the United States, and
    (B) Which are incurred for a move which begins within 6 months after 
the death of the decedent and which is to a residence in the United 
States from a former residence outside the United States which (as of 
the time of the decedent's death) was the residence of such decedent and 
the individual paying or incurring the expense.
    (ii) For purposes of paragraph (i)(3) (i) (B) of this section, a 
move begins when:
    (A) The taxpayer contracts for the moving of his or her household 
goods and personal effects to a residence in the United States but only 
if the move is completed within a reasonable time thereafter;
    (B) The taxpayer's household goods and personal effects are packed 
and in transit to a residence in the United States; or
    (C) The taxpayer leaves the former residence to travel to a new 
place of residence in the United States.
    (4) United States. For purposes of this paragraph, the term United 
States includes the possessions of the United States.
    (5) Effective date. The provisions of this paragraph apply to 
expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 
1978. The paragraph also applies to the expenses paid or incurred in the 
taxable year beginning during 1978 of taxpayers who do not make an 
election pursuant to section 209(c) of the Foreign Earned Income Act of 
1978 (Pub. L. 95-615, 92 Stat. 3109) to have section 911 under prior law 
apply to that taxable year.
    (j) Effective date--(1) In general. This section, except as provided 
in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, is applicable to items 
paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969.
    (2) Reimbursement not included in gross income. This section does 
not apply to items to the extent that the taxpayer received or accrued 
in a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, a reimbursement or 
other expense allowance for such items which was not included in his 
gross income.
    (3) Election in cases of expenses paid or incurred before January 1, 
1971, in connection with certain moves--(i) In general. A taxpayer who 
was notified by his employer on or before December 19, 1969, of a 
transfer to a new principal place of work and who pays or incurs moving 
expenses after December 31, 1969, but before January 1, 1971, in 
connection with such transfer may elect to have the rules governing 
moving expenses in effect prior to the effective date of section 231 of 
the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 577) govern such expenses. If such 
election is made, this section and section 82 and the regulations 
thereunder do not apply to such expenses. A taxpayer is considered to 
have been notified on or before December 19, 1969, by his employer of a 
transfer, for example, if before such date the employer has sent a 
notice to all employees or a reasonably defined group of employees, 
which includes such taxpayer, of a relocation of the operations of such 
employer from one plant or facility to another plant or facility. An 
employee who is transferred to a new principal place of work for the 
benefit of his employer and who makes an election under this paragraph 
is permitted to exclude amounts received or accrued, directly or 
indirectly, as payment for or reimbursement of expenses of moving 
household goods and personal effects from the former residence to the 
new residence and of traveling (including meals and lodging) from the

[[Page 342]]

former residence to the new place of residence. Such exclusion is 
limited to amounts received or accrued, directly or indirectly, as a 
payment for or reimbursement of the expenses described above. Amounts in 
excess of actual expenses paid or incurred must be included in gross 
income. No deduction is allowable under section 217 for expenses 
representing amounts excluded from gross income. Also, an employee who 
is transferred to a new principal place of work which is less than 50 
miles but at least 20 miles farther from his former residence than was 
his former principal place of work and who is not reimbursed, either 
directly or indirectly, for the expenses described above is permitted to 
deduct such expenses providing all of the requirements of section 217 
and the regulations thereunder prior to the effective date of section 
231 of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 577) are satisfied.
    (ii) Election made before the date of publication of this notice as 
a Treasury decision. An election under this subparagraph made before the 
date of publication of this notice as a Treasury decision shall be made 
pursuant to the procedure prescribed in temporary income tax regulations 
relating to treatment of payments of expenses of moving from one 
residence to another residence (Part 13 of this chapter) T.D. 7032 (35 
FR 4330), approved Mar. 11, 1970.
    (iii) Election made on or after the date of publication of this 
notice as a Treasury decision. An election made under this subparagraph 
on or after the date of publication of this notice as a Treasury 
decision shall be made not later than the time, including extensions 
thereof, prescribed by law for filing the income tax return for the year 
in which the expenses were paid or 30 days after the date of publication 
of this notice as a Treasury decision, whichever occurs last. The 
election shall be made by a statement attached to the return (or the 
amended return) for the taxable year, setting forth the following 
information:
    (a) The items to which the election relates;
    (b) The amount of each item;
    (c) The date each item was paid or incurred; and
    (d) The date the taxpayer was informed by his employer of his 
transfer to the new principal place of work.
    (iv) Revocation of election. An election made in accordance with 
this subparagraph is revocable upon the filing by the taxpayer of an 
amended return or a claim for refund with the district director, or the 
director of the Internal Revenue service center with whom the election 
was filed not later than the time prescribed by law, including 
extensions thereof, for the filing of a claim for refund with respect to 
the items to which the election relates.

    (2) An annuity plan described in section 403(a),
    (3) A qualified bond purchase plan described in section 405(a), or
    (4) A retirement plan established for its employees by the United 
States, by a State or political subdivision thereof, or by an agency or 
instrumentality of any of the foregoing, or
    (B) Amounts were contributed by his employer for an annuity contract 
described in section 403(b) (whether or not the individual's rights in 
such contract are nonforfeitable).
    (ii) Contributions after age 70\1/2\. No deduction is allowable 
under section 219 (a) to an individual for the taxable year of the 
individual, if he has attained the age of 70\1/2\ before the close of 
such taxable year.
    (iii) Rollover contributions. No deduction is allowable under 
section 219 for any taxable year of an individual with respect to a 
rollover contribution described in section 402(a)(5), 402(a)(7), 
403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), or 409(b)(3)(C).
    (3) Amounts contributed under endowment contracts. (i) For any 
taxable year, no deduction is allowable under section 219(a) for amounts 
paid under an endowment contract described in Sec. 1.408-3(e) which is 
allocable under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph to the cost of 
life insurance.
    (ii) For any taxable year, the cost of current life insurance 
protection under an endowment contract described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) 
of this section is the product of the net premium cost, as determined by 
the Commissioner, and the excess, if any, of the death benefit payable 
under the contract during the policy year beginning in the taxable year 
over the cash value of the contract at the end of such policy year.
    (iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. A, an individual who is otherwise entitled to the maximum 
deduction allowed under section 219, purchases, at age 20, an endowment 
contract described in Sec. 1.408-3(e) which provides for the payment of 
an annuity of $100 per month, at age 65, with a minimum death benefit of 
$10,000, and an annual premium of $220. The cash value at the end of the 
first policy year is 0. The net premium cost, as determined by the 
Commissioner, for A's age is $1.61 per thousand dollars of life 
insurance protection. The cost of current life insurance protection is 
$16.10 ($1.61  x 10). A's maximum deduction under section 219 with 
respect to amounts paid under the endowment contract for the taxable 
year in which the first policy year begins is $203.90 ($220 - $16.10).
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the 
cash value at the end of the second policy year is $200 and the net 
premium cost is $1.67 per thousand for A's age. The cost of current life 
insurance protection is $16.37 ($1.67  x 9.8). A's maximum deduction 
under section 219 with respect to amounts paid under the endowment 
contract for the taxable year in which the second policy year begins is 
$203.63 ($220 - $16.37).

    (c) Definitions and special rules--(1) Compensation. For purposes of 
this section, the term compensation means wages, salaries, professional 
fees, or other amounts derived from or received for personal service 
actually rendered (including, but not limited to, commissions paid 
salesmen, compensation for services on the basis of a percentage of 
profits, commissions on insurance premiums, tips, and bonuses) and 
includes earned income, as defined in section 401 (c) (2), but does not 
include amounts derived from or received as earnings or profits from 
property (including, but not limited to, interest and dividends) or 
amounts not includible in gross income.
    (2) Active participant. For the definition of active participant, 
see Sec. 1.219-2.
    (3) Special rules.  (i) The maximum deduction allowable under 
section 219(b)(1) is computed separately for

[[Page 344]]

each individual. Thus, if a husband and wife each has compensation of 
$10,000 for the taxable year and they are each otherwise eligible to 
contribute to an individual retirement account and they file a joint 
return, then the maximum amount allowable as a deduction under section 
219 is $3,000, the sum of the individual maximums of $1,500. However, 
if, for example, the husband has compensation of $20,000, the wife has 
no compensation, each is otherwise eligible to contribute to an 
individual retirement account for the taxable year, and they file a 
joint return, the maximum amount allowable as a deduction under section 
219 is $1,500.
    (ii) Section 219 is to be applied without regard to any community 
property laws. Thus, if, for example, a husband and wife, who are 
otherwise eligible to contribute to an individual retirement account, 
live in a community property jurisdiction and the husband alone has 
compensation of $20,000 for the taxable year, then the maximum amount 
allowable as a deduction under section 219 is $1,500.
    (4) Employer contributions. For purposes of this chapter, any amount 
paid by an employer to an individual retirement account or for an 
individual retirement annuity or retirement bond constitutes the payment 
of compensation to the employee (other than a self-employed individual 
who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1)) includible 
in his gross income, whether or not a deduction for such payment is 
allowable under section 219 to such employee after the application of 
section 219(b). Thus, an employer will be entitled to a deduction for 
compensation paid to an employee for amounts the employer contributes on 
the employee's behalf to an individual retirement account, for an 
individual retirement annuity, or for a retirement bond if such 
deduction is otherwise allowable under section 162.

[T.D. 7714, 45 FR 52788, Aug. 8, 1980]


<R05>
Sec. 1.219-2  Definition of active participant.

    (a) In general. This section defines the term active participant for 
individuals who participate in retirement plans described in section 
219(b)(2). Any individual who is an active participant in such a plan is 
not allowed a deduction under section 219(a) for contributions to an 
individual retirement account.
    (b) Defined benefit plans--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
subparagraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this paragraph, an individual is an 
active participant in a defined benefit plan if for any portion of the 
plan year ending with or within such individual's taxable year he is not 
excluded under the eligibility provisions of the plan. An individual is 
not an active participant in a particular taxable year merely because 
the individual meets the plan's eligibility requirements during a plan 
year beginning in that particular taxable year but ending in a later 
taxable year of the individual. However, for purposes of this section, 
an individual is deemed not to satisfy the eligibility provisions for a 
particular plan year if his compensation is less than the minimum amount 
of compensation needed under the plan to accrue a benefit. For example, 
assume a plan is integrated with Social Security and only those 
individuals whose compensation exceeds a certain amount accrue benefits 
under the plan. An individual whose compensation for the plan year 
ending with or within his taxable year is less than the amount necessary 
under the plan to accrue a benefit is not an active participant in such 
plan.
    (2) Rules for plans maintained by more than one employer. In the 
case of a defined benefit plan described in section 413(a) and funded at 
least in part by service-related contributions, e.g., so many cents-per-
hour, an individual is an active participant if an employer is 
contributing or is required to contribute to the plan an amount based on 
that individual's service taken into account for the plan year ending 
with or within the individual's taxable year. The general rule in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies in the case of plans described 
in section 413(a) and funded only on some non-service-related unit, 
e.g., so many cents-per-ton of coal.
    (3) Plans in which accruals for all participants have ceased. In the 
case of a defined benefit plan in which accruals for all participants 
have ceased, an individual in such a plan is not an active participant. 
However, any benefit that

[[Page 345]]

may vary with future compensation of an individual provides additional 
accruals. For example, a plan in which future benefit accruals have 
ceased, but the actual benefit depends upon final average compensation 
will not be considered as one in which accruals have ceased.
    (4) No accruals after specified age. An individual in a defined 
benefit plan who accrues no additional benefits in a plan year ending 
with or within such individual's taxable year by reason of attaining a 
specified age is not an active participant by reason of his 
participation in that plan.
    (c) Money purchase plan. An individual is an active participant in a 
money purchase plan if under the terms of the plan employer 
contributions must be allocated to the individual's account with respect 
to the plan year ending with or within the individual's taxable year. 
This rule applies even if an individual is not employed at any time 
during the individual's taxable year.
    (d) Profit-sharing and stock-bonus plans--(1) In general. This 
paragraph applies to profit-sharing and stock bonus plans. An individual 
is an active participant in such plans in a taxable year if a forfeiture 
is allocated to his account as of a date in such taxable year. An 
individual is also an active participant in a taxable year in such plans 
if an employer contribution is added to the participant's account in 
such taxable year. A contribution is added to a participant's account as 
of the later of the following two dates: the date the contribution is 
made or the date as of which it is allocated. Thus, if a contribution is 
made in an individual's taxable year 2 and allocated as of a date in 
individual's taxable year 1, the later of the relevant dates is the date 
the contribution is made. Consequently, the individual is an active 
participant in year 2 but not in year 1 as a result of that 
contribution.
    (2) Special rule. An individual is not an active participant for a 
particular taxable year by reason of a contribution made in such year 
allocated to a previous year if such individual was an active 
participant in such previous year by reason of a prior contribution that 
was allocated as of a date in such previous year.
    (e) Employee contributions. If an employee makes a voluntary or 
mandatory contribution to a plan described in paragraphs (b), (c), or 
(d) of this section, such employee is an active participant in the plan 
for the taxable year in which such contribution is made.
    (f) Certain individuals not active participants. For purposes of 
this section, an individual is not an active participant under a plan 
for any taxable year of such individual for which such individual 
elects, pursuant to the plan, not to participate in such plan.
    (g) Retirement savings for married individuals. The provisions of 
this section apply in determining whether an individual or his spouse is 
an active participant in a plan for purposes of section 220 (relating to 
retirement savings for certain married individuals).
    (h) Examples.The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. The X Corporation maintains a defined benefit plan which 
has the following rules on participation and accrual of benefits. Each 
employee who has attained the age of 25 or has completed one year of 
service is a participant in the plan. The plan further provides that 
each participant shall receive upon retirement $12 per month for each 
year of service in which the employee completes 1,000 hours of service. 
The plan year is the calendar year. B, a calendar-year taxpayer, enters 
the plan on January 2, 1980, when he is 27 years of age. Since B has 
attained the age of 25, he is a participant in the plan. However, B 
completes less than 1,000 hours of service in 1980 and 1981. Although B 
is not accruing any benefits under the plan in 1980 and 1981, he is an 
active participant under section 219(b)(2) because he is a participant 
in the plan. Thus, B cannot make deductible contributions to an 
individual retirement arrangement for his taxable years of 1980 and 
1981.
    Example 2. The Y Corporation maintains a profit-sharing plan for its 
employees. The plan year of the plan is the calendar year. C is a 
calendar-year taxpayer and a participant in the plan. On June 30, 1980, 
the employer makes a contribution for 1980 which as allocated on July 
31, 1980. In 1981 the employer makes a second contribution for 1980, 
allocated as of December 31, 1980. Under the general rule stated in 
Sec. 1.219-2(d)(1), C is an active participant in 1980. Under the 
special rule stated in Sec. 1.219-2(d)(2), however, C is not an active 
participant in 1981 by reason of that contribution made in 1981.


[[Page 346]]


    (i) Effective date. The provisions set forth in this section are 
effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978.

                   Special Deductions for Corporations


<R05>
Sec. 1.241-1   Allowance of special deductions.

    A corporation, in computing its taxable income, is allowed as 
deductions the items specified in Part VIII (section 242 and following), 
Subchapter B, Chapter 1 of the Code, in addition to the deductions 
provided in part VI (section 161 and following) Subchapter B, Chapter 1 
of the Code.


<R05>
Sec. 1.242-1   Deduction for partially tax-exempt interest.

    A corporation is allowed a deduction under section 242(a) in an 
amount equal to certain interest received on obligations of the United 
States, or an obligation of corporations organized under Acts of 
Congress which are instrumentalities of the United States. The interest 
for which a deduction shall be allowed is interest which is included in 
gross income and which is exempt from normal tax under the act, as 
amended and supplemented, which authorized the issuance of the 
obligations. The deduction allowed by section 242(a) is allowed only for 
the purpose of computing normal tax, and therefore, no deduction is 
allowed for such interest in the computation of any surtax imposed by 
Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

[T.D. 7100, 36 FR 5333, Mar. 20, 1971]


<R05>
Sec. 1.243-1   Deduction for dividends received by corporations.

    (a)(1) A corporation is allowed a deduction under section 243 for 
dividends received from a domestic corporation which is subject to 
taxation under Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
    (2) Except as provided in section 243(c) and in section 246, the 
deduction is:
    (i) For the taxable year, an amount equal to 85 percent of the 
dividends received from such domestic corporations during the taxable 
year (other than dividends to which subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this 
subparagraph applies).
    (ii) For a taxable year beginning after September 2, 1958, an amount 
equal to 100 percent of the dividends received from such domestic 
corporations if at the time of receipt of such dividends the recipient 
corporation is a Federal licensee under the Small Business Investment 
Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. ch. 14B). However, to claim the deduction 
provided by section 243(a)(2) the company must file with its return a 
statement that it was a Federal licensee under the Small Business 
Investment Act of 1958 at the time of the receipt of the dividends.
    (iii) For a taxable year ending after December 31, 1963, an amount 
equal to 100 percent of the dividends received which are qualifying 
dividends, as defined in section 243(b) and Sec. 1.243-4.
    (3) To determine the amount of the distribution to a recipient 
corporation and the amount of the dividend, see Secs. 1.301-1 and 1.316-
1.
    (b) For limitation on the dividends received deduction, see section 
246 and the regulations thereunder.

[T.D. 6992, 34 FR 817, Jan. 18, 1969]


<R05>
Sec. 1.243-2   Special rules for certain distributions.

    (a) Dividends paid by mutual savings banks, etc. In determining the 
deduction provided in section 243(a), any amount allowed as a deduction 
under section 591 (relating to deduction for dividends paid by mutual 
savings banks, cooperative banks, and domestic building and loan 
associations) shall not be considered as a dividend.
    (b) Dividends received from regulated investment companies. In 
determining the deduction provided in section 243(a), dividends received 
from a regulated investment company shall be subject to the limitations 
provided in section 854.
    (c) Dividends received from real estate investment trusts. See 
section 857(c) and paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.857-6 for special rules which 
deny a deduction under section 243 in the case of dividends received 
from a real estate investment trust with respect to a taxable year for 
which such trust is taxable under Part II, Subchapter M, Chapter 1 of 
the Code.

[[Page 347]]

    (d) Dividends received on preferred stock of a public utility. The 
deduction allowed by section 243(a) shall be determined without regard 
to any dividends described in section 244 (relating to dividends on the 
preferred stock of a public utility). That is, such deduction shall be 
determined without regard to any dividends received on the preferred 
stock of a public utility which is subject to taxation under Chapter 1 
of the Code and with respect to which a deduction is allowed by section 
247 (relating to dividends paid on certain preferred stock of public 
utilities). For a deduction with respect to such dividends received on 
the preferred stock of a public utility, see section 244. If a deduction 
for dividends paid is not allowable to the distributing corporation 
under section 247 with respect to the dividends on its preferred stock, 
such dividends received from a domestic public utility corporation 
subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code are includible in 
determining the deduction allowed by section 243(a).

[T.D. 6598, 27 FR 4092, Apr. 28, 1962, as amended by T.D. 6992, 34 FR 
817, Jan. 18, 1969; T.D. 7767, 46 FR 11264, Feb. 6, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 1.243-3   Certain dividends from foreign corporations.

    (a) In general. (1) In determining the deduction provided in section 
243(a), section 243(d) provides that a dividend received from a foreign 
corporation after December 31, 1959, shall be treated as a dividend from 
a domestic corporation which is subject to taxation under chapter 1 of 
the Code, but only to the extent that such dividend is out of earnings 
and profits accumulated by a domestic corporation during a period with 
respect to which such domestic corporation was subject to taxation under 
Chapter 1 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of prior law). Thus, 
for example, if a domestic corporation accumulates earnings and profits 
during a period or periods with respect to which it is subject to 
taxation under Chapter 1 of the Code (or corresponding provisions of 
prior law) and subsequently such domestic corporation reincorporates in 
a foreign country, any dividends paid out of such earnings and profits 
after such reincorporation are eligible for the deduction provided in 
section 243(a) (1) and (2).
    (2) Section 243(d) and this section do not apply to dividends paid 
out of earnings and profits accumulated (i) by a corporation organized 
under the China Trade Act, 1922, (ii) by a domestic corporation during 
any period with respect to which such corporation was exempt from 
taxation under section 501 (relating to certain charitable, etc. 
organizations) or 521 (relating to farmers' cooperative associations), 
or (iii) by a domestic corporation during any period to which section 
931 (relating to income from sources within possessions of the United 
States) applied.
    (b) Establishing separate earnings and profits accounts. A foreign 
corporation shall, for purposes of section 243(d), maintain a separate 
account for earnings and profits to which it succeeds which were 
accumulated by a domestic corporation, and such foreign corporation 
shall treat such earnings and profits as having been accumulated during 
the accounting periods in which earned by such domestic corporation. 
Such foreign corporation shall also maintain such a separate account for 
the earnings and profits, or deficit in earnings and profits, 
accumulated by it or accumulated by any other corporations to the 
earnings and profits of which it succeeds.
    (c) Effect of dividends on earnings and profits accounts. Dividends 
paid out of the accumulated earnings and profits (see section 316(a)(1) 
of such foreign corporation shall be treated as having been paid out of 
the most recently accumulated earnings and profits of such corporation. 
A deficit in an earnings and profits account for any accounting period 
shall reduce the most recently accumulated earnings and profits for a 
prior accounting period in such account. If there are no accumulated 
earnings and profits in an earnings and profits account because of a 
deficit incurred in a prior accounting period, such deficit must be 
restored before earnings and profits can be accumulated in a subsequent 
accounting period. If a dividend is paid out of earnings and profits of 
a foreign corporation which maintains two or more accounts (established 
under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section)

[[Page 348]]

with respect to two or more accounting periods ending on the same day, 
then the portion of such dividend considered as paid out of each account 
shall be the same proportion of the total dividend as the amount of 
earnings and profits in that account bears to the sum of the earnings 
and profits in all such accounts.
    (d) Illustration. The application of the principles of this section 
in the determination of the amount of the dividends received deduction 
may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. On December 31, 1960, corporation X, a calendar-year 
corporation organized in the United States on January 1, 1958, 
consolidated with corporation Y, a foreign corporation organized on 
January 1, 1958, which used an annual accounting period based on the 
calendar year, to form corporation Z, a foreign corporation not engaged 
in trade or business within the United States. Corporation Z is a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of corporation M, a domestic corporation. On 
January 1, 1961, corporation Z's accumulated earnings and profits of 
$31,000 are, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
maintained in separate earnings and profits accounts containing the 
following amounts:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     Domestic   Foreign 
      Earnings and profits accumulated for--         corp. X    corp. Y 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1958..............................................   ($1,000)    $11,000
1959..............................................     10,000      9,000
1960..............................................      5,000    (3,000)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Corporation Z had earnings and profits of $10,000 in each of the 
years 1961, 1962, and 1963 and makes distributions with respect to its 
stock to corporation M for such years in the following amounts:

1961.........................................................    $14,000
1962.........................................................     23,000
1963.........................................................     16,000
                                                                        

    (1) For 1961, a deduction of $3,400 is allowable to M with respect 
to the $14,000 distribution from Z, computed as follows:

(i) Dividend from current year earnings and profits (1961)...    $10,000
(ii) Dividend from earnings and profits of corporation X                
 accumulated for 1960........................................      4,000
(iii) Deduction: 85 percent of $4,000 (the amount distributed           
 from the accumulated earnings and profits of corporation X).      3,400
                                                                        

    (2) For 1962, a deduction of $6,970 is allowable to corporation M 
with respect to the $23,000 distribution from corporation Z, computed as 
follows:

(i) Dividend from current year earnings and profits (1962)..    $10,000 
(ii) Dividend from earnings and profits of                              
 corporation X accumulated for:                                         
    1960........................................     $1,000             
    1959: $9,000 (i.e., $10,000 - $1,000) divided by $15,000            
     (i.e., $9,000+$9,000-$3,000) multiplied by $12,000                 
     (i.e., $23,000-$11,000)................................       7,200
                                                 ------------           
      Total.................................................      8,200 
(iii) Dividend from earnings and profits of                             
 corporation Y accumulated for:                                         
    1959: $6,000/$15,000 x $12,000..........................      4,800 
(iv) Deduction: 85 percent of $8,200 (the amount                        
 distributed from the accumulated earnings and                          
 profits of corporation X)......................  ..........       6,970
                                                                        

    (3) For 1963, a deduction of $1,530 is allowable to M with respect 
to the $16,000 distribution from Z, computed as follows:

(i) Dividend from current year earnings and profits (1963)...    $10,000
(ii) Dividend from earnings and profits of corporation X                
 accumulated for 1959:                                                  
  Earnings and profits remaining after 1962 distribution

<R05>
Sec. 1.243-4   Qualifying dividends.

    (a) Definition of qualifying dividends--(1) General. For purposes of 
section 243(a)(3), the term qualifying dividends means dividends 
received by a corporation if:
    (i) At the close of the day the dividends are received, such 
corporation is a member of the same affiliated group of corporations (as 
defined in paragraph (b) of this section) as the corporation 
distributing the dividends,
    (ii) An election by such affiilated group under section 243(b)(2) 
and paragraph (c) of this section is effective for the taxable years of 
its members which include such day, and
    (iii) The dividends are distributed out of earnings and profits 
specified in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) Earnings and profits. The earnings and profits specified in this 
subparagraph are earnings and profits of a taxable year of the 
distributing corporation (or a predecessor corporation) which satisfies 
each of the following conditions:

[[Page 349]]

    (i) Such year must end after December 31, 1963;
    (ii) On each day of such year the distributing corporation (or the 
predecessor corporation) and the corporation receiving the dividends 
must have been members of the affiliated group of which the distributing 
corporation and the corporation receiving the dividends are members on 
the day the dividends are received; and
    (iii) An election under section 1562 (relating to the election of 
multiple surtax exmptions) was never effective (or is no longer 
effective pursuant to section 1562(c)) for such year.
    (3) Special rule for insurance companies. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, if an insurance 
company subject to taxation under section 802 or 821 distributes a 
dividend out of earnings and profits of a taxable year with respect to 
which the company would have been a component member of a controlled 
group of corporations within the meaning of section 1563 were it not for 
the application of section 1563(b)(2)(D), such dividend shall not be 
treated as a qualifying dividend unless an election under section 
243(b)(2) is effective for such taxable year.
    (4) Predecessor corporations. For purposes of this paragraph, a 
corporation shall be considered to be a predecessor corporation with 
respect to a distributing corporation if the distributing corporation 
succeeds to the earnings and profits of such corporation, for example, 
as the result of a transaction to which section 381(a) applies. A 
distributing corporation shall, for purposes of this section, maintain, 
in respect of each predecessor corporation, a separate account for 
earnings and profits to which it succeeds, and such earnings and profits 
shall be considered to be earnings and profits of the predecessor's 
taxable year in which the earnings and profits were accumulated.
    (5) Mere change in form. (i) For purposes of subparagraph (2)(ii) of 
this paragraph, the affiliated group in existence during the taxable 
year out of the earnings and profits of which the dividend is 
distributed shall not be considered as a different group from that in 
existence on the day on which the dividend is received merely because:
    (a) The common parent corporation has undergone a mere change in 
identity, form, or place of organization (within the meaning of section 
368(a)(1)(F)), or
    (b) A newly organized corporation (the ``acquiring corporation'') 
has acquired substantially all of the outstanding stock of the common 
parent corporation (the ``acquired corporation'') solely in exchange for 
stock of such acquiring corporation, and the stockholders (immediately 
before the acquisition) of the acquired corporation, as a result of 
owning stock of the acquired corporation, own (immediately after the 
acquisition) all of the outstanding stock of the acquiring corporation.

If a transaction described in the preceding sentence has occurred, the 
acquiring corporation shall be treated as having been a member of the 
affiliated group for the entire period during which the acquired 
corporation was a member of such group.
    (ii) For purposes of subdivision (i) (b) of this subparagraph, if 
immediately before the acquisition:
    (a) The stockholders of the acquired corporation also owned all of 
the outstanding stock of another corporation (the ``second 
corporation''), and
    (b) Stock of the acquired corporation and of the second corporation 
could be acquired or transferred only as a unit (hereinafter referred to 
as the ``limitation on transferability''), then the second corporation 
shall be treated as an acquired corporation and such second corporation 
shall be treated as having been a member of the affiliated group for the 
entire period (while such group was in existence) during which the 
limitation on transferability was in existence, and if the second 
corporation is itself the common parent corporation of an affiliated 
group (the ``second group'') any other member of the second group shall 
be treated as having been a member of the affiliated group for the 
entire period during which it was a member of the second group while the 
limitation on transferability existed. For purposes of (a) of this 
subdivision and subdivision (i)(b) of this subparagraph, if the 
limitation on transferability of stock of the acquired corporation and 
the second corporation

[[Page 350]]

is achieved by using a voting trust, then the stock owned by the trust 
shall be considered as owned by the holders of the beneficial interests 
in the trust.
    (6) Source of distributions. In determining from what year's 
earnings and profits a dividend is treated as having been distributed 
for purposes of this section, the principles of paragraph (a) of 
Sec. 1.316-2 shall apply. A dividend shall be considered to be 
distributed, first, out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year 
which includes the date the dividend is distributed, second, out of the 
earnings and profits accumulated for the immediately preceding taxable 
year, third, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the second 
preceding taxable year, etc. A deficit in an earnings and profits 
account for any taxable year shall reduce the most recently accumulated 
earnings and profits for a prior year in such account. If there are no 
accumulated earnings and profits in an earnings and profits account 
because of a deficit incurred in a prior year, such deficit must be 
restored before earnings and profits can be accumulated in a subsequent 
year. If a dividend is distributed out of separate earnings and profits 
accounts (established under the provisions of subparagraph (4) of this 
paragraph) for two or more taxable years ending on the same day, then 
the portion of such dividend considered as distributed out of each 
account shall be the same proportion of the total dividend as the amount 
of earnings and profits in that account bears to the sum of the earnings 
and profits in all such accounts.
    (7) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. On March 1, 1965, corporation P, a publicly owned 
corporation, acquires all of the stock of corporation S and continues to 
hold the stock throughout the remainder of 1965 and all of 1966. P and S 
are domestic corporations which file separate returns on the basis of a 
calendar year. The affiliated group consisting of P and S makes an 
election under section 243(b)(2) which is effective for the 1966 taxable 
years of P and S. A multiple surtax exemption election under section 
1562 is not effective for their 1965 taxable years. On February 1, 1966, 
S distributes $50,000 with respect to its stock which is received by P 
on the same date. S had earnings and profits of $40,000 for 1966 
(computed without regard to distributions during 1966). S also had 
earnings and profits accumulated for 1965 of $70,000. Since $40,000 was 
distributed out of earnings and profits for 1966 and since each of the 
conditions prescribed in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph is 
satisfied, P is entitled to a 100-percent dividends received deduction 
with respect to $40,000 of the $50,000 distribution. However, since 
$10,000 was distributed out of earnings and profits accumulated for 
1965, and since on each day of 1965 S and P were not members of the 
affiliated group of which S and P were members on February 1, 1966, 
$10,000 of the $50,000 distribution does not satisfy the condition 
specified in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph and thus does not 
qualify for the 100-percent dividends received deduction.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that 
corporation P acquires all the stock of corporation S on January 1, 
1965, and sells such stock on November 1, 1966. Since $10,000 is 
distributed out of earnings and profits for 1965, and since each of the 
conditions prescribed in subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph is 
satisfied, P is entitled to a 100-percent dividends received deduction 
with respect to $10,000 of the $50,000 distribution. However, since 
$40,000 of the $50,000 distribution was made out of earnings and profits 
of S for its 1966 taxable year, and on each day of such year S and P 
were not members of the affiliated group of which S and P were members 
on February 1, 1966, $40,000 of the distribution does not satisfy the 
condition specified in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph and thus 
does not qualify for the 100-percent dividends received deduction.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that 
corporation P acquires all the stock of corporation S on January 1, 
1965, and that a multiple surtax exemption election under section 1562 
is effective for P's and S's 1965 taxable years. Further assume that the 
section 1562 election is terminated effective with respect to their 1966 
taxable years, and that an election under section 243(b) (2) is 
effective for such taxable years. Since $10,000 of the February 1, 1966, 
distribution was made out of earnings and profits of S for its 1965 
taxable year and since a multiple surtax exemption election is effective 
for such year, $10,000 of the distribution does not satisfy the 
condition specified in subparagraph (2) (iii) of this paragraph and thus 
does not qualify for the 100-percent dividends received deduction. 
However, the portion of the distribution which was distributed out of 
earnings and profits of S's 1966 year ($40,000) qualifies for the 100-
percent dividends received deduction.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that 
corporation P acquires all the stock of corporation S on January 1, 
1965, and that S is a life insurance company subject to taxation under 
section 802. Accordingly, S would have been a member of a

[[Page 351]]

controlled group of corporations except for the application of section 
1563(b)(2)(D). Since $10,000 of the distribution was made out of 
earnings and profits of S for its 1965 taxable year, and since with 
respect to such year an election under section 243(b)(2) was not 
effective, $10,000 of the distribution is not a qualifying dividend by 
reason of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. On the other hand, the 
portion of the distribution which was distributed out of earnings and 
profits for S's 1966 year ($40,000) does qualify for the 100-percent 
dividends received deduction because the distribution was out of 
earnings and profits of a year for which an election under section 
243(b) (2) is effective, and because the other conditions specified in 
subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph are satisfied. However, if P 
were also a life insurance company subject to taxation under section 
802, then subparagraph (3) of this paragraph would not result in the 
disqualification of the portion of the distribution made out of S's 1965 
earnings and profits because S would be a component member of an 
insurance group of corporations (as defined in section 1563(a)(4)), 
consisting of P and S, with respect to its 1965 year.
    Example 5. Corporation X owns all the stock of corporation Y from 
January 1, 1965, through December 31, 1969. X and Y are domestic 
corporations which file separate returns on the basis of a calendar 
year. On June 30, 1965, Y acquired all the stock of domestic corporation 
Z, a calendar year taxpayer, and on December 31, 1967, Y acquired the 
assets of Z in a transaction to which section 381(a) applied. A multiple 
surtax exemption election under section 1562, was not effective for any 
taxable year of X, Y, or Z, and an election under section 243(b)(2) is 
effective for the 1968 and 1969 taxable years of X and Y. On January 1, 
1968, Y's accumulated earnings and profits are, under the provisions of 
subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, maintained in separate earnings and 
profits accounts containing the following amounts:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       Corp       Corp  
       Earnings and profits accumulated for        ---------------------
                                                        Y          Z    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1964..............................................    $60,000    $40,000
1965..............................................     30,000     15,000
1966..............................................    (5,000)      2,000
1967..............................................     12,000      6,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Corporation Y had earnings and profits of $10,000 in each of the years 
1968 and 1969, and made distributions during such years in the following 
amounts:

  1968.......................................................    $29,000
  1969.......................................................     31,000
                                                                        

    (i) The source of the 1968 distribution, determined in accordance 
with the rules of subparagraph (6) of this paragraph, is as follows:

(a) Dividend from Y's current year's earnings and profits               
 (1968)......................................................    $10,000
(b) Dividend from earnings and profits of Y accumulated for             
 1967........................................................     12,000
(c) Dividend from earnings and profits of Z accumulated for:.           
    1967.....................................................      6,000
    1966.....................................................      1,000
                                                              ----------
                                                                  29,000
                                                                        

Since the 1968 dividend is considered paid out of earnings and profits 
of Y's 1968 and 1967 years, and Z's 1967 and 1966 years, and since each 
of these years satisfies each of the conditions specified in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, X is entitled to a 100-percent 
dividends received deduction with respect to the entire 1968 
distribution of $29,000 from Y.
    (ii) The source of the 1969 distribution of $31,000, determined in 
accordance with the rules of subparagraph (6) of this paragraph, is as 
follows:

(a) Dividend from Y's current year's earnings and profits               
 (1969)......................................................    $10,000
(b) Dividend from earnings and profits of Z accumulated for             
 1966 (1966 earnings and profits remaining after 1968                   
 distribution, i.e., $2,000-$1,000...........................      1,000
(c) Dividend from earnings and profits of Y and Z accumulated           
 for 1965:                                                              
    Corporation Y: $25,000 (i.e., $30,000-$5,000 deficit)               
     divided by $40,000 (i.e., the sum of the 1965 earnings             
     and profits of Y and Z) multiplied by $20,000 (the                 
     portion of the distribution from the 1965 earnings and             
     profits of Y and Z).....................................     12,500
    Corporation Z: $15,000 divided by $40,000 multiplied by             
     $20,000.................................................      7,500
                                                              ----------
                                                                  31,000
                                                                        

The sum of the dividends from Y's 1969 year ($10,000), Z's 1966 year 
($1,000), and Y's 1965 year ($12,500), or $23,500, qualifies for the 
100-percent dividends received deduction. However, the dividends paid 
out of Z's 1965 year ($7,500) do not qualify because on each day of 1965 
Z and X were not members of the affiliated group of which Y (the 
distributing corporation) and X (the corporation receiving the 
dividends) were members on the day in 1969 when the dividends were 
received by X.

    (b) Definition of affiliated group. For purposes of this section and 
Sec. 1.243-5, the term affiliated group shall have the meaning assigned 
to it by section 1504(a), except that insurance companies subject to 
taxation under section 802 or 821 shall be treated as includible 
corporations (notwithstanding section 1504(b)(2) ), and the provisions 
of section 1504(c) shall not apply.
    (c) Election--(1) Manner and time of making election--(i) General. 
The election provided by section 243(b)(2) shall be made for an 
affiliated group by the

[[Page 352]]

common parent corporation and shall be made for a particular taxable 
year of the common parent corporation. Such election may not be made for 
any taxable year of the common parent corporation for which a multiple 
surtax exemption election under section 1562 is effective. The election 
shall be made by means of a statement, signed by any person who is duly 
authorized to act on behalf of the common parent corporation, stating 
that the affiliated group elects under section 243(b)(2) for such 
taxable year. The statement shall be filed with the district director 
for the internal revenue district in which is located the principal 
place of business or principal office or agency of the common parent. 
The statement shall set forth the name, address, taxpayer account 
number, and taxable year of each corporation (including wholly-owned 
subsidiaries) that is a member of the affiliated group at the time the 
election is filed. The statement may be filed at any time, provided 
that, with respect to each corporation the tax liability of which for 
its matching taxable year of election (or for any subsequent taxable 
year) would be increased because of the election, at the time of filing 
there is at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period (including 
any extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency against such 
corporation for such year. (If there is less than 1 year remaining with 
respect to any taxable year, the district director for the internal 
revenue district in which is located the principal place of business or 
principal office or agency of the corporation will ordinarily, upon 
request, enter into an agreement to extend such statutory period for 
assessment and collection of deficiencies.
    (ii) Information statement by common parent. If a corporation 
becomes a member of the affiliated group after the date on which the 
election is filed and during its matching taxable year of election, then 
the common parent shall file, within 60 days after such corporation 
becomes a member of the affiliated group, an additional statement 
containing the name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year 
of such corporation. Such additional statement shall be filed with the 
internal revenue officer with whom the election was filed.
    (iii) Definition of matching taxable year of election. For purposes 
of this paragraph and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the term 
matching taxable year of election shall mean the taxable year of each 
member (including the common parent corporation) of the electing 
affiliated group which includes the last day of the taxable year of the 
common parent corporation for which an election by the affiiliated group 
is made under section 243(b)(2).
    (2) Consents by subsidiary corporations--(i) General. Each 
corporation (other than the common parent corporation) which is a member 
of the electing affiliated group (including any member which joins in 
the filing of a consolidated return) at any time during its matching 
taxable year of election must consent to such election in the manner and 
time provided in subdivision (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph, 
whichever is applicable.
    (ii) Wholly owned subsidiary. If all of the stock of a corporation 
is owned by a member or members of the affiliated group on each day of 
such corporation's matching taxable year of election, then such 
corporation (referred to in this paragraph as a ``wholly owned 
subsidiary'') shall be deemed to consent to such election.
    (iii) Other members. The consent of each member of the affiliated 
group (other than a wholly owned subsidiary) shall be made by means of a 
statement, signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf 
of the consenting member, stating that such member consents to the 
election under section 243(b)(2). The statement shall set forth the 
name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of the 
consenting member and of the common parent corporation, and in the case 
of a statement filed after December 31, 1968, the identity of the 
internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of 
business or principal office or agency of the common parent corporation. 
The consent of more than one such member may be incorporated in a single 
statement. The statement (or statements) shall be attached to

[[Page 353]]

the election filed by the common parent corporation. The consent of a 
corporation that, after the date the election was filed and during its 
matching taxable year of election, either (a) becomes a member, or (b) 
ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary but continues to be a member, 
shall be filed with the internal revenue officer with whom the election 
was filed and shall be filed on or before the date prescribed by law 
(including extensions of time) for the filing of the consenting member's 
income tax return for such taxable year, or on or before June 10, 1964, 
whichever is later.
    (iv) Statement attached to return. Each corporation that consents to 
an election by means of a statement described in subdivision (iii) of 
this subparagraph should attach a copy of the statement to its income 
tax return for its matching taxable year of election, or, if such return 
has already been filed, to its first income tax return filed on or after 
the date on which the statement is filed. However, if such return is 
filed on or before June 10, 1964, a copy of such statement should be 
filed on or before June 10, 1964, with the district director with whom 
such return is filed. Each wholly owned subsidiary should attach a 
statement to its income tax return for its matching taxable year of 
election, or, if such return has already been filed, to its first income 
tax return filed on or after the date on which the statement is filed 
stating that it is subject to an election under section 243(b)(2) and 
the taxable year to which the election applies, and setting forth the 
name, address, taxpayer account number, and taxable year of the common 
parent corporation, and in the case of a statement filed after December 
31, 1968, the identity of the internal revenue district in which is 
located the principal place of business or principal office or agency of 
the common parent corporation. However, if the due date for such return 
(including extensions of time) is before June 10, 1964, such statement 
should be filed on or before June 10, 1964, with the district director 
with whom such return is filed.
    (3) Information statement by member. If a corporation becomes a 
member of the affiliated group during a taxable year that begins after 
the last day of the common parent corporation's matching taxable year of 
election, then (unless such election has been terminated) such 
corporation should attach a statement to its income tax return for such 
taxable year stating that it is subject to an election under section 
243(b)(2) for such taxable year and setting forth the name, address, 
taxpayer account number, and taxable year of the common parent 
corporation, and the identity of the internal revenue district in which 
is located the principal place of business or principal office or agency 
of the common parent corporation. In the case of an affiliated group 
that made an election under the rules provided in Treasury Decision 
6721, approved April 8, 1964 (29 FR 4997, C.B. 1964-1 (Part 1), 625), 
such statement shall be filed, on or before March 15, 1969, with the 
district director for the internal revenue district in which is located 
such member's principal place of business or principal office or agency.
    (4) Years for which election effective--(i) General rule. An 
election under section 243(b)(2) by an affiliated group shall be 
effective:
    (a) In the case of each corporation which is a member of such group 
at any time during its matching taxable year of election, for such 
taxable year, and
    (b) In the case of each corporation which is a member of such group 
at any time during a taxable year ending after the last day of the 
common parent's taxable year of election but which does not include such 
last day, for such taxable year, unless the election is terminated under 
section 243(b)(4) and paragraph (e) of this section. Thus, the election 
has a continuing effect and need not be renewed annually.
    (ii) Special rule for certain taxable years ending in 1964. In the 
case of a taxable year of a member (other than the common parent 
corporation) of the affiliated group (a) which begins in 1963 and ends 
in 1964, and (b) for which an election is not effective under 
subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph, if an election under section 
243(b)(2) is effective for the taxable year of the common parent 
corporation which includes the last day of such taxable year of such 
member, then such election shall be effective for such taxable year of

[[Page 354]]

such member if such member files a separate consent with respect to such 
taxable year. However, in order for a dividend distributed by such 
member during such taxable year to meet the requirements of section 
243(b)(1), an election under section 243(b)(2) must be effective for the 
taxable year of each member of the affiliated group which includes the 
date such dividend is received. See section 243(b)(1)(A) and paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section. Accordingly, if the dividend is to qualify for 
the 100-percent dividends received deduction under section 243(a)(3), a 
consent must be filed under this subdivision by each member of the 
affiliated group with respect to its taxable year which includes the day 
the dividend is received (unless an election is effective for such 
taxable year under subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph). For 
purposes of this subdivision, a consent shall be made by means of a 
statement meeting the requirements of subparagraph (2)(iii) of this 
paragraph, and shall be attached to the election made by the common 
parent corporation for its taxable year which includes the last day of 
the taxable year of the member with respect to which the consent is 
made. A copy of the statement should be filed, within 60 days after such 
election is filed by the common parent corporation, with the district 
director with whom the consenting member filed its income tax return for 
such taxable year.
    (iii) Examples. The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this 
subparagraph, relating to the special rule for certain taxable years 
ending in 1964, may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. P Corporation owns all the stock of S-1 Corporation on 
each day of 1963, 1964, and 1965. P uses the calendar year as its 
taxable year and S-1 uses a fiscal year ending June 30 as its taxable 
year. P makes an election under section 243(b)(2) for 1964. Since S-1 is 
a wholly owned subsidiary for its taxable year ending June 30, 1965, it 
is deemed to consent to the election. However, in order for the election 
to be effective with respect to S-1's taxable year ending June 30, 1964, 
a statement specifying that S-1 consents to the election with respect to 
such taxable year and containing the information required in a statement 
of consent under subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph must be 
attached to the election.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that P 
also owns all the stock of S-2 Corporation on each day of 1963, 1964, 
and 1965. S-2 uses a fiscal year ending May 31 as its taxable year. If 
S-1 distributes a dividend to P on January 15, 1964, the dividend may 
qualify under section 243(a)(3) only if S-1 and S-2 both consent to the 
election made by P for 1964 with respect to their taxable years ending 
in 1964.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that P 
uses a fiscal year ending on January 31 as its taxable year and makes an 
election under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for its taxable year 
ending January 31, 1964. Since S-1's taxable year beginning in 1963 and 
ending in 1964 includes January 31, 1964, the last day of P's taxable 
year for which the election was made, the election is effective under 
subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph, for S-1's taxable year ending 
June 30, 1964. Accordingly, the special rule of subdivision (ii) of this 
subparagraph has no application.

    (d) Effect of election. For restrictions and limitations applicable 
to corporations which are members of an electing affiliated group on 
each day of their taxable years, see Sec. 1.243-5.
    (e) Termination of election--(1) In general. An election under 
section 243(b)(2) by an affiliated group may be terminated with respect 
to any taxable year of the common parent corporation after the matching 
taxable year of election of the common parent corporation. The election 
is terminated as a result of one of the occurrences described in 
subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph. For years affected by 
termination, see subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
    (2) Consent of members--(i) General. An election may be terminated 
for an affiliated group by its common parent corporation with respect to 
a taxable year of the common parent corporation provided each 
corporation (other than the common parent) that was a member of the 
affiliated group at any time during its taxable year that includes the 
last day of such year of the common parent (the ``matching taxable year 
of termination'') consents to such termination. The statement of 
termination may be filed by the common parent corporation at any time, 
provided that, with respect to each corporation the tax liability of 
which for its matching taxable year of termination (or for any 
subsequent taxable

[[Page 355]]

year) would be increased because of the termination, at the time of 
filing there is at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period 
(including any extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency 
against such corporation for such year. (If there is less than 1 year 
remaining with respect to any taxable year, the district director for 
the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of 
business or principal office or agency of the corporation will 
ordinarily, upon request, enter into agreement to extend such statutory 
period for assessment and collection of deficiencies.)
    (ii) Statements filed after December 31, 1968. With respect to 
statements of termination filed after December 31, 1968:
    (a) The statement shall be filed with the district director for the 
internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of 
business or principal office or agency of the common parent corporation;
    (b) The statement shall be signed by any person who is duly 
authorized to act on behalf of the common parent corporation and shall 
state that the affiliated group terminates the election under section 
243(b)(2) for such taxable year;
    (c) The statement shall set forth the name, address, taxpayer 
account number, and taxable year of each corporation (including wholly 
owned subsidiaries) which is a member of the affiliated group at the 
time the termination is filed; and
    (d) The consents to the termination shall be given in accordance 
with the rules prescribed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, relating 
to manner and time for giving consents to an election under section 
243(b)(2).
    (3) Refusal by new member to consent--(i) Manner of giving refusal. 
If any corporation which is a new member of an affiliated group with 
respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation (other than 
the matching taxable year of election of the common parent corporation) 
files a statement that it does not consent to an election under section 
243(b)(2) with respect to such taxable year, then such election shall 
terminate with respect to such taxable year. Such statement shall be 
signed by any person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the new 
member, and shall be filed with the timely filed income tax return of 
such new member for its taxable year within which falls the last day of 
such taxable year of the common parent corporation. In the event of a 
termination under this subparagraph, each corporation (other than such 
new member) that is a member of the affiliated group at any time during 
its taxable year which includes such last day should, within 30 days 
after such new member files the statement of refusal to consent, notify 
the district director of such termination. Such notification should be 
filed with the district director for the internal revenue district in 
which is located the principal place of business or principal office or 
agency of the corporation.
    (ii) Corporation considered as new member. For purposes of 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, a corporation shall be considered 
to be a new member of an affiliated group of corporations with respect 
to a taxable year of the common parent corporation if such corporation:
    (a) Is a member of the affiliated group at any time during such 
taxable year of the common parent corporation, and
    (b) Was not a member of the affiliated group at any time during the 
common parent corporation's immediately preceding taxable year.
    (4) Effect of termination. A termination under subparagraph (2) or 
(3) of this paragraph is effective with respect to (i) the common parent 
corporation's taxable year referred to in the particular subparagraph 
under which the termination occurs, and (ii) the taxable years of the 
other members of the affiliated group which include the last day of such 
taxable year of the common parent. An election, once terminated, is no 
longer effective. Accordingly, the termination is also effective with 
respect to the succeeding taxable years of the members of the group. 
However, the affiliated group may make a new election in accordance with 
the provisions of section 243(b)(2) and paragraph (c) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1.243-5   Effect of election.

    (a) General--(1) Corporations subject to restrictions and 
limitations. If an election by an affiliated group under section 
243(b)(2) is effective with respect to a taxable year of the common 
parent corporation, then each corporation (including the common parent 
corporation) which is a member of such group on each day of its matching 
taxable year shall be subject to the restrictions and limitations 
prescribed by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section for such 
taxable year. For purposes of this section, the term matching taxable 
year shall mean the taxable year of each member (including the common 
parent corporation) of an affiliated group which includes the last day 
of a particular taxable year of the common parent corporation for which 
an election by the affiliated group under section 243(b)(2) is 
effective. If a corporation is a member of an affiliated group on each 
day of a short taxable year which does not include the last day of a 
taxable year of the common parent corporation, and if an election under 
section 243(b)(2) is effective for such short year, see paragraph (g) of 
this section. In the case of taxable years beginning in 1963 and ending 
in 1964 for which an election under section 243(b)(2) is effective under 
paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of Sec. 1.243-4, see paragraph (f)(9) of this 
section.
    (2) Members filing consolidated returns. The restrictions and 
limitations prescribed by this section shall apply notwithstanding the 
fact that some of the corporations which are members of the electing 
affiliated group (within the meaning of section 243(b)(5)) join in the 
filing of a consolidated return. Thus, for example, if an electing 
affiliated group includes one or more corporations taxable under section 
11 of the Code and two or more insurance companies taxable under section 
802 of the Code, and if the insurance companies join in the filing of a 
consolidated return, the amount of such companies' exemptions from 
estimated tax (for purposes of sections 6016 and 6655) shall be the 
amounts determined under paragraph (d)(5) of this section and not the 
amounts determined pursuant to the regulations under section 1502.
    (b) Multiple surtax exemption election--(1) General rule. If an 
election by an affiliated group under section 243(b)(2) is effective 
with respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation, then no 
corporation which is a member of such affiliated group on each day of 
its matching taxable year may consent (or shall be deemed to consent) to 
an election under section 1562(a)(1), relating to election of multiple 
surtax exemptions, which would be effective for such matching taxable 
year. Thus, each corporation which is a component member of the 
controlled group of corporations with respect to its matching taxable 
year (determined by applying section 1563(b) without regard to paragraph 
(2)(D) thereof) shall determine its surtax exemption for such taxable 
year in accordance with section 1561 and the regulations thereunder.
    (2) Special rule for certain insurance companies. Under section 
243(b)(6)(A), if the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph 
apply with respect to the taxable year of an insurance company subject 
to taxation under section 802 or 821, then the surtax exemption of such 
insurance company for such taxable year shall be determined by applying 
part II (section 1561 and following), subchapter B, chapter 6 of the 
Code, with respect to such insurance company and the other corporations 
which are component members of the controlled group of corporations (as 
determined under section 1563 without regard to subsections (a)(4) and 
(b)(2)(D) thereof) of which such insurance company is a member, without 
regard to section 1563(a)(4) (relating to certain insurance companies 
treated as a separate controlled group) and section 1563(b)(2)(D) 
(relating to certain insurance companies treated as excluded members).
    (3) Example. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. Throughout 1965 corporation M owns all the stock of 
corporations L-1, L-2, S-1, and S-2. M is a domestic mutual insurance 
company subject to tax under section 821 of the Code, L-1 and L-2 are 
domestic life insurance companies subject to tax under section 802 of 
the Code, and S-1 and S-2 are domestic corporations subject to tax under 
section 11 of the Code. Each corporation uses the calendar year as its 
taxable year. M

[[Page 357]]

makes a valid election under section 243(b)(2) for the affiliated group 
consisting of M, L-1, L-2, S-1, and S-2. If part II, subchapter B, 
chapter 6 of the Code were applied with respect to the 1965 taxable 
years of the corporations without regard to section 243(b)(6)(A), the 
following would result: S-1 and S-2 would be treated as component 
members of a controlled group of corporations on such date; L-1 and L-2 
would be treated as component members of a separate controlled group on 
such date; and M would be treated as an excluded member. However, since 
section 243(b)(6)(A) requires that part II of subchapter B be applied 
without regard to section 1563(a)(4) and (b)(2)(D), for purposes of 
determing the surtax exemptions of M, L-1, L-2, S-1, and S-2 for their 
1965 taxable years, such corporations are treated for purposes of such 
part II as component members of a single controlled group of 
corporations on December 31, 1965. Moreover, by reason of having made 
the election under section 243(b)(2), M, L-1, L-2, S-1, and S-2 cannot 
consent to multiple surtax exemption elections under section 1562 which 
would be effective for their 1965 taxable years. Thus, such corporations 
are limited to a single $25,000 surtax exemption for such taxable years 
(to be apportioned among such corporations in accordance with section 
1561 and the regulations thereunder).

    (c) Foreign tax credit--(1) General. If an election by an affiliated 
group under section 243(b)(2) is effective with respect to a taxable 
year of the common parent corporation, then:
    (i) The credit under section 901 for taxes paid or accrued to any 
foreign country or possession of the United States shall be allowed to a 
corporation which is a member of such affiliated group for each day of 
its matching taxable year only if each other corporation which pays or 
accrues such foreign taxes to any foreign country or possession, and 
which is a member of such group on each day of its matching taxable 
year, does not deduct such taxes in computing its tax liability for its 
matching taxable year, and
    (ii) A corporation which is a member of such affiliated group on 
each day of its matching taxable year may use the overall limitation 
provided in section 904(a)(2) for such matching taxable year only if 
each other corporation which pays or accrues foreign taxes to any 
foreign country or possession, and which is a member of such group on 
each day of its matching taxable year, uses such limitation for its 
matching taxable year.
    (2) Consent of the Commissioner. In the absence of unusual 
circumstances, a request by a corporation for the consent of the 
Commissioner to the revocation of an election of the overall limitation, 
or to a new election of the overall limitation, for the purpose of 
satisfying the requirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph 
will be given favorable consideration, notwithstanding the fact that 
there has been no change in the basic nature of the corporation's 
business or changes in conditions in a foreign country which 
substantially affect the corporation's business. See paragraph (d)(3) of 
Sec. 1.904-1.
    (d) Other restrictions and limitations--(1) General rule. If an 
election by an affilated group under section 243(b)(2) is effective with 
respect to a taxable year of the common parent corporation, then, except 
to the extent that an apportionment plan adopted under paragraph (f) of 
this section for such taxable year provides otherwise with respect to a 
restriction or limitation described in this paragraph, the rules 
provided in subparagraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5) of this paragraph shall 
apply to each corporation which is a member of such affiliated group on 
each day of its matching taxable year for the purpose of computing the 
amount of such restriction or limitation for its matching taxable year. 
For purposes of this paragraph, each corporation which is a member of an 
electing affiliated group (including any member which joins in filing a 
consolidated return) shall be treated as a separate corporation for 
purposes of determining the amount of such restrictions and limitations.
    (2) Accumulated earnings credit--(i) General. Except as provided in 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, in determining the minimum 
accumulated earnings credit under section 535(c)(2) (or the accumulated 
earnings credit of a mere holding or investment company under section 
535(c)(3) for each corporation which is a member of the affiliated group 
on each day of its matching taxable year, in lieu of the $150,000 amount 
($100,000 amount in the case of taxable years beginning before January 
1, 1975) mentioned in such sections there shall be substituted an amount

[[Page 358]]

equal to (a) $150,000 ($100,000 in the case of taxable years beginning 
before January 1, 1975), divided by (b) the number of such members.
    (ii) Allocation of excess. If, with respect to one or more members, 
the amount determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph exceeds 
the sum of (a) such member's accumulated earnings and profits as of the 
close of the preceding taxable year, plus (b) such member's earnings and 
profits for the taxable year which are retained (within the meaning of 
section 535(c)(1), then any such excess shall be subtracted from the 
amount determined under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph and shall 
be divided equally among those remaining members of the affiliated group 
that do not have such an excess (until no such excess remains to be 
divided among those remaining members that have not had such an excess). 
The excess so divided among such remaining members shall be added to the 
amount determined under subdivision (i) with respect to such members.
    (iii) Apportionment plan not allowed. An affiliated group may not 
adopt an apportionment plan, as provided in paragraph (f) of this 
section, with respect to the amounts computed under the provisions of 
this subparagraph.
    (iv) Example. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated 
by the following example;

    Example. An affiliated group is composed of four member 
corporations, W, X, Y, and Z. The sum of the accumulated earnings and 
profits (as of the close of the preceding taxable year ending December 
31, 1975) plus the earnings and profits for the taxable year ending 
December 31, 1976 which are retained is $15,000, $75,000, $37,500, and 
$300,000 in the case of W, X, Y, and Z, respectively. The amounts 
determined under this subparagraph for W, X, Y, and Z are $15,000, 
$48,750, $37,500 and $48,750, respectively, computed as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                               Component members                
                                                             ---------------------------------------------------
                                                                   W            X            Y            Z

    Amount to be used for purposes of sec. 535(c) (2) and                                                       
     (3)....................................................       15,000       48,750       37,500       48,750
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Mine exploration expenditures--(i) Limitation under section 
615(a). If the aggregate of the expenditures to which section 615(a) 
applies, which are paid or incurred by corporations which are members of 
the affiliated group on each day of their matching taxable years (during 
such taxable years) exceeds $100,000, then the deduction (or amount 
deferrable) under section 615 for any such member for its matching 
taxable year shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount which 
bears the same ratio to $100,000 as the amount deductible or deferrable 
by such member under section 615 (computed without regard to this 
subdivision) bears to the aggregate of the amounts deductible or 
deferrable under section 615 (as so computed) by all such members.
    (ii) Limitation under section 615(c). If the aggregate of the 
expenditures to which section 615(a) applies which are paid or incurred 
by the corporations which are members of such affiliated group on each 
day of their matching taxable years (during such taxable years) would, 
when added to the aggregate of the amounts deducted or deferred in prior 
taxable years which are taken into account by such corporations in 
applying the limitation of section 615(c), exceed $400,000, then section 
615 shall not apply to any such expenditure so paid or incurred by any 
such member to the extent such expenditure would exceed the amount which 
bears the same ratio to (a) the amount, if any, by which $400,000 
exceeds the amounts so deducted or deferred in prior years, as (b) such 
member's deduction (or amount deferrable) under

[[Page 359]]

section 615 (computed without regard to this subdivision) for such 
expenditures paid or incurred by such member during its matching taxable 
year, bears to (c) the aggregate of the amounts deductible or deferrable 
under section 615 (as so computed) by all such members during their 
matching taxable years.
    (iii) Treatment of corporations filing consolidated returns. For 
purposes of making the computations under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of 
this subparagraph, a corporation which joins in the filing of a 
consolidated return shall be treated as if it filed a separate return.
    (iv) Estimate of exploration expenditures. If, on the date a 
corporation (which is a member of an affiliated group on each day of its 
matching taxable year) files its income tax return for such taxable 
year, it cannot be determined whether or not the $100,000 limitation 
prescribed by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, or the $400,000 
limitation prescribed by subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, will 
apply with respect to such taxable year, then such member shall, for 
purposes of such return, apply the provisions of such subdivisions (i) 
and (ii) with respect to such taxable year on the basis of an estimate 
of the aggregate of the exploration expenditures by all such members of 
the affiliated group for their matching taxable years. Such estimate 
shall be made on the basis of the facts and circumstances known at the 
time of such estimate. If an estimate is used by any such member of the 
affiliated group pursuant to this subdivision, and if the actual 
expenditures by all such members differ from the estimate, then each 
such member shall file as soon as possible an original or amended return 
reflecting an amended apportionment (either pursuant to an apportionment 
plan adopted under paragraph (f) of this section or pursuant to the 
application of the rule provided by subdivision (i) or (ii) of this 
subparagraph) based upon such actual expenditures.
    (v) Amount apportioned under apportionment plan. If an electing 
affiliated group adopts an apportionment plan as provided in paragraph 
(f) of this section with respect to the limitation under section 615(a) 
or 615(c), then the amount apportioned under such plan to any 
corporation which is a member of such group may not exceed the amount 
which such member could have deducted (or deferred) under section 615 
had such affiliated group not filed an election under section 243(b)(2).
    (4) Small business deductions of life insurance companies. In the 
case of a life insurance company taxable under section 802 which is a 
member of such affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable 
year, the small business deduction under sections 804(a)(4) and 
809(d)(10) shall not exceed an amount equal to $25,000 divided by the 
number of life insurance companies taxable under section 802 which are 
members of such group on each day of their matching taxable years.
    (5) Estimated tax--(i) Exemption from estimated tax. Except as 
otherwise provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the 
exemption from estimated tax (for purposes of estimated tax filing 
requirements under section 6016 and the addition to tax under section 
6655 for failure to pay estimated tax) of each corporation which is a 
member of such affiliated group on each day of its matching taxable year 
shall be (in lieu of the $100,000 amount specified in section 6016(a) 
and (b)(2)(A) and in section 6655(d)(1) and (e)(2)(A) an amount equal to 
$100,000 divided by the number of such members.
    (ii) Nonapplication to certain taxable years beginning in 1963 and 
ending in 1964. For purposes of this section, if a corporation has a 
taxable year beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964 the last day of the 
eighth month of which falls on or before April 10, 1964, then 
(notwithstanding the fact that an election under section 243(b)(2) is 
effective for such taxable year) subdivision (i) of this subparagraph 
shall not apply to such corporation for such taxable year. Thus, such 
corporation shall be entitled to a $100,000 exemption from estimated tax 
for such taxable year. Also, with respect to a taxable year described in 
the first sentence of this subdivision, any such corporation shall not 
be considered to be a member of the affiliated group for purposes of 
determining the number of members referred to in subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph.

[[Page 360]]

    (iii) Examples. The provisions of subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation P owns all the stock of corporation S-1 on 
each day of 1965. On March 1, 1965, P acquires all the stock of 
corporation S-2. Corporations P, S-1, and S-2 file separate returns on a 
calendar year basis. On March 31, 1965, the affiliated group consisting 
of P, S-1, and S-2 anticipates making an election under section 
243(b)(2) for P's 1965 taxable year. If the affiliated group does make a 
valid election under section 243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year, under 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph the exemption from estimated tax of 
P for 1965, and the exemption from estimated tax of S-1 for 1965, will 
be (assuming an apportionment plan is not filed pursuant to paragraph 
(f) of this section) an amount equal to $50,000 ($100,000<divide>2). 
(Since S-2 is not a member of the affiliated group on each day of 1965, 
S-2's exemption from estimated tax will be determined for the year 1965 
without regard to subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, whether or not 
the affiliated group makes the election under section 243(b)(2).) P and 
S-1 file declarations of estimated tax on April 15, 1965, on such basis 
and make payments with respect to such declarations on such basis. Thus, 
if the affiliated group does make a valid election under section 
243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year, P and S-1 will not incur (as a result of 
the application of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph to their 1965 
years) additions to tax under section 6655 for failure to pay estimated 
tax.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that, on 
March 31, 1965, S-1 anticipates that it will incur a loss for its 1965 
year. Accordingly, in anticipation of making an election under section 
243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year and adopting an apportionment plan under 
paragraph (f) of this section, P computes its estimated tax liability 
for 1965 on the basis of a $100,000 exemption, and S-1 computes its 
estimated tax liability for 1965 on the basis of a zero exemption. 
Assume S-1 incurs a loss for 1965 as anticipated. Thus, if P does make 
the election for 1965, and an apportionment plan is adopted apportioning 
$100,000 to P and zero to S-1 (for their 1965 years), P and S-1 will not 
incur (as a result of the application of subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph to their 1965 years) additions to tax under section 6655 
for failure to pay estimated tax.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that P 
and S-1 file declarations of estimated tax on April 15, 1965, on the 
basis of separate $100,000 exemptions from estimated tax for their 1965 
years, and make payments with respect to such declarations on such 
basis. Assume that the affiliated group makes an election under section 
243(b)(2) for P's 1965 year. Under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, 
P and S-1 are limited in the aggregate to a single $100,000 exemption 
from estimated tax for their 1965 years. The provisions of section 6655 
will be applied to the 1965 year of P and the 1965 year of S-1 on the 
basis of a $50,000 exemption from estimated tax for each corporation, 
unless a different apportionment of the $100,000 amount is adopted under 
paragraph (f) of this section. Since the election was made under section 
243(b)(2), regardless of whether or not the affiliated group anticipated 
making the election, P or S-1 (or both) may incur additions to tax under 
section 6655 for failure to pay estimated tax.

    (e) Effect of election for certain taxable years beginning in 1963 
and ending in 1964. If an election under section 243(b)(2) by an 
affiliated group is effective for a taxable year of a corporation under 
paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of Sec. 1.243-4 (relating to election for certain 
taxable years beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964), and if such 
corporation is a member of such group on each day of such taxable year, 
then the restrictions and limitations prescribed by paragraphs (b), (c), 
and (d) of this section shall apply to all such members having such 
taxable years (for such taxable years). For purposes of this paragraph, 
such paragraphs shall be applied with respect to such taxable years as 
if such taxable years included the last day of a taxable year of the 
common parent corporation for which an election was effective under 
section 243(b)(2), i.e., as if such taxable years were matching taxable 
years. For apportionment plans with respect to such taxable years, see 
paragraph (f) (9) of this section.
    (f) Apportionment plans--(1) In general. In the case of corporations 
which are members of an affiliated group of corporations on each day of 
their matching taxable years:
    (i) The $100,000 amount referred to in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this 
section (relating to limitation under section 615(a)),
    (ii) The amount determined under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(a) of this 
section (relating to limitation under section 615(c)),
    (iii) The $25,000 amount referred to in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section (relating to small business deduction of life insurance 
companies), and
    (iv) The $100,000 amount referred to in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this 
section

[[Page 361]]

(relating to exemption from estimated tax), may be apportioned among 
such members (for such taxable years) if the common parent corporation 
files an apportionment plan with respect to such taxable years in the 
manner provided in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, and if all other 
members consent to the plan, in the manner provided in subparagraph (5) 
or (6) of this paragraph (whichever is applicable). The plan may provide 
for the apportionment to one or more of such members, in fixed dollar 
amounts, of one or more of the amounts referred to in subdivisions (i), 
(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this subparagraph, but in no event shall the 
sum of the amounts so apportioned in respect to any such subdivision 
exceed the amount referred to in such subdivision. See also paragraph 
(d)(3)(v) of this section, relating to the maximum amount that may be 
apportioned to a corporation under this subparagraph with respect to 
exploration expenditures to which section 615 applies.
    (2) Time for adopting plan. An affiliated group may adopt an 
apportionment plan with respect to the matching taxable years of its 
members only if, at the time such plan is sought to be adopted, there is 
at least 1 year remaining in the statutory period (including any 
extensions thereof) for the assessment of a deficiency against any 
corporation the tax liability of which for any taxable year would be 
increased by the adoption of such plan. (If there is less than 1 year 
remaining with respect to any taxable year, the district director for 
the internal revenue district in which is located the principal place of 
business or principal office or agency of the corporation will 
ordinarily, upon request, enter into an agreement to extend such 
statutory period for assessment and collection of deficiencies.)
    (3) Years for which effective. A valid apportionment plan with 
respect to matching taxable years of members of an affiliated group 
shall be effective for such matching taxable years, and for all 
succeeding matching taxable years of such members, unless the plan is 
amended in accordance with subparagraph (8) of this paragraph or is 
terminated. Thus, the apportionment plan (including any amendments 
thereof) has a continuing effect and need not be renewed annually. An 
apportionment plan with respect to a particular taxable year of the 
common parent shall terminate with respect to the taxable years of the 
members of the affiliated group which include the last day of a 
succeeding taxable year of the common parent if:
    (i) Any corporation which was a member of the affiliated group on 
each day of its matching taxable year which included the last day of the 
particular taxable year of the common parent is not a member of such 
group on each day of its taxable year which includes the last day of 
such succeeding taxable year of the common parent, or
    (ii) Any corporation which was not a member of such group on each 
day of its taxable year which included the last day of the particular 
taxable year of the common parent is a member of such group on each day 
of its taxable year which includes the last day of such succeeding 
taxable year of the common parent.

An apportionment plan, once terminated, is no longer effective. 
Accordingly, unless a new apportionment plan is filed and consented to 
(or the section 243(b)(2) election is terminated) the amounts referred 
to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph will be apportioned among the 
corporations which are members of the affiliated group on each day of 
their matching taxable years in accordance with the rules provided in 
paragraphs (d)(3)(i), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(4), and (d)(5)(i) of this section.
    (4) Filing of plan. The apportionment plan shall be in the form of a 
statement filed by the common parent corporation with the district 
director for the internal revenue district in which is located the 
principal place of business or principal office or agency of such common 
parent. The statement shall be signed by any person who is duly 
authorized to act on behalf of the common parent corporation and shall 
set forth the name, address, internal revenue district, taxpayer account 
number, and taxable year of each member to whom the common parent could 
apportion an amount under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (or, in the 
case of an apportionment plan referred

[[Page 362]]

to in subparagraph (9) of this paragraph, each member to whom the common 
parent could apportion an amount under such subparagraph) and the amount 
(or amounts) apportioned to each such member under the plan.
    (5) Consent of wholly owned subsidiaries. If all the stock of a 
corporation which is a member of the affiliated group on each day of its 
matching taxable year is owned on each such day by another corporation 
(or corporations) which is a member of such group on each day of its 
matching taxable year, such corporation (hereinafter in this paragraph 
referred to as a ``wholly owned subsidiary'') shall be deemed to consent 
to the apportionment plan. Each wholly owned subsidiary should attach a 
copy of the plan filed by the common parent corporation to an income tax 
return, amended return, or claim for refund for its matching taxable 
year.
    (6) Consent of other members. The consent of each member (other than 
the common parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries) to an 
apportionment plan shall be in the form of a statement, signed by any 
person who is duly authorized to act on behalf of the member consenting 
to the plan, stating that such member consents to the plan. The consent 
of more than one such member may be incorporated in a single statement. 
The statement (or statements) shall be attached to the apportionment 
plan filed by the common parent corporation. The consent of any such 
member which, after the date the apportionment plan was filed and during 
its matching taxable year referred to in subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph, ceases to be a wholly owned subsidiary but continues to be a 
member, shall be filled with the district director with whom the 
apportionment plan is filed (as soon as possible after it ceases to be a 
wholly owned subsidiary). Each consenting member should attach a copy of 
the apportionment plan filed by the common parent to an income tax 
return, amended return, or claim for refund for its matching taxable 
year which includes the last day of the taxable year of the common 
parent corporation for which the apportionment plan was filed.
    (7) Members of group filing consolidated return--(i) General rule. 
Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, if the 
members of an affiliated group of corporations include one or more 
corporations taxable under section 11 of the Code and one or more 
insurance companies taxable under section 802 or 821 of the Code and if 
the affiliated group includes corporations which join in the filing of a 
consolidated return, then, for purposes of determining the amount to be 
apportioned to a corporation under an apportionment plan adopted under 
this paragraph, the corporations filing the consolidated return shall be 
treated as a single member.
    (ii) Consenting to an apportionment plan. For purposes of consenting 
to an apportionment plan under subparagraphs (5) and (6) of this 
paragraph, if the members of an affiliated group of corporations include 
corporations which join in the filing of a consolidated return, each 
corporation which joins in filing the consolidated return shall be 
treated as a separate member.
    (8) Amendment of plan. An apportionment plan, which is effective for 
the matching taxable years of members of an affiliated group, may be 
amended if an amended plan is filed (and consented to) within the time 
and in accordance with the rules prescribed in this paragraph for the 
adoption of an original plan with respect to such taxable years.
    (9) Certain taxable years beginning in 1963 and ending in 1964. In 
the case of corporations which are members of an affiliated group of 
corporations on each day of their taxable years referred to in paragraph 
(e) of this section:
    (i) The $100,000 amount referred to in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this 
section (relating to limitation under section 615(a)),
    (ii) The amount determined under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(a) of this 
section (relating to limitation under section 615(c)),
    (iii) The $25,000 amount referred to in paragraph (d)(4) of this 
section (relating to small business deduction of life insurance 
companies), and
    (iv) The $100,000 amount referred to in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this 
section (relating to exemption from estimated

[[Page 363]]

tax), may be apportioned among such members (for such taxable years) if 
an apportionment plan is filed (and consented to) with respect to such 
taxable years in accordance with the rules provided in subparagraphs 
(2), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this paragraph. For purposes of this 
subparagraph, such subparagraphs shall be applied as if such taxable 
years included the last day of a taxable year of the common parent 
corporation, i.e., as if such taxable years were matching taxable years. 
An apportionment plan adopted under this subparagraph shall be effective 
only with respect to taxable years referred to in paragraph (e) of this 
section. The plan may provide for the apportionment to one or more of 
such members, in fixed dollar amounts, of one or more of the amounts 
referred to in subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this 
subparagraph, but in no event shall the sum of the amounts so 
apportioned in respect of any such subdivision exceed the amount 
referred to in such subdivision. See also paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this 
section, relating to the maximum amount that may be apportioned to a 
corporation under an apportionment plan described in this subparagraph 
with respect to exploration expenditures to which section 615 applies.
    (g) Short taxable years--(1) General. If:
    (i) The return of a corporation is for a short period (ending after 
December 31, 1963) on each day of which such corporation is a member of 
an affiliated group,
    (ii) The last day of the common parent's taxable year does not end 
with or within such short period, and
    (iii) An election under section 243(b)(2) by such group is effective 
under paragraph (c) (4) (i) of Sec. 1.243-4 for the taxable year of the 
common parent within which falls such short period, then the 
restrictions and limitations prescribed by section 243(b)(3) shall be 
applied in the manner provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
    (2) Manner of applying restrictions. In the case of a corporation 
described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph having a short period 
described in such subparagraph:
    (i) Such corporation may not consent to an election under section 
1562, relating to election of multiple surtax exemptions, which would be 
effective for such short period;
    (ii) The credit under section 901 shall be allowed to such 
corporation for such short period if, and only if, each corporation, 
which pays or accrues foreign taxes and which is a member of the 
affiliated group on each day of its taxable year which includes the last 
day of the common parent's taxable year within which falls such short 
period, does not deduct such taxes in computing its tax liability for 
its taxable year which includes such last day;
    (iii) The overall limitation provided in section 904(a)(2) shall be 
allowed to such corporation for such short period if, and only if, each 
corporation, which pays or accrues foreign taxes and which is a member 
of the affiliated group on each day of its taxable year which includes 
the last day of the common parent's taxable year within which falls such 
short period, uses such limitation for its taxable year which includes 
such last day;
    (iv) The minimum accumulated earnings credit provided by section 
535(c)(2) (or in the case of a mere holding or investment company, the 
accumulated earnings credit provided by section 535(c)(3)) allowable for 
such short period shall be the amount computed by dividing (a) the 
amount (if any) by which $100,000 exceeds the aggregate of the 
accumulated earnings and profits of the corporations, which are members 
of the affiliated group on the last day of such short period, as of the 
close of their taxable years preceding the taxable year which includes 
the last day of such short period, by (b) the number of such members on 
the last day of such short period;
    (v) The deduction allowable under section 615(a) for such short 
period shall be limited to an amount equal to $100,000 divided by the 
number of corporations which are members of the affiliated group on the 
last day of such short period;
    (vi) If the expenditures to which section 615(a) applies which are 
paid or incurred by such corporation during such short period would, 
when added to the aggregate of the amounts deducted or deferred (in 
taxable years ending before the last day of such short period) which are 
taken into account in applying the

[[Page 364]]

limitation of section 615(c) by corporations which are members of the 
affiliated group on the last day of such short period exceed $400,000, 
then section 615 shall not apply to any such expenditure so paid or 
incurred by such corporation to the extent such expenditure would exceed 
an amount equal to (a) the amount (if any) by which $400,000 exceeds the 
aggregate of the amounts so deducted or deferred in such taxable years 
(computed as if each member filed a separate return), divided by (b) the 
number of corporations in the group which have taxable years ending on 
such last day;
    (vii) If such corporation is a life insurance company taxable under 
section 802, the small business deduction under sections 804(a)(4) and 
809(d)(10) shall not exceed an amount equal to (a) $25,000, divided by 
(b) the number of life insurance companies taxable under section 802 
which are members of the affiliated group on the last day of such short 
period; and
    (viii) The exemption from estimated tax (for purposes of estimated 
tax filing requirements under section 6016 and the addition to tax under 
section 6655 for failure to pay estimated tax) for such short period 
shall be an amount equal to $100,000 divided by the number of 
corporations which are members of the affiliated group on the last day 
of such short period.

<R05>
Sec. 1.244-1   Deduction for dividends received on certain preferred stock.

    A corporation is allowed a deduction under section 244 for dividends 
received on certain preferred stock of certain public utility 
corporations subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code. The 
deduction is allowable only for dividends received on the preferred 
stock of a public utility with respect to which the deduction for 
dividends paid provided in section 247 (relating to dividends paid on 
certain preferred stock of public utilities) is allowable to the 
distributing corporation.


<R05>
Sec. 1.244-2   Computation of deduction.

    (a) General rule. Section 244(a) provides a formula for the 
computation of the deduction for dividends received on the preferred 
stock of a public utility. For purposes of this computation, the normal 
tax rate referred to in section 244(a)(2)(B) shall be determined without 
regard to any additional tax imposed by section 1562(b). See section 
1562(b)(4). The deduction computed under section 244(a) is subject to 
the limitation provided in section 246.
    (b) Qualifying dividends. Section 244(b) provides that in the case 
of dividends received on the preferred stock of a public utility in 
taxable years ending after December 31, 1963, which are ``qualifying 
dividends''(as defined in section 243(b)(1), but determined without 
regard to section 243(c)(4)), the computation of the deduction for 
dividends received shall be made by applying the formula provided by 
section 244(a) separately to such qualifying dividends. For such 
purposes, 100 percent shall be used in lieu of the 85 percent specified 
in section 244(a)(3).
    (c) Examples. The computation of the deduction provided in section 
244 may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation X, which files its income tax returns on the 
calendar year basis, received in 1965 $100,000 as dividends on the 
preferred stock of corporation Y, a public utility corporation which is 
subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code. The deduction provided 
in section 247 is allowable to Y, the distributing corporation, with 
respect to these dividends and they are not ``qualifying dividends''(as 
defined in section 243(b)(1) but determined without regard to section 
243(c)(4)). The corporation normal tax rate and the surtax rate for the 
calendar year 1965 are 22 percent and 26 percent, respectively. The 
deduction allowable to X under section 244(a) for the year 1965 with 
respect to these dividends is $60,208.33, computed as follows:

Dividends received on preferred stock of corporation Y....   $100,000.00
Less: The fraction specified in section 244(a)(2): 14/48 x              
 $100,000.................................................     29,166.67
                                                           -------------
Amount subject to 85-percent deduction....................     70,833.33
                                                           -------------
Deduction--85 percent of $70,833.33.......................     60,208.33
                                                           =============
                                                                        

The result would be the same if X or Y(or both) were subject to the 6-
percent additional tax imposed by section 1562(b) for 1965.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) and also assume 
that in 1965 corporation X received $200,000 as dividends on the 
preferred stock of Corporation Z, a public utility corporation which is 
subject to

[[Page 365]]

taxation under chapter 1 of the Code. Assume further that such dividends 
are ``qualifying dividends'' (as defined in section 243(b)(1) but 
determined without regard to section 243(c)(4)). The deduction provided 
in section 247 is allowable to Z, the distributing corporation, with 
respect to these dividends. The deduction allowable to X under section 
244 for the year 1965 is $201,875, computed as follows:

Deduction allowable under section 244(a) with respect to                
 the dividend received from Y (see Example (1))...........    $60,208.33
Deduction allowable under section 244(b) with respect to                
 the dividend received from Z: Qualifying dividends                     
 received on preferred stock of corporation Z.............    200,000.00
Less: The fraction specified in section 244(a)(2): 14/48 x              
 $200,000.................................................     58,333.33
                                                           -------------
Deduction.................................................    141,666.67
                                                           -------------
Deduction allowable under section 244 for 1965............    201,875.00
                                                           =============
                                                                        

[T.D. 6992, 34 FR 825, Jan. 18, 1969]


<R05>
Sec. 1.245-1   Dividends received from certain foreign corporations.

    (a) General rule. (1) A corporation is allowed a deduction under 
section 245(a) for dividends received from a foreign corporation (other 
than a foreign personal holding company as defined in section 552) which 
is subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code if, for an 
uninterrupted period of not less than 36 months ending with the close of 
the foreign corporation's taxable year in which the dividends are paid, 
(i) the foreign corporation is engaged in trade or business in the 
United States, and (ii) 50 percent or more of the foreign corporation's 
entire gross income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade 
or business in the United States by that corporation. If the foreign 
corporation has been in existence less than 36 months as of the close of 
the taxable year in which the dividends are paid, then the applicable 
uninterrupted period to be taken into consideration in lieu of the 
uninterrupted period of 36 or more months is the entire period such 
corporation has been in existence as of the close of such taxable year. 
An uninterrupted period which satisfied the twofold requirement with 
respect to business activity and gross income may start at a date later 
than the date on which the foreign corporation first commenced an 
uninterrupted period of engaging in trade or business within the United 
States, but the applicable uninterrupted period is in any event the 
longest uninterrupted period which satisfies such twofold requirement. 
The deduction under section 245(a) is allowable to any corporation, 
whether foreign or domestic, receiving dividends from a distributing 
corporation which meets the requirements of that section.
    (2) Any taxable year of a foreign corporation which falls within the 
uninterrupted period described in section 245(a)(2) shall not be taken 
into account in applying section 245(a)(2) and this paragraph if the 100 
percent dividends received deduction would be allowable under paragraph 
(b) of this section, whether or not in fact allowed, with respect to any 
dividends payable, whether or not in fact paid, out of the earnings and 
profits of such foreign corporation for that taxable year. Thus, in such 
case the foreign corporation shall be treated as having no earnings and 
profits for that taxable year for purposes of determining the dividends 
received deduction allowable under section 245(a) and this paragraph. 
However, that taxable year may be taken into account for purposes of 
determining whether the foreign corporation meets the requirements of 
section 245(a) that, for the uninterrupted period specified therein, the 
foreign corporation is engaged in trade or business in the United States 
and meets the 50 percent gross income requirement.
    (b) Dividends from wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. (1) A domestic 
corporation is allowed a deduction under section 245(b) for any taxable 
year beginning after December 31, 1966, for dividends received from a 
foreign corporation (other than a foreign personal holding company as 
defined in section 552) which is subject to taxation under Chapter 1 of 
the Code if:
    (i) The domestic corporation owns either directly or indirectly all 
of the outstanding stock of the foreign corporation during the entire 
taxable year of the domestic corporation in which the dividends are 
received, and
    (ii) The dividends are paid out of earnings and profits of a taxable 
year of the foreign corporation during which

[[Page 366]]

(a) the domestic corporation receiving the dividends owns directly or 
indirectly throughout such year all of the outstanding stock of the 
foreign corporation, and (b) all of the gross income of the foreign 
corporation from all sources is effectively connected for that year with 
the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that 
corporation.
    (2) The deduction allowed by section 245(b) does not apply if an 
election under section 1562, relating to the privilege of a controlled 
group of corporations to elect multiple surtax exemptions, is effective 
for either the taxable year of the domestic corporation in which the 
dividends are received or the taxable year of the foreign corporation 
out of the earnings and profits of which the dividends are paid.
    (c) Rules of application. (1) Except as provided in section 246, the 
deduction provided by section 245 for any taxable year is the sum of the 
amounts computed under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 245(a) plus, in 
the case of a domestic corporation for any taxable year beginning after 
December 31, 1966, the sum of the amounts computed under section 
245(b)(2).
    (2) To the extent that a dividend received from a foreign 
corporation is treated as a dividend from a domestic corporation in 
accordance with section 243(d) and Sec. 1.243-3, it shall not be treated 
as a dividend received from a foreign corporation for purposes of this 
section.
    (3) For purposes of section 245 (a) and (b), the amount of a 
distribution shall be determined under subparagraph (B) (without 
reference to subparagraph (C)) of section 301(b)(1).
    (4) In determining from what year's earnings and profits a dividend 
is treated as having been distributed for purposes of this section, the 
principles of paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.316-2 shall apply. A dividend 
shall be considered to be distributed, first, out of the earnings and 
profits of the taxable year which includes the date the dividend is 
distributed, second, out of the earnings and profits accumulated for the 
immediately preceding taxable year, third, out of the earnings and 
profits accumulated for the second preceding taxable year, etc. A 
deficit in an earnings and profits account for any taxable year shall 
reduce the most recently accumulated earnings and profits for a prior 
year in such account. If there are no accumulated earnings and profits 
in an earnings and profits account because of a deficit incurred in a 
prior year, such deficit must be restored before earnings and profits 
can be accumulated in a subsequent accounting year. See also paragraph 
(c) of Sec. 1.243-3 and paragraph (a)(6) of Sec. 1.243-4.
    (5) For purposes of this section the gross income of a foreign 
corporation for any period before its first taxable year beginning after 
December 31, 1966, which is from sources within the United States shall 
be treated as gross income which is effectively connected for that 
period with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by 
that corporation.
    (6) For the determination of the source of income and the income 
which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business 
in the United States, see sections 861 through 864, and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (d) Illustrations. The application of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation A (a foreign corporation filing its income 
tax returns on a calendar year basis) whose stock is 100 percent owned 
by Corporation B (a domestic corporation filing its income tax returns 
on a calendar year basis) for the first time engaged in trade or 
business within the United States on January 1, 1943, and qualifies 
under section 245 for the entire period beginning on that date and 
ending on December 31, 1954. Corporation A had accumulated earnings and 
profits of $50,000 immediately prior to January 1, 1943, and had 
earnings and profits of $10,000 for each taxable year during the 
uninterrupted period from January 1, 1943, through December 31, 1954. It 
derived for the period from January 1, 1943, through December 31, 1953, 
90 percent of its gross income from sources within the United States and 
in 1954 derived 95 percent of its gross income from sources within the 
United States. During the calendar years 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, and 
1947 Corporation A distributed in each year $15,000; during the calendar 
years 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, and 1953 it distributed in each year 
$5,000; and during the year 1954, $50,000. An analysis of the 
accumulated earnings and profits under the above statement of facts 
discloses that at December 31, 1953, the accumulation amounted to 
$55,000, of

[[Page 367]]

which $25,000 was accumulated prior to the ``uninterrupted period'' and 
$30,000 was accumulated during the uninterrupted period. (See section 
316(a) and paragraph (c) of this section.) For 1954 a deduction under 
section 245 of $31,025 ($8,075 on 1954 earnings of the foreign 
corporation, plus $22,950 from the $30,000 accumulation at December 31, 
1953) for dividends received from a foreign corporation is allowable to 
Corporation B with respect to the $50,000 received from Corporation A, 
computed as follows:
    (i) $8,075, which is $8,500 (85 percent-- the percent specified in 
section 243 for the calendar year 1954--of the $10,000 of earnings and 
profits of the taxable year) multiplied by 95 percent (the portion of 
the gross income of Corporation A derived during the taxable year 1954 
from sources within the United States), plus
    (ii) $22,950, which is $25,500 (85 percent-- the percent specified 
in section 243 for the calendar year 1954--of $30,000, the part of the 
earnings and profits accumulated after the beginning of the 
uninterrupted period) multiplied by 90 percent (the portion of the gross 
income of Corporation A derived from sources within the United States 
during that portion of the uninterrupted period ending at the beginning 
of the taxable year 1954).
    Example 2. If in Example (1), Corporation A for the taxable year 
1954 had incurred a deficit of $10,000 (shown to have been incurred 
before December 31) the amount of the earnings and profits accumulated 
after the beginning of the uninterrupted period would be $20,000. If 
Corporation A had distributed $50,000 on December 31, 1954, the 
deduction under section 245 for dividends received from a foreign 
corporation allowable to Corporation B for 1954 would be $15,300, 
computed by multiplying $17,000 (85 percent--the percent specified in 
section 243 for the calendar year 1954--of $20,000 earnings and profits 
accumulated after the beginning of the uninterrupted period) by 90 
percent (the portion of the gross income of Corporation A derived from 
United States sources during that portion of the uninterrupted period 
ending at the beginning of the taxable year 1954).
    Example 3. Corporation A (a foreign corporation filing its income 
tax returns on a calendar year basis) whose stock is 100 percent owned 
by corporation B (a domestic corporation filing its income tax returns 
on a calendar year basis) for the first time engaged in trade or 
business within the United States on January 1, 1960, and qualifies 
under section 245 for the entire period beginning on that date and 
ending on December 31, 1963. In 1963, A derived 75 percent of its gross 
income from sources within the United States. A's earnings and profits 
for 1963 (computed as of the close of the taxable year without 
diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year) 
are $200,000. On December 31, 1963, corporation A distributes to 
corporation B 100 shares of corporation C stock which have an adjusted 
basis in A's hands of $40,000 and a fair market value of $100,000. For 
purposes of computing the deduction under section 245 for dividends 
received from a foreign corporation, the amount of the distribution is 
$40,000. B is allowed a deduction under section 245 of $25,500, i.e., 
$34,000 ($40,000 multiplied by 85 percent, the percent specified in 
section 243 for 1963), multiplied by 75 percent (the portion of the 
gross income of corporation A derived during 1963 from sources within 
the United States).

Sec. 1.246-1   Deductions not allowed for dividends from certain corporations.

    The deductions provided in sections 243 (relating to dividends 
received by corporations), 244 (relating to dividends received on 
certain preferred stock), and 245 (relating to dividends received from 
certain foreign corporations), are not allowable with respect to any 
dividend received from:
    (a) A corporation organized under the China Trade Act, 1922 (15 
U.S.C. ch. 4) (see section 941); or
    (b) A corporation which is exempt from tax under section 501 
(relating to certain charitable, etc., organizations) or section 521 
(relating to farmers' cooperative associations) for the taxable year of 
the corporation in which the distribution is made or for its next 
preceding taxable year; for
    (c) A corporation to which section 931 (relating to income from 
sources within possessions of the United States) applies for the taxable 
year of the corporation in which the distribution is made or for its 
next preceding taxable year; or
    (d) A real estate investment trust which, for its taxable year in 
which the distribution is made, is taxable under Part II, Subchapter M, 
Chapter 1 of the Code. See section 243(c)(3), paragraph (c) of 
Sec. 1.243-2, section 857(c), and paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.857-6.

Sec. 1.246-2   Limitation on aggregate amount of deductions.

    (a) General rule. The sum of the deductions allowed by sections 
243(a)(1) (relating to dividends received by corporations), 244(a) 
(relating to dividends received on certain preferred stock), and 245 
(relating to dividends received from certain foreign corporations), 
except as provided in section 246(b)(2) and in paragraph (b) of this 
section, is limited to 85 percent of the taxable income of the 
corporation. The taxable income of the corporation for this purpose is 
computed without regard to the net operating loss deduction allowed by 
section 172, the deduction for dividends paid on certain preferred stock 
of public utilities allowed by section 247, any capital loss carryback 
under section 1212(a)(1), and the deductions provided in sections 
243(a)(1), 244(a), and 245. For definition of the term taxable income, 
see section 63.
    (b) Effect of net operating loss. If the shareholder corporation has 
a net operating loss (as determined under sec. 172) for a taxable year, 
the limitation provided in section 246(b)(1) and in paragraph (a) of 
this section is not applicable for such taxable year. In that event, the 
deductions provided in sections 243(a)(1), 244(a), and 245 shall be 
allowable for all tax purposes to the shareholder corporation for such 
taxable year without regard to such limitation. If the shareholder 
corporation does not have a net operating loss for the taxable year, 
however, the limitation will be applicable for all tax purposes for such 
taxable year. In determining whether the shareholder corporation has a 
net operating loss for a taxable year under section 172, the deductions 
allowed by sections 243(a)(1), 244(a), and 245 are to be computed 
without regard to the limitation provided in section 246(b)(1) and in 
paragraph (a) of this section.

[T.D. 6992, 34 FR 825, Jan. 18, 1969, as amended by T.D. 7301, 39 FR 
963, Jan. 4, 1974]


<R05>
Sec. 1.246-3   Exclusion of certain dividends.

    (a) In general. Corporate taxpayers are denied, in certain cases, 
the dividends-received deduction provided by section 243 (dividends 
received by corporations), section 244 (dividends received on certain 
preferred stock), and section 245 (dividends received from certain 
foreign corporations). The above-mentioned dividends-received deductions 
are denied, under section 246(c)(1), to corporate shareholders:
    (1) If the dividend is in respect of any share of stock which is 
sold or otherwise disposed of in any case where the taxpayer has held 
such share for 15 days or less; or
    (2) If and to the extent that the taxpayer is under an obligation to 
make corresponding payments with respect to substantially identical 
stock or securities. It is immaterial whether the obligation has arisen 
pursuant to a short sale or otherwise.
    (b) Ninety-day rule for certain preference dividends. In the case of 
any stock having a preference in dividends, a special rule is provided 
by section 246(c)(2) in lieu of the 15-day rule described in section 
246(c)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the taxpayer receives 
dividends on such stock which are attributable to a period or periods 
aggregating in excess of 366 days, the holding period specified in 
section 246(c)(1)(A) shall be 90 days (in lieu of 15 days).
    (c) Definitions--(1) ``Otherwise disposed of''. As used in this 
section the term otherwise disposed of includes disposal by gift.
    (2) ``Substantially identical stock or securities''. The term 
substantially identical stock or securities is to be applied according 
to the facts and circumstances in each case. In general, the term has 
the same meaning as the corresponding terms in sections 1091 and 1233 
and the regulations thereunder. See paragraph (d)(1) of Sec. 1.1233-1.
    (3) Obligation to make corresponding payments. (i) Section 
246(c)(1)(B) of the Code denies the dividends-received deduction to a 
corporate taxpayer to the extent that such taxpayer is under an 
obligation, with respect to substantially identical stock or securities, 
to make payments corresponding to the dividend received. Thus, for 
example, where a corporate taxpayer is in both a ``long'' and ``short'' 
position with respect to the same stock on the date that such stock goes 
ex-dividend, the dividend received on the stock owned by the taxpayer 
will not be eligible for

[[Page 369]]

the dividends-received deduction to the extent that the taxpayer is 
obligated to make payments to cover the dividends with respect to its 
offsetting short position in the same stock. The dividends-received 
deduction is denied in such a case without regard to the length of time 
the taxpayer has held the stock on which such dividends are received.
    (ii) The provisions of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. Y Corporation owns 100 shares of the Z Corporation's common 
stock on January 1, 1959. Z Corporation on January 15, 1959, declares a 
dividend of $1.00 per share payable to shareholders of record on January 
30, 1959. On January 21, 1959, Y Corporation sells short 25 shares of 
the Z Corporation's common stock and remains in the short position on 
January 31, 1959, the day that Z Corporation's common stock goes ex-
dividend. Y Corporation is therefore obligated to make a payment to the 
lender of the 25 shares of Z Corporation's common stock which were sold 
short, corresponding to the $1.00 a share dividend that the lender would 
have received on those 25 shares, or $25.00. Therefore, $25.00 of the 
$100.00 that the Y Corporation receives as dividends from the Z 
Corporation with respect to the 100 shares of common stock in which it 
has a long position is not eligible for the dividends-received 
deduction.

    (d) Determination of holding period--(1) In general. Special rules 
are provided by paragraph (3) of section 246(c) for determining the 
period for which the taxpayer has held any share of stock for purposes 
of the restriction provided by such section. In computing the holding 
period the day of disposition but not the day of acquisition shall be 
taken into account. Also, there shall not be taken into account any day 
which is more than 15 days after the date on which the share of stock 
becomes ex-dividend. Thus, the holding period is automatically 
terminated at the end of such 15-day period without regard to how long 
the stock may be held after that date. In the case of stock qualifying 
under paragraph (2) of section 246(c) (as having preference in 
dividends) a 90-day period is substituted for the 15-day period 
prescribed in this subparagraph. Finally, section 1223(4), relating to 
holding periods in the case of wash sales, shall not apply. Therefore, 
tacking of the holding period of the stock disposed of to the holding 
period of the stock acquired where a wash sale occurs is not permitted 
for purposes of determining the holding period described in section 
246(c).
    (2) Special rules. Section 246(c) requires that the holding periods 
determined thereunder shall be appropriately reduced for any period that 
the taxpayer's stock holding is offset by a corresponding short position 
resulting from an option to sell, a contractual obligation to sell, or a 
short sale of, substantially identical stock or securities. The holding 
periods of stock held for a period of 15 days or less on the date such 
short position is created shall accordingly be reduced to the extent of 
such short position. Where the amount of stock acquired within such 
period exceeds the amount as to which the taxpayer establishes a short 
position, the stock the holding period of which must be reduced because 
of such short position shall be that most recently acquired within such 
period. If, on the date the short position is created, the amount of 
stock subject to the short position exceeds the amount, if any, of stock 
held by the taxpayer for 15 days or less, the excess shares of stock 
sold short shall, to the extent thereof, postpone until the termination 
of the short position the commencement of the holding periods of 
subsequently acquired stock. Stock having a preference in dividends is 
also subject to the rules prescribed in this subparagraph, except that 
the 90-day period provided by paragraph (b) of this section shall apply 
in lieu of the 15-day period otherwise applicable. The rules prescribed 
in this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. L Company purchased 100 shares of Z Corporation's common 
stock during January 1959. On November 26, 1959, L Company purchased an 
additional 100 shares of the same stock. On December 1, 1959, Z 
Corporation declared a dividend payable on its common stock to 
shareholders of record on December 20, 1959. Also on December 1, L 
Company sold short 150 shares of Z Corporation's common stock. On 
December 16, 1959 (before the stock went ex-dividend), L Company closed 
its short sale with 150 shares purchased on that date. In determining, 
for purposes of section 246(c), whether L Company has held the 100 
shares of stock acquired on November 26 for a period in excess of 15 
days, the period of the short position (from December 2 through December 
16) shall

[[Page 370]]

be excluded. Thus, if on or before December 26, 1959, L Company sold the 
100 shares of Z Corporation stock which it purchased on November 26, 
1959, it would not be entitled to a dividends-received deduction for the 
dividends received on such shares because it would have held such shares 
for 15 days or less on the date of the sale. Since L Company had held 
the 100 shares acquired during January 1959 for more than 15 days on 
December 2, 1959, and since it was under no obligation to make payments 
corresponding to the dividends received thereon, section 246(c) is 
inapplicable to the dividends received with respect to those shares.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) above except that 
the additional 100 shares of Z Corporation common stock were purchased 
by L Company on December 10, 1959, rather than November 26, 1959. In 
determining, for purposes of section 246(c), whether L Company has held 
such shares for a period in excess of 15 days, the period from December 
11, 1959, until December 16, 1959 (the date the short sale made on 
December 1 was closed), shall be excluded.

    (e) Effective date. The provisions of this section shall apply to 
stock acquired after December 31, 1957, or with respect to stock 
acquired before that date where the taxpayer has made a short sale of 
substantially identical stock or securities after that date.


<R05>
Sec. 1.246-4   Dividends from a DISC or former DISC.

    The deduction provided in section 243 (relating to dividends 
received by corporations) is not allowable with respect to any dividend 
(whether in the form of a deemed or actual distribution or an amount 
treated as a dividend pursuant to section 995(c)) from a corporation 
which is a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a)(1) or (3) 
as the case may be) to the extent such dividend is from the 
corporation's accumulated DISC income (as defined in section 996(f)(1)) 
or previously taxed income (as defined in section 996(f)(2)) or is a 
deemed distribution pursuant to section 995(b)(1) in a taxable year for 
which the corporation qualifies (or is treated) as a DISC. To the extent 
that a dividend is paid out of earnings and profits which are not made 
up of accumulated DISC income or previously taxed income, the corporate 
recipient is entitled to the deduction provided in section 243 in the 
same manner and to the same extent as a dividend from a domestic 
corporation which is not a DISC or former DISC.

[T.D. 7283, 38 FR 20824, Aug. 3, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 1.246-5  Reduction of holding periods in certain situations.

    (a) In general. Under section 246(c)(4)(C), the holding period of 
stock for purposes of the dividends received deduction is appropriately 
reduced for any period in which a taxpayer has diminished its risk of 
loss by holding one or more other positions with respect to 
substantially similar or related property. This section provides rules 
for applying section 246(c)(4)(C).
    (b) Definitions--(1) Substantially similar or related property. The 
term substantially similar or related property is applied according to 
the facts and circumstances in each case. In general, property is 
substantially similar or related to stock when--
    (i) The fair market values of the stock and the property primarily 
reflect the performance of--
    (A) A single firm or enterprise;
    (B) The same industry or industries; or
    (C) The same economic factor or factors such as (but not limited to) 
interest rates, commodity prices, or foreign-currency exchange rates; 
and
    (ii) Changes in the fair market value of the stock are reasonably 
expected to approximate, directly or inversely, changes in the fair 
market value of the property, a fraction of the fair market value of the 
property, or a multiple of the fair market value of the property.
    (2) Diminished risk of loss. A taxpayer has diminished its risk of 
loss on its stock by holding positions with respect to substantially 
similar or related property if changes in the fair market values of the 
stock and the positions are reasonably expected to vary inversely.
    (3) Position. For purposes of this section, a position with respect 
to property is an interest (including a futures or forward contract or 
an option) in property or any contractual right to a payment, whether or 
not severable from stock or other property. A position does not include 
traditional equity rights to demand payment from the issuer, such as the 
rights traditionally

[[Page 371]]

provided by mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.
    (4) Reasonable expectations. For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i), 
(b)(2), or (c)(1)(vi) of this section, reasonable expectations are the 
expectations of a reasonable person, based on all the facts and 
circumstances at the later of the time the stock is acquired or the 
positions are entered into. Reasonable expectations include all explicit 
or implicit representations made with respect to the marketing or sale 
of the position.
    (c) Special rules--(1) Positions in more than one stock--(i) In 
general. This paragraph (c)(1) provides rules for the treatment of 
positions that reflect the value of more than one stock. In general, 
positions that reflect the value of a portfolio of stocks are treated 
under the rules of paragraphs (c)(1) (ii) through (iv) of this section, 
and positions that reflect the value of more than one stock but less 
than a portfolio are treated under the rules of paragraph (c)(1)(v) of 
this section. A portfolio for this purpose is any group of stocks of 20 
or more unrelated issuers. Paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section provides 
an anti-abuse rule.
    (ii) Portfolios. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a 
position reflecting the value of a portfolio of stocks is substantially 
similar or related to the stocks held by the taxpayer only if the 
position and the taxpayer's holdings substantially overlap as of the 
most recent testing date. A position may be substantially similar or 
related to a taxpayer's entire stock holdings or a portion of a 
taxpayer's stock holdings.
    (iii) Determining substantial overlap. This paragraph (c)(1)(iii) 
provides rules for determining whether a position and a taxpayer's stock 
holdings or a portion of a taxpayer's stock holdings substantially 
overlap. Paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) (A) through (C) of this section 
determine whether there is substantial overlap as of any testing date.
    (A) Step One. Construct a subportfolio (the Subportfolio) that 
consists of stock in an amount equal to the lesser of the fair market 
value of each stock represented in the position and the fair market 
value of the stock in the taxpayer's stock holdings. (The Subportfolio 
may contain fewer than 20 stocks.)
    (B) Step Two. If the fair market value of the Subportfolio is equal 
to or greater than 70 percent of the fair market value of the stocks 
represented in the position, the position and the Subportfolio 
substantially overlap.
    (C) Step Three. If the position does not substantially overlap with 
the Subportfolio, repeat Steps One and Two (paragraphs (c)(1)(iii)(A) 
and (B) of this section) reducing the size of the position. The largest 
percentage of the position that results in a substantial overlap is 
substantially similar or related to the Subportfolio determined with 
respect to that percentage of the position.
    (iv) Testing date. A testing date is any day on which the taxpayer 
purchases or sells any stock if the fair market value of the stock or 
the fair market value of substantially similar or related property is 
reflected in the position, any day on which the taxpayer changes the 
position, or any day on which the composition of the position changes.
    (v) Nonportfolio positions. A position that reflects the fair market 
value of more than one stock but not of a portfolio of stocks is treated 
as a separate position with respect to each of the stocks the value of 
which the position reflects.
    (vi) Anti-abuse rule. Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through 
(v) of this section, a position that reflects the value of more than one 
stock is a position in substantially similar or related property to the 
appropriate portion of the taxpayer's stock holdings if--
    (A) Changes in the value of the position or the stocks reflected in 
the position are reasonably expected to virtually track (directly or 
inversely) changes in the value of the taxpayer's stock holdings, or any 
portion of the taxpayer's stock holdings and other positions of the 
taxpayer; and
    (B) The position is acquired or held as part of a plan a principal 
purpose of which is to obtain tax savings (including by deferring tax) 
the value of which is significantly in excess of the expected pre-tax 
economic profits from the plan.
    (2) Options--(i) Options that are significantly out of the money. 
For purposes of

[[Page 372]]

paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an option to sell that is 
significantly out of the money does not diminish the taxpayer's risk of 
loss on its stock unless the option is held as part of a strategy to 
substantially offset changes in the fair market value of the stock.
    (ii) Conversion rights. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of 
this section, a taxpayer is treated as diminishing its risk of loss by 
holding substantially similar or related property if it engages in the 
following transactions or their substantial equivalents--
    (A) A short sale of common stock while holding convertible preferred 
stock of the same issuer and the price changes of the convertible 
preferred stock and the common stock are related;
    (B) A short sale of a convertible debenture while holding 
convertible preferred stock into which the debenture is convertible or 
common stock; or
    (C) A short sale of convertible preferred stock while holding common 
stock.
    (3) Stacking rule. If a taxpayer diminishes its risk of loss by 
holding a position in substantially similar or related property with 
respect to only a portion of the shares that the taxpayer holds in a 
particular stock, the holding period of those shares having the shortest 
holding period is reduced.
    (4) Guarantees, surety agreements, or similar arrangements. A 
taxpayer has diminished its risk of loss on stock by holding a position 
in substantially similar or related property if the taxpayer is the 
beneficiary of a guarantee, surety agreement, or similar arrangement and 
the guarantee, surety agreement, or similar arrangement provides for 
payments that will substantially offset decreases in the fair market 
value of the stock.
    (5) Hedges counted only once. A position established as a hedge of 
one outstanding position, transaction, or obligation of the taxpayer 
(other than stock) is not treated as diminishing the risk of loss with 
respect to any other position held by the taxpayer. In determining 
whether a position is established to hedge an outstanding position, 
transaction, or obligation of the taxpayer, substantial deference will 
be given to the relationships that are established in its books and 
records at the time the position is entered into.
    (6) Use of related persons or pass-through entities. Positions held 
by a party related to the taxpayer within the meaning of sections 267(b) 
or 707(b)(1) are treated as positions held by the taxpayer if the 
positions are held with a view to avoiding the application of this 
section or Sec. 1.1092(d)-2. In addition, a taxpayer is treated as 
diminishing its risk of loss by holding substantially similar or related 
property if the taxpayer holds an interest in, or is the beneficiary of, 
a pass-through entity, intermediary, or other arrangement with a view to 
avoiding the application of this section or Sec. 1.1092(d)-2.
    (7) Notional principal contracts. For purposes of this section, 
rights and obligations under notional principal contracts are considered 
separately even though payments with regard to those rights and 
obligations are generally netted for other purposes. Therefore, if a 
taxpayer is treated under the preceding sentence as receiving payments 
under a notional principal contract when the fair market value of the 
taxpayer's stock declines, the taxpayer has diminished its risk of loss 
by holding a position in substantially similar or related property 
regardless of the netting of the payments under the contract for any 
other purposes.
    (d) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of 
this section:
    Example 1. General application to common stock. Corporation A and 
Corporation B are both automobile manufacturers. The fair market values 
of Corporation A and Corporation B common stock primarily reflect the 
value of the same industry. Because Corporation A and Corporation B 
common stock are affected not only by the general level of growth in the 
industry but also by individual corporate management decisions and 
corporate capital structures, changes in the fair market value of 
Corporation A common stock are not reasonably expected to approximate 
changes in the fair market value of the Corporation B common stock. 
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, Corporation A common stock is 
not substantially similar or related to Corporation B common stock.
    Example 2. Common stock value primarily reflects commodity price. 
Corporation C and Corporation D both hold gold as their primary asset, 
and historically changes in the fair market value of Corporation C 
common

[[Page 373]]

stock approximated changes in the fair market value of Corporation D 
common stock. Corporation M purchased Corporation C common stock and 
sold short Corporation D common stock. Corporation C common stock is 
substantially similar or related to Corporation D common stock because 
their fair market values primarily reflect the performance of the same 
economic factor, the price of gold, and changes in the fair market value 
of Corporation C common stock are reasonably expected to approximate 
changes in the fair market value of Corporation D common stock. It was 
reasonably expected that changes in the fair market values of the 
Corporation C common stock and the short position in Corporation D 
common stock would vary inversely. Thus, Corporation M has diminished 
its risk of loss on its Corporation C common stock for purposes of 
section 246(c)(4)(C) and this section by holding a position in 
substantially similar or related property.
    Example 3. Portfolios of stocks--(i) Corporation Z holds a portfolio 
of stocks and acquires a short position on a publicly traded index 
through a regulated futures contract (RFC) that reflects the value of a 
portfolio of stocks as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. 
The index reflects the fair market value of stocks A through T. The 
values of stocks reflected in the index and the values of the same 
stocks in Corporation Z's holdings are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Z's

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) The position is substantially similar or related to Z's stock 
holdings only if they substantially overlap. To determine whether they 
substantially overlap, Corporation Z must construct a Subportfolio of 
stocks with the lesser of the value of the stock as reflected in the RFC 
and its holdings. The Subportfolio is given in the rightmost column 
above. The value of the Subportfolio is 60.74 percent of the value of 
the stocks represented in the position ($4100<divide>$6750), so the 
position and the Subportfolio do not substantially overlap.
    (iii) To determine whether any portion of the position substantially 
overlaps with any portion of the Z's stock holdings, the values of the 
stocks in the RFC are reduced for purposes of the above steps. Eighty 
percent of the position and the corresponding subportfolio (consisting 
of stocks with a value of the lesser of the stocks represented in Z's 
holdings and in 80 percent of the RFC) substantially overlap, computed 
as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Z's     80% of

    (iv) Because $3,780 is 70 percent of $5,400, the Subportfolio 
substantially overlaps with 80 percent of the position. Under paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section, Z's stocks having the shortest holding period 
are treated as included in the Subportfolio. A larger portion of Z's 
stocks may be treated as substantially similar or related property under 
the anti-abuse rule of paragraph (c)(1)(vi) of this section.

    Example 4. Hedges counted only once. January 1, 1996, Corporation X 
owns a $100 million portfolio of stocks all of which would substantially 
overlap with a $100 million regulated futures contract (RFC) on a 
commonly used index (the Index). On January 15, Corporation X enters 
into a $100 million short position in an RFC on the Index with a March 
delivery date and enters into a $75 million long position in an RFC on 
the Index for June delivery. Also on January 15, 1996, Corporation X 
indicates in its books and records that the long and short RFC positions 
are intended to offset one another. Under paragraph (c)(5) of this 
section, $75 million of the short position in the RFC is not treated as 
diminishing the risk of loss on the stock portfolio and instead is 
treated as

[[Page 374]]

a straddle or a hedging transaction, as appropriate, with respect to the 
$75 million long position in the RFC, under section 1092. The remaining 
$25 million short position is treated as diminishing the risk of loss on 
the portfolio by holding a position in substantially similar or related 
property. The rules of paragraph (c)(1) determine how much of the 
portfolio is subject to this rule and the rules of paragraph (c)(3) 
determine which shares have their holding periods tolled.

    (e) Effective date--(1) In general. The provisions of this section 
apply to dividends received on or after March 17, 1995, on stock 
acquired after July 18, 1984.

    (2) Special rule for dividends received on certain stock. 
Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, this section applies 
to any dividends received by a taxpayer on stock acquired after July 18, 
1984, if the taxpayer has diminished its risk of loss by holding 
substantially similar or related property involving the following types 
of transactions--

    (i) The short sale of common stock when holding convertible 
preferred stock of the same issuer and the price changes of the two 
stocks are related, or the short sale of a convertible debenture while 
holding convertible preferred stock into which the debenture is 
convertible (or common stock), or a short sale of convertible preferred 
stock while holding common stock; or

    (ii) The acquisition of a short position in a regulated futures 
contract on a stock index, or the acquisition of an option to sell the 
regulated futures contract or the stock index itself, or the grant of a 
deep-in-the-money option to buy the regulated futures contract or the 
stock index while holding the stock of an investment company whose 
principal holdings mimic the performance of the stocks included in the 
stock index; or alternatively, while holding a portfolio composed of 
stocks that mimic the performance of the stocks included in the stock 
index.

<R05>
Sec. 1.247-1   Deduction for dividends paid on preferred stock of public utilities.

    (a) Amount of deduction. (1) A deduction is provided in section 247 
for dividends paid during the taxable year by certain public utility 
corporations (see paragraph (b) of this section) on certain preferred 
stock (see paragraph (c) of this section). This deduction is an amount 
equal to the product of a specified fraction times the lesser of (i) the 
amount of the dividends paid during the taxable year by a public utility 
on its preferred stock (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section), or 
(ii) the taxable income of the public utility for such taxable year 
(computed without regard to the deduction allowed by section 247). The 
specified fraction for any taxable year is the fraction the numerator of 
which is 14 and the denominator of which is the sum of the corporation 
normal tax rate and the surtax rate for such taxable year specified in 
section 11. Since section 11 provides that for the calendar year 1954 
the corporation normal tax rate is 30 percent and the surtax rate is 22 
percent, the sum of the two tax rates is 52 percent and the specified 
fraction for the calendar year 1954 is 14/52. If, for example, section 
11 should specify that the corporation's normal tax rate is 25 percent 
and the surtax rate is 22 percent for the calendar year, the sum of the 
two tax rates will be 47 percent and the specified fraction for the 
calendar year will be 14/47. If Corporation A, a public utility which 
files its income tax return on the calendar year basis, pays $100,000 
dividends on its preferred stock in the calendar year 1954 and if its 
taxable income for such year is greater than $100,000 the deduction 
allowable to Corporation A under section 247 for 1954 is $100,000 times 
14/52, or $26,923.08. If in 1954 Corporation A's taxable income, 
computed without regard to the deduction provided in section 247, had 
been $90,000 (that is, less than the amount of the dividends which it 
paid on its preferred stock in that year), the deduction allowable under 
section 247 for 1954 would have been $90,000 times 14/52, or $24,230.77.
    (2) For the purpose of determining the amount of the deduction 
provided in section 247(a) and in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, 
the amount of dividends paid in a given taxable year shall not include 
any amount distributed in such year with respect to dividends unpaid and 
accumulated in any taxable year ending before October 1, 1942. If any 
distribution is made in the

[[Page 375]]

current taxable year with respect to dividends unpaid and accumulated 
for a prior taxable year, such distribution will be deemed to have been 
made with respect to the earliest year or years for which there are 
dividends unpaid and accumulated. Thus, if a public utility makes a 
distribution with respect to a prior taxable year, it shall be 
considered that such distribution was made with respect to the earliest 
year or years for which there are dividends unpaid and accumulated, 
whether or not the public utility states that the distribution was made 
with respect to such year or years and even though the public utility 
stated that the distribution was made with respect to a later year. Even 
though it has dividends unpaid and accumulated with respect to a taxable 
year ending before October 1, 1942, a public utility may, however, 
include the dividends paid with respect to the current taxable year in 
computing the deduction under section 247. If there are no dividends 
unpaid and accumulated with respect to a taxable year ending before 
October 1, 1942, a public utility may include the dividends paid with 
respect to a prior taxable year which ended after October 1, 1942, in 
computing the deduction under section 247; such public utility in 
addition may include the dividends paid with respect to the current 
taxable year in computing the deduction under section 247. However, if 
local law or its own charter requires a public utility to pay all unpaid 
and accumulated dividends before any dividends can be paid with respect 
to the current taxable year, such public utility may not include any 
distribution in the current year in computing the deduction under 
section 247 to the extent that there are dividends unpaid and 
accumulated with respect to taxable years ending before October 1, 1942.
    (3) If a corporation which is engaged in one or more of the four 
types of business activities (called utility activities in this section) 
enumerated in section 247(b)(1) (the furnishing of telephone service or 
the sale of electrical energy, gas, or water) is also engaged in some 
other business that does not fall within any of the enumerated 
categories, the deduction under section 247 is allowable only for such 
portion of the amount computed under section 247(a) as is allocable to 
the income from utility activities. For this purpose, the allocation may 
be made on the basis of the ratio which the total income from the 
utility activities bears to total income from all sources (total income 
being considered either gross income or gross receipts, whichever method 
results in the higher deduction). However, if such an allocation reaches 
an inequitable result and the books of the corporation are so kept that 
the taxable income attributable to the utility activities can be readily 
determined, particularly where the books of the corporation are required 
by governmental bodies to be so kept for rate making or other purposes, 
the allocation may be made upon the basis of taxable income. No such 
apportionment will be required if the income from sources other than 
utility activities is less than 20 percent of the total income of the 
corporation, irrespective of the method used in determining such total 
income.
    (b) Public utility. As used in section 247 and this section, public 
utility means a corporation engaged in the furnishing of telephone 
service, or in the sale of electric energy, gas, or water if the rates 
charged by such corporation for such furnishing or sale, as the case may 
be, have been established or approved by a State or political 
subdivision thereof or by an agency or instrumentality of the United 
States or by a public utility or public service commission or other 
similar body of the District of Columbia or of any State or political 
subdivision thereof. If a schedule of rates has been filed with any of 
the above bodies having the power to disapprove such rates, then such 
rates shall be considered as established or approved rates even though 
such body has taken no action on the filed schedule. Rates fixed by 
contract between the corporation and the purchaser, except where the 
purchaser is the United States, a State, the District of Columbia, or an 
agency or political subdivision of the United States, a State, or the 
District of Columbia, shall not be considered as established or approved 
rates in those cases where they are not subject to direct control, or 
where no maximum

[[Page 376]]

rate for such contract rates has been established by the United States, 
a State, the District of Columbia, or by an agency or political 
subdivision thereof. The deduction provided in section 247 will not be 
denied solely because part of the gross income of the corporation 
consists of revenue derived from such furnishing or sale at rates which 
are not so regulated, provided the corporation establishes to the 
satisfaction of the Commissioner (1) that the revenue from regulated 
rates and the revenue from unregulated rates are derived from the 
operation of a single interconnected and coordinated system within a 
single area or region in one or more States, or from the operation of 
more than one such system and (2) that the regulation to which it is 
subject in part of its operating territory in one such system is 
effective to control rates within the unregulated territory of the same 
system so that the rates within the unregulated territory have been and 
are substantially as favorable to users and consumers as are the rates 
within the regulated territory.
    (c) Preferred stock. (1) For the purposes of section 247 and this 
section, preferred stock means stock (i) which was issued before October 
1, 1942, (ii) the dividends in respect of which (during the whole of the 
taxable year, or the part of the taxable year after the actual date of 
the issue of such stock) were cumulative, nonparticipating as to current 
distributions, and payable in preference to the payment of dividends on 
other stock, and (iii) the rate of return on which is fixed and cannot 
be changed by a vote of the board of directors or by some similar 
method. However, if there are several classes of preferred stock, all of 
which meet the above requirements, the deduction provided in section 247 
shall not be denied in the case of a given class of preferred stock 
merely because there is another class of preferred stock whose dividends 
are to be paid before those of the given class of stock. Likewise, it is 
immaterial for the purposes of section 247 and this section whether the 
stock be voting or nonvoting stock.
    (2) Preferred stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, under 
certain circumstances will be considered as having been issued before 
October 1, 1942, for purposes of the deduction provided in section 247. 
If the new stock is issued on or after October 1, 1942, to refund or 
replace bonds or debentures which were issued before October 1, 1942, or 
to refund or replace other stock which was preferred stock within the 
meaning of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding provision of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1939), such new stock shall be considered as 
having been issued before October 1, 1942. If preferred stock is issued 
to refund or replace stock which was preferred stock within the meaning 
of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding provision of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1939), it shall be immaterial whether the preferred 
stock so refunded or replaced was issued before, on, or after October 1, 
1942. If stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, to refund or replace 
stock which was issued before October 1, 1942, and which was preferred 
stock within the meaning of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding 
provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), is not itself preferred 
stock within the meaning of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding 
provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), no stock issued to 
refund or replace such stock can be considered preferred stock for 
purposes of the deduction provided in section 247.
    (3) In the case of any preferred stock issued on or after October 1, 
1942, to refund or replace bonds or debentures issued before October 1, 
1942, or to refund or replace other stock which was preferred stock 
within the meaning of section 247(b)(2) (or the corresponding provision 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), only that portion of the stock 
issued on or after October 1, 1942, will be considered as having been 
issued before October 1, 1942, the par or stated value of which does not 
exceed the par, stated, or face value of such bonds, debentures, or 
other preferred stock which the new stock was issued to refund or 
replace. In such case no shares of the new stock issued on or after 
October 1, 1942, shall be earmarked in determining the deduction 
allowable under section 247, but the appropriate allocable portion of 
the total amount of dividends paid on such stock will be considered as 
having been paid on stock which was issued before October 1, 1942.

[[Page 377]]

    (4) The provisions of section 247(b)(2) may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. A public utility has outstanding 1,000 bonds which were 
issued before October 1, 1942, and each of which has a face value of 
$100. On or after October 1, 1942, each of such bonds is retired in 
exchange for 1 1/10 shares of preferred stock issued on or after October 
1, 1942, and having a par value of $100 per share. Only 10/11 of the 
dividends paid on the preferred stock thus issued in exchange for the 
bonds will be considered as having been paid on stock which was issued 
before October 1, 1942. Likewise, if preferred stock which is issued on 
or after October 1, 1942, has no par value but a stated value of $50 per 
share and such stock is issued in a ratio of three shares to one share 
to refund or replace preferred stock having a par value of $100 per 
share, only two-thirds of the dividends paid on the new shares of stock 
will be considered as having been paid on stock which was issued before 
October 1, 1942.

    (5) Whether or not preferred stock issued on or after October 1, 
1942, was issued to refund or replace bonds or debentures issued before 
October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace other preferred stock, is in 
each case a question of fact. Among the factors to be considered is 
whether such stock is new in an economic sense to the corporation or 
whether it was issued merely to take the place, directly or indirectly, 
of bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock of such corporation. It 
is not necessary that the new preferred stock be issued in exchange for 
such bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock. The mere fact that the 
bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock remain in existence for a 
short period of time after the issuance of the new stock (or were 
retired before the issuance of the new stock) does not necessarily mean 
that such new stock was not issued to refund or replace such bonds, 
debentures, or other preferred stock. It is necessary to consider the 
entire transaction, including the issuance of the new preferred stock, 
the date of such issuance, the retirement of the old bonds, debentures, 
or preferred stock, and the date of such retirement, in order to 
determine whether such new stock really was issued to take the place of 
bonds, debentures, or other preferred stock of the corporation or 
whether it represents something essentially new in an economic sense in 
the corporation's financial structure. If, for example, a public 
utility, which has outstanding bonds issued before October 1, 1942, 
issues new preferred stock on October 1, 1954, in order to secure funds 
with which to retire such bonds and with the money paid in for such 
stock retires the bonds on November 1, 1954, such stock may be 
considered as having been issued to refund or replace bonds issued 
before October 1, 1942. Whether the money used to retire the bonds can 
be traced back and identified as the money paid in for the stock will 
have evidentiary value, but will not be conclusive, in determining 
whether the stock was issued to refund or replace the bonds. Similarly, 
whether the amount of money used to retire the bonds was smaller than, 
equal to, or greater than that paid in for the stock, or whether the 
entire issue of bonds is retired, will be important, but not decisive, 
in making such determination.
    (6) Preferred stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, by a 
corporation to refund or replace bonds or debentures of a second 
corporation which were issued before October 1, 1942, or to refund or 
replace other preferred stock of such second corporation, may be 
considered as having been issued before October 1, 1942, if such new 
stock was issued (i) in a transaction which is a reorganization within 
the meaning of section 368(a) or the corresponding provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1939; or (ii) in a transaction to which section 
371 (relating to insolvency reorganizations), or the corresponding 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, is applicable; or (iii) 
in a transaction which is subject to the provisions of Part VI, 
Subchapter O, Chapter 1 of the Code (relating to exchanges and 
distributions in obedience to orders of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission) or to the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1939. Whether the stock actually was issued to refund or replace 
bonds or debentures of the second corporation issued before October 1, 
1942, or to refund or replace preferred stock of such second 
corporation, shall be determined under the same principles as if only 
one corporation were involved. A corporation may issue stock to refund 
or replace its own bonds, debentures, or other preferred

[[Page 378]]

stock in a transaction which is a reorganization within the meaning of 
section 368(a) or the corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1939, in a transaction to which section 371 or the corresponding 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is applicable, or in a 
transaction which is subject to the provisions of Part VI, Subchapter O, 
Chapter 1 of the Code, or to the corresponding provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1939. The provisions of this paragraph, in 
addition, are applicable in case a corporation issues stock on or after 
October 1, 1942, to refund or replace its own bonds, debentures, or 
other preferred stock even though the issuance of such stock may not 
fall within one of the categories enumerated above.
    (7) Even though stock issued on or after October 1, 1942, is 
considered as having been issued before October 1, 1942, by reason of 
having been issued to refund or replace bonds or debentures issued 
before October 1, 1942, or to refund or replace other preferred stock, 
such stock will not be deemed to be preferred stock within the meaning 
of section 247(b)(2), and no deduction will be allowable in respect of 
dividends paid on such stock, unless the stock fulfills all the other 
requirements of a preferred stock set forth in section 247(b)(2) and in 
this paragraph.

Sec. 1.248-1   Election to amortize organizational expenditures.

    (a) In general. (1) Section 248(a) provides that a corporation may 
elect for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, to treat 
its organizational expenditures, as defined in subsection (b) of section 
248 and in paragraph (b) of this section, as deferred expenses. A 
corporation which exercises such election must, at the time it makes the 
election, select a period of not less than 60 months, beginning with the 
month in which it began business, over which it will amortize its 
organizational expenditures. The period selected by the corporation may 
be equal to or greater, but not less, than 60 months, but in any event 
it must begin with the month in which the corporation began business. 
The organizational expenditures of the corporation which are treated as 
deferred expenses under the provisions of section 248 and this section 
shall then be allowed as a deduction in computing taxable income ratably 
over the period selected by the taxpayer. The period selected by the 
taxpayer in making its election may not be subsequently changed but 
shall be adhered to in computing taxable income for the taxable year for 
which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years.
    (2) If a corporation exercises the election provided in section 
248(a), such election shall apply to all of its expenditures which are 
organizational expenditures within the meaning of subsection (b) of 
section 248 and paragraph (b) of this section. The election shall apply, 
however, only with respect to expenditures incurred before the end of 
the taxable year in which the corporation begins business (without 
regard to whether the corporation files its returns on the accrual or 
cash method of accounting or whether the expenditures are paid in the 
taxable year in which they are incurred), if such expenditures are paid 
or incurred on or after August 16, 1954 (the date of enactment of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954).
    (3) The deduction allowed under section 248 must be spread over a 
period beginning with the month in which the corporation begins 
business. The determination of the date the corporation begins business 
presents a question of fact which must be determined in each case in 
light of all the circumstances of the particular case. The words begins 
business, however, do not have the same meaning as ``in existence.'' 
Ordinarily, a corporation begins business when it starts the business 
operations for which it was organized; a corporation comes into 
existence on the date of its incorporation. Mere organizational 
activities, such as the obtaining of the corporate charter, are not 
alone sufficient to show the beginning of business. If the activities of 
the corporation have advanced to the extent necessary to establish the 
nature of its business operations, however, it will be deemed to have 
begun business. For example, the acquisition of operating assets which 
are necessary to the type of business contemplated may constitute the 
beginning of business.

[[Page 379]]

    (b) Organizational expenditures defined. (1) Section 248(b) defines 
the term organizational expenditures. Such expenditures, for purposes of 
section 248 and this section, are those expenditures which are directly 
incident to the creation of the corporation. An expenditure, in order to 
qualify as an organizational expenditure, must be (i) incident to the 
creation of the corporation, (ii) chargeable to the capital account of 
the corporation, and (iii) of a character which, if expended incident to 
the creation of a corporation having a limited life, would be 
amortizable over such life. An expenditure which fails to meet each of 
these three tests may not be considered an organizational expenditure 
for purposes of section 248 and this section.
    (2) The following are examples of organizational expenditures within 
the meaning of section 248 and this section: legal services incident to 
the organization of the corporation, such as drafting the corporate 
charter, by-laws, minutes of organizational meetings, terms of original 
stock certificates, and the like; necessary accounting services; 
expenses of temporary directors and of organizational meetings of 
directors or stockholders; and fees paid to the State of incorporation.
    (3) The following expenditures are not organizational expenditures 
within the meaning of section 248 and this section:
    (i) Expenditures connected with issuing or selling shares of stock 
or other securities, such as commissions, professional fees, and 
printing costs. This is so even where the particular issue of stock to 
which the expenditures relate is for a fixed term of years;
    (ii) Expenditures connected with the transfer of assets to a 
corporation.
    (4) Expenditures connected with the reorganization of a corporation, 
unless directly incident to the creation of a corporation, are not 
organizational expenditures within the meaning of section 248 and this 
section.
    (c) Time and manner of making election. The election provided by 
section 248(a) and paragraph (a) of this section shall be made in a 
statement attached to the taxpayer's return for the taxable year in 
which it begins business. Such taxable year must be one which begins 
after December 31, 1953. The return and statement must be filed not 
later than the date prescribed by law for filing the return (including 
any extensions of time) for the taxable year in which the taxpayer 
begins business. The statement shall set forth the description and 
amount of the expenditures involved, the date such expenditures were 
incurred, the month in which the corporation began business, and the 
number of months (not less than 60 and beginning with the month in which 
the taxpayer began business) over which such expenditures are to be 
deducted ratably.


<R05>
Sec. 1.249-1   Limitation on deduction of bond premium on repurchase.

    (a) Limitation--(1) General rule. No deduction is allowed to the 
issuing corporation for any ``repurchase premium'' paid or incurred to 
repurchase a convertible obligation to the extent the repurchase premium 
exceeds a ``normal call premium.''
    (2) Exception. Under paragraph (e) of this section, the preceding 
sentence shall not apply to the extent the corporation demonstrates that 
such excess is attributable to the cost of borrowing and not to the 
conversion feature.
    (b) Obligations--(1) Definition. For purposes of this section, the 
term obligation means any bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other 
evidence of indebtedness.
    (2) Convertible obligation. Section 249 applies to an obligation 
which is convertible into the stock of the issuing corporation or a 
corporation which, at the time the obligation is issued or repurchased, 
is in control of or controlled by the issuing corporation. For purposes 
of this subparagraph, the term control has the meaning assigned to such 
term by section 368(c).
    (3) Comparable nonconvertible obligation. A nonconvertible 
obligation is comparable to a convertible obligation if both obligations 
are of the same grade and classification, with the same issue and 
maturity dates, and bearing the same rate of interest. The term 
comparable nonconvertible obligation does not include any obligation 
which is convertible into property.
    (c) Repurchase premium. For purposes of this section:

[[Page 380]]

    (1) The term repurchase premium means the excess of the repurchase 
price paid or incurred to repurchase the obligation over its ``adjusted 
issue price.''
    (2) The term adjusted issue price means the issue price (as defined 
in section 1232(b) and the regulations thereunder) increased by any 
amount of discount deducted before repurchase, or, in the case of 
convertible obligations issued after February 28, 1913, decreased by any 
amount of premium included in gross income before repurchase. For rules 
applicable to deduction of discount, see Secs. 1.163-3 and 1.163-4. For 
rules applicable to amortization of bond premium see Sec. 1.61-12.
    (d) Normal call premium--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, for purposes of this section, a 
normal call premium on a convertible obligation is an amount equal to a 
normal call premium on a nonconvertible obligation which is comparable 
to the convertible obligation. A normal call premium on a comparable 
nonconvertible obligation is a call premium specified in dollars under 
the terms of such obligation. Thus, if such a specified call premium is 
constant over the entire term of the obligation, the normal call premium 
is the amount specified. If, however, the specified call premium varies 
during the period the comparable nonconvertible obligation is callable 
or if such obligation is not callable over its entire term, the normal 
call premium is the amount specified for the period during the term of 
such comparable nonconvertible obligation which corresponds to the 
period during which the convertible obligation was repurchased.
    (2) One-year's interest rule. Under this subparagraph, a call 
premium specified in dollars under the terms of a convertible obligation 
shall be considered to be a normal call premium on a nonconvertible 
obligation if the call premium on the convertible obligation so 
specified which is applicable at the time it is repurchased does not 
exceed an amount equal to 1 year's interest payable on such obligation 
increased by the amount of discount on the obligation deductible under 
Sec. 1.163-3 or Sec. 1.163-4 (as the case may be) for the corporation's 
taxable year during which the repurchase occurred or reduced by the 
amount of issue premium includible in income under Sec. 1.61-12(c) for 
such taxable year (computed as if the obligation were not repurchased). 
The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply if the amount of 
interest payable for the corporation's taxable year is subject under the 
terms of the obligation to any contingency other than repurchase prior 
to the close of such taxable year.
    (e) Exception--(1) In general. If a repurchase premium exceeds a 
normal call premium, the general rule of paragraph (a) (1) of this 
section does not apply to the extent that the corporation demonstrates 
to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or his delegate that such 
repurchase premium is attributable to the cost of borrowing and is not 
attributable to the conversion feature. For purposes of this paragraph, 
if a normal call premium cannot be established under paragraph (d) of 
this section, the amount thereof shall be considered to be zero.
    (2) Determination of the portion of a repurchase premium 
attributable to the cost of borrowing and not attributable to the 
conversion feature. (i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this 
paragraph, the portion of a repurchase premium which is attributable to 
the cost of borrowing and which is not attributable to the conversion 
feature is the amount by which the selling price of the convertible 
obligation increased between the dates it was issued and repurchased by 
reason of a decline in yields on comparable nonconvertible obligations 
traded on an established securities market or, if such comparable traded 
obligations do not exist, by reason of a decline in yields generally on 
nonconvertible obligations which are as nearly comparable as possible.
    (ii) In determining the amount under subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph, appropriate consideration shall be given to all factors 
affecting the selling price or yields of comparable nonconvertible 
obligations. Such factors include general changes in prevailing yields 
of comparable obligations between the dates the convertible obligation 
was issued and repurchased and the amount (if any) by which the selling 
price of

[[Page 381]]

the nonconvertible obligation was affected by reason of any change in 
the issuing corporation's credit rating or the credit rating of the 
obligation during such period (determined on the basis of widely 
published ratings of recognized credit rating services or on the basis 
of other relevant facts and circumstances which reflect the relative 
credit ratings of the corporation or the comparable obligation).
    (iii) The relationship between selling price and yields in 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall ordinarily be determined by 
means of standard bond tables.
    (f) Effective date--(1) In general. Under section 414(c) of the Tax 
Reform Act of 1969, the provisions of section 249 and this section shall 
apply to any repurchase of a convertible obligation occurring after 
April 22, 1969, other than a convertible obligation repurchased pursuant 
to a binding obligation incurred on or before April 22, 1969, to 
repurchase such convertible obligation at a specified call premium. A 
binding obligation on or before such date may arise if, for example, the 
issuer irrevocably obligates itself, on or before such date, to 
repurchase the convertible obligation at a specified price after such 
date, or if, for example, the issuer, without regard to the terms of the 
convertible obligation, negotiates a contract which, on or before such 
date, irrevocably obligates the issuer to repurchase the convertible 
obligation at a specified price after such date. A binding obligation on 
or before such date does not include a privilege in the convertible 
obligation permitting the issuer to call such convertible obligation 
after such date, which privilege was not exercised on or before such 
date.
    (2) Effect on transactions not subject to this section. No 
inferences shall be drawn from the provisions of section 249 and this 
section as to the proper treatment of transactions not subject to such 
provisions because of the effective date limitations thereof. For 
provisions relating to repurchases of convertible bonds or other 
evidences of indebtedness to which section 249 and this section do not 
apply, see Secs. 1.163-3(c) and 1.163-4(c).
    (g) Example. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following example:

    Example. On May 15, 1968, corporation A issues a callable 20-year 
convertible bond at face for $1,000 bearing interest at 10 percent per 
annum. The bond is convertible at any time into 2 shares of the common 
stock of corporation A. Under the terms of the bond, the applicable call 
price prior to May 15, 1975, is $1,100. On June 1, 1974, corporation A 
calls the bond for $1,100. Since the repurchase premium, $100 (i.e., 
$1,100 minus $1,000), was specified in dollars in the obligation and 
does not exceed 1 year's interest at the rate fixed in the obligation, 
the $100 is considered under paragraph (d) (2) of this section to be a 
normal call premium on a comparable nonconvertible obligation. 
Accordingly, A may deduct the $100 under Sec. 1.163-3(c).

                          Items Not Deductible


<R05>
Sec. 1.261-1   General rule for disallowance of deductions.

    In computing taxable income, no deduction shall be allowed, except 
as otherwise expressly provided in Chapter 1 of the Code, in respect of 
any of the items specified in Part IX (section 262 and following), 
Subchapter B, Chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 1.262-1   Personal, living, and family expenses.

    (a) In general. In computing taxable income, no deduction shall be 
allowed, except as otherwise expressly provided in chapter 1 of the 
Code, for personal, living, and family expenses.
    (b) Examples of personal, living, and family expenses. Personal, 
living, and family expenses are illustrated in the following examples:
    (1) Premiums paid for life insurance by the insured are not 
deductible. See also section 264 and the regulations thereunder.
    (2) The cost of insuring a dwelling owned and occupied by the 
taxpayer as a personal residence is not deductible.
    (3) Expenses of maintaining a household, including amounts paid for 
rent, water, utilities, domestic service, and the like, are not 
deductible. A taxpayer who rents a property for residential purposes, 
but incidentally conducts business there (his place of business being 
elsewhere) shall not deduct any

[[Page 382]]

part of the rent. If, however, he uses part of the house as his place of 
business, such portion of the rent and other similar expenses as is 
properly attributable to such place of business is deductible as a 
business expense.
    (4) Losses sustained by the taxpayer upon the sale or other 
disposition of property held for personal, living, and family purposes 
are not deductible. But see section 165 and the regulations thereunder 
for deduction of losses sustained to such property by reason of 
casualty, etc.
    (5) Expenses incurred in traveling away from home (which include 
transportation expenses, meals, and lodging) and any other 
transportation expenses are not deductible unless they qualify as 
expenses deductible under section 162, Sec. 1.162-2, and paragraph (d) 
of Sec. 1.162-5 (relating to trade or business expenses), section 170 
and paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.170-2 or paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.170A-1 
(relating to charitable contributions), section 212 and Sec. 1.212-1 
(relating to expenses for production of income), section 213(e) and 
paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.213-1 (relating to medical expenses) or section 
217(a) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.217-1 (relating to moving expenses). 
The taxpayer's costs of commuting to his place of business or employment 
are personal expenses and do not qualify as deductible expenses. The 
costs of the taxpayer's lodging not incurred in traveling away from home 
are personal expenses and are not deductible unless they qualify as 
deductible expenses under section 217. Except as permitted under section 
162, 212, or 217, the costs of the taxpayer's meals not incurred in 
traveling away from home are personal expenses.
    (6) Amounts paid as damages for breach of promise to marry, and 
attorney's fees and other costs of suit to recover such damages, are not 
deductible.
    (7) Generally, attorney's fees and other costs paid in connection 
with a divorce, separation, or decree for support are not deductible by 
either the husband or the wife. However, the part of an attorney's fee 
and the part of the other costs paid in connection with a divorce, legal 
separation, written separation agreement, or a decree for support, which 
are properly attributable to the production or collection of amounts 
includible in gross income under section 71 are deductible by the wife 
under section 212.
    (8) The cost of equipment of a member of the armed services is 
deductible only to the extent that it exceeds nontaxable allowances 
received for such equipment and to the extent that such equipment is 
especially required by his profession and does not merely take the place 
of articles required in civilian life. For example, the cost of a sword 
is an allowable deduction in computing taxable income, but the cost of a 
uniform is not. However, amounts expended by a reservist for the 
purchase and maintenance of uniforms which may be worn only when on 
active duty for training for temporary periods, when attending service 
school courses, or when attending training assemblies are deductible 
except to the extent that nontaxable allowances are received for such 
amounts.
    (9) Expenditures made by a taxpayer in obtaining an education or in 
furthering his education are not deductible unless they qualify under 
section 162 and Sec. 1.162-5 (relating to trade or business expenses).
    (c) Cross references. Certain items of a personal, living, or family 
nature are deductible to the extent expressly provided under the 
following sections, and the regulations under those sections:
    (1) Section 163 (interest).
    (2) Section 164 (taxes).
    (3) Section 165 (losses).
    (4) Section 166 (bad debts).
    (5) Section 170 (charitable, etc., contributions and gifts).
    (6) Section 213 (medical, dental, etc., expenses).
    (7) Section 214 (expenses for care of certain dependents).
    (8) Section 215 (alimony, etc., payments).
    (9) Section 216 (amounts representing taxes and interest paid to 
cooperative housing corporation).
    (10) Section 217 (moving expenses).

Sec. 1.263(a)-1  Capital expenditures; In general.

    (a) Except as otherwise provided in chapter 1 of the Code, no 
deduction shall be allowed for:
    (1) Any amount paid out for new buildings or for permanent 
improvements or betterments made to increase the value of any property 
or estate, or
    (2) Any amount expended in restoring property or in making good the 
exhaustion thereof for which an allowance is or has been made in the 
form of a deduction for depreciation, amortization, or depletion.
    (b) In general, the amounts referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
section include amounts paid or incurred (1) to add to the value, or 
substantially prolong the useful life, of property owned by the 
taxpayer, such as plant or equipment, or (2) to adapt property to a new 
or different use. Amounts paid or incurred for incidental repairs and 
maintenance of property are not capital expenditures within the meaning 
of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph. See section 162 and 
Sec. 1.162-4. See section 263A and the regulations thereunder for cost 
capitalization rules which apply to amounts referred to in paragraph (a)

personal property (as defined in Sec. 1.263A-1T (a)(5)(iii)), including 
films, sound recordings, video tapes, books, or similar properties. An 
amount referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is a capital 
expenditure that is taken into account through inclusion in inventory 
costs or a charge to capital accounts or basis no earlier than the 
taxable year during which the amount is incurred within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii). See section 263A and the regulations thereunder 
for cost capitalization rules that apply to amounts referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the production of real and 
tangible personal property (as defined in Sec. 1.263A-2(a)(2)), 
including films, sound recordings, video tapes, books, or similar 
properties.
    (c) The provisions of paragraph (a) (1) of this section shall not 
apply to expenditures deductible under:
    (1) Section 616 and Secs. 1.616-1 through 1.616-3, relating to the 
development of mines or deposits,
    (2) Section 174 and Secs. 1.174-1 through 1.174-4, relating to

Sec. 1.263(a)-2   Examples of capital expenditures.

    The following paragraphs of this section include examples of capital 
expenditures:
    (a) The cost of acquisition, construction, or erection of buildings, 
machinery and equipment, furniture and fixtures, and similar property 
having a useful life substantially beyond the taxable year.
    (b) Amounts expended for securing a copyright and plates, which 
remain the property of the person making the payments. See section 263A 
and the regulations thereunder for capitalization rules which apply to 
amounts expended in securing and producing a copyright and plates in 
connection with the production of property, including films, sound 
recordings, video tapes, books, or similar properties.
    (c) The cost of defending or perfecting title to property.
    (d) The amount expended for architect's services.
    (e) Commissions paid in purchasing securities. Commissions paid in 
selling securities are an offset against the selling price, except that 
in the case of dealers in securities such commissions may be treated as 
an ordinary and necessary business expense.
    (f) Amounts assessed and paid under an agreement between bondholders 
or shareholders of a corporation to be

[[Page 384]]

used in a reorganization of the corporation or voluntary contributions 
by shareholders to the capital of the corporation for any corporate 
purpose. Such amounts are capital investments and are not deductible. 
See section 118 and Sec. 1.118-1.
    (g) A holding company which guarantees dividends at a specified rate 
on the stock of a subsidiary corporation for the purpose of securing new 
capital for the subsidiary and increasing the value of its stockholdings 
in the subsidiary shall not deduct amounts paid in carrying out this 
guaranty in computing its taxable income, but such payments are capital 
expenditures to be added to the cost of its stock in the subsidiary.
    (h) The cost of good will in connection with the acquisition of the 
assets of a going concern is a capital expenditure.

<R05>
Sec. 1.263(e)-1   Expenditures in connection with certain railroad rolling stock.

    (a) Allowance of deduction--(1) Election. Under section 263(e), for 
any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1969, a taxpayer may elect 
to treat certain expenditures paid or incurred during such taxable year 
as deductible repairs under section 162 or 212. This election applies 
only to expenditures described in paragraph (c) of this section in 
connection with the rehabilitation of a unit of railroad rolling stock 
(as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) used by a domestic 
common carrier by railroad (as defined in paragraph (b) (3) and (4) of 
this section). However, an election under section 263(e) may not be made 
with respect to expenditures in connection with any unit of railroad 
rolling stock for which an election under section 263(f) and the 
regulations thereunder is in effect. An election made under section 
263(e) is an annual election which may be made with respect to one or 
more of the units of railroad rolling stock owned by the taxpayer.
    (2) Special 20 percent rule. Section 263(e) shall not apply if, 
under paragraph (d) of this section, expenditures

[[Page 385]]

paid or incurred during any period of 12 calendar months in connection 
with the rehabilitation of a unit exceed 20 percent of the basis (as 
defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) of such unit in the hands 
of the taxpayer. However, section 263(e) does not constitute a limit on 
the deduction of expenditures for repairs which are deductible without 
regard to such section. Accordingly, amounts otherwise deductible as 
repairs will continue to be deductible even though such amounts exceed 
20 percent of the basis of the unit of railroad rolling stock in the 
hands of the taxpayer.
    (3) Time and manner of making election. (i) An election by a 
taxpayer under section 263(e) shall be made by a statement to that 
effect attached to its income tax return or amended income tax return 
for the taxable year for which the election is made if such return or 
amended return is filed no later than the time prescribed by law 
(including extensions thereof) for filing the return for the taxable 
year of election. An election under section 263(e) may be made with 
respect to one or more of the units of railroad rolling stock owned by 
the taxpayer. If an election is not made within the time and in the 
manner prescribed in this subparagraph, no election may be made (by the 
filing of an amended return or in any other manner) with respect to the 
taxable year.
    (ii) If the taxpayer has filed a return on or before March 14, 1973, 
and has claimed a deduction under section 162 or 212 by reason of 
section 263(e), and if the taxpayer does not desire to make an election 
under section 263(e) for the taxable year with respect to which such 
return was filed, the taxpayer shall file an amended return for such 
taxable year on or before May 14, 1973, and shall pay any additional tax 
due for such year. The taxpayer shall also file an amended return for 
each taxable year which is affected by the filing of an amended return 
under the preceding sentence and shall pay any additional tax due for 
such year. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as extending 
the time specified in section 6511 within which a claim for credit or 
refund may be filed.
    (iii) If an election under section 263(e) was not made at the time 
the return for a taxable year was filed, and it is subsequently 
determined that an expenditure was erroneously treated as an expenditure 
which was not in connection with rehabilitation (as determined under 
paragraph (c) of this section), an election under section 263(e) may be 
made with respect to the unit of railroad rolling stock for which such 
expenditure was made for such taxable year, notwithstanding any 
provision in this subparagraph (3) to the contrary. Nothing in this 
subdivision shall be construed as extending the time specified in 
section 6511 within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
    (iv) The statement required by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph 
shall include the following information:
    (a) The total number of units of railroad rolling stock with respect 
to which an election is being made under section 263(e).
    (b) The aggregate basis (as defined in paragraph (b) (1) of this 
section) of the units described in (a) of this subdivision (iv), and
    (c) The total deduction being claimed under section 263(e) for the 
taxable year.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Basis. (i) In general, for purposes of section 
263(e) the basis of a unit of railroad rolling stock shall be the 
adjusted basis of such unit determined without regard to the adjustments 
provided in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of section 1016(a) and section 
1017. Thus, the basis of property would generally be its cost without 
regard to adjustments to basis such as for depreciation or for capital 
improvements. If the basis of a unit in the hands of a transferee is 
determined in whole or in part by reference to its basis in the hands of 
the transferor, for example, by reason of the application of section 362 
(relating to basis to corporations), 374 (relating to gain or loss not 
recognized in certain railroad reorganizations), or 723 (relating to the 
basis of property contributed to a partnership), then the basis of such 
unit in the hands of the transferor for purposes of section 263(e) shall 
be its basis for purposes of section 263(e) in the hands of the 
transferee. Similarly, when the basis of a unit of railroad rolling 
stock

[[Page 386]]

in the hands of the taxpayer is determined in whole or in part by 
reference to the basis of another unit, for example, by reason of the 
application of the first sentence of section 1033(c) (relating to 
involuntary conversions), then the basis of the latter unit for purposes 
of section 263(e) shall be the basis for purposes of section 263(e) of 
the former unit. The question whether a capital expenditure in 
connection with a unit of railroad rolling stock results in the 
retirement of such unit and the creation of another unit of railroad 
rolling stock shall be determined without regard to rules under the 
uniform system of accounts prescribed by the Interstate Commerce 
Commission.
    (ii) For example, if a unit of railroad rolling stock has a cost to 
M of $10,000 and because of depreciation adjustments of $4,000 and 
capital expenditures of $3,000, such unit has an adjusted basis in the 
hands of M of $9,000, the basis for purposes of section 263(e) of such 
unit in the hands of M is $10,000. Further, if M transfers such unit to 
N in a transaction in which no gain or loss is recognized such as, for 
example, a transaction to which section 351(a) (relating to a transfer 
to a corporation controlled by the transferor) applies, the basis of 
such unit for purposes of section 263(e) is $10,000 in the hands of N.
    (2) Railroad rolling stock. For purposes of this section, the term 
unit or unit of railroad rolling stock means a unit of transportation 
equipment the expenditures for which are of a type chargeable (or in the 
case of property leased to a domestic common carrier by railroad, would 
be chargeable) to the equipment investment accounts in the uniform 
system of accounts for railroad companies prescribed by the Interstate 
Commerce Commission (49 CFR Part 1201), but only if (i) such unit 
exclusively moves on, moves under, or is guided by rail, and (ii) such 
unit is not a locomotive. Thus, for example, a unit of railroad rolling 
stock includes a box car, a gondola car, a passenger car, a car designed 
to carry truck trailers and containerized freight, a wreck crane, and a 
bunk car. However, such term does not include equipment which does not 
exclusively move on, move under, or is not exclusively guided by rail 
such as, for example, a barge, a tugboat, a container which is used on 
cars designed to carry containerized freight, a truck trailer, or an 
automobile. A locomotive is self-propelled equipment, the sole function 
of which is to push or pull railroad rolling stock. Thus, a self-
propelled passenger or freight car is not a locomotive.
    (3) Domestic common carrier by railroad. The term domestic common 
carrier by railroad means a railroad subject to regulation under Part I 
of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) or a railroad which 
would be subject to regulation under Part I of the Interstate Commerce 
Act if it were engaged in interstate commerce.
    (4) Use. For purposes of this section, a unit of railroad rolling 
stock is not used by a domestic common carrier by railroad if it is 
owned by a person other than a domestic common carrier by railroad and 
(i) is exclusively used for transportation by the owner or (ii) is 
exclusively used for transportation by another person which is not a 
domestic common carrier by railroad. Thus, for example, a unit of 
railroad rolling stock which is owned by a person which is not a 
domestic common carrier by railroad and is leased to a manufacturing 
company by the owner is not a unit of railroad rolling stock used by a 
domestic common carrier by railroad.
    (c) Expenditures considered in connection with rehabilitation. For 
purposes of section 263(e) and this section all expenditures which would 
be properly chargeable to capital account but for the application of 
section 263 (e) or (f) shall be considered to be expenditures in 
connection with the rehabilitation of a unit of railroad rolling stock. 
Expenditures which are paid or incurred in connection with incidental 
repairs or maintenance of a unit of railroad rolling stock and which are 
deductible without regard to section 263 (e) or (f) shall not be 
included in any determination or computation under section 263(e) and 
shall not be treated as paid or incurred in connection with the 
rehabilitation of a unit of railroad rolling stock for purposes of 
section 263(e). The determination of whether an item would be, but for 
section 263 (e) or (f), properly chargeable to capital account

[[Page 387]]

shall be made in a manner consistent with the principles for 
classification of expenditures as between capital and expenses under the 
Internal Revenue Code. See, for example, Secs. 1.162-4, 1.263(a)-1, 
1.263(a)-2, and paragraph (a)(4) (ii) and (iii) of Sec. 1.446-1. An 
expenditure shall be classified as capital or as expense without regard 
to its classification under the uniform system of accounts prescribed by 
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
    (d) 20-percent limitation--(1) In general. No expenditures in 
connection with the rehabilitation of a unit of railroad rolling stock 
shall be treated as a deductible repair by reason of an election under 
section 263(e) if, during any period of 12 calendar months in which the 
month the expenditure is included falls, all such expenditures exceed an 
amount equal to 20 percent of the basis (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) 
of this section) of such unit in the hands of the taxpayer. All such 
expenditures shall be included in the computation of the 20-percent 
limitation even if such expenditures were deducted under section 263(f) 
in either the preceding or succeeding taxable year. Solely for purposes 
of the 20-percent limitation in this paragraph, such expenditures shall 
be deemed to be included in the month in which a rehabilitation of the 
unit of railroad rolling stock is completed. For the requirement that 
expenditures treated as repairs solely by reason of an election under 
section 263(e) be deducted in the taxable year paid or incurred, see 
paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) 12-month period. For purposes of this section, any period of 12 
calendar months shall consist of any 12 consecutive calendar months 
except that calendar months prior to the calendar month of January 1970 
shall not be included in determining such period.
    (3) Period for certain corporate acquisitions. If a unit of railroad 
rolling stock to which section 263(e) applies is sold, exchanged, or 
otherwise disposed of in a transaction in which its basis in the hands 
of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to its 
basis in the hands of the transferor (see paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section), calendar months during which such unit is in the hands of the 
transferor and in the hands of such transferee shall both be included in 
the calendar months used by the transferor and the transferee to 
determine any period of 12 calendar months for purposes of section 
263(e).
    (4) Deduction allowed in year paid or incurred. If, based on the 
information available when the income tax return for a taxable year is 
filed, an expenditure paid or incurred in such taxable year would be 
deductible by reason of the application of section 263(e) but for the 
fact that it cannot be established whether the 20-percent limitation in 
subparagraph (1) of this paragraph will be exceeded, the expenditure 
shall be deducted for such taxable year. If by reason of the application 
of such 20-percent limitation it is subsequently determined that such 
expenditure is not deductible as a repair, an amended return shall be 
filed for the year in which such deduction was treated as a deductible 
repair and additional tax, if any, for such year shall be paid. 
Appropriate adjustment with respect to the taxpayer's tax liability for 
any other affected year shall be made. Nothing in this subparagraph 
shall be construed as extending the time specified in section 6511 
within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed.
    (e) Recordkeeping requirements--(1) In general. Such records as will 
enable the accurate determination of the expenditures which may be 
subject to the treatment provided in section 263(e) shall be maintained. 
No deduction shall be allowed under section 162 or 212 by reason of 
section 263(e) with respect to a unit unless the taxpayer substantiates 
by adequate records that expenditures in connection with such unit of 
railroad rolling stock meet the requirements and limitations of this 
section.
    (2) Separate records. A separate section 263(e) record shall be 
maintained for each unit with respect to which an election under section 
263(e) is made. Such record shall:
    (i) Identify the unit,
    (ii) State the basis (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section) and the date of acquisition of the unit,
    (iii) Enumerate for each unit the amount of all expenditures 
incurred in connection with rehabilitation of such unit which would, but 
for section 263

[[Page 388]]

(e) or (f), be properly chargeable to capital account (including 
expenditures incurred by the taxpayer in connection with rehabilitation 
of such unit undertaken by a person other than the taxpayer) regardless 
of whether such expenditures during any 12-month period exceed 20 
percent of the basis of such unit,
    (iv) Describe the nature of the work in connection with each 
expenditure, and
    (v) Specify the calendar month in which the rehabilitation is 
completed and the taxable year in which each expenditure is paid or 
incurred.

A section 263(e) record need only be prepared for a unit of railroad 
rolling stock for the period beginning on the first day of the eleventh 
calendar month immediately preceding the month in which the 
rehabilitation of such unit is completed and ending on the last day of 
the eleventh calendar month immediately succeeding such month. No 
section 263(e) record need be prepared for calendar months before 
January 1970.
    (3) Records for certain expenditures: Expenditures determined to be 
incidental repairs and maintenance (referred to in paragraph (c) of this 
section) shall not be entered in the section 263(e) record. However, 
each taxpayer shall maintain records to reflect that such expenditures 
are properly deductible.
    (4) Convenience rule. In general, expenditures and information 
maintained in compliance with subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this 
paragraph shall be recorded in the section 263(e) record of the specific 
unit with respect to which such expenditures are incurred. However, when 
a group of units of the same type are rehabilitated in a single project 
and the expenditure for each unit in the project will approximate 
the average expenditure per unit for the project, expenditures for the 
project may be aggregated without regard to the unit in the project with 
respect to which each expenditure is connected, and an amount equal to 
the aggregate expenditures for the project divided by the number of 
units in the project may be entered in the section 263(e) account of 
each unit in the project.
    (f) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. M Corporation, a domestic common carrier by railroad, 
uses the calendar year as its taxable year. M owns and uses several 
gondola cars to which an election under section 263(e) applies for its 
taxable years 1970-1972. Gondola car No.1 has a basis (defined in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section) of $10,000. No expenditures properly 
chargeable to the section 263(e) record are made on gondola car No. 1 in 
1970 and 1971, except in January 1971. In January 1971, M at a cost of 
$1,500 performed rehabilitation work on gondola car No. 1. Such amount 
was properly entered in the section 263(e) record for gondola car No.1. 
Since the expenditures in such record do not exceed an amount equal to 
20 percent of the basis of gondola car No. 1 ($2,000) during any period 
of 12 calendar months in which January 1971 falls, the expenditures 
during January 1971 shall be treated as a deductible expense regardless 
of what the treatment would have been if section 263(e) had not been 
enacted.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1). Assume further 
that for 1970, 1971, and 1972, only the following expenditures in 
connection with rehabilitation which would, but for section 263(e), be 
properly chargeable to capital account were deemed included for gondola 
car No. 2:

(a) December 1970..............................................   $1,500
(b) November 1971..............................................      600
(c) December 1971..............................................      400
(d) January 1972...............................................    1,050
                                                                        


[[Page 389]]

Assume further that gondola car No. 2 has a basis (as defined in 
paragraph (b) (1) of this section) equal to $10,000, that M files its 
tax return by September 15 following each taxable year, and that each 
rehabilitation was completed in the month in which expenditures in 
connection with it were incurred. Any expenditures in connection with 
each gondola car (No. 1 or No. 2) have no effect on the treatment of 
expenditures in connection with the other gondola car. With respect to 
gondola car No. 2, the expenditures of December 1970 are treated as 
deductible repairs at the time M's income tax return for 1970 is filed 
because, based on the information available when the income tax return 
for 1970 is filed, such expenditure would be deductible by reason of 
application of section 263(e) but for the fact that it cannot be 
established whether the 20-percent limitation in paragraph (d)(1) of 
this section will be exceeded. Nevertheless, because such expenditures 
during the period of 12 calendar months including calendar months 
December 1970 and November 1971 exceed $2,000, the December 1970 
rehabilitation expenditures are not subject to the provisions of section 
263(e). Because such rehabilitation expenditures during the period of 12 
calendar months including calendar months February 1971 and January 1972 
exceed $2,000, rehabilitation expenditures in 1971 are not subject to 
the provisions of section 263(e). Similarly, the 1972 rehabilitation 
expenditures are not subject to the provisions of section 263(e).

<R05>
Sec. 1.263A-1  Uniform capitalization of costs.

    (a) Introduction--(1) In general. The regulations under 
Secs. 1.263A-1 through 1.263A-6 provide guidance to taxpayers that are 
required to capitalize certain costs under section 263A. These 
regulations generally apply to all costs required to be capitalized 
under section 263A except for interest that must be capitalized under 
section 263A(f) and the regulations thereunder. Statutory or regulatory 
exceptions may provide that section 263A does not apply to certain 
activities or costs; however, those activities or costs may nevertheless 
be subject to capitalization requirements under other provisions of the 
Internal Revenue Code and regulations.
    (2) Effective dates. (i) In general, this section and Secs. 1.263A-2 
and 1.263A-3 apply to costs incurred in taxable years beginning after 
December 31, 1993. In the case of property that is inventory in the 
hands of the taxpayer, however, these sections are effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1993. Changes in methods of 
accounting necessary as a result of the rules in this section and 
Secs. 1.263A-2 and 1.263A-3 must be made under terms and conditions 
prescribed by the Commissioner. Under these terms and conditions, the 
principles of Sec. 1.263A-7T(e) generally must be applied in revaluing 
inventory property.
    (ii) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1994, taxpayers 
must take reasonable positions on their federal income tax returns when 
applying section 263A. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2)(iii), a 
reasonable position is a position consistent with the temporary 
regulations, revenue rulings,

[[Page 395]]

revenue procedures, notices, and announcements concerning section 263A 
applicable in taxable years beginning before January 1, 1994. See 
Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.
    (3) General scope--(i) Property to which section 263A applies. 
Taxpayers subject to section 263A must capitalize all direct costs and 
certain indirect costs properly allocable to--
    (A) Real property and tangible personal property produced by the 
taxpayer; and
    (B) Real property and personal property described in section 
1221(1), which is acquired by the taxpayer for resale.
    (ii) Property produced. Taxpayers that produce real property and 
tangible personal property (producers) must capitalize all the direct 
costs of producing the property and the property's properly allocable 
share of indirect costs (described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (3) of 
this section), regardless of whether the property is sold or used in the 
taxpayer's trade or business. See Sec. 1.263A-2 for rules relating to 
producers.
    (iii) Property acquired for resale. Retailers, wholesalers, and 
other taxpayers that acquire property described in section 1221(1) for 
resale (resellers) must capitalize the direct costs of acquiring the 
property and the property's properly allocable share of indirect costs 
(described in paragraphs (e)(2)(ii) and (3) of this section). See 
Sec. 1.263A-3 for rules relating to resellers. See also section 
263A(b)(2)(B), which excepts from section 263A personal property 
acquired for resale by a small reseller.
    (iv) Inventories valued at market. Section 263A does not apply to 
inventories valued at market under either the market method or the lower 
of cost or market method if the market valuation used by the taxpayer 
generally equals the property's fair market value. For purposes of this 
paragraph (a)(3)(iv), the term fair market value means the price at 
which the taxpayer sells its inventory to its customers (e.g., as in the 
market value definition provided in Sec. 1.471-4(b)) less, if 
applicable, the direct cost of disposing of the inventory. However, 
section 263A does apply in determining the market value of any inventory 
for which market is determined with reference to replacement cost or 
reproduction cost. See Secs. 1.471-4 and 1.471-5.
    (v) Property produced in a farming business. Section 263A generally 
requires taxpayers engaged in a farming business to capitalize certain 
costs. See section 263A(d) and Sec. 1.263A-4T(c) for rules relating to 
taxpayers engaged in a farming business.
    (vi) Creative property. Section 263A generally requires taxpayers 
engaged in the production and resale of creative property to capitalize 
certain costs.
    (vii) Property produced or property acquired for resale by foreign 
persons. Section 263A generally applies to foreign persons.
    (b) Exceptions--(1) Small resellers. See section 263A(b)(2)(B) for 
the $10,000,000 gross receipts exception for small resellers of personal 
property. See Sec. 1.263A-3(b) for rules relating to this exception. See 
also the exception for small resellers with de minimis production 
activities in Sec. 1.263A-3(a)(2)(ii) and the exception for small 
resellers that have property produced under contract in Sec. 1.263A-
3(a)(3).
    (2) Long-term contracts. Except for certain home construction 
contracts described in section 460(e)(1), section 263A does not apply to 
any property produced by the taxpayer pursuant to a long-term contract 
as defined in section 460(f), regardless of whether the taxpayer uses an 
inventory method to account for such production.
    (3) Costs incurred in certain farming businesses. See section 
263A(d) for an exception for costs paid or incurred in certain farming 
businesses. See Sec. 1.263A-4T(c) for specific rules relating to 
taxpayers engaged in a farming business.
    (4) Costs incurred in raising, harvesting, or growing timber. See 
section 263A(c)(5) for an exception for costs paid or incurred in 
raising, harvesting, or growing timber and certain ornamental trees. See 
Sec. 1.263A-4T(c), however, for rules relating to taxpayers that produce 
certain trees to which section 263A applies.
    (5) Qualified creative expenses. See section 263A(h) for an 
exception for qualified creative expenses paid or incurred by certain 
free-lance authors, photographers, and artists.

[[Page 396]]

    (6) Certain not-for-profit activities. See section 263A(c)(1) for an 
exception for property produced by a taxpayer for use by the taxpayer 
other than in a trade or business or an activity conducted for profit. 
This exception does not apply, however, to property produced by an 
exempt organization in connection with its unrelated trade or business 
activities.
    (7) Intangible drilling and development costs. See section 
263A(c)(3) for an exception for intangible drilling and development 
costs. Additionally, section 263A does not apply to any amount allowable 
as a deduction under section 59(e) with respect to qualified 
expenditures under sections 263(c), 616(a), or 617(a).
    (8) Natural gas acquired for resale. Under this paragraph (b)(8), 
section 263A does not apply to any costs incurred by a taxpayer relating 
to natural gas acquired for resale to the extent such costs would 
otherwise be allocable to cushion gas.
    (i) Cushion gas. Cushion gas is the portion of gas stored in an 
underground storage facility or reservoir that is required to maintain 
the level of pressure necessary for operation of the facility. However, 
section 263A applies to costs incurred by a taxpayer relating to natural 
gas acquired for resale to the extent such costs are properly allocable 
to emergency gas.
    (ii) Emergency gas. Emergency gas is natural gas stored in an 
underground storage facility or reservoir for use during periods of 
unusually heavy customer demand.
    (9) Research and experimental expenditures. See section 263A(c)(2) 
for an exception for any research and experimental expenditure allowable 
as a deduction under section 174 or the regulations thereunder. 
Additionally, section 263A does not apply to any amount allowable as a 
deduction under section 59(e) with respect to qualified expenditures 
under section 174.
    (10) Certain property that is substantially constructed. Section 
263A does not apply to any property produced by a taxpayer for use in 
its trade or business if substantial construction occurred before March 
1, 1986.
    (i) For purposes of this section, substantial construction is deemed 
to have occurred if the lesser of--
    (A) 10 percent of the total estimated costs of construction; or
    (B) The greater of $10 million or 2 percent of the total estimated 
costs of construction, was incurred before March 1, 1986.
    (ii) For purposes of the provision in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this 
section, the total estimated costs of construction shall be determined 
by reference to a reasonable estimate, on or before March 1, 1986, of 
such amount. Assume, for example, that on March 1, 1986, the estimated 
costs of constructing a facility were $150 million. Assume that before 
March 1, 1986, $12 million of construction costs had been incurred. 
Based on the above facts, substantial construction would be deemed to 
have occurred before March 1, 1986, because $12 million (the costs of 
construction incurred before such date) is greater than $10 million (the 
lesser of $15 million; or the greater of $10 million or $3 million). For 
purposes of this provision, construction costs are defined as those 
costs incurred after construction has commenced at the site of the 
property being constructed (unless the property will not be located on 
land and, therefore, the initial construction of the property must begin 
at a location other than the intended site). For example, in the case of 
a building, construction commences when work begins on the building, 
such as the excavation of the site, the pouring of pads for the 
building, or the driving of foundation pilings into the ground. 
Preliminary activities such as project engineering and architectural 
design do not constitute the commencement of construction, nor are such 
costs considered construction costs, for purposes of this paragraph 
(b)(10).
    (11) Certain property provided incident to services--(i) In general. 
Under this paragraph (b)(11), section 263A does not apply to property 
that is provided to a client (or customer) incident to the provision of 
services by the taxpayer if the property provided to the client is--
    (A) De minimis in amount; and
    (B) Not inventory in the hands of the service provider.

[[Page 397]]

    (ii) Definition of services. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(11), 
services is defined with reference to its ordinary and accepted meaning 
under federal income tax principles. In determining whether a taxpayer 
is a bona-fide service provider under this paragraph (b)(11), the nature 
of the taxpayer's trade or business and the facts and circumstances 
surrounding the taxpayer's trade or business activities must be 
considered. Examples of taxpayers qualifying as service providers under 
this paragraph include taxpayers performing services in the fields of 
health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, 
performing arts, or consulting.
    (iii) De minimis property provided incident to services. In 
determining whether property provided to a client by a service provider 
is de minimis in amount, all facts and circumstances, such as the nature 
of the taxpayer's trade or business and the volume of its service 
activities in the trade or business, must be considered. A significant 
factor in making this determination is the relationship between the 
acquisition or direct materials costs of the property that is provided 
to clients and the price that the taxpayer charges its clients for its 
services and the property. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(11), if 
the acquisition or direct materials cost of the property provided to a 
client incident to the services is less than or equal to five percent of 
the price charged to the client for the services and property, the 
property is de minimis. If the acquisition or direct materials cost of 
the property exceeds five percent of the price charged for the services 
and property, the property may be de minimis if additional facts and 
circumstances so indicate.
    (12) De minimis rule for certain producers with total indirect costs 
of $200,000 or less. See Sec. 1.263A-2(b)(3)(iv) for a de minimis rule 
that treats producers with total indirect costs of $200,000 or less as 
having no additional section 263A costs (as defined in paragraph (d)(3) 
of this section) for purposes of the simplified production method.
    (13) Exception for the origination of loans. For purposes of section 
263A(b)(2)(A), the origination of loans is not considered the 
acquisition of intangible property for resale. (But section 
263A(b)(2)(A) does include the acquisition by a taxpayer of pre-existing 
loans from other persons for resale.)
    (c) General operation of section 263A--(1) Allocations. Under 
section 263A, taxpayers must capitalize their direct costs and a 
properly allocable share of their indirect costs to property produced or 
property acquired for resale. In order to determine these capitalizable 
costs, taxpayers must allocate or apportion costs to various activities, 
including production or resale activities. After section 263A costs are 
allocated to the appropriate production or resale activities, these 
costs are generally allocated to the items of property produced or 
property acquired for resale during the taxable year and capitalized to 
the items that remain on hand at the end of the taxable year. See 
however, the simplified production method and the simplified resale 
method in Secs. 1.263A-2(b) and 1.263A-3(d).
    (2) Otherwise deductible. (i) Any cost which (but for section 263A 
and the regulations thereunder) may not be taken into account in 
computing taxable income for any taxable year is not treated as a cost 
properly allocable to property produced or acquired for resale under 
section 263A and the regulations thereunder. Thus, for example, if a 
business meal deduction is limited by section 274(n) to 80 percent of 
the cost of the meal, the amount properly allocable to property produced 
or acquired for resale under section 263A is also limited to 80 percent 
of the cost of the meal.
    (ii) The amount of any cost required to be capitalized under section 
263A may not be included in inventory or charged to capital accounts or 
basis any earlier than the taxable year during which the amount is 
incurred within the meaning of Sec. 1.446-1(c)(1)(ii).
    (3) Capitalize. Capitalize means, in the case of property that is 
inventory in the hands of a taxpayer, to include in inventory costs and, 
in the case of other property, to charge to a capital account or basis.
    (4) Recovery of capitalized costs. Costs that are capitalized under 
section 263A are recovered through depreciation, amortization, cost of 
goods sold, or by an adjustment to basis at the time the

[[Page 398]]

property is used, sold, placed in service, or otherwise disposed of by 
the taxpayer. Cost recovery is determined by the applicable Internal 
Revenue Code and regulation provisions relating to the use, sale, or 
disposition of property.
    (d) Definitions--(1) Self-constructed assets. Self-constructed 
assets are assets produced by a taxpayer for use by the taxpayer in its 
trade or business. Self-constructed assets are subject to section 263A.
    (2) Section 471 costs--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided 
in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, for purposes of the 
regulations under section 263A, a taxpayer's section 471 costs are the 
costs, other than interest, capitalized under its method of accounting 
immediately prior to the effective date of section 263A. Thus, although 
section 471 applies only to inventories, section 471 costs include any 
non-inventory costs, other than interest, capitalized or included in 
acquisition or production costs under the taxpayer's method of 
accounting immediately prior to the effective date of section 263A.
    (ii) New taxpayers. In the case of a new taxpayer, section 471 costs 
are those acquisition or production costs, other than interest, that 
would have been required to be capitalized by the taxpayer if the 
taxpayer had been in existence immediately prior to the effective date 
of section 263A.
    (iii) Method changes. If a taxpayer included a cost described in 
Sec. 1.471-11(c)(2)(iii) in its inventoriable costs immediately prior to 
the effective date of section 263A, that cost is included in the 
taxpayer's section 471 costs under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. 
Except as provided in the following sentence, a change in the financial 
reporting practices of a taxpayer for costs described in Sec. 1.471-
11(c)(2)(iii) subsequent to the effective date of section 263A does not 
affect the classification of these costs as section 471 costs. A 
taxpayer may change its established methods of accounting used in 
determining section 471 costs only with the consent of the Commissioner 
as required under section 446(e) and the regulations thereunder.
    (3) Additional section 263A costs. Additional section 263A costs are 
defined as the costs, other than interest, that were not capitalized 
under the taxpayer's method of accounting immediately prior to the 
effective date of section 263A (adjusted as appropriate for any changes 
in methods of accounting for section 471 costs under paragraph 
(d)(2)(iii) of this section), but that are required to be capitalized 
under section 263A. For new taxpayers, additional section 263A costs are 
defined as the costs, other than interest, that the taxpayer must 
capitalize under section 263A, but which the taxpayer would not have 
been required to capitalize if the taxpayer had been in existence prior 
to the effective date of section 263A.
    (4) Section 263A costs. Section 263A costs are defined as the costs 
that a taxpayer must capitalize under section 263A. Thus, section 263A 
costs are the sum of a taxpayer's section 471 costs, its additional 
section 263A costs, and interest capitalizable under section 263A(f).
    (e) Types of costs subject to capitalization--(1) In general. 
Taxpayers subject to section 263A must capitalize all direct costs and 
certain indirect costs properly allocable to property produced or 
property acquired for resale. This paragraph (e) describes the types of 
costs subject to section 263A.
    (2) Direct costs--(i) Producers. Producers must capitalize direct 
material costs and direct labor costs.
    (A) Direct material costs include the costs of those materials that 
become an integral part of specific property produced and those 
materials that are consumed in the ordinary course of production and 
that can be identified or associated with particular units or groups of 
units of property produced.
    (B) Direct labor costs include the costs of labor that can be 
identified or associated with particular units or groups of units of 
specific property produced. For this purpose, labor encompasses full-
time and part-time employees, as well as contract employees and 
independent contractors. Direct labor costs include all elements of 
compensation other than employee benefit costs described in paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii)(D) of this section. Elements of direct labor costs

[[Page 399]]

include basic compensation, overtime pay, vacation pay, holiday pay, 
sick leave pay (other than payments pursuant to a wage continuation plan 
under section 105(d) as it existed prior to its repeal in 1983), shift 
differential, payroll taxes, and payments to a supplemental unemployment 
benefit plan.
    (ii) Resellers. Resellers must capitalize the acquisition costs of 
property acquired for resale. In the case of inventory, the acquisition 
cost is the cost described in Sec. 1.471-3(b).
    (3) Indirect costs--(i) In general. Indirect costs are defined as 
all costs other than direct material costs and direct labor costs (in 
the case of property produced) or acquisition costs (in the case of 
property acquired for resale). Taxpayers subject to section 263A must 
capitalize all indirect costs properly allocable to property produced or 
property acquired for resale. Indirect costs are properly allocable to 
property produced or property acquired for resale when the costs 
directly benefit or are incurred by reason of the performance of 
production or resale activities. Indirect costs may be allocable to both 
production and resale activities, as well as to other activities that 
are not subject to section 263A. Taxpayers subject to section 263A must 
make a reasonable allocation of indirect costs between production, 
resale, and other activities.
    (ii) Examples of indirect costs required to be capitalized. The 
following are examples of indirect costs that must be capitalized to the 
extent they are properly allocable to property produced or property 
acquired for resale:
    (A) Indirect labor costs. Indirect labor costs include all labor 
costs (including the elements of labor costs set forth in paragraph 
(e)(2)(i) of this section) that cannot be directly identified or 
associated with particular units or groups of units of specific property 
produced or property acquired for resale (e.g., factory labor that is 
not direct labor). As in the case of direct labor, indirect labor 
encompasses full-time and part-time employees, as well as contract 
employees and independent contractors.
    (B) Officers' compensation. Officers' compensation includes 
compensation paid to officers of the taxpayer.
    (C) Pension and other related costs. Pension and other related costs 
include contributions paid to or made under any stock bonus, pension, 
profit-sharing or annuity plan, or other plan deferring the receipt of 
compensation, whether or not the plan qualifies under section 401(a). 
Contributions to employee plans representing past services must be 
capitalized in the same manner (and in the same proportion to property 
currently being acquired or produced) as amounts contributed for current 
service.
    (D) Employee benefit expenses. Employee benefit expenses include all 
other employee benefit expenses (not described in paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section) to the extent such expenses are otherwise 
allowable as deductions under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
These other employee benefit expenses include: worker's compensation; 
amounts otherwise deductible or allowable in reducing earnings and 
profits under section 404A; payments pursuant to a wage continuation 
plan under section 105(d) as it existed prior to its repeal in 1983; 
amounts includible in the gross income of employees under a method or 
arrangement of employer contributions or compensation that has the 
effect of a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing or annuity plan, or 
other plan deferring receipt of compensation or providing deferred 
benefits; premiums on life and health insurance; and miscellaneous 
benefits provided for employees such as safety, medical treatment, 
recreational and eating facilities, membership dues, etc. Employee 
benefit expenses do not, however, include direct labor costs described 
in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.
    (E) Indirect material costs. Indirect material costs include the 
cost of materials that are not an integral part of specific property 
produced and the cost of materials that are consumed in the ordinary 
course of performing production or resale activities that cannot be 
identified or associated with particular units or groups of units of 
property. Thus, for example, a cost described in Sec. 1.162-3, relating 
to the cost of a material or supply, is an indirect material cost.

[[Page 400]]

    (F) Purchasing costs. Purchasing costs include costs attributable to 
purchasing activities. See Sec. 1.263A-3(c)(3) for a further discussion 
of purchasing costs.
    (G) Handling costs. Handling costs include costs attributable to 
processing, assembling, repackaging and transporting goods, and other 
similar activities. See Sec. 1.263A-3(c)(4) for a further discussion of 
handling costs.
    (H) Storage costs. Storage costs include the costs of carrying, 
storing, or warehousing property. See Sec. 1.263A-3(c)(5) for a further 
discussion of storage costs.
    (I) Cost recovery. Cost recovery includes depreciation, 
amortization, and cost recovery allowances on equipment and facilities 
(including depreciation or amortization of self-constructed assets or 
other previously produced or acquired property to which section 263A or 
section 263 applies).
    (J) Depletion. Depletion includes allowances for depletion, whether 
or not in excess of cost. Depletion is, however, only properly allocable 
to property that has been sold (i.e., for purposes of determining gain 
or loss on the sale of the property).
    (K) Rent. Rent includes the cost of renting or leasing equipment, 
facilities, or land.
    (L) Taxes. Taxes include those taxes (other than taxes described in 
paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(F) of this section) that are otherwise allowable 
as a deduction to the extent such taxes are attributable to labor, 
materials, supplies, equipment, land, or facilities used in production 
or resale activities.
    (M) Insurance. Insurance includes the cost of insurance on plant or 
facility, machinery, equipment, materials, property produced, or 
property acquired for resale.
    (N) Utilities. Utilities include the cost of electricity, gas, and 
water.
    (O) Repairs and maintenance. Repairs and maintenance include the 
cost of repairing and maintaining equipment or facilities.
    (P) Engineering and design costs. Engineering and design costs 
include pre-production costs, such as costs attributable to research, 
experimental, engineering, and design activities (to the extent that 
such amounts are not research and experimental expenditures as described 
in section 174 and the regulations thereunder).
    (Q) Spoilage. Spoilage includes the costs of rework labor, scrap, 
and spoilage.
    (R) Tools and equipment. Tools and equipment include the costs of 
tools and equipment which are not otherwise capitalized.
    (S) Quality control. Quality control includes the costs of quality 
control and inspection.
    (T) Bidding costs. Bidding costs are costs incurred in the 
solicitation of contracts (including contracts pertaining to property 
acquired for resale) ultimately awarded to the taxpayer. The taxpayer 
must defer all bidding costs paid or incurred in the solicitation of a 
particular contract until the contract is awarded. If the contract is 
awarded to the taxpayer, the bidding costs become part of the indirect 
costs allocated to the subject matter of the contract. If the contract 
is not awarded to the taxpayer, bidding costs are deductible in the 
taxable year that the contract is awarded to another party, or in the 
taxable year that the taxpayer is notified in writing that no contract 
will be awarded and that the contract (or a similar or related contract) 
will not be rebid, or in the taxable year that the taxpayer abandons its 
bid or proposal, whichever occurs first. Abandoning a bid does not 
include modifying, supplementing, or changing the original bid or 
proposal. If the taxpayer is awarded only part of the bid (for example, 
the taxpayer submitted one bid to build each of two different types of 
products, and the taxpayer was awarded a contract to build only one of 
the two types of products), the taxpayer shall deduct the portion of the 
bidding costs related to the portion of the bid not awarded to the 
taxpayer. In the case of a bid or proposal for a multi-unit contract, 
all bidding costs must be included in the costs allocated to the subject 
matter of the contract awarded to the taxpayer to produce or acquire for 
resale any of such units. For example, where the taxpayer submits one 
bid to produce three similar turbines and the taxpayer is awarded a 
contract to produce only two of the three turbines, all bidding costs 
must be included in the cost of the two turbines.

[[Page 401]]

For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(T), a contract means--
    (1) In the case of a specific unit of property, any agreement under 
which the taxpayer would produce or sell property to another party if 
the agreement is entered into before the taxpayer produces or acquires 
the specific unit of property to be delivered to the party under the 
agreement; and
    (2) In the case of fungible property, any agreement to the extent 
that, at the time the agreement is entered into, the taxpayer has on 
hand an insufficient quantity of completed fungible items of such 
property that may be used to satisfy the agreement (plus any other 
production or sales agreements of the taxpayer).
    (U) Licensing and franchise costs. Licensing and franchise costs 
include fees incurred in securing the contractual right to use a 
trademark, corporate plan, manufacturing procedure, special recipe, or 
other similar right associated with property produced or property 
acquired for resale. These costs include the otherwise deductible 
portion (e.g., amortization) of the initial fees incurred to obtain the 
license or franchise and any minimum annual payments and royalties that 
are incurred by a licensee or a franchisee.
    (V) Interest. Interest includes interest on debt incurred or 
continued during the production period to finance the production of real 
property or tangible personal property to which section 263A(f) applies.
    (W) Capitalizable service costs. Service costs that are required to 
be capitalized include capitalizable service costs and capitalizable 
mixed service costs as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (iii) Indirect costs not capitalized. The following indirect costs 
are not required to be capitalized under section 263A:
    (A) Selling and distribution costs. These costs are marketing, 
selling, advertising, and distribution costs.
    (B) Research and experimental expenditures. Research and 
experimental expenditures are expenditures described in section 174 and 
the regulations thereunder.
    (C) Section 179 costs. Section 179 costs are expenses for certain 
depreciable assets deductible at the election of the taxpayer under 
section 179 and the regulations thereunder.
    (D) Section 165 losses. Section 165 losses are losses under section 
165 and the regulations thereunder.
    (E) Cost recovery allowances on temporarily idle equipment and 
facilities--(1) In general. Cost recovery allowances on temporarily idle 
equipment and facilities include only depreciation, amortization, and 
cost recovery allowances on equipment and facilities that have been 
placed in service but are temporarily idle. Equipment and facilities are 
temporarily idle when a taxpayer takes them out of service for a finite 
period. However, equipment and facilities are not considered temporarily 
idle--
    (i) During worker breaks, non-working hours, or on regularly 
scheduled non-working days (such as holidays or weekends);
    (ii) During normal interruptions in the operation of the equipment 
or facilities;
    (iii) When equipment is enroute to or located at a job site; or
    (iv) When under normal operating conditions, the equipment is used 
or operated only during certain shifts.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(E) are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Equipment operated only during certain shifts. Taxpayer A 
manufactures widgets. Although A's manufacturing facility operates 24 
hours each day in three shifts, A only operates its stamping machine 
during one shift each day. Because A only operates its stamping machine 
during certain shifts, A's stamping machine is not considered 
temporarily idle during the two shifts that it is not operated.
    Example 2. Facility shut down for retooling. Taxpayer B owns and 
operates a manufacturing facility. B closes its manufacturing facility 
for two weeks to retool its assembly line. B's manufacturing facility is 
considered temporarily idle during this two-week period.

    (F) Taxes assessed on the basis of income. Taxes assessed on the 
basis of income include only state, local, and foreign income taxes, and 
franchise taxes that are assessed on the taxpayer based on income.

[[Page 402]]

    (G) Strike expenses. Strike expenses include only costs associated 
with hiring employees to replace striking personnel (but not wages of 
replacement personnel), costs of security, and legal fees associated 
with settling strikes.
    (H) Warranty and product liability costs. Warranty costs and product 
liability costs are costs incurred in fulfilling product warranty 
obligations for products that have been sold and costs incurred for 
product liability insurance.
    (I) On-site storage costs. On-site storage costs are storage and 
warehousing costs incurred by a taxpayer at an on-site storage facility, 
as defined in Sec. 1.263A-3(c)(5)(ii)(A), with respect to property 
produced or property acquired for resale.
    (J) Unsuccessful bidding expenses. Unsuccessful bidding costs are 
bidding expenses incurred in the solicitation of contracts not awarded 
to the taxpayer.
    (K) Deductible service costs. Service costs that are not required to 
be capitalized include deductible service costs and deductible mixed 
service costs as defined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
    (4) Service costs--(i) Introduction. This paragraph (e)(4) provides 
definitions and categories of service costs. Paragraph (g)(4) of this 
section provides specific rules for determining the amount of service 
costs allocable to property produced or property acquired for resale. In 
addition, paragraph (h) of this section provides a simplified method for 
determining the amount of service costs that must be capitalized.
    (A) Definition of service costs. Service costs are defined as a type 
of indirect costs (e.g., general and administrative costs) that can be 
identified specifically with a service department or function or that 
directly benefit or are incurred by reason of a service department or 
function.
    (B) Definition of service departments. Service departments are 
defined as administrative, service, or support departments that incur 
service costs. The facts and circumstances of the taxpayer's activities 
and business organization control whether a department is a service 
department. For example, service departments include personnel, 
accounting, data processing, security, legal, and other similar 
departments.
    (ii) Various service cost categories--(A) Capitalizable service 
costs. Capitalizable service costs are defined as service costs that 
directly benefit or are incurred by reason of the performance of the 
production or resale activities of the taxpayer. Therefore, these 
service costs are required to be capitalized under section 263A. 
Examples of service departments or functions that incur capitalizable 
service costs are provided in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of this section.
    (B) Deductible service costs. Deductible service costs are defined 
as service costs that do not directly benefit or are not incurred by 
reason of the performance of the production or resale activities of the 
taxpayer, and therefore, are not required to be capitalized under 
section 263A. Deductible service costs generally include costs incurred 
by reason of the taxpayer's overall management or policy guidance 
functions. In addition, deductible service costs include costs incurred 
by reason of the marketing, selling, advertising, and distribution 
activities of the taxpayer. Examples of service departments or functions 
that incur deductible service costs are provided in paragraph (e)(4)(iv) 
of this section.
    (C) Mixed service costs. Mixed service costs are defined as service 
costs that are partially allocable to production or resale activities 
(capitalizable mixed service costs) and partially allocable to non-
production or non-resale activities (deductible mixed service costs). 
For example, a personnel department may incur costs to recruit factory 
workers, the costs of which are allocable to production activities, and 
it may incur costs to develop wage, salary, and benefit policies, the 
costs of which are allocable to non-production activities.
    (iii) Examples of capitalizable service costs. Costs incurred in the 
following departments or functions are generally allocated among 
production or resale activities:
    (A) The administration and coordination of production or resale 
activities (wherever performed in the business organization of the 
taxpayer).

[[Page 403]]

    (B) Personnel operations, including the cost of recruiting, hiring, 
relocating, assigning, and maintaining personnel records or employees.
    (C) Purchasing operations, including purchasing materials and 
equipment, scheduling and coordinating delivery of materials and 
equipment to or from factories or job sites, and expediting and follow-
up.
    (D) Materials handling and warehousing and storage operations.
    (E) Accounting and data services operations, including, for example, 
cost accounting, accounts payable, disbursements, and payroll functions 
(but excluding accounts receivable and customer billing functions).
    (F) Data processing.
    (G) Security services.
    (H) Legal services.
    (iv) Examples of deductible service costs. Costs incurred in the 
following departments or functions are not generally allocated to 
production or resale activities:
    (A) Departments or functions responsible for overall management of

activities or trades or businesses, such as the board of directors

    (f) Cost allocation methods--(1) Introduction. This paragraph (f) 
sets forth various detailed or specific (facts-and-circumstances) cost 
allocation methods that taxpayers may use to allocate direct and 
indirect costs to property produced and property acquired for resale. 
Paragraph (g) of this section provides general rules for applying these 
allocation methods to various categories of costs (i.e., direct 
materials, direct labor, and indirect costs, including service costs). 
In addition, in lieu of a facts-and-circumstances allocation method, 
taxpayers may use the simplified methods provided in Secs. 1.263A-2(b) 
and 1.263A-3(d) to allocate direct and indirect costs to eligible 
property produced or eligible property acquired for resale; see those 
sections for definitions of eligible property. Paragraph (h) of this 
section provides a simplified method for determining the amount of mixed 
service costs required to be capitalized to eligible property. The 
methodology set forth in paragraph (h) of this section for mixed service 
costs may be used in conjunction with either a facts-and-circumstances 
or a simplified method of allocating costs to eligible property produced 
or eligible property acquired for resale.
    (2) Specific identification method. A specific identification method 
traces costs to a cost objective, such as a function, department, 
activity, or product, on the basis of a cause and effect or other 
reasonable relationship between the costs and the cost objective.
    (3) Burden rate and standard cost methods--(i) Burden rate method--
(A) In general.  A burden rate method allocates an appropriate amount of 
indirect costs to

[[Page 404]]

property produced or property acquired for resale during a taxable year 
using predetermined rates that approximate the actual amount of indirect 
costs incurred by the taxpayer during the taxable year. Burden rates 
(such as ratios based on direct costs, hours, or similar items) may be 
developed by the taxpayer in accordance with acceptable accounting 
principles and applied in a reasonable manner. A taxpayer may allocate 
different indirect costs on the basis of different burden rates. Thus, 
for example, the taxpayer may use one burden rate for allocating the 
cost of rent and another burden rate for allocating the cost of 
utilities. Any periodic adjustment to a burden rate that merely reflects 
current operating conditions, such as increases in automation or changes 
in operation or prices, is not a change in method of accounting under 
section 446(e). A change, however, in the concept or base upon which 
such rates are developed, such as a change from basing the rates on 
direct labor hours to basing them on direct machine hours, is a change 
in method of accounting to which section 446(e) applies.
    (B) Development of burden rates. The following factors, among 
others, may be used in developing burden rates:
    (1) The selection of an appropriate level of activity and a period 
of time upon which to base the calculation of rates reflecting operating 
conditions for purposes of the unit costs being determined.
    (2) The selection of an appropriate statistical base, such as direct 
labor hours, direct labor dollars, machine hours, or a combination 
thereof, upon which to apply the overhead rate.
    (3) The appropriate budgeting, classification, and analysis of 
expenses (for example, the analysis of fixed versus variable costs).
    (C) Operation of the burden rate method. The purpose of the burden 
rate method is to allocate an appropriate amount of indirect costs to 
production or resale activities through the use of predetermined rates 
intended to approximate the actual amount of indirect costs incurred. 
Accordingly, the proper use of the burden rate method under this section 
requires that any net negative or net positive difference between the 
total predetermined amount of costs allocated to property and the total 
amount of indirect costs actually incurred and required to be allocated 
to such property (i.e., the under or over-applied burden) must be 
treated as an adjustment to the taxpayer's ending inventory or capital 
account (as the case may be) in the taxable year in which such 
difference arises. However, if such adjustment is not significant in 
amount in relation to the taxpayer's total indirect costs incurred with 
respect to production or resale activities for the year, such adjustment 
need not be allocated to the property produced or property acquired for 
resale unless such allocation is made in the taxpayer's financial 
reports. The taxpayer must treat both positive and negative adjustments 
consistently.
    (ii) Standard cost method--(A) In general. A standard cost method 
allocates an appropriate amount of direct and indirect costs to property 
produced by the taxpayer through the use of preestablished standard 
allowances, without reference to costs actually incurred during the 
taxable year. A taxpayer may use a standard cost method to allocate 
costs, provided variances are treated in accordance with the procedures 
prescribed in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. Any periodic 
adjustment to standard costs that merely reflects current operating 
conditions, such as increases in automation or changes in operation or 
prices, is not a change in method of accounting under section 446(e). A 
change, however, in the concept or base upon which standard costs are 
developed is a change in method of accounting to which section 446(e) 
applies.
    (B) Treatment of variances. For purposes of this section, net 
positive overhead variance means the excess of total standard indirect 
costs over total actual indirect costs and net negative overhead 
variance means the excess of total actual indirect costs over total 
standard indirect costs. The proper use of a standard cost method 
requires that a taxpayer must reallocate to property a pro rata portion 
of any net negative or net positive overhead variances and any net 
negative or net positive direct

[[Page 405]]

cost variances. The taxpayer must apportion such variances to or among 
the property to which the costs are allocable. However, if such 
variances are not significant in amount relative to the taxpayer's total 
indirect costs incurred with respect to production and resale activities 
for the year, such variances need not be allocated to property produced 
or property acquired for resale unless such allocation is made in the 
taxpayer's financial reports. A taxpayer must treat both positive and 
negative variances consistently.
    (4) Reasonable allocation methods. A taxpayer may use the methods 
described in paragraph (f) (2) or (3) of this section if they are 
reasonable allocation methods within the meaning of this paragraph 
(f)(4). In addition, a taxpayer may use any other reasonable method to 
properly allocate direct and indirect costs among units of property 
produced or property acquired for resale during the taxable year. An 
allocation method is reasonable if, with respect to the taxpayer's 
production or resale activities taken as a whole--
    (i) The total costs actually capitalized during the taxable year do 
not differ significantly from the aggregate costs that would be properly 
capitalized using another permissible method described in this section 
or in Secs. 1.263A-2 and 1.263A-3, with appropriate consideration given 
to the volume and value of the taxpayer's production or resale 
activities, the availability of costing information, the time and cost 
of using various allocation methods, and the accuracy of the allocation 
method chosen as compared with other allocation methods;
    (ii) The allocation method is applied consistently by the taxpayer; 
and
    (iii) The allocation method is not used to circumvent the 
requirements of the simplified methods in this section or in 
Sec. 1.263A-2, Sec. 1.263A-3, or the principles of section 263A.
    (g) Allocating categories of costs--(1) Direct materials. Direct 
material costs (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section) incurred 
during the taxable year must be allocated to the property produced or 
property acquired for resale by the taxpayer using the taxpayer's d of 
accounting for materials (e.g., specific identification; first-in, 
first-out (FIFO); or last-in, first-out (LIFO)), or any other reasonable 
allocation method (as defined under the principles of paragraph (f)(4) 
of this section).
    (2) Direct labor. Direct labor costs (as defined in paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section) incurred during the taxable year are generally 
allocated to property produced or property acquired for resale using a 
specific identification method, standard cost method, or any other 
reasonable allocation method (as defined under the principles of 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section). All elements of compensation, other 
than basic compensation, may be grouped together and then allocated in 
proportion to the charge for basic compensation. Further, a taxpayer is 
not treated as using an erroneous method of accounting if direct labor 
costs are treated as indirect costs under the taxpayer's allocation 
method, provided such costs are capitalized to the extent required by 
paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
    (3) Indirect costs. Indirect costs (as defined in paragraph (e)(3) 
of this section) are generally allocated to intermediate cost objectives 
such as departments or activities prior to the allocation of such costs 
to property produced or property acquired for resale. Indirect costs are 
allocated using either a specific identification method, a standard cost 
method, a burden rate method, or any other reasonable allocation method 
(as defined under the principles of paragraph (f)(4) of this section).
    (4) Service costs--(i) In general. Service costs are a type of 
indirect costs that may be allocated using the same allocation methods 
available for allocating other indirect costs described in paragraph 
(g)(3) of this section. Generally, taxpayers that use a specific 
identification method or another reasonable allocation method must 
allocate service costs to particular departments or activities based on 
a factor or relationship that reasonably relates the service costs to 
the benefits received from the service departments or activities. For 
example, a reasonable factor for allocating legal services to particular 
departments or activities is the number of hours of legal services 
attributable to each department or activity. See paragraph (g)(4)(iv) of 
this section for

[[Page 406]]

other illustrations. Using reasonable factors or relationships, a 
taxpayer must allocate mixed service costs under a direct reallocation 
method described in paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, a step-
allocation method described in paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, 
or any other reasonable allocation method (as defined under the 
principles of paragraph (f)(4) of this section).
    (ii) De minimis rule. For purposes of administrative convenience, if 
90 percent or more of a mixed service department's costs are deductible 
service costs, a taxpayer may elect not to allocate any portion of the 
service department's costs to property produced or property acquired for 
resale. For example, if 90 percent of the costs of an electing 
taxpayer's industrial relations department benefit the taxpayer's 
overall policy-making activities, the taxpayer is not required to 
allocate any portion of these costs to a production activity. Under this 
election, however, if 90 percent or more of a mixed service department's 
costs are capitalizable service costs, a taxpayer must allocate 100 
percent of the department's costs to the production or resale activity 
benefitted. For example, if 90 percent of the costs of an electing 
taxpayer's accounting department benefit the taxpayer's manufacturing 
activity, the taxpayer must allocate 100 percent of the costs of the 
accounting department to the manufacturing activity. An election under 
this paragraph (g)(4)(ii) applies to all of a taxpayer's mixed service 
departments and constitutes the adoption of a (or a change in) method of 
accounting under section 446 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (iii) Methods for allocating mixed service costs--(A) Direct 
reallocation method. Under the direct reallocation method, the total 
costs (direct and indirect) of all mixed service departments are 
allocated only to departments or cost centers engaged in production or 
resale activities and then from those departments to particular 
activities. This direct reallocation method ignores benefits provided by 
one mixed service department to other mixed service departments, and 
also excludes other mixed service departments from the base used to make 
the allocation.
    (B) Step-allocation method. (1) Under a step-allocation method, a 
sequence of allocations is made by the taxpayer. First, the total costs 
of the mixed service departments that benefit the greatest number of 
other departments are allocated to--
    (i) Other mixed service departments;
    (ii) Departments that incur only deductible service costs; and
    (iii) Departments that exclusively engage in production or resale 
activities.
    (2) A taxpayer continues allocating mixed service costs in the 
manner described in paragraph (g)(4)(iii)(B)(1) of this section (i.e., 
from the service departments benefitting the greatest number of 
departments to the service departments benefitting the least number of 
departments) until all mixed service costs are allocated to the types of 
departments listed in this paragraph (g)(4)(iii). Thus, a step-
allocation method recognizes the benefits provided by one mixed service 
department to another mixed service department and also includes mixed 
service departments that have not yet been allocated in the base used to 
make the allocation.
    (C) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (g)(4)(iii) are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Direct reallocation method. (i) Taxpayer E has the 
following five departments: the Assembling Department, the Painting 
Department, and the Finishing Department (production departments), and 
the Personnel Department and the Data Processing Department (mixed 
service departments). E allocates the Personnel Department's costs on 
the basis of total payroll costs and the Data Processing Department's 
costs on the basis of data processing hours.
    (ii) Under a direct reallocation method, E allocates the Personnel 
Department's costs directly to its Assembling, Painting, and Finishing 
Department, and not to its Data Processing department.

    Example 2. Step-allocation method. (i) Taxpayer F has the following 
five departments: the Manufacturing Department (a production 
department), the Marketing Department and the Finance Department 
(departments that incur only deductible service costs), the Personnel 
Department and the Data Processing Department (mixed service 
departments). F uses a step-allocation method and allocates the 
Personnel Department's costs on the basis of total payroll costs and the 
Data Processing Department's costs on the basis of data processing 
hours. F's Personnel Department benefits all four of F's other 
departments, while its Data Processing Department benefits only three 
departments. Because F's Personnel Department benefits the greatest 
number of other departments, F first allocates its Personnel 
Department's costs to its Manufacturing, Marketing, Finance and Data 
Processing departments, as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               Total cost of   Total payroll                          Amount

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (ii) Under a step-allocation method, the denominator of F's 
allocation ratio includes the payroll costs of its Manufacturing, 
Marketing, Finance, and Data Processing departments.
    (iii) Next, F allocates the costs of its Data Processing Department 
on the basis of data processing hours. Because the costs incurred by F's 
Personnel Department have already been allocated, no allocation is made 
to the Personnel Department.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (iv) Under the second step of F's step-allocation method, the 
denominator of F's allocation ratio includes the data processing hours 
of its Manufacturing, Marketing, and Finance Departments, but does not 
include the data processing hours of its Personnel Department (the other 
mixed service department) because the costs of that department have 
previously been allocated.

    (iv) Illustrations of mixed service cost allocations using 
reasonable factors or relationships. This paragraph (g)(4)(iv) 
illustrates various reasonable factors and relationships that may be 
used in allocating different types of mixed service costs. Taxpayers, 
however, are permitted to use other reasonable factors and relationships 
to allocate mixed service costs. In addition, the factors or 
relationships illustrated in this paragraph (g)(4)(iv) may be used to 
allocate other types of service costs not illustrated in this paragraph 
(g)(4)(iv).
    (A) Security services. The costs of security or protection services 
must be allocated to each physical area that receives the services using 
any reasonable method applied consistently (e.g., the size of the 
physical area, the number of employees in the area, or the relative fair 
market value of assets located in the area).
    (B) Legal services. The costs of legal services are generally 
allocable to a particular production or resale activity on the basis of 
the approximate number of hours of legal service performed in connection 
with the activity, including research, bidding, negotiating, drafting, 
reviewing a contract, obtaining necessary licenses and permits, and 
resolving disputes. Different hourly rates may be appropriate for 
different services. In determining the number of hours allocable to any 
activity, estimates are appropriate, detailed time records are not 
required to be kept, and insubstantial amounts of services provided to 
an activity by senior legal staff (such as administrators or reviewers) 
may be ignored. Legal costs may also be allocated to a particular 
production or resale activity based on the ratio of the total direct 
costs incurred for the activity to the total direct costs incurred with 
respect to all production or resale activities. The taxpayer must also 
allocate directly to an activity the cost incurred for any outside legal 
services. Legal costs relating to general corporate functions are not 
required to be allocated to a particular production or resale activity.
    (C) Centralized payroll services. The costs of a centralized payroll 
department or activity are generally allocated to the departments or 
activities benefitted on the basis of the gross dollar amount of payroll 
processed.
    (D) Centralized data processing services. The costs of a centralized 
data processing department are generally allocated to all departments or 
activities benefitted using any reasonable basis, such as total direct 
data processing costs or the number of data processing hours supplied. 
The costs of data processing systems or applications developed for a 
particular activity are directly allocated to that activity.
    (E) Engineering and design services. The costs of an engineering or 
a design department are generally directly allocable to the departments 
or activities benefitted based on the ratio of the approximate number of 
hours of work performed with respect to the particular activity to the 
total number of hours of engineering or design work performed for all 
activities. Different services may be allocated at different hourly 
rates.
    (F) Safety engineering services. The costs of a safety engineering 
departments or activities generally benefit all of the taxpayer's 
activities and, thus, should be allocated using a reasonable basis, such 
as: the approximate number of safety inspections made in connection with 
a particular activity as a fraction of total inspections, the number of 
employees assigned to an activity as a fraction of total employees, or 
the total labor hours worked in connection with an activity as a 
fraction of total hours. However, in determining the allocable costs of 
a safety engineering department, costs attributable to providing a 
safety program relating only to a particular activity must be directly 
assigned to such activity. Additionally, the cost of a safety 
engineering department only responsible for setting safety policy and 
establishing safety procedures to be used in all of the taxpayer's 
activities is not required to be allocated.
    (v) Accounting method change. A change in the method or base used to 
allocate service costs (such as changing from an allocation base using 
direct labor costs to a base using direct labor hours), or a change in 
the taxpayer's determination of what functions or departments of the 
taxpayer are to be allocated, is a change in

[[Page 409]]

method of accounting to which section 446(e) and the regulations 
thereunder apply.
    (h) Simplified service cost method--(1) Introduction. This paragraph 
(h) provides a simplified method for determining capitalizable mixed 
service costs incurred during the taxable year with respect to eligible 
property (i.e., the aggregate portion of mixed service costs that are 
properly allocable to the taxpayer's production or resale activities).
    (2) Eligible property--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided 
in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) of this section, the simplified service cost 
method, if elected for any trade or business of the taxpayer, must be 
used for all production and resale activities of the trade or business 
associated with any of the following categories of property that are 
subject to section 263A:
    (A) Inventory property. Stock in trade or other property properly 
includible in the inventory of the taxpayer.
    (B) Non-inventory property held for sale. Non-inventory property 
held by a taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary 
course of the taxpayer's trade or business.
    (C) Certain self-constructed assets. Self-constructed assets 
substantially identical in nature to, and produced in the same manner 
as, inventory property produced by the taxpayer or other property 
produced by the taxpayer and held primarily for sale to customers in the 
ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.
    (D) Self-constructed assets produced on a repetitive basis. Self-
constructed assets produced by the taxpayer on a routine and repetitive 
basis in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.
    (ii) Election to exclude self-constructed assets. At the taxpayer's 
election, the simplified service cost method may be applied within a 
trade or business to only the categories of inventory property and non-
inventory property held for sale described in paragraphs (h)(2)(i)(A) 
and(B) of this section. Taxpayers electing to exclude the self-
constructed assets described in paragraphs (h)(2)(i)(C) and (D) of this 
section from application of the simplified service cost method must, 
however, allocate service costs to such property in accordance with 
paragraph (g)(4) of this section.
    (3) General allocation formula. (i) Under the simplified service 
cost method, a taxpayer computes its capitalizable mixed service costs 
using the following formula:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.001

    (ii) A producer may elect one of two allocation ratios, the labor-
based allocation ratio or the production cost allocation ratio. A 
reseller that satisfies the requirements for using the simplified resale 
method of Sec. 1.263A-3(d) (whether or not that method is elected) may 
elect the simplified service cost method, but must use a labor-based 
allocation ratio. (See Sec. 1.263A-3(d) for labor-based allocation 
ratios to be used in conjunction with the simplified resale method.) The 
allocation ratio used by a trade or business of a taxpayer is a method 
of accounting which must be applied consistently within the trade or 
business.
    (4) Labor-based allocation ratio. (i) The labor-based allocation 
ratio is computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.002

    (ii) Section 263A labor costs are defined as the total labor costs 
(excluding labor costs included in mixed service costs) allocable to 
property produced and property acquired for resale under section 263A 
that are incurred in the taxpayer's trade or business during the taxable 
year. Total labor costs are defined as the total labor costs (excluding 
labor costs included in mixed service costs) incurred in the taxpayer's 
trade or business during the taxable year.

[[Page 410]]

Total labor costs include labor costs incurred in all parts of the trade 
or business (i.e., if the taxpayer has both property produced and 
property acquired for resale, the taxpayer must include labor costs from 
resale activities as well as production activities). For example, 
taxpayer G incurs $1,000 of total mixed service costs during the taxable 
year. G's section 263A labor costs are $5,000 and its total labor costs 
are $10,000. Under the labor-based allocation ratio, G's capitalizable 
mixed service costs are $500 (i.e., $1,000  x  ($5,000 divided by 
$10,000)).
    (5) Production cost allocation ratio. (i) Producers may use the 
production cost allocation ratio, computed as follows:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.003

    (ii) Section 263A production costs are defined as the total costs 
(excluding mixed service costs and interest) allocable to property 
produced (and property acquired for resale if the producer is also 
engaged in resale activities) under section 263A that are incurred in 
the taxpayer's trade or business during the taxable year. Total costs 
are defined as all costs (excluding mixed service costs and interest) 
incurred in the taxpayer's trade or business during the taxable year. 
Total costs include all direct and indirect costs allocable to property 
produced (and property acquired for resale if the producer is also 
engaged in resale activities) as well as all other costs of the 
taxpayer's trade or business, including, but not limited to: salaries 
and other labor costs of all personnel; all depreciation taken for 
federal income tax purposes; research and experimental expenditures; and 
selling, marketing, and distribution costs. Such costs do not include, 
however, taxes described in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(F) of this section. 
For example, taxpayer H, a producer, incurs $1,000 of total mixed 
service costs in the taxable year. H's section 263A production costs are 
$10,000 and its total costs are $20,000. Under the production cost 
allocation ratio, H's capitalizable mixed service costs are $500 (i.e., 
$1,000 X ($10,000 divided by $20,000)).
    (6) Definition of total mixed service costs. Total mixed service 
costs are defined as the total costs incurred during the taxable year in 
all departments or functions of the taxpayer's trade or business that 
perform mixed service activities. See paragraph (e)(4)(ii)(C) of this 
section which defines mixed service costs. In determining the total 
mixed service costs of a trade or business, the taxpayer must include 
all costs incurred in its mixed service departments and cannot exclude 
any otherwise deductible service costs. For example, if the accounting 
department within a trade or business is a mixed service department, 
then in determining the total mixed service costs of the trade or 
business, the taxpayer cannot exclude the costs of personnel in the 
accounting department that perform services relating to non-production 
activities (e.g., accounts receivable or customer billing activities). 
Instead, the entire cost of the accounting department must be included 
in the total mixed service costs.
    (7) Costs allocable to more than one business. To the extent mixed 
service costs, labor costs, or other costs are incurred in more than one 
trade or business, the taxpayer must determine the amounts allocable to 
the particular trade or business for which the simplified service cost 
method is being applied by using any reasonable allocation method 
consistent with the principles of paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (8) De minimis rule. If the taxpayer elects to apply the de minimis 
rule of paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section to any mixed service 
department, the department is not considered a mixed service department 
for purposes of the simplified service cost method. Instead, the costs 
of such department are allocated exclusively to the particular activity 
satisfying the 90-percent test.
    (9) Separate election. A taxpayer may elect the simplified service 
cost method in conjunction with any other allocation method used at the 
trade or business level, including the simplified methods described in 
Secs. 1.263A-2(b) and 1.263A-3(d). However, the election of the 
simplified service cost method must be made independently of the 
election to use those other simplified methods.
    (i) [Reserved]

[[Page 411]]

    (j) Special rules--(1) Costs provided by a related person--(i) In 
general. A taxpayer subject to section 263A must capitalize an arm's-
length charge for any section 263A costs (e.g., costs of materials, 
labor, or services) incurred by a related person that are properly 
allocable to the property produced or property acquired for resale by 
the taxpayer. Both the taxpayer and the related person must account for 
the transaction as if an arm's-length charge had been incurred by the 
taxpayer with respect to its property produced or property acquired for 
resale. For purposes of this paragraph (j)(1)(i), a taxpayer is 
considered related to another person if the taxpayer and such person are 
described in section 482. Further, for purposes of this paragraph 
(j)(1)(i), arm's-length charge means the arm's-length charge (or other 
appropriate charge where permitted and applicable) under the principles 
of section 482. Any correlative adjustments necessary because of the 
arm's-length charge requirement of this paragraph (j)(1)(i) shall be 
determined under the principles of section 482.
     (ii) Exceptions. The provisions of paragraph (j)(1)(i) of this 
section do not apply if, and to the extent that--
    (A) It would be inappropriate under the principles of section 482 
for the Commissioner to adjust the income of the taxpayer or the related 
person with respect to the transaction at issue; or
    (B) A transaction is accounted for under an alternative Internal 
Revenue Code section resulting in the capitalization (or deferral of the 
deduction) of the costs of the items provided by the related party and 
the related party does not deduct such costs earlier than the costs 
would have been deducted by the taxpayer if the costs were capitalized 
under section 263A. See Sec. 1.1502-13.
    (2) Optional capitalization of period costs--(i) In general. 
Taxpayers are not required to capitalize indirect costs that do not 
directly benefit or are not incurred by reason of the production of 
property or acquisition of property for resale (i.e., period costs). A 
taxpayer may, however, elect to capitalize certain period costs if: The 
method is consistently applied; is used in computing beginning 
inventories, ending inventories, and cost of goods sold; and does not 
result in a material distortion of the taxpayer's income. A material 
distortion relates to the source, character, amount, or timing of the 
cost capitalized or any other item affected by the capitalization of the 
cost. Thus, for example, a taxpayer may not capitalize a period cost 
under section 263A if capitalization would result in a material change 
in the computation of the foreign tax credit limitation under section 
904. An election to capitalize a period cost is the adoption of (or a 
change in) a method of accounting under section 446 of the Internal 
Revenue Code.
    (ii) Period costs eligible for capitalization. The types of period 
costs eligible for capitalization under this paragraph (j)(2) include 
only the types of period costs (e.g., under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of 
this section) for which some portion of the costs incurred is properly 
allocable to property produced or property acquired for resale in the 
year of the election. Thus, for example, marketing or advertising costs, 
no portion of which are properly allocable to property produced or 
property acquired for resale, do not qualify for elective capitalization 
under this paragraph (j)(2).
    (3) Trade or business application. Notwithstanding the references 
generally to taxpayer throughout this section and Secs. 1.263A-2 and 
1.263A-3, the methods of accounting provided under section 263A are to 
be elected and applied independently for each separate and distinct 
trade or business of the taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of 
section 446(d) and the regulations thereunder.
    (4) Transfers with a principal purpose of tax avoidance. The 
District Director may require appropriate adjustments to valuations of 
inventory and other property subject to section 263A if a transfer of 
property is made to another person for a principal purpose of avoiding 
the application of section 263A. Thus, for example, the District 
Director may require a taxpayer using the simplified production method 
of Sec. 1.263A-2(b) to apply that method to transferred inventories 
immediately prior to a transfer under section 351 if

[[Page 412]]

a principal purpose of the transfer is to avoid the application of 
section 263A.

<R05>
Sec. 1.263A-2  Rules relating to property produced by the taxpayer.

    (a) In general. Section 263A applies to real property and tangible 
personal property produced by a taxpayer for use in its trade or 
business or for sale to its customers. In addition, section 263A applies 
to property produced for a taxpayer under a contract with another party. 
The principal terms related to the scope of section 263A with respect to 
producers are provided in this paragraph (a). See Sec. 1.263A-1(b)(11) 
for an exception in the case of certain de minimis property provided to 
customers incident to the provision of services.
    (1) Produce--(i) In general. For purposes of section 263A, produce 
includes the following: construct, build, install, manufacture, develop, 
improve, create, raise, or grow.
    (ii) Ownership--(A) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(1)(ii) (B) and (C) of this section, a taxpayer is not considered to 
be producing property unless the taxpayer is considered an owner of the 
property produced under federal income tax principles. The determination 
as to whether a taxpayer is an owner is based on all of the facts and 
circumstances, including the various benefits and burdens of ownership 
vested with the taxpayer. A taxpayer may be considered an owner of 
property produced, even though the taxpayer does not have legal title to 
the property.
    (B) Property produced for the taxpayer under a contract--(1) In 
general. Property produced for the taxpayer under a contract with 
another party is treated as property produced by the taxpayer to the 
extent the taxpayer makes payments or otherwise incurs costs with 
respect to the property. A taxpayer has made payment under this section 
if the transaction would be considered payment by a taxpayer using the 
cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting.
    (2) Definition of a contract--(i) General rule. Except as provided 
under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B)(2)(ii) of this section, a contract is any 
agreement providing for the production of property if the agreement is 
entered into before the production of the property to be delivered under 
the contract is completed. Whether an agreement exists depends on all 
the facts and circumstances. Facts and circumstances indicating an 
agreement include, for example, the making of a prepayment, or an 
arrangement to make a prepayment, for property prior to the date of the 
completion of production of the property, or the incurring of 
significant expenditures for property of specialized design or 
specialized application that is not intended for self-use.
    (ii) Routine purchase order exception. A routine purchase order for 
fungible property is not treated as a contract for purposes of this 
section. An agreement will not be treated as a routine purchase order 
for fungible property, however, if the contractor is required to make 
more than de minimis modifications to the property to tailor it to the 
customer's specific needs, or if at the time the agreement is entered 
into, the customer knows or has reason to know that the contractor 
cannot satisfy the agreement within 30 days out of existing stocks and 
normal production of finished goods.
    (C) Home construction contracts. Section 460(e)(1) provides that 
section 263A applies to a home construction contract unless that 
contract will be completed within two years of the contract commencement 
date and the taxpayer's average annual gross receipts for the three 
preceding taxable years do not exceed $10,000,000. Section 263A applies 
to such a contract even if the contractor is not considered the owner of 
the property produced under the contract under federal income tax 
principles.
    (2) Tangible personal property--(i) General rule. In general, 
section 263A applies to the costs of producing tangible personal 
property, and not to the costs of producing intangible property. For 
example, section 263A applies to the costs manufacturers incur to 
produce goods, but does not apply to the costs financial institutions 
incur to originate loans.

[[Page 413]]

    (ii) Intellectual or creative property. For purposes of determining 
whether a taxpayer producing intellectual or creative property is 
producing tangible personal property or intangible property, the term 
tangible personal property includes films, sound recordings, video 
tapes, books, and other similar property embodying words, ideas, 
concepts, images, or sounds by the creator thereof. Other similar 
property for this purpose generally means intellectual or creative 
property for which, as costs are incurred in producing the property, it 
is intended (or is reasonably likely) that any tangible medium in which 
the property is embodied will be mass distributed by the creator or any 
one or more third parties in a form that is not substantially altered. 
However, any intellectual or creative property that is embodied in a 
tangible medium that is mass distributed merely incident to the 
distribution of a principal product or good of the creator is not other 
similar property for these purposes.
    (A) Intellectual or creative property that is tangible personal 
property. Section 263A applies to tangible personal property defined in 
this paragraph (a)(2) without regard to whether such property is treated 
as tangible or intangible property under other sections of the Internal 
Revenue Code. Thus, for example, section 263A applies to the costs of 
producing a motion picture or researching and writing a book even though 
these assets may be considered intangible for other purposes of the 
Internal Revenue Code. Tangible personal property includes, for example, 
the following:
    (1) Books. The costs of producing and developing books (including 
teaching aids and other literary works) required to be capitalized under 
this section include costs incurred by an author in researching, 
preparing, and writing the book. (However, see section 263A(h), which 
provides an exemption from the capitalization requirements of section 
263A in the case of certain free-lance authors.) In addition, the costs 
of producing and developing books include prepublication expenditures 
incurred by publishers, including payments made to authors (other than 
commissions for sales of books that have already taken place), as well 
as costs incurred by publishers in writing, editing, compiling, 
illustrating, designing, and developing the books. The costs of 
producing a book also include the costs of producing the underlying 
manuscript, copyright, or license. (These costs are distinguished from 
the separately capitalizable costs of printing and binding the tangible 
medium embodying the book (e.g., paper and ink).) See Sec. 1.174-
2(a)(1), which provides that the term research or experimental 
expenditures does not include expenditures incurred for research in 
connection with literary, historical, or similar projects.
    (2) Sound recordings. A sound recording is a work that results from 
the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, regardless 
of the nature of the material objects, such as discs, tapes, or other 
phonorecordings, in which such sounds are embodied.
    (B) Intellectual or creative property that is not tangible personal 
property. Items that are not considered tangible personal property 
within the meaning of section 263A(b) and paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this 
section include:
    (1) Evidences of value. Tangible personal property does not include 
property that is representative or evidence of value, such as stock, 
securities, debt instruments, mortgages, or loans.
    (2) Property provided incident to services. Tangible personal 
property does not include de minimis property provided to a client or 
customer incident to the provision of services, such as wills prepared 
by attorneys, or blueprints prepared by architects. See Sec. 1.263A-
1(b)(11).
    (3) Costs required to be capitalized by producers--(i) In general. 
Except as specifically provided in section 263A(f) with respect to 
interest costs, producers must capitalize direct and indirect costs 
properly allocable to property produced under section 263A, without 
regard to whether those costs are incurred before, during, or after the 
production period (as defined in section 263A(f)(4)(B)).
    (ii) Pre-production costs. If property is held for future 
production, taxpayers must capitalize direct and indirect costs 
allocable to such property (e.g., purchasing, storage, handling, and 
other costs), even though production

[[Page 414]]

has not begun. If property is not held for production, indirect costs 
incurred prior to the beginning of the production period must be 
allocated to the property and capitalized if, at the time the costs are 
incurred, it is reasonably likely that production will occur at some 
future date. Thus, for example, a manufacturer must capitalize the costs 
of storing and handling raw materials before the raw materials are 
committed to production. In addition, a real estate developer must 
capitalize property taxes incurred with respect to property if, at the 
time the taxes are incurred, it is reasonably likely that the property 
will be subsequently developed.
     (iii) Post-production costs. Generally, producers must capitalize 
all indirect costs incurred subsequent to completion of production that 
are properly allocable to the property produced. Thus, for example, 
storage and handling costs incurred while holding the property produced 
for sale after production must be capitalized to the property to the 
extent properly allocable to the property. However, see Sec. 1.263A-3(c) 
for exceptions.
    (4) Practical capacity concept. Notwithstanding any provision to the 
contrary, the use, directly or indirectly, of the practical capacity 
concept is not permitted under section 263A. For purposes of section 
263A, the term practical capacity concept means any concept, method, 
procedure, or formula (such as the practical capacity concept described 
in Sec. 1.471-11(d)(4)) whereunder fixed costs are not capitalized 
because of the relationship between the actual production at the 
taxpayer's production facility and the practical capacity of the 
facility. For purposes of this section, the practical capacity of a 
facility includes either the practical capacity or theoretical capacity 
of the facility, as defined in Sec. 1.471-11(d)(4), or any similar 
determination of productive or operating capacity. The practical 
capacity concept may not be used with respect to any activity to which 
section 263A applies (i.e., production or resale activities). A taxpayer 
shall not be considered to be using the practical capacity concept 
solely because the taxpayer properly does not capitalize costs described 
in Sec. 1.263A-1(e)(3)(iii)(E), relating to certain costs attributable 
to temporarily idle equipment.
    (5) Taxpayers required to capitalize costs under this section. This 
section generally applies to taxpayers that produce property. If a 
taxpayer is engaged in both production activities and resale activities, 
the taxpayer applies the principles of this section as if it read 
production or resale activities, and by applying appropriate principles 
from Sec. 1.263A-3. If a taxpayer is engaged in both production and 
resale activities, the taxpayer may elect the simplified production 
method provided in this section, but generally may not elect the 
simplified resale method discussed in Sec. 1.263A-3(d). If elected, the 
simplified production method must be applied to all eligible property 
produced and all eligible property acquired for resale by the taxpayer.
    (b) Simplified production method--(1) Introduction. This paragraph 
(b) provides a simplified method for determining the additional section 
263A costs properly allocable to ending inventories of property produced 
and other eligible property on hand at the end of the taxable year.
     (2) Eligible property--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided 
in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the simplified production 
method, if elected for any trade or business of a producer, must be used 
for all production and resale activities associated with any of the 
following categories of property to which section 263A applies:
    (A) Inventory property. Stock in trade or other property properly 
includible in the inventory of the taxpayer.
    (B) Non-inventory property held for sale. Non-inventory property 
held by a taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary 
course of the taxpayer's trade or business.
    (C) Certain self-constructed assets. Self-constructed assets 
substantially identical in nature to, and produced in the same manner 
as, inventory property produced by the taxpayer or other property 
produced by the taxpayer and held primarily for sale to customers in the 
ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.

[[Page 415]]

    (D) Self-constructed assets produced on a repetitive basis. Self-
constructed assets produced by the taxpayer on a routine and repetitive 
basis in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's trade or business.
    (ii) Election to exclude self-constructed assets. At the taxpayer's 
election, the simplified production method may be applied within a trade 
or business to only the categories of inventory property and non-
inventory property held for sale described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (A) 
and (B) of this section. Taxpayers electing to exclude the self- 
constructed assets, defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) (C) and (D) of this 
section, from application of the simplified production method must, 
however, allocate additional section 263A costs to such property in 
accordance with Sec. 1.263A-1 (f).
    (3) Simplified production method without historic absorption ratio 
election--(i) General allocation formula--(A) In general. Except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, the 
additional section 263A costs allocable to eligible property remaining 
on hand at the close of the taxable year under the simplified production 
method are computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.004

    (B) Effect of allocation. The absorption ratio generally is 
multiplied by the section 471 costs remaining in ending inventory or 
otherwise on hand at the end of each taxable year in which the 
simplified production method is applied. The resulting product is the 
additional section 263A costs that are added to the taxpayer's ending 
section 471 costs to determine the section 263A costs that are 
capitalized. See, however, paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section for 
special rules applicable to LIFO taxpayers. Except as otherwise provided 
in this section or in Sec. 1.263A-1 or 1.263A-3, additional section 263A 
costs that are allocated to inventories on hand at the close of the 
taxable year under the simplified production method of this paragraph 
(b) are treated as inventory costs for all purposes of the Internal 
Revenue Code.
    (ii) Definitions--(A) Absorption ratio. Under the simplified 
production method, the absorption ratio is determined as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.005

    (1) Additional section 263A costs incurred during the taxable year. 
Additional section 263A costs incurred during the taxable year are 
defined as the additional section 263A costs described in Sec. 1.263A-
1(d)(3) that a taxpayer incurs during its current taxable year.
    (2) Section 471 costs incurred during the taxable year. Section 471 
costs incurred during the taxable year are defined as the section 471 
costs described in Sec. 1.263A-1(d)(2) that a taxpayer incurs during its 
current taxable year.
    (B) Section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end. Section 471 
costs remaining on hand at year end means the section 471 costs, as 
defined in Sec. 1.263A-1(d)(2), that a taxpayer incurs during its 
current taxable year which remain in its ending inventory or are 
otherwise on hand at year end. For LIFO inventories of a taxpayer, the 
section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end means the increment, if 
any, for the current year stated in terms of section 471 costs. See 
paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section.
    (iii) LIFO taxpayers electing the simplified production method--(A) 
In general. Under the simplified production method, a taxpayer using a 
LIFO method must calculate a particular year's index (e.g., under 
Sec. 1.472-8(e)) without

[[Page 416]]

regard to its additional section 263A costs. Similarly, a taxpayer that 
adjusts current-year costs by applicable indexes to determine whether 
there has been an inventory increment or decrement in the current year 
for a particular LIFO pool must disregard the additional section 263A 
costs in making that determination.
    (B) LIFO increment. If the taxpayer determines there has been an 
inventory increment, the taxpayer must state the amount of the increment 
in current-year dollars (stated in terms of section 471 costs). The 
taxpayer then multiplies this amount by the absorption ratio. The 
resulting product is the additional section 263A costs that must be 
added to the taxpayer's increment for the year stated in terms of 
section 471 costs.
    (C) LIFO decrement. If the taxpayer determines there has been an 
inventory decrement, the taxpayer must state the amount of the decrement 
in dollars applicable to the particular year for which the LIFO layer 
has been invaded. The additional section 263A costs incurred in prior 
years that are applicable to the decrement are charged to cost of goods 
sold. The additional section 263A costs that are applicable to the 
decrement are determined by multiplying the additional section 263A 
costs allocated to the layer of the pool in which the decrement occurred 
by the ratio of the decrement (excluding additional section 263A costs) 
to the section 471 costs in the layer of that pool.
    (iv) De minimis rule for producers with total indirect costs of 
$200,000 or less--(A) In general. If a producer using the simplified 
production method incurs $200,000 or less of total indirect costs in a 
taxable year, the additional section 263A costs allocable to eligible 
property remaining on hand at the close of the taxable year are deemed 
to be zero. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (b)(3)(iv), taxpayers 
are permitted to exclude any category of indirect costs (listed in 
Sec. 1.263A-1(e)(3)(iii)) that is not required to be capitalized (e.g., 
selling and distribution costs) in determining total indirect costs.
    (B) Related party and aggregation rules. In determining whether the 
producer incurs $200,000 or less of total indirect costs in a taxable 
year, the related party and aggregation rules of Sec. 1.263A-3(b)(3) are 
applied by substituting total indirect costs for gross receipts wherever 
gross receipts appears.
    (v) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) are illustrated 
by the following examples.

    Example 1--FIFO inventory method. (i) Taxpayer J uses the FIFO 
method of accounting for inventories. J's beginning inventory for 1994 
(all of which is sold during 1994) is $2,500,000 (consisting of 
$2,000,000 of section 471 costs and $500,000 of additional section 263A 
costs). During 1994, J incurs $10,000,000 of section 471 costs and 
$1,000,000 of additional section 263A costs. J's additional section 263A 
costs include capitalizable mixed service costs computed under the 
simplified service cost method as well as other allocable costs. J's 
section 471 costs remaining in ending inventory at the end of 1994 are 
$3,000,000. J computes its absorption ratio for 1994, as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.006

    (ii) Under the simplified production method, J determines the 
additional section 263A costs allocable to its ending inventory by 
multiplying the absorption ratio by the section 471 costs remaining in 
its ending inventory:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.007


[[Page 417]]


    (iii) J adds this $300,000 to the $3,000,000 of section 471 costs 
remaining in its ending inventory to calculate its total ending 
inventory of $3,300,000. The balance of J's additional section 263A 
costs incurred during 1994, $700,000, ($1,000,000 less $300,000) is 
taken into account in 1994 as part of J's cost of goods sold.
    Example 2--LIFO inventory method. (i) Taxpayer K uses a dollar-value 
LIFO inventory method. K's beginning inventory for 1994 is $2,500,000 
(consisting of $2,000,000 of section 471 costs and $500,000 of 
additional section 263A costs). During 1994, K incurs $10,000,000 of 
section 471 costs and $1,000,000 of additional section 263A costs. K's 
1994 LIFO increment is $1,000,000 ($3,000,000 of section 471 costs in 
ending inventory less $2,000,000 of section 471 costs in beginning 
inventory).
    (ii) To determine the additional section 263A costs allocable to its 
ending inventory, K multiplies the 10% absorption ratio ($1,000,000 of 
additional section 263A costs divided by $10,000,000 of section 471 
costs) by the $1,000,000 LIFO increment. Thus, K's additional section 
263A costs allocable to its ending inventory are $100,000 ($1,000,000 
multiplied by 10%). This $100,000 is added to the $1,000,000 to 
determine a total 1994 LIFO increment of $1,100,000. K's ending 
inventory is $3,600,000 (its beginning inventory of $2,500,000 plus the 
$1,100,000 increment). The balance of K's additional section 263A costs 
incurred during 1994, $900,000 ($1,000,000 less $100,000), is taken into 
account in 1994 as part of K's cost of goods sold.
    (iii) In 1995, K sells one-half of the inventory in its 1994 LIFO 
increment. K must include in its cost of goods sold for 1995 the amount 
of additional section 263A costs relating to this inventory, $50,000 
(one-half of the tional section 263A costs capitalized in 1994 ending 
inventory, or $100,000).
    Example 3--LIFO pools. (i) Taxpayer U begins its business in 1994 
and adopts the LIFO inventory method. During 1994, L incurs $10,000 of 
section 471 costs and $1,000 of additional section 263A costs. At the 
end of 1994, L's ending inventory includes $3,000 of section 471 costs 
contained in three LIFO pools (X, Y, and Z) as shown below. Under the 
simplified production method, L computes its absorption ratio and 
inventory for 1994 as follows:

    1994 ending inventory.............   $3,300   $1,760    $660    $880
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) During 1995, L incurs $2,000 of section 471 costs as shown 
below and $400 of additional section 263A costs. Moreover, L sells goods 
from pools X, Y, and Z having a total cost of $1,000. L computes its 
absorption ratio and inventory for 1995:

    (iii) In 1995, L experiences a $200 decrement in pool Z. Thus, L 
must charge the additional section 263A costs incurred in prior years 
applicable to the decrement to 1995's cost of goods sold. To do so, L 
determines a ratio by dividing the decrement by the section 471 costs in 
the 1994 layer ($200 divided by $800, or 25%). L then multiplies this 
ratio (25%) by the additional section 263A costs in the 1994 layer ($80) 
to determine the additional section 263A costs applicable to the 
decrement ($20). Therefore, $20 is taken into account by L in 1995 as 
part of its cost of goods sold ($80 multiplied by 25%).

    (4) Simplified production method with historic absorption ratio 
election--(i) In general. This paragraph (b)(4) generally permits 
producers using the simplified production method to elect a historic 
absorption ratio in determining additional section 263A costs allocable 
to eligible property remaining on hand at the close of their taxable 
years. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section, a 
taxpayer may only make a historic absorption ratio election if it has 
used the simplified production method for three or more consecutive 
taxable years immediately prior to the year of election and has 
capitalized additional section 263A costs using an actual absorption 
ratio (as defined under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section) for its 
three most recent consecutive taxable years. This method is not 
available to a taxpayer that is deemed to have zero additional section 
263A costs under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section. The historic 
absorption ratio is used in lieu of an actual absorption ratio computed 
under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section and is based on costs 
capitalized by a taxpayer during its test period. If elected, the 
historic absorption ratio must be used for each taxable year within the 
qualifying period described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (ii) Operating rules and definitions--(A) Historic absorption ratio. 
(1) The historic absorption ratio is equal to the following ratio:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.010

    (2) Additional section 263A costs incurred during the test period 
are defined as the additional section 263A costs described in 
Sec. 1.263A-1(d)(3) that the taxpayer incurs during the test period 
described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (3) Section 471 costs incurred during the test period mean the 
section 471 costs described in Sec. 1.263A-1(d)(2) that the taxpayer 
incurs during the test period described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of 
this section.
    (B) Test period--(1) In general. The test period is generally the 
three taxable-year period immediately prior to the taxable year that the 
historic absorption ratio is elected.
    (2) Updated test period. The test period begins again with the 
beginning of the first taxable year after the close of a qualifying 
period. This new test period, the updated test period, is the three 
taxable-year period beginning with the first taxable year after the 
close of the qualifying period as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of 
this section.
    (C) Qualifying period--(1) In general. A qualifying period includes 
each of the first five taxable years beginning with the first taxable 
year after a test period (or an updated test period).

[[Page 419]]

    (2) Extension of qualifying period. In the first taxable year 
following the close of each qualifying period, (e.g., the sixth taxable 
year following the test period), the taxpayer must compute the actual 
absorption ratio under the simplified production method. If the actual 
absorption ratio computed for this taxable year (the recomputation year) 
is within one-half of one percentage point (plus or minus) of the 
historic absorption ratio used in determining capitalizable costs for 
the qualifying period (i.e., the previous five taxable years), the 
qualifying period is extended to include the recomputation year and the 
following five taxable years, and the taxpayer must continue to use the 
historic absorption ratio throughout the extended qualifying period. If, 
however, the actual absorption ratio computed for the recomputation year 
is not within one-half of one percentage point (plus or minus) of the 
historic absorption ratio, the taxpayer must use actual absorption 
ratios beginning with the recomputation year under the simplified 
production method and throughout the updated test period. The taxpayer 
must resume using the historic absorption ratio (determined with 
reference to the updated test period) in the third taxable year 
following the recomputation year.
    (iii) Method of accounting--(A) Adoption and use. The election to 
use the historic absorption ratio is a method of accounting. A taxpayer 
using the simplified production method may elect the historic absorption 
ratio in any taxable year if permitted under this paragraph (b)(4), 
provided the taxpayer has not obtained the Commissioner's consent to 
revoke the historic absorption ratio election within its prior six 
taxable years. The election is to be effected on a cut-off basis, and 
thus, no adjustment under section 481(a) is required or permitted. The 
use of a historic absorption ratio has no effect on other methods of 
accounting adopted by the taxpayer and used in conjunction with the 
simplified production method in determining its section 263A costs. 
Accordingly, in computing its actual absorption ratios, the taxpayer 
must use the same methods of accounting used in computing its historic 
absorption ratio during its most recent test period unless the taxpayer 
obtains the consent of the Commissioner. Finally, for purposes of this 
paragraph (b)(4)(iii), the recomputation of the historic absorption 
ratio during an updated test period and the change from a historic 
absorption ratio to an actual absorption ratio by reason of the 
requirements of this paragraph (b)(4) are not considered changes in 
methods of accounting under section 446(e) and, thus, do not require the 
consent of the Commissioner or any adjustments under section 481(a).
    (B) Revocation of election. A taxpayer may only revoke its election 
to use the historic absorption ratio with the consent of the 
Commissioner in a manner prescribed under section 446(e) and the 
regulations thereunder. Consent to the change for any taxable year that 
is included in the qualifying period (or an extended qualifying period) 
will be granted only upon a showing of unusual circumstances.
    (iv) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements--(A) Reporting. A 
taxpayer making an election under this paragraph (b)(4) must attach a 
statement to its federal income tax return for the taxable year in which 
the election is made showing the actual absorption ratios determined 
under the simplified production method during its first test period. 
This statement must disclose the historic absorption ratio to be used by 
the taxpayer during its qualifying period. A similar statement must be 
attached to the federal income tax return for the first taxable year 
within any subsequent qualifying period (i.e., after an updated test 
period).
    (B) Recordkeeping. A taxpayer must maintain all appropriate records 
and details supporting the historic absorption ratio until the 
expiration of the statute of limitations for the last year for which the 
taxpayer applied the particular historic absorption ratio in determining 
additional section 263A costs capitalized to eligible property.
    (v) Transition rules. Taxpayers will be permitted to elect a 
historic absorption ratio in their first, second, or third taxable year 
beginning after December 31, 1993, under such terms and conditions as 
may be prescribed by the Commissioner. Taxpayers are eligible to

[[Page 420]]

make an election under these transition rules whether or not they 
previously used the simplified production method. A taxpayer making such 
an election must recompute (or compute) its additional section 263A 
costs, and thus, its historic absorption ratio for its first test period 
as if the rules prescribed in this section and Secs. 1.263A-1 and 
1.263A-3 had applied throughout the test period.
    (vi) Example. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(4) are 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. (i) Taxpayer M uses the FIFO method of accounting for 
inventories and for 1994 elects to use the historic absorption ratio 
with the simplified production method. After recomputing its additional 
section 263A costs in accordance with the transition rules of paragraph 
(b)(4)(v) of this section, M identifies the following costs incurred 
during the test period:
1991:
    Add'l section 263A costs--$100
    Section 471 costs--$3,000
1992:
    Add'l section 263A costs--$200
    Section 471 costs--$4,000
1993:
    Add'l section 263A costs--$300
    Section 471 costs--$5,000
    (ii) Therefore, M computes a 5% historic absorption ratio determined 
as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.011

    (iii) In 1994, M incurs $10,000 of section 471 costs of which $3,000 
remain in inventory at the end of the year. Under the simplified 
production method using a historic absorption ratio, M determines the 
additional section 263A costs allocable to its ending inventory by 
multiplying its historic absorption ratio (5%) by the section 471 costs 
remaining in its ending inventory as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.012

    (iv) To determine its ending inventory under section 263A, M adds 
the additional section 263A costs allocable to ending inventory to its 
section 471 costs remaining in ending inventory ($3,150=$150+$3,000). 
The balance of M's additional section 263A costs incurred during 1994 is 
taken into account in 1994 as part of M's cost of goods sold.
    (v) M's qualifying period ends with the close of its 1998 taxable 
year. Therefore, 1999 is a recomputation year in which M must compute 
its actual absorption ratio. M determines its actual absorption ratio 
for 1999 to be 5.25% and compares that ratio to its historic absorption 
ratio (5.0%). Therefore, M must continue to use its historic absorption 
ratio of 5.0% throughout an extended qualifying period, 1999 through 
2004 (the recomputation year and the following five taxable years).
    (vi) If, instead, M's actual absorption ratio for 1999 were not 
between 4.5% and 5.5%, M's qualifying period would end and M would be 
required to compute a new historic absorption ratio with reference to an 
updated test period of 1999, 2000, and 2001. Once M's historic 
absorption ratio is determined for the updated test period, it would be 
used for a new qualifying period beginning in 2002.

    (c) Additional simplified methods for producers. The Commissioner 
may prescribe additional elective simplified methods by revenue ruling 
or revenue procedure.
    (d) Cross reference. See Sec. 1.6001-1(a) regarding the duty of 
taxpayers to keep such records as are sufficient to establish the amount 
of gross income, deductions, etc.

<R05>
Sec. 1.263A-3  Rules relating to property acquired for resale.

    (a) Capitalization rules for property acquired for resale--(1) In 
general. Section 263A applies to real property and personal property 
described in section 1221(1) acquired for resale by a retailer,

[[Page 421]]

wholesaler, or other taxpayer (reseller). However, section 263A does not 
apply to personal property described in section 1221(1) acquired for 
resale by a reseller whose average annual gross receipts for the three 
previous taxable years do not exceed $10,000,000 (small reseller). For 
this purpose, personal property includes both tangible and intangible 
property. Property acquired for resale includes stock in trade of the 
taxpayer or other property which is includible in the taxpayer's 
inventory if on hand at the close of the taxable year, and property held 
by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course 
of the taxpayer's trade or business. See, however, Sec. 1.263A-1(b)(11) 
for an exception for certain de minimis property provided to customers 
incident to the provision of services.
    (2) Resellers with production activities--(i) In general. Generally, 
a taxpayer must capitalize all direct costs and certain indirect costs 
associated with real property and tangible personal property it 
produces. See Sec. 1.263A-2(a). Thus, except as provided in paragraphs 
(a)(2)(ii) and (3) of this section, a reseller, including a small 
reseller, that also produces property must capitalize the additional 
section 263A costs associated with any property it produces.
    (ii) Exception for small resellers. Under this paragraph (a)(2)(ii), 
a small reseller is not required to capitalize additional section 263A 
costs associated with any personal property that is produced incident to 
its resale activities, provided the production activities are de minimis 
(within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section).
    (iii) De minimis production activities--(A) In general. (1) In 
determining whether a taxpayer's production activities are de minimis, 
all facts and circumstances must be considered. For example, the 
taxpayer must consider the volume of the production activities in its 
trade or business. Production activities are presumed de minimis if--
    (i) The gross receipts from the sale of the property produced by the 
reseller are less than 10 percent of the total gross receipts of the 
trade or business; and
    (ii) The labor costs allocable to the trade or business' production 
activities are less than 10 percent of the reseller's total labor costs 
allocable to its trade or business.
    (2) For purposes of this de minimis presumption, gross receipts has 
the same definition as provided in paragraph (b) of this section except 
that gross receipts are measured at the trade-or-business level rather 
than at the single-employer level.
    (B) Example. The application of this paragraph (a)(2) may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example--Small reseller with de minimis production activities. 
Taxpayer N is a small reseller in the retail grocery business whose 
average annual gross receipts for the three previous taxable years are 
less than $10,000,000. N's grocery stores typically contain bakeries 
where customers may purchase baked goods produced by N. N's gross 
receipts from its bakeries are 5% of the entire grocery business. N's 
labor costs from its bakeries are 3% of its total labor costs allocable 
to the entire grocery business. Because both ratios are less than 10%, 
N's production activities are de minimis. Further, because N's 
production activities are incident to its resale activities, N is not 
required to capitalize any additional section 263A costs associated with 
its produced property.

    (3) Resellers with property produced under contract. Generally, 
property produced for a taxpayer under a contract (within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.263A-2(a)(1)(ii)(B)(2)) is treated as property produced by the 
taxpayer. See Sec. 1.263A-2(a)(1)(ii)(B). However, a small reseller is 
not required to capitalize additional section 263A costs to personal 
property produced for it under contract with an unrelated person if the 
contract is entered into incident to the resale activities of the small 
reseller and the property is sold to its customers. For purposes of this 
paragraph, persons are related if they are described in section 267(b) 
or 707(b).
    (4) Use of the simplified resale method--(i) In general. Except as 
provided in paragraphs (a)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section, a taxpayer 
may elect the simplified production method (as described in Sec. 1.263A-
2(b)) but may not elect the simplified resale method (as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section) if the taxpayer is engaged in both 
production and resale activities with respect to the items of eligible 
property listed in Sec. 1.263A-2(b)(2).

[[Page 422]]

    (ii) Resellers with de minimis production activities. A reseller 
otherwise permitted to use the simplified resale method in paragraph (d) 
of this section may use the simplified resale method if its production 
activities with respect to the items of eligible property listed in 
Sec. 1.263A-2(b)(2) are de minimis (within the meaning of paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section) and incident to its resale of personal 
property described in section 1221(1).
    (iii) Resellers with property produced under a contract. A reseller 
otherwise permitted to use the simplified resale method in paragraph (d) 
of this section may use the simplified resale method even though it has 
personal property produced for it (e.g., private label goods) under a 
contract with an unrelated person if the contract is entered into 
incident to its resale activities and the property is sold to its 
customers. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(4)(iii), persons are 
related if they are described in section 267(b) or 707(b).
    (iv) Application of simplified resale method. A taxpayer that uses 
the simplified resale method and has de minimis production activities 
incident to its resale activities or property produced under contract 
must capitalize all costs allocable to eligible property produced using 
the simplified resale method.
    (b) Gross receipts exception for small resellers--(1) In general. 
Section 263A does not apply to any personal property acquired for resale 
during any taxable year if the taxpayer's (or its predecessors') average 
annual gross receipts for the three previous taxable years (test period) 
do not exceed $10,000,000. However, taxpayers that acquire real property 
for resale are subject to section 263A with respect to real property 
regardless of their gross receipts. See section 263A(b)(2)(B).
    (i) Test period for new taxpayers. For purposes of applying this 
exception, if a taxpayer has been in existence for less than three 
taxable years, the taxpayer determines its average annual gross receipts 
for the number of taxable years (including short taxable years) that the 
taxpayer (or its predecessor) has been in existence.
    (ii) Treatment of short taxable year. In the case of a short taxable 
year, the taxpayer's gross receipts are annualized by--
    (A) Multiplying the gross receipts of the short taxable year by 12; 
and
    (B) Dividing the product determined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of 
this section by the number of months in the short taxable year.
    (2) Definition of gross receipts--(i) In general. Gross receipts are 
the total amount, as determined under the taxpayer's method of 
accounting, derived from all of the taxpayer's trades or businesses 
(e.g., revenues derived from the sale of inventory before reduction for 
cost of goods sold).
    (ii) Amounts excluded. For purposes of this paragraph (b), gross 
receipts do not include amounts representing--
    (A) Returns or allowances;
    (B) Interest, dividends, rents, royalties, or annuities, not derived 
in the ordinary course of a trade or business;
    (C) Receipts from the sale or exchange of capital assets, as defined 
in section 1221;
    (D) Repayments of loans or similar instruments (e.g., a repayment of 
the principal amount of a loan held by a commercial lender);
    (E) Receipts from a sale or exchange not in the ordinary course of 
business, such as the sale of an entire trade or business or the sale of 
property used in a trade or business as defined under section 1221(2); 
and
    (F) Receipts from any activity other than a trade or business or an 
activity engaged in for profit.
    (3) Aggregation of gross receipts--(i) In general. In determining 
gross receipts, all persons treated as a single employer under section 
52(a) or (b), section 414(m), or any regulation prescribed under section 
414 (or persons that would be treated as a single employer under any of 
these provisions if they had employees) shall be treated as one 
taxpayer. The gross receipts of a single employer (or the group) are 
determined by aggregating the gross receipts of all persons (or the 
members) of the group, excluding any gross receipts attributable to 
transactions occurring between group members.
    (ii) Single employer defined. A controlled group, which is treated 
as a single employer under section 52(a), includes members of a 
controlled group

[[Page 423]]

within the meaning of section 1563(a), regardless of whether such 
members would be treated as component members of such group under 
section 1563(b). (See Sec. 1.52-1(c).) Thus, for example, the gross 
receipts of a franchised corporation that is treated as an excluded 
member for purposes of section 1563(b) are included in the single 
employer's gross receipts under this aggregation rule, if such 
corporation and the taxpayer were members of the same controlled group 
under section 1563(a).
    (iii) Gross receipts of a single employer. The gross receipts of a 
single employer for the test period include the gross receipts of all 
group members (or their predecessors) that are members of the group as 
of the first day of the taxable year in issue, regardless of whether 
such persons were members of the group for any of the three preceding 
taxable years. The gross receipts of the single employer for the test 
period do not, however, include the gross receipts of any member that 
was a group member (including any predecessor) for any or all of the 
three preceding taxable years, and is no longer a group member as of the 
first day of the taxable year in issue. Any group member that has a 
taxable year of less than 12 months must annualize its gross receipts in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (iv) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b)(3) are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Subsidiary acquired during the taxable year. A parent 
corporation, (P), has owned 100% of the stock of another corporation, 
(S1), continually since 1989. P and S1 are calendar year taxpayers. S1 
acquires property for resale. On January 1, 1994, P acquires 100% of the 
stock of another calendar year corporation (S2). In determining whether 
S1's resale activities are subject to the provisions of section 263A for 
1994, the gross receipts of P, S1, and S2 for 1991, 1992, and 1993 are 
aggregated, excluding the gross receipts, if any, attributable to 
transactions occurring between the three corporations.
    Example 2. Subsidiary sold during the taxable year. Since 1989, a 
parent corporation, (P), has continually owned 100% of the stock of two 
other corporations, (S1) and (S2). The three corporations are calendar 
year taxpayers. S1 acquires property for resale. On December 31, 1993, P 
sells all of its stock in S2. In determining whether S1's resale 
activities are subject to the provisions of section 263A for 1994, only 
the gross receipts of P and S1 for 1991, 1992, and 1993 must be 
aggregated, excluding the gross receipts, if any, attributable to 
transactions occurring between the two corporations.

    (c) Purchasing, handling, and storage costs--(1) In general. 
Generally, Sec. 1.263A-1(e) describes the types of costs that must be 
capitalized by taxpayers. Resellers must capitalize the acquisition cost 
of property acquired for resale, as well as indirect costs described in 
Sec. 1.263A-1(e)(3), which are properly allocable to property acquired 
for resale. The indirect costs most often incurred by resellers are 
purchasing, handling, and storage costs. This paragraph (c) provides 
additional guidance regarding each of these categories of costs. As 
provided in Sec. 1.263A-1(e), this paragraph (c) also applies to 
producers incurring purchasing, handling, and storage costs.
    (2) Costs attributable to purchasing, handling, and storage. The 
costs attributable to purchasing, handling, and storage activities 
generally consist of direct and indirect labor costs (including the 
costs of pension plans and other fringe benefits); occupancy expenses 
including rent, depreciation, insurance, security, taxes, utilities and 
maintenance; materials and supplies; rent, maintenance, depreciation, 
and insurance of vehicles and equipment; tools; telephone; travel; and 
the general and administrative costs that directly benefit or are 
incurred by reason of the taxpayer's activities.
    (3) Purchasing costs--(i) In general. Purchasing costs are costs 
associated with operating a purchasing department or office within a 
trade or business, including personnel costs (e.g., of buyers, assistant 
buyers, and clerical workers), relating to--
    (A) The selection of merchandise;
    (B) The maintenance of stock assortment and volume;
    (C) The placement of purchase orders;
    (D) The establishment and maintenance of vendor contacts; and
    (E) The comparison and testing of merchandise.
    (ii) Determination of whether personnel are engaged in purchasing 
activities. The determination of whether a person is engaged in 
purchasing activities is

[[Page 424]]

based upon the activities performed by that person and not upon the 
person's title or job classification. Thus, for example, although an 
employee's job function may be described in such a way as to indicate 
activities outside the area of purchasing (e.g., a marketing 
representative), such activities must be analyzed on the basis of the 
activities performed by that employee. If a person performs both 
purchasing and non-purchasing activities, the taxpayer must reasonably 
allocate the person's labor costs between these activities. For example, 
a reasonable allocation is one based on the amount of time the person 
spends on each activity.
    (A) \1/3\-\2/3\ rule for allocating labor costs. A taxpayer may 
elect the \1/3\-\2/3\ rule for allocating labor costs of persons 
performing both purchasing and non-purchasing activities. If elected, 
the taxpayer must allocate the labor costs of all such persons using the 
\1/3\-\2/3\ rule. Under this rule--
    (1) If less than one-third of a person's activities are related to 
purchasing, none of that person's labor costs are allocated to 
purchasing;
    (2) If more than two-thirds of a person's activities are related to 
purchasing, all of that person's labor costs are allocated to 
purchasing; and
    (3) In all other cases, the taxpayer must reasonably allocate labor 
costs between purchasing and non-purchasing activities.
    (B) Example. The application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. Taxpayer O is a reseller that employs three persons, A, B, 
and C, who perform both purchasing and non- purchasing activities. These 
persons spend the following time performing purchasing activities: A-25 
%; B-70 %; and C-50 %. Under the \1/3\-\2/3\ rule, Taxpayer O treats 
none of A's labor costs as purchasing costs, all of B's labor costs as 
purchasing costs, and Taxpayer O allocates 50 % of C's labor costs as 
purchasing costs.

    (4) Handling costs--(i) In general. Handling costs include costs 
attributable to processing, assembling, repackaging, transporting, and 
other similar activities with respect to property acquired for resale, 
provided the activities do not come within the meaning of the term 
produce as defined in Sec. 1.263A-2(a)(1). Handling costs are generally 
required to be capitalized under section 263A. Under this paragraph 
(c)(4)(i), however, handling costs incurred at a retail sales facility 
(as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) with respect to 
property sold to retail customers at the facility are not required to be 
capitalized. Thus, for example, handling costs incurred at a retail 
sales facility to unload, unpack, mark, and tag goods sold to retail 
customers at the facility are not required to be capitalized. In 
addition, handling costs incurred at a dual-function storage facility 
(as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(G) of this section) with respect to 
property sold to customers from the facility are not required to be 
capitalized to the extent that the costs are incurred with respect to 
property sold in on-site sales. Handling costs attributable to property 
sold to customers from a dual-function storage facility in on-site sales 
are determined by applying the ratio in paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of this 
section.
    (ii) Processing costs. Processing costs are the costs a reseller 
incurs in making minor changes or alterations to the nature or form of a 
product acquired for resale. Minor changes to a product include, for 
example, monogramming a sweater, altering a pair of pants, and other 
similar activities.
    (iii) Assembling costs. Generally, assembling costs are costs 
associated with incidental activities that are necessary in readying 
property for resale (e.g., attaching wheels and handlebars to a bicycle 
acquired for resale).
    (iv) Repackaging costs. Repackaging costs are the costs a taxpayer 
incurs to package property for sale to its customers.
    (v) Transportation costs. Generally, transportation costs are the 
costs a taxpayer incurs moving or shipping property acquired for resale. 
These costs include the cost of dispatching trucks; loading and 
unloading shipments; and sorting, tagging, and marking property. 
Transportation costs may consist of depreciation on trucks and equipment 
and the costs of fuel, insurance, labor, and similar costs. Generally, 
transportation costs required to

[[Page 425]]

be capitalized include costs incurred in transporting property--
    (A) From the vendor to the taxpayer;
    (B) From one of the taxpayer's storage facilities to another of its 
storage facilities;
    (C) From the taxpayer's storage facility to its retail sales 
facility;
    (D) From the taxpayer's retail sales facility to its storage 
facility; and
    (E) From one of the taxpayer's retail sales facilities to another of 
its retail sales facilities.
    (vi) Costs not required to be capitalized as handling costs--(A) 
Distribution costs--(1) In general. Distribution costs are not required 
to be capitalized. Distribution costs are any transportation costs 
incurred outside a storage facility in delivering goods to a customer. 
For this purpose, any costs incurred on a loading dock are treated as 
incurred outside a storage facility.
    (2) Costs incurred in transporting goods to a related person. 
Distribution costs do not include costs incurred by a taxpayer in 
delivering goods to a related person. Thus, for example, when a taxpayer 
sells goods to a related person, the costs of transporting the goods are 
included in determining the basis of the goods that are sold, and hence 
in determining the resulting gain or loss from the sale, for all 
purposes of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations thereunder. 
See, e.g., sections 267, 707, and 1502. For purposes of this provision, 
persons are related if they are described in section 267(b) or section 
707(b).
    (B) Delivery of custom-ordered items. Generally, costs incurred in 
transporting goods from a taxpayer's storage facility to its retail 
sales facility must be capitalized. However, costs incurred outside a 
storage facility in delivering custom-ordered items to a retail sales 
facility are not required to be capitalized. For this purpose, any costs 
incurred on a loading dock are treated as incurred outside a storage 
facility. Delivery of custom-ordered items occurs when a taxpayer can 
demonstrate that a delivery to the taxpayer's retail sales facility is 
made to fill an identifiable order of a particular customer (placed by 
the customer before the delivery of the goods occurs) for the particular 
goods in question. Factors that may demonstrate the existence of a 
specific, identifiable delivery include the following--
    (1) The customer has paid for the item in advance of the delivery;
    (2) The customer has submitted a written order for the item;
    (3) The item is not normally available at the retail sales facility 
for on-site customer purchases; and
    (4) The item will be returned to the storage facility (and not held 
for sale at the retail sales facility) if the customer cancels an order.
    (C) Pick and pack costs--(1) In general. Generally, handling costs 
incurred inside a storage or warehousing facility must be capitalized. 
However, costs attributable to pick and pack activities inside a storage 
or warehousing facility are not required to be capitalized. Pick and 
pack activities are activities undertaken in preparation for imminent 
shipment to a particular customer after the customer has ordered the 
specific goods in question. Examples of pick and pack activities 
include:
    (i) Moving specific goods from a storage location in preparation for 
shipment to the customer;
    (ii) Packing or repacking those goods for shipment to the customer; 
and
    (iii) Staging those goods for shipment to the customer.
    (2) Activities that are not pick and pack activities. Pick and pack 
activities do not include:
    (i) Unloading goods that are received for storage;
    (ii) Checking the quantity and quality of goods received;
    (iii) Comparing the quantity of goods received to the amounts 
ordered and preparing the receiving documents;
    (iv) Moving the goods to their storage location, e.g., bins, racks, 
containers, etc.; and
    (v) Storing the goods.
    (3) Costs not attributable to pick and pack activities. Occupancy 
costs, such as rent, depreciation, insurance, security, taxes, 
utilities, and maintenance costs properly allocable to the storage or 
warehousing facility, are not costs attributable to pick and pack 
activities.
    (5) Storage costs--(i) In general. Generally, storage costs are 
capitalized under section 263A to the extent they are attributable to 
the operation of an

[[Page 426]]

off-site storage or warehousing facility (an off-site storage facility). 
However, storage costs attributable to the operation of an on-site 
storage facility (as defined in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section) 
are not required to be capitalized under section 263A. Storage costs 
attributable to a dual-function storage facility (as defined in 
paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(G) of this section) must be capitalized to the 
extent that the facility's costs are allocable to off-site storage.
    (ii) Definitions--(A) On-site storage facility. An on-site storage 
facility is defined as a storage or warehousing facility that is 
physically attached to, and an integral part of, a retail sales 
facility.
    (B) Retail sales facility. (1) A retail sales facility is defined as 
a facility where a taxpayer sells merchandise exclusively to retail 
customers in on-site sales. For this purpose, a retail sales facility 
includes those portions of any specific retail site--
    (i) Which are customarily associated with and are an integral part 
of the operations of that retail site;
    (ii) Which are generally open each business day exclusively to 
retail customers;
    (iii) On or in which retail customers normally and routinely shop to 
select specific items of merchandise; and
    (iv) Which are adjacent to or in immediate proximity to other 
portions of the specific retail site.
    (2) Thus, for example, two lots of an automobile dealership 
physically separated by an alley or an access road would generally be 
considered one retail sales facility, provided customers routinely shop 
on both of the lots to select the specific automobiles that they wish to 
acquire.
    (C) An integral part of a retail sales facility. A storage facility 
is considered an integral part of a retail sales facility when the 
storage facility is an essential and indispensable part of the retail 
sales facility. For example, if the storage facility is used exclusively 
for filling orders or completing sales at the retail sales facility, the 
storage facility is an integral part of the retail sales facility.
    (D) On-site sales. On-site sales are defined as sales made to retail 
customers physically present at a facility. For example, mail order and 
catalog sales are made to customers not physically present at the 
facility, and thus, are not on-site sales.
    (E) Retail customer--(1) In general. A retail customer is defined as 
the final purchaser of the merchandise. A retail customer does not 
include a person who resells the merchandise to others, such as a 
contractor or manufacturer that incorporates the merchandise into 
another product for sale to customers.
    (2) Certain non-retail customers treated as retail customers. For 
purposes of this section, a non-retail customer is treated as a retail 
customer with respect to a particular facility if the following 
requirements are satisfied--
    (i) The non-retail customer purchases goods under the same terms and 
conditions as are available to retail customers (e.g., no special 
discounts);
    (ii) The non-retail customer purchases goods in the same manner as a 
retail customer (e.g., the non-retail customer may not place orders in 
advance and must come to the facility to examine and select goods);
    (iii) Retail customers shop at the facility on a routine basis 
(i.e., on most business days), and no special days or hours are reserved 
for non-retail customers; and
    (iv) More than 50 percent of the gross sales of the facility are 
made to retail customers.
    (F) Off-site storage facility. An off-site storage facility is 
defined as a storage facility that is not an on-site storage facility.
    (G) Dual-function storage facility. A dual-function storage facility 
is defined as a storage facility that serves as both an off-site storage 
facility and an on-site storage facility. For example, a dual-function 
storage facility would include a regional warehouse that serves the 
taxpayer's separate retail sales outlets and also contains a sales 
outlet therein. A dual-function storage facility also includes any 
facility where sales are made to retail customers in on-site sales and 
to--
    (1) Retail customers in sales that are not on-site sales; or
    (2) Other customers.
    (iii) Treatment of storage costs incurred at a dual-function storage 
facility--(A) In

[[Page 427]]

general. Storage costs associated with a dual-function storage facility 
must be allocated between the off-site storage function and the on-site 
storage function. To the extent that the dual-function storage 
facility's storage costs are allocable to the off-site storage function, 
they must be capitalized. To the extent that the dual-function storage 
facility's storage costs are allocable to the on-site storage function, 
they are not required to be capitalized.
    (B) Dual-function storage facility allocation ratio--(1) In general. 
Storage costs associated with a dual-function storage facility must be 
allocated between the off-site storage function and the on-site storage 
function using the ratio of--
    (i) Gross on-site sales of the facility (i.e., gross sales of the 
facility made to retail customers visiting the premises in person and 
purchasing merchandise stored therein); to
    (ii) Total gross sales of the facility. For this purpose, the total 
gross sales of the facility include the value of items shipped to other 
facilities of the taxpayer.
    (2) Illustration of ratio allocation. For example, if a dual-
function storage facility's on-site sales are 40 percent of the total 
gross sales of the facility, then 40 percent of the facility's storage 
costs are allocable to the on-site storage function and are not required 
to be capitalized under section 263A.
    (3) Appropriate adjustments for other uses of a dual-function 
storage facility. Prior to computing the allocation ratio in paragraph 
(c)(5)(iii)(B) of this section, a taxpayer must apply the principles of 
paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section in determining the portion of the 
facility that is a dual-function storage facility (and the costs 
attributable to such portion).
    (C) De minimis 90-10 rule for dual-function storage facilities. If 
90 percent or more of the costs of a facility are attributable to the 
on-site storage function, the entire storage facility is deemed to be an 
on-site storage facility. In contrast, if 10 percent or less of the 
costs of a storage facility are attributable to the on-site storage 
function, the entire storage facility is deemed to be an off-site 
storage facility.
    (iv) Costs not attributable to an off-site storage facility. To the 
extent that costs incurred at an off-site storage facility are not 
properly allocable to the taxpayer's storage function, the costs are not 
accounted for as off-site storage costs. For example, if a taxpayer has 
an office attached to its off-site storage facility where work unrelated 
to the storage function is performed, such as a sales office, costs 
associated with this office are not off-site storage costs. However, if 
a taxpayer uses a portion of an off-site storage facility in a manner 
related to the storage function, for example, to store equipment or 
supplies that are not offered for sale to customers, costs associated 
with this portion of the facility are off-site storage costs.
    (v) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c)(5) are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Catalog or mail order center. Taxpayer P operates a mail 
order catalog business. As part of its business, P stores merchandise 
for shipment to customers who purchase the merchandise through orders 
placed by telephone or mail. P's storage facility is not an on-site 
storage facility because no on-site sales are made at the facility.
    Example 2. Pooled-stock facility. Taxpayer Q maintains a pooled-
stock facility, which functions as a back-up regional storage facility 
for Q's retail sales outlets in the nearby area. Q's pooled stock 
facility is an off-site storage facility because it is neither 
physically attached to nor an integral part of a retail sales facility.
    Example 3. Wholesale warehouse. Taxpayer R operates a wholesale 
warehouse where wholesale sales are made to customers physically present 
at the facility. R's customers resell the goods they purchase from R to 
final retail customers. Because no retail sales are conducted at the 
facility, all storage costs attributable to R's wholesale warehouse must 
be capitalized.

    (d) Simplified resale method--(1) Introduction. This paragraph (d) 
provides a simplified method for determining the additional section 263A 
costs properly allocable to property acquired for resale and other 
eligible property on hand at the end of the taxable year.
    (2) Eligible property. Generally, the simplified resale method is 
only available to a trade or business exclusively engaged in resale 
activities. However,

[[Page 428]]

certain resellers with property produced as a result of de minimis 
production activities or property produced under contract may elect the 
simplified resale method, as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this 
section. Eligible property for purposes of the simplified resale method, 
therefore, includes any real or personal property described in section 
1221(1) that is acquired for resale and any eligible property (within 
the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-2(b)(2)) that is described in paragraph 
(a)(4) of this section.
    (3) Simplified resale method without historic absorption ratio 
election--(i) General allocation formula--(A) In general. Under the 
simplified resale method, the additional section 263A costs allocable to 
eligible property remaining on hand at the close of the taxable year are 
computed as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.013

    (B) Effect of allocation. The resulting product under the general 
allocation formula is the additional section 263A costs that are added 
to the taxpayer's ending section 471 costs to determine the section 263A 
costs that are capitalized.
    (C) Definitions--(1) Combined absorption ratio. The combined 
absorption ratio is defined as the sum of the storage and handling costs 
absorption ratio as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section 
and the purchasing costs absorption ratio as defined in paragraph 
(d)(3)(i)(E) of this section.
    (2) Section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end. Section 471 
costs remaining on hand at year end mean the section 471 costs, as 
defined in Sec. 1.263A-1(d)(2), that the taxpayer incurs during its 
current taxable year, which remain in its ending inventory or are 
otherwise on hand at year end. For LIFO inventories of a taxpayer, the 
section 471 costs remaining on hand at year end means the increment, if 
any, for the current year stated in terms of section 471 costs. See 
paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section for special rules applicable to 
LIFO taxpayers. Except as otherwise provided in this section or in 
Sec. 1.263A-1 or 1.263A-2, additional section 263A costs that are 
allocated to inventories on hand at the close of the taxable year under 
the simplified resale method of this paragraph (d) are treated as 
inventory costs for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.
    (D) Storage and handling costs absorption ratio.
    (1) Under the simplified resale method, the storage and handling 
costs absorption ratio is determined as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.014

    (2) Current year's storage and handling costs are defined as the 
total storage costs plus the total handling costs incurred during the 
taxable year that relate to the taxpayer's property acquired for resale 
and other eligible property. See paragraph (c) of this section, which 
discusses storage and handling costs. Storage and handling costs must 
include the amount of allocable mixed service costs as described in 
paragraph (d)(3)(i)(F) of this section. Beginning inventory in the 
denominator of the storage and handling costs absorption ratio refers to 
the section 471 costs of any property acquired for resale or other 
eligible property held by the taxpayer as of the beginning of the 
taxable year. Current year's purchases generally mean the taxpayer's 
section 471 costs incurred with respect to purchases of property 
acquired for resale during the current taxable year. In computing the 
denominator of the storage and handling costs absorption ratio, a 
taxpayer using a dollar-value

[[Page 429]]

LIFO method of accounting, must state beginning inventory amounts using 
the LIFO carrying value of the inventory and not current-year dollars.
    (E) Purchasing costs absorption ratio. (1) Under the simplified 
resale method, the purchasing costs absorption ratio is determined as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.015

    (2) Current year's purchasing costs are defined as the total 
purchasing costs incurred during the taxable year that relate to the 
taxpayer's property acquired for resale and eligible property. See 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, which discusses purchasing costs. 
Purchasing costs must include the amount of allocable mixed service 
costs determined in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(F) of this section. Current 
year's purchases generally mean the taxpayer's section 471 costs 
incurred with respect to purchases of property acquired for resale 
during the current taxable year.
    (F) Allocable mixed service costs. (1) If a taxpayer allocates its 
mixed service costs to purchasing costs, storage costs, and handling 
costs using a method described in Sec. 1.263A-1(g)(4), the taxpayer is 
not required to determine its allocable mixed service costs under this 
paragraph (d)(3)(i)(F). However, if the taxpayer uses the simplified 
service cost method, the amount of mixed service costs allocated to and 
included in purchasing costs, storage costs, and handling costs in the 
absorption ratios in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) (D) and (E) of this section is 
determined as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.016

    (2) Labor costs allocable to activity are defined as the total labor 
costs allocable to each particular activity (i.e., purchasing, handling, 
and storage), excluding labor costs included in mixed service costs. 
Total labor costs are defined as the total labor costs (excluding labor 
costs included in mixed service costs) that are incurred in the 
taxpayer's trade or business during the taxable year. See Sec. 1.263A-
1(h)(6) for the definition of total mixed service costs.
    (ii) LIFO taxpayers electing simplified resale method--(A) In 
general. Under the simplified resale method, a taxpayer using a LIFO 
method must calculate a particular year's index (e.g., under Sec. 1.472-
8(e)) without regard its additional section 263A costs. Similarly, a 
taxpayer that adjusts current-year costs by applicable indexes to 
determine whether there has been an inventory increment or decrement in 
the current year for a particular LIFO pool must disregard the 
additional section 263A costs in making that determination.
    (B) LIFO increment. If the taxpayer determines there has been an 
inventory increment, the taxpayer must state the amount of the increment 
in current-year dollars (stated in terms of section 471 costs). The 
taxpayer then multiplies this amount by the combined absorption ratio. 
The resulting product is the additional section 263A costs that must be 
added to the taxpayer's increment for the year stated in terms of 
section 471 costs.
    (C) LIFO decrement. If the taxpayer determines there has been an 
inventory decrement, the taxpayer must state the amount of the decrement 
in dollars applicable to the particular year for which the LIFO layer 
has been invaded. The additional section 263A costs incurred in prior 
years that are applicable to the decrement are charged to

[[Page 430]]

cost of goods sold. The additional section 263A costs that are 
applicable to the decrement are determined by multiplying the additional 
section 263A costs allocated to the layer of the pool in which the 
decrement occurred by the ratio of the decrement (excluding additional 
section 263A costs) to the section 471 costs in the layer of that pool.
    (iii) Permissible variations of the simplified resale method. The 
following variations of the simplified resale method are permitted:
    (A) The exclusion of beginning inventories from the denominator in 
the storage and handling costs absorption ratio formula in paragraph 
(d)(3)(i)(D) of this section; or
    (B) Multiplication of the storage and handling costs absorption 
ratio in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(D) of this section by the total of section 
471 costs included in a LIFO taxpayer's ending inventory (rather than 
just the increment, if any, experienced by the LIFO taxpayer during the 
taxable year) for purposes of determining capitalizable storage and 
handling costs.
    (iv) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(3) are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. FIFO inventory method. (i) Taxpayer S uses the FIFO 
method of accounting for inventories. S's beginning inventory for 1994 
(all of which was sold during 1994) was $2,100,000 (consisting of 
$2,000,000 of section 471 costs and $100,000 of additional section 263A 
costs). During 1994, S makes purchases of $10,000,000. In addition, S 
incurs purchasing costs of $460,000, storage costs of $110,000, and 
handling costs of $90,000. S's purchases (section 471 costs) remaining 
in ending inventory at the end of 1994 are $3,000,000.
    (ii) In 1994, S incurs $400,000 of total mixed service costs and 
$1,000,000 of total labor costs (excluding labor costs included in mixed 
service costs). In addition, S incurs the following labor costs 
(excluding labor costs included in mixed service costs): purchasing--
$100,000, storage--$200,000, and handling--$200,000. Accordingly, the 
following mixed service costs must be included in purchasing costs, 
storage costs, and handling costs as capitalizable mixed service costs: 
purchasing-- $40,000 ([$100,000 divided by $1,000,000] multiplied by 
$400,000); storage--$80,000 ([$200,000 divided by $1,000,000] multiplied 
by $400,000); and handling-- $80,000 ([$200,000 divided by $1,000,000] 
multiplied by $400,000).
    (iii) S computes its purchasing costs absorption ratio for 1994 as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.017

    (iv) S computes its storage and handling costs absorption ratio for 
1994 as follows:

[[Page 431]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.018


    (v) S's combined absorption ratio is 8.0 %, or the sum of the 
purchasing costs absorption ratio (5.0 %) and the storage and handling 
costs absorption ratio (3.0 %). Under the simplified resale method, S 
determines the additional section 263A costs allocable to its ending 
inventory by multiplying the combined absorption ratio by its section 
471 costs with respect to current year's purchases remaining in ending 
inventory:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.019

    (vi) S adds this $240,000 to the $3,000,000 of purchases remaining 
in its ending inventory to determine its total ending FIFO inventory of 
$3,240,000.
    Example 2. LIFO inventory method. (i) Taxpayer T uses a dollar-value 
LIFO inventory method. T's beginning inventory for 1994 is $2,100,000 
(consisting of $2,000,000 of section 471 costs and $100,000 of 
additional section 263A costs). During 1994, T makes purchases of 
$10,000,000. In addition, T incurs purchasing costs of $460,000, storage 
costs of $110,000, and handling costs of $90,000. T's 1994 LIFO 
increment is $1,000,000 ($3,000,000 of section 471 costs in ending 
inventory less $2,000,000 of section 471 costs in beginning inventory).
    (ii) In 1994, T incurs $400,000 of total mixed service costs and 
$1,000,000 of total labor costs (excluding labor costs included in mixed 
service costs). In addition, T incurs the following labor costs 
(excluding labor costs included in mixed service costs): purchasing--
$100,000, storage--$200,000, and handling--$200,000. Accordingly, the 
following mixed service costs must be included in purchasing costs, 
storage costs, and handling costs as capitalizable mixed service costs: 
purchasing--$40,000 ([$100,000 divided by $1,000,000] multiplied by 
$400,000); storage-- $80,000 ([ $200,000 divided by $1,000,000] 
multiplied by $400,000); and handling-- $80,000 ([ $200,000 divided by 
$1,000,000] multiplied by $400,000).
    (iii) Based on these facts, T determines that it has a combined 
absorption ratio of 8.0 %. To determine the additional section 263A 
costs allocable to its ending inventory, T multiplies its combined 
absorption ratio (8.0 %) by the $1,000,000 LIFO increment. Thus, T's 
additional section 263A costs allocable to its ending inventory are 
$80,000 ($1,000,000 multiplied by 8.0 %). This $80,000 is added to the 
$1,000,000 to determine a total 1994 LIFO increment of $1,080,000. T's 
ending inventory is $3,180,000 (its beginning inventory of $2,100,000 
plus the $1,080,000 increment).
    (iv) In 1995, T sells one-half of the inventory in its 1994 LIFO 
increment. T must include in its cost of goods sold for 1995 the amount 
of additional section 263A costs relating to this inventory, i.e., one-
half of the $80,000 additional section 263A costs capitalized in 1994 
ending inventory, or $40,000.
    Example 3. LIFO Pools. (i) Taxpayer U begins its business in 1994, 
and adopts the LIFO inventory method. During 1994, U makes purchases of 
$10,000, and incurs $400 of purchasing costs, $350 of storage costs and 
$250 of handling costs. U's purchasing costs, storage costs, and 
handling costs include their proper allocable share of mixed service 
costs.
    (ii) U computes its purchasing costs absorption ratio for 1994, as 
follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.020

    (iii) U computes its storage and handling costs absorption ratio for 
1994, as follows:

[[Page 432]]

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.021


    (iv) U's combined absorption ratio is 10%, or the sum of the 
purchasing costs absorption ratio (4.0%) and the storage and handling 
costs absorption ratio (6.0%). At the end of 1994, U's ending inventory 
included $3,000 of current year purchases, contained in three LIFO pools 
(X, Y, and Z) as shown below. Under the simplified resale method, U 
computes its ending inventory for 1994 as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            1994                                 Total          X            Y            Z

                                                             ---------------------------------------------------
1994 ending inventory.......................................        3,300        1,760          660          880
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (v) During 1995, U makes purchases of $2,000 as shown below, and 
incurs $200 of purchasing costs, $325 of storage costs and $175 of 
handling costs. U's purchasing costs, storage costs, and handling costs 
include their proper share of mixed service costs. Moreover, U sold 
goods from pools X, Y, and Z having a total cost of $1,000. U computes 
its ending inventory for 1995 as follows.
    (vi) U computes its purchasing costs absorption ratio for 1995:
    [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.022
    
    (vii) U computes its storage and handling costs absorption ratio for 
1995:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.023

    (viii) U's combined absorption ratio is 20.0%, or the sum of the 
purchasing costs absorption ratio (10.0%) and the storage and handling 
costs absorption ratio (10.0%).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (ix) In 1995, U experiences a $200 decrement in Pool Z. Thus, U must 
charge the additional section 263A costs incurred in prior years 
applicable to the decrement to 1995's cost of goods sold. To do so, U 
determines a ratio by dividing the decrement by the section 471 costs in 
the 1994 layer ($200 divided by $800, or 25%). U then multiplies this 
ratio (25%) by the additional section 263A costs in the 1994 layer ($80) 
to determine the additional section 263A costs applicable to the 
decrement ($20). Therefore, $20 is taken into account by U in 1995 as 
part of its cost of goods sold ($80 multiplied by 25%).

    (4) Simplified resale method with historic absorption ratio 
election--(i) In general. This paragraph (d)(4) permits resellers using 
the simplified resale method to elect a historic absorption ratio in 
determining additional section 263A costs allocable to eligible property 
remaining on hand at the close of their taxable years. Except as 
provided in paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section, a taxpayer may only 
make a historic absorption ratio election if it has used the simplified 
resale method for three or more consecutive taxable years immediately 
prior to the year of election. The historic absorption ratio is used in 
lieu of an actual combined absorption ratio computed under paragraph 
(d)(3)(i)(C)(1) of this section and is based on costs capitalized by a 
taxpayer during its test period. If elected, the historic absorption 
ratio must be used for the qualifying period described in paragraph 
(d)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.
    (ii) Operating rules and definitions--(A) Historic absorption ratio. 
(1) The historic absorption ratio is equal to the following ratio:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.024

    (2) Additional section 263A costs incurred during the test period 
are defined as the sum of the products of the combined absorption ratios 
(defined in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(C)(1) of this section) multiplied by a 
taxpayer's section 471 costs incurred with respect to purchases, for 
each taxable year of the test period.
    (3) Section 471 costs incurred during the test period mean the 
section 471 costs described in Sec. 1.263A-1(d)(2) that a taxpayer 
incurs generally with respect to its purchases during the test period 
described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.
    (B) Test period--(1) In general. The test period is generally the 
three taxable-year period immediately prior to the taxable year that the 
historic absorption ratio is elected.
    (2) Updated test period. The test period begins again with the 
beginning of the first taxable year after the close of a qualifying 
period (as defined in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(C) of this section). This new 
test period, the updated test period, is the three taxable-year period 
beginning with the first taxable year after the close of the qualifying 
period.
    (C) Qualifying period--(1) In general. A qualifying period includes 
each of the first five taxable years beginning with the first taxable 
year after a test period (or updated test period).
    (2) Extension of qualifying period. In the first taxable year 
following the close of each qualifying period (e.g., the sixth taxable 
year following the test period), the taxpayer must compute the actual 
combined absorption

[[Page 434]]

ratio under the simplified resale method. If the actual combined 
absorption ratio computed for this taxable year (the recomputation year) 
is within one-half of one percentage point (plus or minus) of the 
historic absorption ratio used in determining capitalizable costs for 
the qualifying period (i.e., the previous five taxable years), the 
qualifying period must be extended to include the recomputation year and 
the following five taxable years, and the taxpayer must continue to use 
the historic absorption ratio throughout the extended qualifying period. 
If, however, the actual combined absorption ratio computed for the 
recomputation year is not within one-half of one percentage point (plus 
or minus) of the historic absorption ratio, the taxpayer must use actual 
combined absorption ratios beginning with the recomputation year under 
the simplified resale method and throughout the updated test period. The 
taxpayer must resume using the historic absorption ratio (determined 
with reference to the updated test period) in the third taxable year 
following the recomputation year.
    (iii) Method of accounting--(A) Adoption and use. The election to 
use the historic absorption ratio is a method of accounting. A taxpayer 
using the simplified resale method may elect the historic absorption 
ratio in any taxable year if permitted under this paragraph (d)(4), 
provided the taxpayer has not obtained the Commissioner's consent to 
revoke the historic absorption ratio election within its prior six 
taxable years. The election is to be effected on a cut-off basis, and 
thus, no adjustment under section 481(a) is required or permitted. The 
use of a historic absorption ratio has no effect on other methods of 
accounting adopted by the taxpayer and used in conjunction with the 
simplified resale method in determining its section 263A costs. 
Accordingly, in computing its actual combined absorption ratios, the 
taxpayer must use the same methods of accounting used in computing its 
historic absorption ratio during its most recent test period unless the 
taxpayer obtains the consent of the Commissioner. Finally, for purposes 
of this paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A), the recomputation of the historic 
absorption ratio during an updated test period and the change from a 
historic absorption ratio to an actual combined absorption ratio during 
an updated test period by reason of the requirements of this paragraph 
(d)(4) are not considered changes in methods of accounting under section 
446(e) and, thus, do not require the consent of the Commissioner or any 
adjustments under section 481(a).
    (B) Revocation of election. A taxpayer may only revoke its election 
to use the historic absorption ratio with the consent of the 
Commissioner in a manner prescribed under section 446(e) and the 
regulations thereunder. Consent to the change for any taxable year that 
is included in the qualifying period (or an extended qualifying period) 
will be granted only upon a showing of unusual circumstances.
    (iv) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements--(A) Reporting. A 
taxpayer making an election under this paragraph (d)(4) must attach a 
statement to its federal income tax return for the taxable year in which 
the election is made showing the actual combined absorption ratios 
determined under the simplified resale method during its first test 
period. This statement must disclose the historic absorption ratio to be 
used by the taxpayer during its qualifying period. A similar statement 
must be attached to the federal income tax return for the first taxable 
year within any subsequent qualifying period (i.e., after an updated 
test period).
    (B) Recordkeeping. A taxpayer must maintain all appropriate records 
and details supporting the historic absorption ratio until the 
expiration of the statute of limitations for the last year for which the 
taxpayer applied the particular historic absorption ratio in determining 
additional section 263A costs capitalized to eligible property.
    (v) Transition rules. Taxpayers will be permitted to elect a 
historic absorption ratio in their first, second, or third taxable year 
beginning after December 31, 1993, under such terms and conditions as 
may be prescribed by the Commissioner. Taxpayers are eligible to make an 
election under these transition rules whether or not they previously 
used the simplified resale method. A taxpayer making such an election 
must recompute (or compute)

[[Page 435]]

its additional section 263A costs, and thus, its historic absorption 
ratio for its first test period as if the rules prescribed in this 
section and Secs. 1.263A-1 and 1.263A-2 had applied throughout the test 
period.
    (vi) Example. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(4) are 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. (i) Taxpayer V uses the FIFO method of accounting for 
inventories and in 1994 elects to use the historic absorption ratio with 
the simplified resale method. After recomputing its additional section 
263A costs in accordance with the transition rules of paragraph 
(d)(4)(v) of this section, V identifies the following costs incurred 
during the test period:

1991:
    Add'l section 263A costs--$100
    Section 471 costs--$3,000
1992:
    Add'l section 263A costs--$200
    Section 471 costs--$4,000
1993:
    Add'l section 263A costs--$300
    Section 471 costs--$5,000

    (ii) Therefore, V computes a 5% historic absorption ratio determined 
as follows:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.025

    (iii) In 1994, V incurs $10,000 of section 471 costs of which $3,000 
remain in inventory at the end of the year. Under the simplified resale 
method using a historic absorption ratio, V determines the additional 
section 263A costs allocable to its ending inventory by multiplying its 
historic ratio (5%) by the section 471 costs remaining in its ending 
inventory:
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC10OC91.026

    (iv) To determine its ending inventory under section 263A, V adds 
the additional section 263A costs allocable to ending inventory to its 
section 471 costs remaining in ending inventory ($3,150=$150+$3,000). 
The balance of V's additional section 263A costs incurred during 1994 is 
taken into account in 1994 as part of V's cost of goods sold.
    (v) V's qualifying period ends as of the close of its 1998 taxable 
year. Therefore, 1999 is a recomputation year in which V must compute 
its actual combined absorption ratio. V determines its actual absorption 
ratio for 1999 to be 5.25% and compares that ratio to its historic 
absorption ratio (5.0%). Therefore, V must continue to use its historic 
absorption ratio of 5.0% throughout an extended qualifying period, 1999 
through 2004 (the recomputation year and the following five taxable 
years).
    (vi) If, instead, V's actual combined absorption ratio for 1999 were 
not between 4.5% and 5.5%, V's qualifying period would end and V would 
be required to compute a new historic absorption ratio with reference to 
an updated test period of 1999, 2000, and 2001. Once V's historic 
absorption ratio is determined for the updated test period, it would be 
used for a new qualifying period beginning in 2002.

    (5) Additional simplified methods for resellers. The Commissioner 
may prescribe additional elective simplified methods by revenue ruling

Sec. 1.263A-4  Rules for property produced in a farming trade or 
business. [Reserved]


<R05>
Sec. 1.263A-4T   Rules relating to property produced in a farming business.

    (a)-(b) [Reserved]
    (c) Special rules for property produced in a farming business--(1) 
General rule. In general, this section applies to property produced in a 
farming business if

[[Page 436]]

such property has a preproductive period of more than 2 years, or if 
such farming business is described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
This section does not apply, however, if the property is described in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section or if the taxpayer has made the 
election described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. In addition, 
this section does not apply to animals produced in a farming business if 
such animals are held primarily for slaughter (regardless of the 
preproductive period of such animals), except that this section shall 
apply to the production of such animals by a farming business if such 
business is described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. For purposes 
of this section, an animal is held primarily for slaughter regardless of 
whether the taxpayer itself will slaughter the animal or instead will 
sell the animal to others for slaughter.
    (2) Taxpayers required to use the accrual method. (i) This section 
applies to property produced in a farming business (including all 
animals held primarily for slaughter) without regard to the 
preproductive period of such property in the case of a:
    (A) Corporation or partnership required to use an accrual method of 
accounting under section 447 in computing its taxable income from 
farming, or
    (B) Tax shelter required to use an accrual method of accounting 
under section 448(a)(3).

Thus, for example, this section applies to an enterprise involving the 
feeding of cattle held for slaughter regardless of the preproductive 
period of such cattle, if the enterprise is required to use an accrual 
method of accounting under section 447 or section 448(a)(3).
    (ii) For purposes of this section, a farming business shall be 
considered a tax shelter, and thus required to use an accrual method of 
accounting under section 448(a)(3), if that farming business is:
    (A) A farming syndicate as defined in section 464(c); or
    (B) A tax shelter within the meaning of section 6661(b)(2)(C)(ii), 
defined as--
    (1) A partnership or other entity,
    (2) Any investment plan or arrangement, or
    (3) Any other plan or arrangement, if the principal purpose of such 
partnership, entity, plan, or arrangement is the avoidance or evasion of 
federal income tax.
    (iii) For purposes of this section, marketed arrangements in which 
persons carry on farming activities utilizing the services of a common 
managerial or administrative service will be presumed to have the 
principal purpose of tax avoidance if such persons prepay a substantial 
portion of their farming expenses with borrowed funds.
    (3) Exception--(i) In general. This section does not apply to costs 
incurred on or after October 22, 1986, that are attributable to the 
replanting, cultivation, maintenance, and development of any plants 
bearing an edible crop for human consumption (including, but not limited 
to, plants which constitute a grove, orchard, or vineyard) that were 
lost or damaged while in the hands of the taxpayer by reason of freezing 
temperatures, disease, drought, pests, or casualty. Such replanting or 
maintenance costs may be incurred with respect to property other than 
the property on which the damage or loss occurred if the acreage of the 
property with respect to which the replanting or maintenance costs are 
incurred is not in excess of the acreage of the property on which the 
damage or loss occurred. Plants bearing crops for human consumption are 
those crops that are normally eaten or drunk by humans. Thus, for 
example, costs incurred with respect to replanting plants bearing jojoba 
beans do not qualify for the exception provided in this paragraph 
(c)(3)(i) because that crop is not normally eaten or drunk by humans.
    (ii) Ownership; in general. Replanting, cultivation, maintenance, 
and development costs described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section 
generally must be incurred by the taxpayer owning the property at the 
time the plants were lost or damaged. Paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this 
section will apply, however, to costs incurred by a person other than 
the taxpayer owning the plants at the time of damage or loss if--
    (A) The taxpayer who owned the plants at the time the damage or loss 
occurred owns an equity interest of more than 50 percent in such plants 
or crops, and

[[Page 437]]

    (B) Such other person owns any portion of the remaining equity 
interest and materially participates in the replanting, cultivating, 
maintenance or development of such plants or crops.

A person will be treated as materially participating for purposes of 
this provision if such person would otherwise meet the requirements with 
respect to material participation within the meaning of section 2032A of 
the Code.
    (4) Definitions--(i) Farming business. (A) For purposes of this 
section, a farming business means a trade or business involving the 
cultivation of land or the raising or harvesting of any agricultural or 
horticultural commodity. Examples include the trade or business of 
operating a nursery or sod farm; the raising or harvesting of crops; the 
raising or harvesting of trees bearing fruit, nuts or other crops; the 
raising of ornamental trees; and the raising, shearing, feeding, caring 
for, training, and management of animals.
    (B) For purposes of this section, an evergreen tree that is more 
than 6 years old at the time it is severed from its roots is not treated 
as an ornamental tree regardless of the purpose for which it is sold.
    (C)(1) For purposes of this section, the term farming business does 
not include the processing of commodities or products beyond those 
activities which are normally incident to the growing, raising or 
harvesting of such products.
    (2) Thus, for example, assume the taxpayer, a C corporation, is in 
the business of growing and harvesting wheat and other grains. The 
taxpayer processes grain that it has harvested in order to produce 
breads, cereals, and other similar food products, which it then sells to 
customers in the course of its business. Although the taxpayer is in the 
farming business with respect to the growing and harvesting of grain, 
the taxpayer is not in the farming business with respect to the 
processing of such grains to produce food products that it sells to 
customers.
    (3) Similarly, assume the taxpayer is in the business of raising 
poultry or other livestock. The taxpayer then uses such livestock in a 
meat processing operation in which the livestock are slaughtered, 
processed, and packaged or canned in preparation for their sale to 
customers. Although the taxpayer is in the farming business with respect 
to the raising of livestock, the taxpayer is not in the farming business 
with respect to the meat processing operation.
    (4) However, under this section the term farming business does 
include processing activities which are normally incident to the 
growing, raising of harvesting or agricultural products. For example, 
assume a taxpayer is in the business of growing fruits and vegetables. 
When the fruits and vegetables are ready to be harvested, the taxpayer 
picks, washes, inspects, and packages the fruits and vegetables for 
sale. Such activities are normally incident to the raising of these 
crops by farmers. The taxpayer will be considered to be in the business 
of farming with respect to the growing of fruits and vegetables, and the 
processing activities incident to their harvest.
    (ii) Preproductive period. (A) For purposes of this section, the 
preproductive period of property produced in a farming business means--
    (1) In the case of a plant or animal which will have more than one 
crop or yield, the period before the first marketable crop or yield from 
such plant or animal, or
    (2) In the case of any other plant or animal, the period before such 
plant or animal is reasonably expected to be disposed of.
    (B) The preproductive period of a plant begins when the plant or 
seed is first planted or acquired by the taxpayer. The preproductive 
period ends when the plant becomes productive in marketable quantities 
or when the plant is reasonably expected to be sold or otherwise 
disposed of.
    (C) The preproductive period of an animal begins at the time of 
acquisition, breeding, or embryo implantation. The preproductive period 
ends at the time the animal is ready to perform the primary function 
intended to be performed by that animal (e.g., when the animal becomes 
productive in marketable quantities), or when the animal is reasonably 
expected to be sold or otherwise disposed of. For example, in the case 
of a cow used for breeding purposes, the preproductive period with

[[Page 438]]

respect to the cow ends on the date the first calf is dropped.
    (D) The preproductive period of plants grown in commercial 
quantities in the United States shall be based on the weighted average 
preproductive period for such plant, determined on a nationwide basis.
    (5) Inventory methods--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided, 
the costs required to be allocated to any plant or animal under this 
section may be determined using reasonable inventory valuation methods 
such as the farm-price method or the unit-livestock-price method. See 
Sec. 1.471-6.
    (ii) Availability to tax shelters. Tax shelters, as defined in 
paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, using the unit-livestock-price 
method of accounting for inventories must include in inventory the 
annual standard unit price for all animals which are acquired during the 
taxable year, regardless of whether such purchases are made during the 
last 6 months of the taxable year.
    (iii) Availability to property used in trade or business. The farm-
price method or the unit-livestock-price method may be used by any 
taxpayer to allocate costs to any plant or animal under this section, 
regardless of whether the plant or animal is held or treated as 
inventory property by the taxpayer. Thus, for example, a taxpayer may 
use the unit-livestock-price method to account for the costs of raising 
livestock which will be used in the trade or business of farming (e.g., 
a breeding animal or a dairy cow) although the property in question is 
not inventory property.
    (6) Election not to have this section apply--(i) Introduction. This 
paragraph (c)(6) permits certain taxpayers to make an election not to 
have the rules of this section apply to any plant or animal produced in 
a farming business conducted by the electing taxpayer.
    (ii) Availability of the election. The election described in this 
section is available to any farmer except that no election may be made 
by a corporation, partnership or tax shelter required to use an accrual 
method of accounting under section 447 or 448(a)(3). Moreover, no 
election may be made with respect to the planting, cultivation, 
maintenance or development of pistachio trees. In addition, the election 
described in this section does not apply to any costs incurred for the 
planting, cultivation, maintenance or development of any citrus or 
almond grove (or any part thereof) to the extent that such costs are 
incurred within the first four years in which such trees were planted. 
If a citrus or almond grove is planted in more than one taxable year, 
the portion of the grove planted in any one taxable year is treated as a 
separate grove for purposes of determining the year of planting.
    (iii) Time and manner of making the election. Unless consent is 
obtained from the Commissioner, the election described in this section 
may only be made for the taxpayer's first taxable year that begins after 
December 31, 1986, and during which the taxpayer engages in a farming 
business. The election shall be made on the schedule E, F, or other 
schedule required to be attached to the income tax return for the first 
taxable year for which the election is effective. In the case of a 
partnership or S corporation, the election must be made by the partner 
or shareholder.
    (iv) Election treated as if made if certain requirements satisfied. 
A taxpayer eligible to make the election under paragraph (c)(6) of this 
section shall be treated as having made the election if such taxpayer 
does not capitalize the costs of producing property in a farming 
business as the provisions of this section would otherwise require.
    (v) Revocation. Once the election is made, it is revocable only with 
the consent of the Commissioner.
    (vi) Special rules for treatment of expenses. (A) If the election is 
made, the plant or animal produced by the taxpayer is treated as section 
1245 property and any gain resulting from any disposition of such 
property is recaptured (i.e., treated as ordinary income) to the extent 
of the total amount of the deductions which, but for the election, would 
have been required to be capitalized with respect to the plant or 
animal. In calculating the amount of gain which is recaptured under this 
paragraph (c)(6)(vi), the taxpayer may use the farm-price or unit-
livestock methods in determining the deductions

[[Page 439]]

which otherwise would have been capitalized with respect to the plant or 
animal.
    (B) If the taxpayer or a related person makes the election, the 
alternative depreciation system (as defined in section 168(g)(2)), shall 
be applied to all property used predominantly in any farming business of 
the taxpayer or related person and placed in service in any taxable year 
during which the election is in effect. The requirement to use the 
alternative depreciation system by reason of any election under 
paragraph (c)(6) of this section shall not prevent any taxpayer from 
making an election under section 179 to expense certain depreciable 
business assets.
    (C) For purposes of this paragraph (c)(6), the term related party 
means--
    (1) The taxpayer and members of the taxpayer's family (defined, for 
this purpose, to include the spouse of the taxpayer and any of his or 
her children who have not reached the age of 18 as of the last day of 
the taxable year in question),
    (2) Any corporation (including an S corporation) if 50 percent or 
more of the stock (in value) is owned directly or indirectly (through 
the application of section 318) by the taxpayer or members of the 
taxpayer's family,
    (3) A corporation and any other corporation which is a member of the 
same controlled group (within the meaning of section 1563(a)(1)), and,
    (4) Any partnership if 50 percent or more (in value) of the 
interests in such partnership is owned directly or indirectly (through 
the application of section 318) by the taxpayer or members of the 
taxpayer's family.
    (vii) The operation of the election not to have this section apply 
is illustrated in the following examples:

    Example (1) Assume that A, an individual, is engaged in the trade or 
business of farming. A raises cattle for breeding and dairy purposes. In 
addition, A grows and harvests wheat and other grains. Assume further, 
that the preproductive period of certain of the cattle raised by A is 
more than two years, as defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, 
and that A elects under paragraph (c)(6) of this section not to have the 
rules of this section apply to the costs of raising such cattle. A is 
required to use the alternative depreciation system described in section 
168(g) of the Code with respect to all property used predominantly in 
any farming business of A (including the growing and harvesting of 
wheat) if such property is placed in service during a year for which the 
election is in effect. Thus, for example, all assets and equipment 
(including any dairy cattle which A treats as depreciable property, and 
any equipment used to grow and harvest wheat) placed in service during a 
year for which the election is in effect must be depreciated using the 
straight line method over the applicable number of years, as provided in 
section 168(g).
    Example (2) Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that A and 
members of A's family (as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(vi)(C)) also own 
51% (in value) of the interests in a partnership P, which is engaged in 
the trade or business of growing and harvesting corn. P is a related 
person to A under the provisions of paragraph (c)(6)(i)(F) of this 
section. Thus, the requirements to use the alternative depreciation 
system under section 168(g) also apply to any property used 
predominantly in a trade or business of farming which P places in 
service during a year for which the election made by A is in effect.
    (d) This section is effective for costs incurred after December 31, 
1986, in taxable years ending after such date. In the case of property 
that is inventory in the hands of the taxpayer, this section is 
effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.

<R05>
Sec. 1.263A-7T   Rules relating to changes in methods of accounting.

    (a)-(d) [Reserved]
    (e) Inventories--(1) In general. (i) Under section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder, taxpayers are required to change their method of 
accounting with respect to inventory property, effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1986. The required change in method 
of accounting applies to inventory produced by the taxpayer, as well as 
to inventory acquired by the

[[Page 440]]

taxpayer for resale. The change in method of accounting is to be made by 
revaluing the items or costs included in beginning inventory in the year 
of change as if the new capitalization rules of section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder had been in effect during all prior periods. In 
revaluing inventory costs under this procedure, all of the 
capitalization provisions of section 263A and the regulations thereunder 
(e.g., the requirement to capitalize the entire amount of tax 
depreciation and cost recovery allowances with respect to equipment and 
facilities and the repeal of the practical capacity concept), shall 
apply to all inventory costs accumulated in prior periods. The necessity 
to revalue beginning inventory as if the new capitalization rules had 
been in effect for all prior periods includes, for example, the 
revaluation of costs or layers incurred in taxable years preceding the 
transition period to the full absorption method of inventory costing as 
described in Sec. 1.471-11(e), regardless of whether a taxpayer employed 
a ``cut-off'' method under those regulations. The difference between the 
inventory as originally valued and the inventory as revalued by applying 
the new capitalization rules is equal to the amount of the adjustment 
required under section 481(a). For example, with respect to inventories 
of films, sound recordings, video tapes, books, and other similar 
property, the taxpayer shall revalue the costs of such items under the 
principles of this paragraph (e)(1).
    (ii) Pursuant to the change in method of accounting required under 
section 263A and the regulations thereunder, taxpayers are required to 
revalue the amount of deferred gain or loss resulting from the sale or 
exchange of inventory property in an intercompany transaction, to an 
amount equal to the deferred gain or loss that would have resulted had 
the cost of goods sold for that inventory property been determined under 
the capitalization rules of section 263A and the regulations thereunder. 
The requirement of the preceding sentence shall apply with respect to 
both property produced by the taxpayer, or property acquired by the 
taxpayer for resale. In addition, the requirements of this paragraph 
shall apply only to the deferred gain or loss of the taxpayer as of the 
beginning of the year of change in method of accounting required under 
section 263A and the regulations thereunder. (See Sec. 1.1502-13, which 
separately requires that the capitalization rules of section 263A and 
the regulations thereunder shall apply in determining the cost of goods 
sold for intercompany transactions occurring after the effective date of 
section 263A.) Corresponding changes to the adjustment required under 
section 481(a) shall be made with respect to any adjustment of the 
deferred gain or loss required under this paragraph. Moreover, the 
requirements of this paragraph shall apply regardless of whether the 
taxpayer has any items in beginning inventory as of the year of change 
in method of accounting. The terms deferred gain or loss and 
intercompany transaction as used herein are as used in Sec. 1.1502-13.
    (iii) The provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section are 
illustrated by the following example.

    (A) Example. Assume that corporation A, a member of an affiliated 
group of corporations filing a consolidated federal income tax return on 
a calendar year, manufactures and sells inventory property to 
corporation B, a member of the same affiliated group, in 1985. The gain 
from the sale of the inventory property is deferred by A under 
Sec. 1.1502-13 of the regulations. As of the beginning of the year of 
change in method of accounting (January 1, 1987), the inventory property 
is still held by corporation B based on the particular inventory method 
of accounting used by B for Federal income tax purposes (e.g., LIFO or 
FIFO). The property was sold by A to B in 1985 for $150; the cost of 
goods sold with respect to the property under the law in effect at the 
time the inventory was produced (see Sec. 1.471-3) was $100, resulting 
in a gain of $50 which A deferred under Sec. 1.1502-13. The deferred 
intercompany gain as of January 1, 1987, with respect to the 
transaction, is $50.
    (B) Under section 263A and the regulations thereunder, A is required 
to revalue the amount of deferred intercompany gain resulting from the 
sale of the inventory property to an amount equal to the deferred gain 
which would have resulted had the cost of goods sold for that inventory 
property been determined under the capitalization rules. Assume that the 
cost of the inventory under the capitalization rules would have been 
$110, had the capitalization rules applied to A's manufacture of the 
property in 1985. Thus, A is required to revalue the amount of

[[Page 441]]

deferred gain to $40 (i.e., $150 less $110), necessitating a negative 
adjustment to the deferred gain of $10. Moreover, A is required to 
increase its section 481(a) adjustment by $10 in order to prevent the 
omission of such amount by virtue of the decrease in the deferred 
intercompany gain.

    (iv) In determining the amount of intercompany gain which would have 
resulted had the cost of goods sold for that inventory property been 
determined under the capitalization rules of section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder, a taxpayer may use the other methods and 
procedures otherwise properly available to that particular taxpayer in 
revaluing inventory under section 263A and the regulations thereunder, 
including, if appropriate, the various simplified methods provided in 
section 263A and the regulations thereunder and the various procedures 
described in paragraph (e) of this section.
    (2) Section 481(a) adjustment. In the case of any taxpayer required 
by section 263A and the regulations thereunder to change its method of 
accounting for any taxable year, such change shall be treated as 
initiated by the taxpayer. (In addition, such change shall be treated as 
made with the consent of the Commissioner, subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (e)(11) of this section). Thus, for example, the adjustment 
required under section 481(a) with respect to the change in method of 
accounting for such taxpayer shall not be reduced in any manner by any 
amount pertaining to taxable years preceding the effective date of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The adjustment arising from the change in 
method of accounting is to be taken into account over a period not to 
exceed 4 years.
    (3) Timing of section 481(a) adjustment. (i) Any taxpayer required 
to change its method of accounting under section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder shall take into account the adjustment required 
under the administrative procedures applicable to a voluntary change in 
method of accounting in effect on January 1, 1987, subject to the 
following modifications:
    (ii) If 75 percent or more of the section 481(a) adjustment is 
attributable to the 1-taxable year period, 2-taxable year period, or 3-
taxable year period immediately preceding the year of change, the 
highest percent attributable to the 1, 2, or 3-taxable year period is to 
be taken into account ratably over a 3-taxable year period beginning 
with the year of change. The remaining balance is to be taken into 
account in the 4th taxable year (the ``75 percent rule''). The 75 
percent rule of this paragraph shall only apply if the taxpayer has used 
its present method of accounting for more than 3 taxable years.
    (iii) If paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply, the 
section 481(a) adjustment is to be taken into account ratably over the 
number of tax years (not to exceed 4) that the taxpayer has engaged in 
the particular trade or business of producing property or acquiring 
property for resale to which the adjustment applies.
    (iv) If the taxpayer is a cooperative within the meaning of section 
1381(a), the section 481(a) adjustment may be taken into account 
entirely in the year of change or, at the taxpayer's election, may be 
taken into account under the general procedures applicable to other 
taxpayers, as modified by the rules of this paragraph.
    (v) The use of the expedited procedure described in pargraph (e)(4) 
of this section may be elected by a taxpayer in applying the 75 percent 
rule described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section.
    (vi) Any net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be 
allowed to offset any positive section 481(a) adjustment.
    (vii) For purposes of determining estimated tax payments, the 
section 481(a) adjustment will be recognized in taxable income ratably 
throughout the year in question.
    (4) Expedited procedure for applying the 75-percent rule--(i) In 
general. Any taxpayer required to change its method of accounting under 
section 263A and the regulations thereunder may elect to use the 
expedited procedure of this paragraph (e)(4)(i) in determining the 
appropriate period for taking into account the section 481(a) adjustment 
under the provisions of the 75-percent rule contained in paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii) of this section. Under the 75-percent rule, the period for 
taking the section 481(a) adjustment into account may be accelerated if 
75 percent or more or the adjustment is attributable to either the 1-
taxable year period, 2-taxable year

[[Page 442]]

period, or 3-taxable year period immediately preceding the year of 
change. In order to determine whether the 75-percent rule applies to a 
taxpayer, the taxpayer is required to compute the section 481(a) 
adjustment which would have been required had the change in method of 
accounting occurred in each of the three years preceding the actual year 
of change. Under the procedure provided in this paragraph (e)(4), in 
computing the amount of the section 481(a) adjustment that would have 
been required in the three taxable years preceding the year of change, a 
taxpayer may--
    (A) Compute the percentage increase in the balance of beginning 
inventory resulting from the change in method of accounting for the 
taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, and
    (B) Multiply that percentage increase by the beginning inventory 
balance for each of the three preceding taxable years in issue.

The resulting product shall be the amount of the section 481(a) 
adjustment for each of the preceding taxable years, respectively. Any 
taxpayer electing to apply this procedure is required to use such 
procedure for each of the three taxable years in issue. The election to 
use this procedure may be made automatically by the taxpayer, without 
obtaining the consent of the Commissioner, by adopting such procedure in 
determining the timing of its section 481(a) adjustment under this 
section.
    (ii) Example illustrating procedure.

    Example. B, a calendar year taxpayer, is required to change its 
method of accounting for its taxable year beginning January 1, 1987. B's 
beginning inventory balance as of January 1, 1987, before the change in 
method of accounting, is $1,000. The revalued inventory balance after 
applying the change in method of accounting required by section 263A and 
the regulations thereunder is $1,100 (a ten percent increase). B's 
beginning inventory balance as of January 1, 1986, was $900. Under this 
procedure, for applying the 75-percent rule, B may assume that the 
amount of the section 481(a) adjustment applicable to a change in method 
of accounting for the taxable year beginning January 1, 1986, would be 
$90 (ten percent multiplied by $900).

    (5) General examples. The following examples illustrate the 
provisions of this paragraph.

    Example (1). Y is required to change its method of accounting under 
section 263A and the regulations thereunder for its taxable year 
beginning January 1, 1987. The adjustment required by section 481(a) to 
effect such change is $1,000. Y has been using its prior method of 
accounting for inventories for the 4-year period preceding the year of 
change. The highest percent of the section 481(a) adjustment 
attributable to either the 1-taxable year period, 2-taxable year period, 
or 3-taxable year period preceding the year of change is 67%. Based on 
the above facts, Y is required to include ratably the section 481(a) 
adjustment in taxable income for its four consecutive taxable years 
beginning with 1987, i.e., $250 of the section 481(a) adjustment should 
be included in taxable income for each of the four years.
    Example (2). Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the 
highest percent of the section 481(a) adjustment attributable to either 
the 1-taxable year period, 2-taxable year period, or 3-taxable year 
period, immediately preceding the year of change is 90%. Based on the 
above facts, Y is required to include 30% of the total section 481(a) 
adjustment into taxable income for each of its three consecutive taxable 
years beginning with 1987. The remaining 10 percent of the section 
481(a) adjustment shall be included in income for the fourth taxable 
year, i.e., 1990.
    Example (3). Assume that Y is required under section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder to change its method of accounting for its 
taxable year beginning January 1, 1987. In addition, assume that in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(iii), Y is required to include the 
section 481(a) adjustment in income over 4 years beginning with its 1987 
taxable year. On December 31, 1987, the aggregate balance of Y's 
inventory to which the section 481(a) adjustment relates is reduced by 
more than 33\1/3\ percent of the aggregate balance at January 1, 1987. 
Further, the inventory is so reduced by at least such percentage on 
December 31, 1988. Y must include the remaining balance of the 481(a) 
adjustment in its income for December 31, 1988.

    (6) Revaluation of inventory--(i) In general. Generally, in 
revaluing the costs of inventory under the change in method of 
accounting, taxpayers are required to make a determination, based on all 
of the facts and circumstances, of the direct and indirect costs which 
are to be assigned to each time of inventory under the capitalization 
rules of section 263A and the regulations thereunder (the ``facts and 
circumstances revaluation''). The facts and circumstances revaluation 
shall be required for every prior period which is

[[Page 443]]

relevant in determining the total restated balance as of the year of 
change. Paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section describes the facts and 
circumstances revaluation, including the degree of precision and 
accuracy which is necessary under that method. Paragraph (e)(6) (iii) 
and (iv) of this section permit the use of certain methods which 
determine the revaluation of inventory costs through processes of 
estimation and extrapolation which are not based on a determination of 
the facts and circumstances of a particular year's data. The methods 
prescribed in this paragraph (e)(6) (ii), (iii), and (iv) are available 
with respect to taxpayers producing property, or acquiring property for 
resale, regardless of whether those taxpayers elected to use the 
simplified methods available for such activities under section 263A and 
the regulations thereunder.
    (ii) Facts and circumstances revaluation--(A) In general. Under the 
facts and circumstances revaluation, taxpayers generally are required to 
revalue inventories by applying the capitalization rules of section 263A 
and the regulations thereunder to the production and resale activities 
of the taxpayer, with the same degree of specificity as required of 
inventory manufacturers under the law immediately prior to the effective 
date of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Thus, for example, with respect to 
any prior period which is relevant in determining the total amounts of 
the revalued balance as of the year of change, the taxpayer must analyze 
the production and resale data for that particular period, and apply the 
rules and principles of section 263A and the regulations thereunder to 
determine the appropriate revalued inventory costs. However, under the 
facts and circumstances revaluation, taxpayers may utilize reasonable 
estimates and procedures in valuing inventory costs if:
    (1) Taxpayers lack (and are not able to reconstruct, from their 
books and records), actual financial and accounting data which is 
required to apply the capitalization rules of section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder to the relevant facts and circumstances 
surrounding a particular item of inventory or cost; and
    (2) The total amounts of costs for which reasonable estimates and 
procedures are employed are not significant in comparison to the total 
restated value (including costs previously capitalized under the 
taxpayer's prior method of accounting) of the items or costs for the 
period in question.

Taxpayers who are not able to comply with the latter requirement of the 
preceding sentence because of the existence of a significant amount of 
costs which would require the use of estimates and procedures, shall 
revalue their inventories under the procedures provided in paragraph 
(e)(6) (iii) and (iv) of this section.
    (B) Estimates and procedures allowed. The estimates and procedures 
of this paragraph (e)(6)(ii) include--
    (1) The use of available information from more recent periods to 
estimate the amount and nature of inventory costs applicable to earlier 
periods; and
    (2) The use of available information with resepct to comparable 
items of inventory produced or acquired during the same period in order 
to estimate the costs associated with other items of inventory.
    (C) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (e)(6)(ii) are 
illustrated by the following examples. The principles set forth in these 
examples are applicable both to production and resale activities.

    Example (1). Taxpayer X lacks information for the years 1973 and 
earlier, regarding the amount of costs incurred in transporting finished 
goods from X's factory to X's warehouse and in storing those goods at 
the warehouse until their sale to customers. X determines that, for 1974 
and subsequent years, such transportation and storage costs constitute 4 
percent of the total costs of comparable goods under X's method of 
accounting for such years (the ``section 471 costs''), before 
revaluation under section 263A and the regulations thereunder. Under 
this paragraph (e)(6)(ii), X may assume that transportation and storage 
costs for the years 1973 and earlier constitute 4 percent of the total 
section 471 costs of such goods.
    Example (2). Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that 
for the year 1973 and earlier, taxpayer X used a different method of 
accounting for inventory costs whereunder significantly fewer costs were 
capitalized under section 471 than amounts capitalized in later years. 
Thus, the application of transportation and storage based on a

[[Page 444]]

percentage of costs for 1974 and later years would not constitute a 
reasonable estimate for use in earlier years. X may use the information 
from 1974 and later years, if appropriate adjustments are made to 
reflect the differences in inventory costs for the applicable years, 
including, for example: (i) increasing the percentage of costs which are 
intended to represent transportation and storage costs to reflect the 
aggregate differences in capitalized amounts under the two methods of 
accounting; or (ii) taking the absolute dollar amount of transportation 
and storage costs for comparable goods in inventory and applying that 
amount (adjusted for changes in general price levels, where appropriate) 
to goods associated with 1973 and prior periods.
    Example (3). Taxpayer Y lacks information for 1976 and earlier years 
regarding the amount of tax depreciation applicable to equipment used to 
manufacture inventories. For such years Y capitalized the amount of 
depreciation on such equipment equal to the depreciation which was 
treated as an inventoriable cost for ``book'' purposes, i.e., for 
purposes of financial reports. For years 1977 through 1980, Y determines 
that the requirement to capitalize the total amount of depreciation 
allowable for tax purposes under section 263A and the regulations 
thereunder, results in additional capitalized depreciation equal to 5 
percent of the total section 471 costs of the inventory property. Y may 
assume that the requirement to capitalize tax depreciation for the years 
1976 and earlier constitutes as additional 5 percent of the total 
section 471 cost of such goods.
    Example (4). Assume the same facts as in Example (3), except that 
for 1976 and earlier years, taxpayer Y generally did not treat 
depreciation of equipment and facilities as an inventoriable cost for 
book purposes. Thus, for reasons similar to those set forth in Example 
(2), Y may not use the revaluation percentages for tax depreciation in 
1977 through 1980, in determining the amount of such depreciation for 
1976 and earlier years. However, Y may use the available information for 
1977 through 1980, if appropriate adjustments, similar to the 
adjustments prescribed in Example (2), are made in determining the 
applicable amounts for 1976 and earlier years.
    Example (5). Taxpayer Z lacks information for certain years with 
respect to factory administrative costs, subject to capitalization under 
section 263A and the regulations thereunder, incurred in the production 
of inventory in factory A. Z does have sufficient information to 
determine factory administrative costs with respect to production of 
inventory in factory B, wherein inventory items were produced during the 
same years as factory A. Z may use the information from factory B to 
determine the appropriate amount of factory administrative costs to 
capitalize as inventory costs for comparable items produced in factory A 
during the same years.

    (iii) Weighted average method--(A) In general. Taxpayers using the 
FIFO method of accounting or the specific goods LIFO method of 
accounting for inventories may use the weighted average method as 
provided in this paragraph (e)(6)(iii), to estimate the amount of 
additional costs that must be allocated to inventories for prior years. 
The weighted average method under paragraph (e)(6)(iii) is only 
available to taxpayers who lack sufficient data to revalue their 
inventory costs under the facts and circumstances revaluation method 
provided for in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. Moreover, taxpayers 
who qualify for the use of the weighted average method under this 
paragraph (e)(6)(iii) shall utilize such method only with respect to 
items or costs for which they lack sufficient information to revalue 
under the capitalization rules of section 263A and the regulations 
thereunder. Particular items or costs must be revalued under the facts 
and circumstances revaluation method of this paragraph (e)(6)(ii), if 
sufficient information exists to make such a revaluation. If a taxpayer 
lacks sufficient information to otherwise apply the weighted average 
method under this paragraph (e)(6)(iii) (e.g., the taxpayer is unable to 
revalue the costs of any of its items in inventory due to a lack of 
information), then the taxpayer shall use reasonable estimates and 
procedures, as described in the facts and circumstances revaluation 
method under paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section, to whatever extent is 
necessary to allow the taxpayer to apply the weighted average method.
    (B) Weighted average method for specific goods LIFO taxpayers. (1) 
This paragraph (e)(6)(iii)(B) sets forth the mechanics of the weighted 
average method as applicable to LIFO taxpayers using the specific goods 
method of valuing inventories. Under the weighted average method, the 
inventory layers with respect to an item for which data is available are 
revalued under section 263A and the regulations thereunder and the 
increase in amount

[[Page 445]]

for each layer is expressed as a percentage of change from the cost in 
the layer as originally valued. A weighted average of the percentage of 
change for all layers for each type of good is computed and applied to 
all earlier layers for each type of good which lacks sufficient data to 
allow for revaluation. In the case of earlier layers for which 
sufficient data exists, such layers are to be revalued using actual 
data. In cases where sufficient data is not available to make a weighted 
average estimate with respect to a particular item of inventory, a 
weighted average increase is to be determined using all other inventory 
items revalued by the taxpayer in the same pool; this percentage 
increase is then used to revalue the cost of the item for which data is 
lacking. If the taxpayer lacks sufficient data to revalue any of the 
inventory items contained in a pool, then the weighted average increase 
of ``substantially similar'' items (as determined by principles similar 
to the rules applicable to dollar-value LIFO taxpayer in Sec. 1.472-
8(b)(3)) shall be applied in the revaluation of the items in such pool. 
If insufficient data exists with respect to all the items in a pool and 
to all items which are substantially similar (or such items do not 
exist), then the weighted average for all revalued items in the 
taxpayer's inventory shall be applied in revaluing items for which data 
is lacking.
    (2) Example.

    Example. Taxpayer M, a manufacturer, produces two different parts. 
Work-in-process inventory is recorded in terms of equivalent units of 
finished goods. M's records show the following at the end of 1986 under 
the specific goods LIFO inventory method:

    M has sufficient data to revalue the unit costs of product 1 under 
the new capitalization rules of section 263A and the regulations 
thereunder to $7.00 in 1984, $7.75 in 1985 and $9.00 in 1986. The 
available data for product 1 results in a weighted average percentage 
change for product 1 of 20.31 percent [(100 x ($7.00 - $6.00)) + (100 x 
($7.75 - $6.50)) + (50 x ($9.00 - $7.00)) divided by (100 x $6.00) + 
(100 x $6.50) + (50 x $7.00)]. M has sufficient data to revalue the unit 
costs of product 2 to $6.00 in 1985 and $7.00 in 1986. The available 
data for product 2 results in a weighted average percentage change of 
18.18 percent [(100 x ($6.00 - $5.00)) + (100  x  ($7.00 - $6.00)) 
divided by (100  x  $5.00) + (100 x $6.00)]. The revalued costs for 
product 1 for 1983 can be estimated by applying the weighted average 
increase determined for product 1 (20.31 percent) to the unit costs 
originally carried on the taxpayer's records for 1983. The estimated 
revalued unit cost in the case of product 1 would be $6.02 ($5.00 x 
1.2031). The costs of product 2 are redetermined in a similar manner 
for 1983 and 1984 by applying the weighted average increase determined 
for product 2 of 18.18 percent to the unit costs of $4.00 and $4.50 for 
1983 and 1984, yielding revalued unit costs of $4.73 and $5.32 
respectively. M's inventory would be revalued as follows:

    (C) Weighted average method for FIFO taxpayers. (1) This paragraph 
(e)(6)(iii)(C) sets forth the mechanics of the weighted average method 
as applicable to FIFO taxpayers. Under the weighted average method, an 
item in ending inventory for which sufficient

[[Page 446]]

data is not available for revaluation under section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder shall be revalued by using the weighted average 
percentage increase with respect to such item for the first subsequent 
year for which sufficient data is available. With respect to an item for 
which no subsequent data exists, such item shall be revalued by using 
the weighted average percentage increase with respect to all reasonably 
comparable items in the taxpayer's inventory for the same year or the 
first subsequent year for which sufficient data is available.
    (2) Example.

    Example. Taxpayer A uses the FIFO method of valuing inventories. A 
maintains inventories of bolts, two types of which it no longer 
produces. Bolt A was last produced in 1984 and 1985. The revaluation of 
the costs of Bolt A under this section for bolts produced in 1984 
results in a 20 percent increase of the costs of Bolt A. A portion of 
the inventory of bolt A, however, is attributable to 1983. A does not 
have sufficient data for revaluation of the 1983 layer for Bolt A. With 
respect to bolt A, A may apply the 20 percent increase determined for 
1984 to the 1983 production as an acceptable estimate. Bolt B was last 
produced in 1982 and no data exists which would allow revaluation of the 
inventory cost of bolt B pursuant to the rules of section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder. The inventories of all other bolts for which 
information is available are attributable to 1984 and 1985 production. 
Revaluation of the costs of these other bolts using available data 
results in an average increase in inventory costs of 15 percent for 1984 
production. With respect to bolt B, the overall 15 percent increase for 
W's inventory for 1984 may be used in revaluing the cost of bolt B.

    (iv) 3-year average method--(A) In general. Taxpayers using the 
dollar-value LIFO method of accounting for inventories may revalue all 
existing LIFO layers of a trade or business based on the 3-year average 
method as provided in this paragraph (e)(6)(iv). The 3-year average 
method is based on the weighted average percentage change (the ``3-year 
revaluation factor'') in the current costs of inventory for each LIFO 
pool based on the three most recent taxable years for which the taxpayer 
has sufficient information (typically, the three most recent taxable 
years of such trade or business). The 3-year revaluation factor is 
applied to all layers for each pool in beginning inventory in the year 
of change. The 3-year average method is available to dollar-value 
taxpayers who comply with the requirements of this paragraph (e)(6)(iv) 
regardless of whether such taxpayers lack sufficient data to revalue 
their inventory costs under the facts and circumstances revaluation 
method prescribed in paragraphs (e)(6)(ii) of this section. The 3-year 
average method must be applied with respect to all inventory in a 
taxpayer's trade or business. Taxpayers are not permitted to apply the 
method for the revaluation of some, but not all, inventory costs on the 
basis of pools, business units, or other measures of inventory amounts 
which do not constitute a separate trade or business. Under the 3-year 
average method, for purposes of determining future indexes, the year 
prior to the year of change becomes a new base year, and all costs are 
restated in new base year costs for purposes of extending such costs in 
future years. However, costs associated with old layers retain their 
separate identity within the base year, with such layers being merely 
restated in terms of the new base year index. For example, for purposes 
of determining whether a particular layer has been invaded, each layer 
shall retain its separate identity; thus, if a decrement in an inventory 
pool occurs, layers accumulated in more recent years shall be viewed as 
invaded first, in order of priority. If a taxpayer lacks sufficient 
information to otherwise apply the 3-year average method under this 
paragraph (e)(6)(iv) (e.g., the taxpayer is unable to revalue the costs 
of any of its LIFO pools for three years due to a lack of information), 
then the taxpayer shall use reasonable estimates and procedures, as 
described in the facts and circumstances revaluation method under 
paragraph (e)(6)(ii) of this section, to whatever extent is necessary to 
allow the taxpayer to apply the 3-year average method.
    (B) Consecutive year requirement. Under the 3-year average method, 
if sufficient production data is available to calculate the revaluation 
factor for more than three years, the taxpayer may use data from such 
additional years in determining the average percentage increase only if 
the additional

[[Page 447]]

years are consecutive years prior to the year of change. The requirement 
under the preceding sentence to use consecutive years is applicable 
under this method regardless of whether any inventory costs in beginning 
inventory as of the year of change are viewed as incurred in, or 
attributable to, those consecutive years under the LIFO method. Thus, 
the requirement to use data from consecutive years may result in using 
information from a year in which no LIFO increment occurred. For 
example, if a taxpayer has sufficient data to revalue its inventory for 
the years 1981 through 1986, the taxpayer may calculate the revaluation 
factor using all six years. If, however, the taxpayer has sufficient 
data to revalue its inventory for the years 1980 through 1982, and 1984 
through 1986, only the years consecutive to the year of change (i.e., 
1984 through 1986) may be used in determining the revaluation factor. 
Similarly, for example, a taxpayer with LIFO increments in 1985, 1983, 
and 1982 may not calculate the revaluation factor based on the data from 
those years alone, but instead must use the data from consecutive years 
for which the taxpayer has information.
    (C) Example.

    Example. G, a calendar year taxpayer, first adopted the dollar value 
LIFO method in 1981, using a single pool and the double extension 
method. G's beginning LIFO inventory for the year of change is as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 LIFO   
                                      Base year     Index      carrying 
                                        costs                   value

    G is able to recompute total inventoriable costs incurred under the 
rules of section 263A and the regulations thereunder for the three 
preceding taxable years as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1986 layer.......................       54,400       70,720          .30

      Total......................      132,900      170,245          .28
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Applying the average revaluation factor of .28 to each layer, the 
inventory is restated as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 LIFO

                                        costs                   value

1982 layer.........................        6,400       1.30        8,320
1983 layer.........................        2,560       1.35        3,456
1984 layer.........................            0       1.40            0
1985 layer.........................        5,120       1.50        7,680

      Total........................       43,520  .........       53,760
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The adjustment required by section 481(a) is the difference between 
(i) the revalued costs of the taxpayer's inventory under the new 
capitalization rules, and (ii) the costs of the taxpayer's inventory 
before the revaluation required under section 263A and the regulations 
thereunder. Based on these facts, the adjustment required by section 
481(a) would be equal to $11,760 ($53,760-$42,000). In addition, the 
year prior to the year of change in method of accounting shall be 
treated as a new base year for the purposes of determining the LIFO 
index in future years. This requires that layers in years prior to the 
base year be restated in terms of the new base year index. With respect 
to G, the restated inventory would be as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (7) Adjustments to inventory costs from prior years--(i) General 
rule. (A) The use of the revaluation factor, based on current costs, to 
estimate the revaluation of prior inventory layers under the 3-year 
average method as described in paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of this section, may 
result in an allocation of costs that include amounts attributable to 
costs not incurred during the year in which the layer arose. To the 
extent that a taxpayer can demonstrate that costs which contributed to 
the determination of the revaluation factor could not

[[Page 448]]

have affected a prior year, the revaluation factor as applied to that 
year may be adjusted, under the restatement adjustment procedure, as 
described in paragraph (e)(9) of this section. Except as provided in 
paragraph (e)(7)(iii) of this section, the determination that a cost 
could not have affected a prior year shall be made by a taxpayer only 
upon showing that the type of cost incurred during the years used to 
calculate the revaluation factor (the ``revaluation years''), was not 
present during such prior year. An item of cost will not be eligible for 
the restatement adjustment procedure simply by reason of the fact that 
the cost varies in amount from year to year or that the same type of 
cost is described or referred to by a different name from year to year. 
Thus, the restatement adjustment procedure allowed under paragraph 
(e)(9) of this section shall not be available in a prior year with 
respect to a particular cost if the same type of cost was incurred in 
both the revaluation years and in such prior year, although the amount 
of such cost (and the name or description thereof) may vary.
    (B) The provisions of this paragraph (e)(7) shall also be applicable 
to taxpayers using the weighted average method in revaluing inventories 
under paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of this section. Thus, to the extent that a 
taxpayer can demonstrate that costs which contributed to the 
determination of the restatement of a particular year or item could not 
have affected a prior year or item, the taxpayer may adjust the 
revaluation of that prior year or item accordingly under the weighted 
average method. All the requirements and definitions, however, 
applicable to the restatement adjustment procedure under this paragraph 
(e)(7) shall fully apply to a taxpayer using the weighted average method 
to revalue inventories.
    (ii) Examples of costs eligible for restatement adjustment 
procedure.

    Example 1. Assume the taxpayer, A, introduced a defined benefit 
pension plan in 1984, and made the plan available to personnel whose 
labor costs were (directly or indirectly) properly allocable to 
production or resale activities. A determines the revaluation factor 
based on data available for the years 1984 through 1986, for which the 
pension plan was in existence. Based on these facts, the costs of the 
pension plan in the revaluation years are eligible for the restatement 
adjustment procedure for years prior to 1984.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that a 
defined contribution plan was available, during prior years, to 
personnel whose labor costs were properly allocable to production or 
resale activities. The defined contribution plan was terminated before 
the introduction of the defined benefit plan in 1984. Based on these 
facts, the costs of the defined benefit pension plan in the revaluation 
years are not eligible for the restatement adjustment procedure with 
respect to years for which the defined contribution plan existed.
    Example 3. Assume that the taxpayer, B established a service 
department in 1981, substantially all of the activities of which were 
devoted to administering the taxpayer's compliance with certain 
governmental regulations which were first issued and made effective for 
the year 1981. The governmental regulations issued in 1981 dealt with 
certain activities of the taxpayer which, under prior law, had not been 
regulated by any governmental body. B determines the revaluation factor 
based on data available for the years 1984 through 1986, for which the 
service department was in existence. Based on these facts, the costs of 
the service department in the revaluation years are eligible for the 
restatement adjustment procedure for 1980 and prior years.
    Example 4. Assume that the taxpayer, C, established a security 
department in 1976, to patrol and safeguard the production and warehouse 
areas used in C's trade or business. Prior to 1976, C had not been 
required to utilize security personnel in its trade or business; C 
established the security department in 1976 in response to increasing 
vandalism and theft at its plant locations. Based on these facts, the 
costs of the security department are eligible for the restatement 
adjustment procedure for years prior to 1976.
    Example 5. Assume that the taxpayer, D, established a payroll 
department in 1978 to process the company's weekly payroll. In the years 
1974 through 1977, D engaged the services of an outside vendor to 
process the company's payroll. Prior to 1974, D's payroll processing 
department was done by D's accounting department, which was responsible 
for payroll processing as well as for other accounting functions. Based 
on these facts, the costs of the payroll department are not eligible for 
the restatement adjustment procedure. D was incurring the same type of 
costs in earlier years as D was incurring in the payroll department in 
1978 and subsequent years, although these costs were designated by a 
different name or description.

[[Page 449]]

    Example 6. Assume that the taxpayer, E, established a legal 
department in 1976 to provide the company with legal services on a 
variety of matters. Prior to 1976, E engaged the services of outside 
counsel to obtain any necessary legal services. Based on these facts, 
the costs of the legal department are not eligible for the restatement 
adjustment procedure.
    Example 7. Assume that the taxpayer, F, establishes a computer 
services department in 1977 in order to automate the processing and 
recordkeeping activities of the company. Prior to 1977, the processing 
and recordkeeping activities of the company had been performed by 
bookkeepers and other personnel in the company's accounting department. 
Based on these facts, the costs of the legal department are not eligible 
for the restatement adjustment procedure.

    (iii) Exceptions from general rule. Costs which are described in 
this paragraph (e)(7) (iii) shall be eligible for the restatement 
adjustment procedure under paragraph (e)(9) of this section even though 
such costs do not otherwise meet the requirements for such eligibility 
under the provisions of paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section. Except as 
provided in this paragraph (e)(7)(iii), no other costs shall be eligible 
for the restatement procedure unless those costs satisfy the 
requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section. Costs described in 
this paragraph which are eligible for the restatement adjustment 
procedure are:
    (A) Costs attributable to different depreciation and cost recovery 
(``depreciation'') methods used for Federal income tax purposes, except 
that no adjustment shall be made for ``applicable pre-cutoff years'' as 
defined in paragraph (e)(8) of this section; and
    (B) Differences in the percentage of fixed indirect production costs 
which were expensed due to unutilized capacity by taxpayers in prior 
years using the practical capacity concept, as described in Sec. 1.471-
11(d)(4), subject to the consecutive year requirement as described in 
paragraph (e)(7)(iv) of this section. Moreover, any taxpayer adjusting 
the revaluation factor with respect to practical capacity shall make 
such adjustment after the revaluation factor is adjusted for all other 
eligible costs as permitted under section 263A and the regulations 
thereunder. In addition, if such other eligible costs are fixed indirect 
production costs, the adjustments attributable to such eligible costs 
shall be taken into account in determining the amount of fixed indirect 
production costs which are utilized in adjusting the revaluation factor 
with respect to the practical capacity concept.
    (iv) Consecutive year requirement. Any taxpayer adjusting the 
revaluation factor to reflect differences in the percentages of fixed 
indirect production costs which were expensed under the practical 
capacity concept, shall only make such adjustments for consecutive 
years. Thus, for example, assume a taxpayer's beginning inventory 
balance as of the year of change in method of accounting consists of 
costs accumulated in years 1983, 1982, 1980 and 1978. The taxpayer may 
not apply the restatement adjustment procedure with respect to the 
practical capacity concept for the years 1983 and 1980, unless such 
procedure is similarly applied for 1982. However, the taxpayer may apply 
the restatement adjustment procedure only to the year 1983 (or for the 
years 1983 and 1982), with no restatement adjustment with respect to the 
practical capacity concept occurring for earlier years.
    (v) Example.

    Example. Assume that taxpayer, A, depreciated its equipment and 
facilities using the accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS) for the 
taxable years 1981 through 1986. A determines the revaluation factor 
based on data available for the years 1984 through 1986. With respect to 
taxable years prior to 1981, A used depreciation methods for federal 
income tax purposes which were less accelerated in nature than the ACRS 
system. Due to the requirement under section 263A and the regulations 
thereunder that all tax depreciation (including the accelerated 
component thererof) incurred with respect to production equipment and 
facilities be capitalized, the use of the revaluation factor determined 
by reference to years 1984 through 1986 results in a higher revaluation 
factor than the factor which would be applicable for years prior to 1981 
based on the facts and circumstances of those years. Although the 
differences in depreciation methods reflect only varying amounts of the 
same type of costs, such differences are eligible for the adjustment 
prescribed in paragraph (e)(9) of this section, subject to the 
requirements of this paragraph (e)(8) regarding any applicable pre-
cutoff years.


[[Page 450]]


    (8) Applicable pre-cutoff years. A taxpayer may not adjust the 
revaluation factor by reason of the difference between depreciation 
methods used for federal income tax purposes, with respect to an 
applicable pre-cutoff year, as defined in this paragraph. A year will be 
considered as an applicable pre-cutoff year if (i) for such year, the 
taxpayer included in inventoriable costs under its method of accounting, 
less than 10 percent of ``book'' depreciation taken for that year with 
respect to the taxpayer's equipment and facilities used for production 
purposes; and (ii) with respect to the revaluation years, the taxpayer 
included in inventoriable costs under its method of accounting 
substantially all (i.e., at least 80 percent) of ``book'' depreciation 
taken for that year with respect to the taxpayer's equipment and 
facilities used for production purposes. Book depreciation, for this 
paragraph, shall mean the total depreciation taken for such year with 
respect to equipment and facilities for financial reporting purposes, 
regardless of whether such book depreciation was treated as an 
inventoriable cost for such financial reporting purposes. A year may be 
treated as an applicable pre-cutoff year under this paragraph (e)(8) if 
the taxpayer utilized either of the cut-off methods described in 
Sec. 1.471-11(e)(3)(ii)(B) (1) or (2) (i.e., cut-off methods available 
under the transition rules to the full absorption method of accounting) 
and the year otherwise qualifies as an applicable cut-off year under 
this paragraph. Similarly, a year may be treated as a pre-cut-off year 
under this paragraph, if the taxpayer changed its method of accounting 
for inventoriable costs and utilized a cut-off method to effectuate such 
change, regardless of whether the change in method of accounting was 
allowed under the Code, or was approved by the Commissioner. Although a 
particular year may be an applicable pre-cutoff year under this 
paragraph, the taxpayer will not be precluded from adjusting the 
revaluation factor with respect to differences between depreciation 
methods used for federal income tax purposes, for years subsequent to 
the applicable pre-cutoff year.
    (9) Restatement Adjustment Procedure--(i) In general. (A) This 
paragraph (e)(9) provides a restatement adjustment procedure whereunder 
taxpayers may adjust the restatement of inventory costs in prior taxable 
years in order to produce a different restated value than the value that 
would otherwise occur through application of the revaluation factor to 
such prior taxable years.
    (B) Under the restatement adjustment procedure as applied to a 
particular prior year, a taxpayer shall determine the particular items 
of cost which are eligible for the restatement adjustment with respect 
to such prior year. The taxpayer shall then recompute, by using 
reasonable estimates and procedures, the total inventoriable costs which 
would have been incurred for each revaluation year under--
    (1) The taxpayer's previous method of accounting for inventories 
used during the revaluation year, and
    (2) The capitalization rules of section 263A and the regulations 
thereunder as applied to production activities in the revaluation year, 
by making appropriate adjustments in the data for such revaluation year 
to reflect the particular costs eligible for adjustment.
    (C) The taxpayer shall then compute the total percentage change with 
respect to each revaluation year, using the revised estimates of total 
inventoriable costs for such year as described in this paragraph 
(e)(9)(i)(B). The percentage change shall be determined by calculating 
the ratio of:
    (1) The revised total of the inventoriable costs for such 
revaluation year under the capitalization rules of section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder, to--
    (2) The revised total of the inventoriable costs for such 
revaluation year under the prior method of accounting used for such 
year.
    (D) A weighted average of the resulting percentage change for all 
revaluation years would then be calculated, and the resulting average 
would then be applied to the prior year in issue.
    (ii) Examples of restatement adjustment procedure

    Example 1. Assume that taxpayer A is eligible to make a restatement 
adjustment by

[[Page 451]]

reason of the costs of a defined benefit pension plan which was 
introduced in 1984, during the revaluation period. The revaluation 
factor, before adjustment of data to reflect the pension costs, is as 
provided in the example in paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(C) of this section. 
Thus, for example, with respect to the year 1984, the total 
inventoriable costs under prior law were $35,000 the total inventoriable 
costs under section 263A and the regulations thereunder were $45,150, 
and the percentage restatement change for that year was .29. Under the 
prior method of accounting used by A during 1984, none of the pension 
costs were included as inventoriable costs. Thus, the total 
inventoriable cost under prior law would remain at $35,000 if the 
pension plan had not been in existence. Under the restatement adjustment 
procedure, A determines that the total inventoriable costs under section 
263A and the regulations thereunder for 1984, if the pension plan had 
not been in existence, would have been $42,000. The restatement 
adjustment for 1984 determined under this paragraph (e)(9) would then be 
equal to .20. A would make similar calculations with respect to 1985 and 
1986. The weighted average of such amounts for each of the three years 
in the revaluation period would then be determined as in the example in 
paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(C) of this section. Such weighted average would be 
used to revalue cost layers for years for which the pension plan was not 
in existence. Such revalued layers would then be viewed as restated in 
compliance with the requirements of this paragraph. With respect to cost 
layers incurred during years for which the pension plan was in 
existence, no adjustment of the revaluation factor would occur, i.e., 
the revaluation factor would be equal to .29.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that a 
portion of the pension costs were included as inventoriable costs under 
the prior method of accounting used by A during 1984. Under the 
restatement adjustment procedure, A determines that the total 
inventoriable costs under the prior method of accounting for 1984, if 
the pension plan had not been in existence, would have been $34,000. 
Similarly, A determines that the total inventoriable costs under section 
263A and the regulations thereunder for 1984, if the pension plan had 
not been in existence, would have been $42,000. The restatement 
adjustment for 1984 determined under this paragraph (e)(9) would then be 
equal to .24. A would make similar calculations with respect to 1985 and 
1986. The weighted average of such amounts for each of the three years 
in the revaluation period would then be determined as in the example in 
paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(C) of this section. Such weighted average would be 
used to revalue cost layers for years for which the pension plan was not 
in existence.
    Example 3. Assume that taxpayer A is eligible to make a restatement 
adjustment by virtue of using ACRS depreciation during the revaluation 
period. With respect to certain taxable years before 1981, A used the 
asset depreciation range and class life system (ADR) of depreciation. 
The revaluation factor before adjustment of data to reflect the 
different depreciation methods is the same factor as provided in Example 
(1), i.e., a percentage restatement change for 1984 of .29. Under the 
restatement adjustment procedure, A determines, using reasonable 
assumptions and estimates, the total amount of ADR depreciation which 
would have been allowable with respect to A's equipment and facilities 
in 1984, had the ADR system been in effect for such year (and for all 
relevant prior years), and had the ACRS system and deductions thereunder 
not been available. Assuming that only ADR depreciation had been used in 
1984 for all of A's equipment and facilities, A determines the total 
inventoriable costs which would have been incurred under the 
capitalization rules of section 263A and the regulations thereunder, 
i.e. rules which require the capitalization of all tax depreciation 
taken with respect to equipment and facilities. A determines that such 
amount is equal to $40,000. The restatement adjustment determined under 
this paragraph (e)(9) would then be equal to .14. The .14 restatement 
adjustment would be used to revalue costs layers for years for which 
only the ADR system had actually been used by A. With respect to cost 
layers incurred during years for which ACRS depreciation was actually 
taken by A, no adjustment of the revaluation factor would occur.
    Example 4. Assume that taxpayer A is eligible to make a restatement 
adjustment by virtue of differences in the percentage of fixed indirect 
production costs which were expensed under the practical capacity 
concept. Assume that during the revaluation period, A's production 
facilities functioned, on a weighted average basis, at 60 percent of 
practical capacity. Assume the revaluation factor before adjustment of 
data to reflect the differences in operating capacity is the same factor 
as in Example (1), i.e., a percentage restatement change for 1984 of 
.29. A determines that during the taxable year 1983, A's facilities 
operated at 70 percent of capacity. Under the restatement procedure, A 
determines, using reasonable assumptions and estimates, the total amount 
of inventoriable costs under A's prior method of accounting which would 
have been incurred in 1984, had the facilities been operating at 70 
percent of capacity for that year. Using this information, A determines 
that the total inventoriable costs under A's prior method of accounting 
for 1984 would have been $38,000. (This difference is attributable to 
the fact that A's facilities functioned at a higher rate of capacity in 
1983 than in 1984). The

[[Page 452]]

total inventoriable costs under section 263A and the regulations 
thereunder continue to be $45,150. The restatement adjustment determined 
under this paragraph would then be equal to .19. A would make similar 
calculations with respect to 1985 and 1986. The weighted average of such 
amounts for each of the three years in the revaluation period would then 
be determined as in the example in paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(C) of this 
section. Such weighted average would be used to revalue the cost layer 
for 1983. With respect to cost layers incurred during the revaluation 
years, no adjustment of the revaluation factor would occur. As provided 
in paragraph (e)(7)(iv) of this section, any taxpayer using the 
restatement adjustment procedure with respect to the practical capacity 
concept must do so for consecutive years.
    Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example (4), except that 
during the taxable year 1983, B's facilities functioned at 50 percent of 
capacity. Using this information, B determines that the total 
inventoriable costs under B's prior method of accounting for 1984 would 
have been $32,000 had the facilities been operating at 50 percent of 
capacity for that year. The total inventoriable costs under section 263A 
and the regulations thereunder continue to be $45,150. The restatement 
adjustment determined under this paragraph would then be equal to .41. A 
would make similar calculations with respect to 1985 and 1986. The 
weighted average of such amounts for each of the three years in the 
revaluation period would then be determined as in the example in 
paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(C) of this section. Such weighted average would be 
used to revalue the cost layer for 1983. With respect to cost layers 
incurred during the revaluation years, no adjustment of the revaluation 
factor would occur.

    (10) Anti-abuse rule--(i) In general. Section 263A(h)(1) provides 
that the Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary 
or appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 263A, including 
regulations to prevent the use of related parties, pass-thru entities, 
or intermediaries to avoid the application of section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder. One way in which the application of section 263A 
and the regulations thereunder would be otherwise avoided is through the 
use of entities described in the preceding sentence in such a manner as 
to effectively avoid the necessity to restate beginning inventory 
balances under the change in method of accounting required under section 
263A and the regulations thereunder.
    (ii) Deemed avoidance of this section--(A) Scope. For purposes of 
this paragraph, the avoidance of the application of section 263A and 
section 263A and the regulations thereunder will be deemed to occur if a 
taxpayer using the LIFO method of accounting for inventories, transfers 
inventory property to a related corporation in a transaction described 
in section 351, and such transfer occurs:
    (1) On or before the beginning of the transferor's taxable year 
beginning in 1987; and
    (2) After September 18, 1986.
    (B) General rule. Any transaction described in paragraph 
(e)(10)(ii)(A) of section 263A and the regulations thereunder shall be 
treated in the following manner:
    (1) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary (e.g., section 
381), the tranferee corporation shall be required to revalue the 
inventories acquired from the transferor under the provisions of this 
paragraph (e) relating to the change in method of accounting and the 
section 481(a) adjustment, as if the inventories had never been 
transferred and were still in the hands of the transferor; and
    (2) Absent an election as described in paragraph (e)(10)(iii) of 
section 263A and the regulations thereunder, the transferee shall 
account for the inventories acquired from the transferor by treating 
such inventories as if they were contained in the transferee's LIFO 
layer(s).
    (iii) Election to use transferor's LIFO layers. If a transferee 
described in paragraph (e)(10)(ii) of this section so elects, the 
transferee shall account for the inventories acquired from the 
transferor by allocating such inventories to LIFO layers corresponding 
to the layers to which such properties were properly allocated by the 
transferor, prior to their transfer. The transferee shall account for 
such inventories for all subsequent periods with reference to such 
layers to which the LIFO costs were allocated. Any such election shall 
be made on a statement attached to the timely filed federal income of 
the transferee for the first taxable year for which section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder applies to the transferee.

[[Page 453]]

    (iv) Tax avoidance intent not required. The provisions of paragraph 
(e)(10)(ii) of this section shall apply to any transaction described 
therein, without regard to whether such transaction was consummated with 
an intention to avoid federal income taxes.
    (v) Related corporation. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(10), a 
taxpayer is related to a corporation if (A) the relationship between 
such persons is described in section 267(b)(1), or (B) such persons are 
engaged in trades or businesses under common control (within the meaning 
of paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 52).
    (vi) Cross reference. See Sec. 1.142-2T(h) regarding certain 
limitations on changes in taxable years that may apply, in some 
circumstances, to transactions described in this paragraph (e)(10).
    (11) Change in methods in accounting--(i) In general. Taxpayers who 
are required to change their method of accounting under section 263A and 
the regulations thereunder may automatically change such method under 
the provisions of this paragraph (e)(11). The Commissioner may require 
such change in method of accounting under this paragraph (e)(11) to be 
made in accordance with such additional procedures as the Commissioner 
may prescribe, including the filing of an application to effect such 
change, at such time and in such a manner as the Commissioner may 
determine.
    (ii) Only certain changes allowed. This paragraph shall only apply 
to changes in method of accounting required under section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder. Taxpayers desiring to change their method of 
accounting, other than with respect to changes in method of accounting 
described in the preceding sentence, shall submit an application for 
change in accounting method under the administrative procedures 
applicable to such taxpayers at such time, including the applicable 
procedures regarding the time and place of filing the application for 
change in method of accounting.
    (iii) Definition of changes in method required. For purposes of this 
paragraph (e)(11), a change in method of accounting is required under 
this paragraph (e)(11) if such change is necessary in order for the 
taxpayer to properly capitalize and allocate costs with respect to 
production and resale activities in the manner prescribed in section 
263A and the regulations thereunder. A change in method of accounting 
may be described in the preceding sentence irrespective of whether the 
taxpayer's previous method of accounting resulted in the capitalization 
of more (or fewer) costs than the costs required to be capitalized under 
section 263A and the regulations thereunder, and irrespective of whether 
the taxpayer's previous method of accounting was a correct method under 
the law in effect at that time. A change in method of accounting is not 
required under this paragraph (e)(11) if such change relates to factors 
other than those described herein. For example, a required change in 
method of accounting does not include a change from an inventory 
valuation method to another inventory valuation method, such as--
    (A) A change from LIFO (or FIFO) to FIFO (or LIFO); or
    (B) A change in accounting method for an inventory of securities 
from market value to cost.

In addition, a required change in method of accounting does not include 
a change within inventory valuation methods, such as a change from the 
``double-extension'' method to the ``link-chain method'', or a change in 
the method used for determining the number of pools.
    (iv) Noncompliance with this provision. Taxpayers who are required 
to change their method of accounting under section 263A and the 
regulations thereunder and who fail to comply with the requirements of 
this paragraph (e)(11) shall be considered as using an improper method 
of accounting under the Code Cf., section 446(f).
    (v) Ordering rule for other changes in method of accounting. A 
change in method of accounting required under this section for any 
taxable year shall be deemed to occur prior to any other change in 
method of accounting for such taxable year. Thus, for example, assume a 
calendar year taxpayer who produces inventory property is required to 
change its method of accounting under section 263A and the regulations 
thereunder for its taxable

[[Page 454]]

year beginning January 1, 1987. The taxpayer also desires to change from 
the LIFO to the FIFO method for the same taxable year, and complies with 
all necessary procedures to effectuate such change, including obtaining 
the consent of the Commissioner to such change in method of accounting, 
if required under such procedures. The change in method of accounting 
required by section 263A shall be deemed to occur first, and such change 
in method of accounting (including the calculation of the section 481(a) 
adjustment) shall be based on the taxpayer's inventory records existing 
as of January 1, 1987, under the LIFO method used by the taxpayer. After 
the change in method of accounting under section 263A is deemed to be 
made, and the amount of the resulting section 481(a) adjustment is 
determined, the change in method of accounting from LIFO to FIFO is then 
deemed to occur.
    (f) This section is effective for costs incurred after December 31, 
1986, in taxable years ending after such date. In the case of property 
that is inventory in the hands of the taxpayer, this section is 
effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.

Sec. 1.263A-8  Requirement to capitalize interest.

    (a) In general--(1) General rule. Capitalization of interest under 
the avoided cost method described in Sec. 1.263A-9 is required with 
respect to the production of designated property described in paragraph 
(b) of this section.
    (2) Treatment of interest required to be capitalized. In general, 
interest that is capitalized under this section is treated as a cost of 
the designated property and is recovered in accordance with Sec. 1.263A-
1(c)(4). Interest capitalized by reason of assets used to produce 
designated property (within the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-11(d)) is added 
to the basis of the designated property rather than the bases of the 
assets used to produce the designated property. Interest capitalized 
with respect to designated property that includes both components 
subject to an allowance for depreciation or depletion and components not 
subject to an allowance for depreciation or depletion is ratably 
allocated among, and is treated as a cost of, components that are 
subject to an allowance for depreciation or depletion.
    (3) Methods of accounting under section 263A(f). Except as otherwise 
provided, methods of accounting and other computations under 
Secs. 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15 are applied on a taxpayer, as opposed 
to a separate and distinct trade or business, basis.
    (4) Special definitions--(i) Related person. Except as otherwise 
provided, for purposes of Secs. 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15, a person is 
related to a taxpayer if their relationship is described in section 
267(b) or 707(b).
    (ii) Placed in service. For purposes of Secs. 1.263A-8 through 
1.263A-15, placed in service has the same meaning as set forth in 
Sec. 1.46-3(d).
    (b) Designated property--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, designated property means 
any property that is produced and that is either:
    (i) Real property; or
    (ii) Tangible personal property (as defined in Sec. 1.263A-2(a)(2)) 
which meets any of the following criteria:
    (A) Property with a class life of 20 years or more under section 168 
(long-lived property), but only if the property is not property 
described in section 1221(l) in the hands of the taxpayer or a related 
person,
    (B) Property with an estimated production period (as defined in 
Sec. 1.263A-12) exceeding 2 years (2-year property), or
    (C) Property with an estimated production period exceeding 1 year 
and an estimated cost of production exceeding $1,000,000 (1-year 
property).
    (2) Special rules--(i) Application of thresholds. The thresholds 
described in paragraphs (b)(l)(ii)(A), (B), and (C) of this section are 
applied separately for each unit of property (as defined in Sec. 1.263A-
10).
    (ii) Relevant activities and costs. For purposes of determining 
whether property is designated property, all activities and costs are 
taken into account if

[[Page 455]]

they are performed or incurred by, or for, the taxpayer or any related 
persons and they directly benefit or are incurred by reason of the 
production of the property.
    (iii) Production period and cost of production. For purposes of 
applying the classification thresholds under paragraphs (b)(l)(ii) (B) 
and (C) of this section to a unit of property, the taxpayer is required, 
at the beginning of the production period, to reasonably estimate the 
production period and the total cost of production for the unit of 
property. The taxpayer must maintain contemporaneous written records 
supporting the estimates and classification. If the estimates are 
reasonable based on the facts in existence at the beginning of the 
production period, the taxpayer's classification of the property is not 
modified in subsequent periods, even if the actual length of the 
production period or the actual cost of production differs from the 
estimates. To be considered reasonable, estimates of the production 
period and the total cost of production must include anticipated expense 
and time for delay, rework, change orders, and technological, design or 
other problems. To the extent that several distinct activities related 
to the production of the property are expected to occur simultaneously, 
the period during which these distinct activities occur is not counted 
more than once. The bases of assets used to produce a unit of property 
(within the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-11(d)) and any interest that would be 
required to be capitalized if a unit of property were designated 
property are disregarded in making estimates of the total cost of 
production for purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii).
    (3) Excluded property. Designated property does not include:
    (i) Timber and evergreen trees that are more than 6 years old when 
severed from the roots, or
    (ii) Property produced by the taxpayer for use by the taxpayer other 
than in a trade or business or an activity conducted for profit.
    (4) De minimis rule--(i) In general. Designated property does not 
include property for which--
    (A) The production period does not exceed 90 days; and
    (B) The total production expenditures do not exceed $1,000,000 
divided by the number of days in the production period.
    (ii) Determination of total production expenditures. For purposes of 
determining whether the condition of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this 
section is met with respect to property, the cost of land, the adjusted 
basis of property used to produce property, and interest that would be 
capitalized with respect to property if it were designated property are 
excluded from total production expenditures.
    (c) Definition of real property--(1) In general. Real property 
includes land, unsevered natural products of land, buildings, and 
inherently permanent structures. Any interest in real property of a type 
described in this paragraph (c), including fee ownership, co-ownership, 
a leasehold, an option, or a similar interest is real property under 
this section. Real property includes the structural components of both 
buildings and inherently permanent structures, such as walls, 
partitions, doors, wiring, plumbing, central air conditioning and 
heating systems, pipes and ducts, elevators and escalators, and other 
similar property. Tenant improvements to a building that are inherently 
permanent or otherwise classified as real property within the meaning of 
this paragraph (c)(1) are real property under this section. However, 
property produced for sale that is not real property in the hands of the 
taxpayer or a related person, but that may be incorporated into real 
property by an unrelated buyer, is not treated as real property by the 
producing taxpayer (e.g., bricks, nails, paint, and windowpanes).
    (2) Unsevered natural products of land. Unsevered natural products 
of land include growing crops and plants, mines, wells, and other 
natural deposits. Growing crops and plants, however, are real property 
only if the preproductive period of the crop or plant exceeds 2 years.
    (3) Inherently permanent structures. Inherently permanent structures 
include property that is affixed to real property and that will 
ordinarily remain affixed for an indefinite period of time, such as 
swimming pools, roads, bridges,

[[Page 456]]

tunnels, paved parking areas and other pavements, special foundations, 
wharves and docks, fences, inherently permanent advertising displays, 
inherently permanent outdoor lighting facilities, railroad tracks and 
signals, telephone poles, power generation and transmission facilities, 
permanently installed telecommunications cables, broadcasting towers, 
oil and gas pipelines, derricks and storage equipment, grain storage 
bins and silos. For purposes of this section, affixation to real 
property may be accomplished by weight alone. Property may constitute an 
inherently permanent structure even though it is not classified as a 
building for purposes of former section 48(a)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.48-1. Any 
property not othewise described in this paragraph (c)(3) that 
constitutes other tangible property under the principles of former 
section 48(a)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.48-1(d) is treated for the purposes of 
this section as an inherently permanent structure.
    (4) Machinery--(i) Treatment. A structure that is property in the 
nature of machinery or is essentially an item of machinery or equipment 
is not an inherently permanent structure and is not real property. In 
the case, however, of a building or inherently permanent structure that 
includes property in the nature of machinery as a structural component, 
the property in the nature of machinery is real property.
    (ii) Certain factors not determinative. A structure may be an 
inherently permanent structure, and not property in the nature of 
machinery or essentially an item of machinery, even if the structure is 
necessary to operate or use, supports, or is otherwise associated with, 
machinery.
    (d) Production--(1) Definition of produce. Produce is defined as 
provided in section 263A(g) and Sec. 1.263A-2(a)(1)(i).
    (2) Property produced under a contract--(i) Customer. A taxpayer is 
treated as producing any property that is produced for the taxpayer (the 
customer) by another party (the contractor) under a contract with the 
taxpayer or an intermediary. Property produced under a contract is 
designated property to the customer if it is real property or tangible 
personal property that satisfies the classification thresholds described 
in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. If property produced under a 
contract will become part of a unit of designated property produced by 
the customer in the customer's hands, the property produced under the 
contract is designated property to the customer.
    (ii) Contractor. Property produced under a contract is designated 
property to the contractor if it is real property, 2-year property, or 
1-year property and the property produced under the contract is not 
excluded by reason of paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section.
    (iii) Definition of a contract. For purposes of this paragraph 
(d)(2), contract has the same meaning as under Sec. 1.263A-
2(a)(1)(ii)(B)(2).
    (iv) Determination of whether thresholds are satisfied. In the case 
of tangible personal property produced under a contract, the customer 
and the contractor each determine under this paragraph (d)(2), whether 
the property satisfies the classification thresholds described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Thus, tangible personal property 
may be designated property with respect to either, or both, the customer 
and the contractor. The provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this 
section are modified as set forth in this paragraph (d)(2)(iv) for 
purposes of determining whether tangible personal property produced 
under a contract is 2-year property or 1-year property.
    (A) Customer. In determining a customer's estimated cost of 
production, the customer takes into account costs and payments that are 
reasonably expected to be incurred by the customer, but does not take 
into account costs incurred (or to be incurred) by an unrelated 
contractor. In determining the customer's estimated length of the 
production period, the production period is treated as beginning on the 
earlier of the date the contract is executed or the date that the 
customer's accumulated production expenditures for the unit are at least 
5 percent of the customer's total estimated production expenditures for 
the unit. The customer, however, may elect to treat the production 
period as beginning on the date the sum of the accumulated production 
expenditures of the contractor (or contractors if more than one 
contractor is producing components for the unit of

[[Page 457]]

property) and of the customer are at least 5 percent of the customer's 
estimated production expenditures for the unit.
    (B) Contractor. In determining a contractor's estimated cost of 
production, the contractor takes into account only the costs that are 
reasonably expected to be incurred by the contractor, without any 
reduction for payments from the customer. In determining the 
contractor's estimated length of the production period, the production 
period is treated as beginning on the date the contractor's accumulated 
production expenditures (without any reduction for payments from the 
customer) are at least 5 percent of the contractor's total estimated 
accumulated production expenditures.
    (v) Exclusion for property subject to long-term contract rules. 
Property described in paragraph (b) of this section is designated 
property with respect to a contractor only if--
    (A) The contract is not a long-term contract (within the meaning of 
section 460(f)); or
    (B) The contract is a home construction contract (within the meaning 
of section 460(e)(6)(A)) with respect to which the requirements of 
section 460(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) are not met.
    (3) Improvements to existing property--(i) In general. Any 
improvement to property described in Sec. 1.263(a)-1(b) constitutes the 
production of property. Generally, any improvement to designated 
property constitutes the production of designated property. An 
improvement is not treated as the production of designated property, 
however, if the de minimis exception described in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section applies to the improvement. In addition, paragraph 
(d)(3)(iii) of this section provides an exception for certain 
improvements to tangible personal property. Incidental maintenance and 
repairs are not treated as improvements under this paragraph (d)(3). See 
Sec. 1.162-4.
    (ii) Real property. The rehabilitation or preservation of a standing 
building, the clearing of raw land prior to sale, and the drilling of an 
oil well are activities constituting improvements to real property and, 
therefore, the production of designated property. Similarly, the 
demolition of a standing building generally constitutes an activity that 
is an improvement to real property and, therefore, the production of 
designated property. See the exceptions, however, in paragraphs (b)(3) 
and (b)(4) of this section.
    (iii) Tangible personal property. If the taxpayer has treated a unit 
of tangible personal property as designated property under this section, 
an improvement to such property constitutes the production of designated 
property regardless of the remaining useful life of the improved 
property (or the improvement) and, except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(4) of this section, regardless of the estimated length of the 
production period or the estimated cost of the improvement. If the 
taxpayer has not treated a unit of tangible personal property as 
designated property under this section, an improvement to such property 
constitutes the production of designated property only if the 
improvement independently meets the classification thresholds described 
in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

<R05>
Sec. 1.263A-9  The avoided cost method.

    (a) In general--(1) Description. The avoided cost method described 
in this section must be used to calculate the amount of interest 
required to be capitalized under section 263A(f). Generally, any 
interest that the taxpayer theoretically would have avoided if 
accumulated production expenditures (as defined in Sec. 1.263A-11) had 
been used to repay or reduce the taxpayer's outstanding debt must be 
capitalized under the avoided cost method. The application of the 
avoided cost method does not depend on whether the taxpayer actually 
would have used the amounts expended for production to repay or reduce 
debt. Instead, the avoided cost method is based on the assumption that 
debt of the taxpayer would have been repaid or reduced without regard to 
the taxpayer's subjective intentions or to restrictions (including 
legal, regulatory, contractual, or other restrictions) against repayment 
or use of the debt proceeds.
    (2) Overview--(i) In general. For each unit of designated property 
(within the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-8(b)), the avoided

[[Page 458]]

cost method requires the capitalization of--
    (A) The traced debt amount under paragraph (b) of this section, and
    (B) The excess expenditure amount under paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (ii) Rules that apply in determining amounts. The traced debt and 
excess expenditure amounts are determined for each taxable year or 
shorter computation period that includes the production period (as 
defined in Sec. 1.263A-12) of a unit of designated property. Paragraph 
(d) of this section provides an election not to trace debt to specific 
units of designated property. Paragraph (f) of this section provides 
rules for selecting the computation period, for calculating averages, 
and for determining measurement dates within the computation period. 
Special rules are in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (3) Definitions of interest and incurred. Except as provided in the 
case of certain expenses that are treated as a substitute for interest 
under paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and (g)(2)(iv) of this section, interest 
refers to all amounts that are characterized as interest expense under 
any provision of the Code, including, for example, sections 482, 483, 
1272, 1274, and 7872. Incurred refers to the amount of interest that is 
properly accruable during the period of time in question determined by 
taking into account the loan agreement and any applicable provisions of 
the Internal Revenue laws and regulations such as section 163, 
Sec. 1.446-2, and sections 1271 through 1275.
    (4) Definition of eligible debt. Except as provided in this 
paragraph (a)(4), eligible debt includes all outstanding debt (as 
evidenced by a contract, bond, debenture, note, certificate, or other 
evidence of indebtedness). Eligible debt does not include--
    (i) Debt (or the portion thereof) bearing interest that is 
disallowed under a provision described in Sec. 1.163-8T(m)(7)(ii);
    (ii) Debt, such as accounts payable and other accrued items, that 
bears no interest, except to the extent that such debt is traced debt 
(as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section);
    (iii) Debt that is borrowed directly or indirectly from a person 
related to the taxpayer and that bears a rate of interest that is less 
than the applicable Federal rate in effect under section 1274(d) on the 
date of issuance;
    (iv) Debt (or the portion thereof) bearing personal interest within 
the meaning of section 163(h)(2);
    (v) Debt (or the portion thereof) bearing qualified residence 
interest within the meaning of section 163(h)(3);
    (vi) Debt incurred by an organization that is exempt from Federal 
income tax under section 501(a), except to the extent interest on such 
debt is directly attributable to an unrelated trade or business of the 
organization within the meaning of section 512;
    (vii) Reserves, deferred tax liabilities, and similar items that are 
not treated as debt for Federal income tax purposes, regardless of the 
extent to which the taxpayer's applicable financial accounting or other 
regulatory reporting principles require or support treating these items 
as debt; and
    (viii) Federal, State, and local income tax liabilities, deferred 
tax liabilities under section 453A, and hypothetical tax liabilities 
under the look-back method of section 460(b) or similar provisions.
    (b) Traced debt amount--(1) General rule. Interest must be 
capitalized with respect to a unit of designated property in an amount 
(the traced debt amount) equal to the total interest incurred on the 
traced debt during each measurement period (as defined in paragraph 
(f)(2)(ii) of this section) that ends on a measurement date described in 
paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section. See the example in paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section. If any interest incurred on the traced debt is 
not taken into account for the taxable year that includes the 
measurement period because of a deferral provision, see paragraph (g)(2) 
of this section for the time and manner for capitalizing and recovering 
that amount. This paragraph (b)(1) does not apply if the taxpayer elects 
under paragraph (d) of this section not to trace debt.
    (2) Identification and definition of traced debt. On each 
measurement date described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, the 
taxpayer must identify debt that is traced debt with respect to a unit 
of designated property. On each such date, traced debt with respect to a

[[Page 459]]

unit of designated property is the outstanding eligible debt (as defined 
in paragraph (a)(4) of this section) that is allocated, on that date, to 
accumulated production expenditures with respect to the unit of 
designated property under the rules of Sec. 1.163-8T. Traced debt also 
includes unpaid interest that has been capitalized with respect to such 
unit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is included in 
accumulated production expenditures on the measurement date.
    (3) Example. The provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this 
section are illustrated by the following example.

    Example. Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in the 
production of a single unit of designated property during 1995 (unit A). 
Corporation X adopts a taxable year computation period and quarterly 
measurement dates. Production of unit A starts on January 14, 1995, and 
ends on June 16, 1995. On March 31, 1995 and on June 30, 1995, 
Corporation X has outstanding a $1,000,000 loan that is allocated under 
the rules of Sec. 1.163-8T to production expenditures with respect to 
unit A. During the period January 1, 1995, through June 30, 1995, 
Corporation X incurs $50,000 of interest related to the loan. Under 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $50,000 of interest Corporation X 
incurs on the loan during the period January 1, 1995, through June 30, 
1995, must be capitalized with respect to unit A.

    (c) Excess expenditure amount--(1) General rule. If there are 
accumulated production expenditures in excess of traced debt with 
respect to a unit of designated property on any measurement date 
described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, the taxpayer must, 
for the computation period that includes the measurement date, 
capitalize with respect to this unit the excess expenditure amount 
calculated under this paragraph (c)(1). However, if the sum of the 
excess expenditure amounts for all units of designated property of a 
taxpayer exceeds the total interest described in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, only a prorata amount (as determined under paragraph 
(c)(7) of this section) of such interest must be capitalized with 
respect to each unit. For each unit of designated property, the excess 
expenditure amount for a computation period equals the product of--
    (i) The average excess expenditures (as determined under paragraph 
(c)(5)(ii) of this section) for the unit of designated property for that 
period, and
    (ii) The weighted average interest rate (as determined under 
paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section) for that period.
    (2) Interest required to be capitalized. With respect to an excess 
expenditure amount, interest incurred during the computation period is 
capitalized from the following sources and in the following sequence but 
not in excess of the excess expenditure amount for all units of 
designated property:
    (i) Interest incurred on nontraced debt (as defined in paragraph 
(c)(5)(i) of this section);
    (ii) Interest incurred on borrowings described in paragraph 
(a)(4)(iii) of this section (relating to certain borrowings from related 
persons); and
    (iii) In the case of a partnership, guaranteed payments for the use 
of capital (within the meaning of section 707(c)) that would be 
deductible by the partnership if section 263A(f) did not apply.
    (3) Example. The provisions of paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this 
section are illustrated by the following example.

    Example. (i) P, a partnership owned equally by Corporation A and 
Individual B, is engaged in the construction of an office building 
during 1995. Average excess expenditures for the office building for 
1995 are $2,000,000. When P was formed, A and B agreed that A would be 
entitled to an annual guaranteed payment of $70,000 in exchange for A's 
capital contribution. The only borrowing of P, A, and B for 1995 is a 
loan to P from an unrelated lender of $1,000,000 (loan #1). The loan is 
nontraced debt and bears interest at an annual rate of 10 percent. Thus, 
P's weighted average interest rate (determined under paragraph 
(c)(5)(iii) of this section) is 10 percent and interest incurred during 
1995 is $100,000.
    (ii) In accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the excess 
expenditure amount is $200,000 ($2,000,000  x  10%). The interest 
capitalized under paragraph (c)(2) of this section is $170,000 ($100,000 
of interest plus $70,000 of guaranteed payments).

    (4) Treatment of interest subject to a deferral provision. If any 
interest described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section is not taken into 
account for the

[[Page 460]]

taxable year that includes the computation period because of a deferral 
provision described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, paragraph 
(c)(2) of this section is first applied without regard to the amount of 
the deferred interest. After applying paragraph (c)(2) without regard to 
the deferred interest, if the amount of interest capitalized with 
respect to all units of designated property for the computation period 
is less than the amount that would have been capitalized if a deferral 
provision did not apply, see paragraph (g)(2) of this section for the 
time and manner for capitalizing and recovering the difference (the 
shortfall amount).
    (5) Definitions--(i) Nontraced debt--(A) Defined. Nontraced debt 
means all eligible debt on a measurement date other than any debt that 
is treated as traced debt with respect to any unit of designated 
property on that measurement date. For example, nontraced debt includes 
eligible debt that is allocated to expenditures that are not capitalized 
under section 263A(a) (e.g., expenditures deductible under section 
174(a) or 263(c)). Similarly, even if eligible debt is allocated to a 
production expenditure for a unit of designated property, the debt is 
included in nontraced debt on measurement dates before the first or 
after the last measurement date for that unit of designated property. 
Thus, nontraced debt may include debt that was previously treated as 
traced debt or that will be treated as traced debt on a future 
measurement date.
    (B) Example. The provisions of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this 
section are illustrated by the following example.

    Example. In 1995, Corporation X begins, but does not complete, the 
construction of two office buildings that are separate units of 
designated property as defined in Sec. 1.263A-10 (Property D and 
Property E). At the beginning of 1995, X borrows $2,500,000 (the 
$2,500,000 loan), which will be used exclusively to finance production 
expenditures for Property D. Although interest is paid currently, the 
entire principal amount of the loan remains outstanding at the end of 
1995. Corporation X also has outstanding during all of 1995 a long-term 
loan with a principal amount of $2,000,000 (the $2,000,000 loan). The 
proceeds of the $2,000,000 loan were used exclusively to finance the 
production of Property C, a unit of designated property that was 
completed in 1994. Under the rules of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
the portion of the $2,500,000 loan allocated to accumulated production 
expenditures for property D at each measurement date during 1995 is 
treated as traced debt for that measurement date. The excess, if any, of 
$2,500,000 over the amount treated as traced debt at each measurement 
date during 1995 is treated as nontraced debt for that measurement date, 
even though it is expected that the entire $2,500,000 will be treated as 
traced debt with respect to Property D on subsequent measurement dates 
as more of the proceeds of the loan are used to finance additional 
production expenditures. In addition, the entire principal amount of the 
$2,000,000 loan is treated as nontraced debt for 1995, even though it 
was treated as traced debt with respect to Property C in a previous 
period.

    (ii) Average excess expenditures--(A) General rule. The average 
excess expenditures for a unit of designated property for a computation 
period are computed by--
    (1) Determining the amount (if any) by which accumulated production 
expenditures exceed traced debt at each measurement date during the 
computation period; and
    (2) Dividing the sum of these amounts by the number of measurement 
dates during the computation period.
    (B) Example. The provisions of paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this 
section are illustrated by the following example.

    Example. Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in the 
production of a single unit of designated property during 1995 (unit A). 
Corporation X adopts the taxable year as the computation period and 
quarterly measurement dates. The production period for unit A begins on 
January 14, 1995, and ends on June 16, 1995. On March 31, 1995, and on 
June 30, 1995, Corporation X has outstanding $1,000,000 of traced debt 
with respect to unit A. Accumulated production expenditures for unit A 
on March 31, 1995, are $1,400,000 and on June 30, 1995, are $1,600,000. 
Accumulated production expenditures in excess of traced debt for unit A 
on March 31, 1995, are $400,000 and on June 30, 1995, are $600,000. 
Average excess expenditures for unit A during 1995 are therefore 
$250,000 ([$400,000 + $600,000 + $0 +$0] <divide> 4).

    (iii) Weighted average interest rate--(A) Determination of rate. The 
weighted average interest rate for a computation period is determined by 
dividing interest incurred on nontraced debt during the period by 
average nontraced debt for the period.

[[Page 461]]

    (B) Interest incurred on nontraced debt. Interest incurred on 
nontraced debt during the computation period is equal to the total 
amount of interest incurred during the computation period on all 
eligible debt minus the amount of interest incurred during the 
computation period on traced debt. Thus, all interest incurred on 
nontraced debt during the computation period is included in the 
numerator of the weighted average interest rate, even if the underlying 
nontraced debt is repaid before the end of a measurement period and 
excluded from nontraced debt outstanding for measurement dates after 
repayment, in determining the denominator of the weighted average 
interest rate. However, see paragraph (g)(7) of this section for an 
election to treat eligible debt that is repaid within the 15-day period 
immediately preceding a quarterly measurement date as outstanding on 
that measurement date. See paragraph (a)(3) of this section for the 
definitions of interest and incurred.
    (C) Average nontraced debt. The average nontraced debt for a 
computation period is computed by--
    (1) Determining the amount of nontraced debt outstanding on each 
measurement date during the computation period; and
    (2) Dividing the sum of these amounts by the number of measurement 
dates during the computation period.
    (D) Special rules if taxpayer has no nontraced debt or rate is 
contingent. If the taxpayer does not have nontraced debt outstanding 
during the computation period, the weighted average interest rate for 
purposes of applying paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section is the 
highest applicable Federal rate in effect under section 1274(d) during 
the computation period. If interest is incurred at a rate that is 
contingent at the time the return for the year that includes the 
computation period is filed, the amount of interest is determined using 
the higher of the fixed rate of interest (if any) on the underlying debt 
or the applicable Federal rate in effect under section 1274(d) on the 
date of issuance.
    (6) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (c):

    Example 1. (i) W, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in the 
production of a unit of designated property during 1995. For purposes of 
applying the avoided cost method of this section, W uses the taxable 
year as the computation period. During 1995, W's only debt is a 
$1,000,000 loan bearing interest at a rate of 7 percent from Y, a person 
that is related to W. Assuming the applicable Federal rate in effect 
under section 1274(d) on the date of issuance of the loan is 10 percent, 
the loan is not eligible debt under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. 
However, even though W has no eligible debt, W incurs $70,000 
($1,000,000 x 7%) of interest during the computation period. This 
interest is described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and must be 
capitalized under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to the extent it does 
not exceed W's excess expenditure amount for the unit of property.
    (ii) W determines, under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, that 
average excess expenditures for the unit of property are $600,000. 
Assuming the highest applicable Federal rate in effect under section 
1274(d) during the computation period is 10 percent, W uses 10 percent 
as the weighted average interest rate for purposes of determining the 
excess expenditure amount. See paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(D) of this section. 
In accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the excess 
expenditure amount is therefore $60,000. Because this amount does not 
exceed the total amount of interest described in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section ($70,000), W is required to capitalize $60,000 of interest 
with respect to the unit of designated property for the 1995 computation 
period.
    Example 2. (i) Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged 
in the production of a single unit of designated property during 1955 
(unit A). Corporation X adopts the taxable year as the computation 
period and quarterly measurement dates. Production of unit A begins in 
1994 and ends on June 30, 1995. On March 31, 1995, and on June 30, 1995, 
Corporation X has outstanding $1,000,000 of eligible debt (loan 1) that 
is allocated under the rules of Sec. 1.163-8T to production expenditures 
for unit A. During each of the first two quarters of 1995, $30,000 of 
interest is incurred on loan 1. The loan is repaid on July 1, 1995. 
Throughout 1995, Corporation X also has outstanding $2,000,000 of 
eligible debt (loan 2) which is not allocated under the rules of 
Sec. 1.163-8T to the production of unit A. During 1995, $200,000 of 
interest is incurred on this nontraced debt. Accumulated production 
expenditures on March 31, 1995, are $1,400,000 and on June 30, 1995, are 
$1,600,000. Accumulated production expenditures in excess of traced debt 
on March 31, 1995, are $400,000 and on June 30, 1995, are $600,000.
    (ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the amount of interest 
capitalized with respect to traced debt is $60,000 ($30,000 for the 
measurement period ending March 31, 1995,

[[Page 462]]

and $30,000 for the measurement period ending June 30, 1995). Under 
paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, average excess expenditures for 
unit A are $250,000 ([($1,400,000-$1,000,000) + ($1,600,000-$1,000,000) 
+ $0 + $0]<divide>4). Under paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(C) of this section, 
average nontraced debt is $2,000,000 ([$2,000,000 + $2,000,000 + 
$2,000,000 + $2,000,000]<divide>4). Under paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(B) of 
this section, interest incurred on nontraced debt is $200,000 ($260,000 
of interest incurred on all eligible debt less $60,000 of interest 
incurred on traced debt). Under paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(A) of this 
section, the weighted average interest rate is 10 percent 
($200,000<divide>$2,000,000). Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
Corporation X capitalizes the excess expenditure amount of $25,000 
($250,000 x 10%), because it does not exceed the total amount of 
interest subject to capitalization under paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section ($200,000). Thus, the total interest capitalized with respect to 
unit A during 1995 is $85,000 ($60,000+$25,000).

    (7) Special rules where the excess expenditure amount exceeds 
incurred interest--(i) Allocation of total incurred interest to units. 
For a computation period in which the sum of the excess expenditure 
amounts under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for all units of 
designated property exceeds the total amount of interest (including 
deferred interest) available for capitalization, as determined under 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the amount of interest that is 
allocated to a unit of designated property is equal to the product of--
    (A) The total amount of interest (including deferred interest) 
available for capitalization, as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section; and
    (B) A fraction, the numerator of which is the average excess 
expenditures for the unit of designated property and the denominator of 
which is the sum of the average excess expenditures for all units of 
designated property.
    (ii) Application of related person rules to average excess 
expenditure. Certain excess expenditures must be taken into account by 
the persons (if any) required to capitalize interest with respect to 
production expenditures of the taxpayer under applicable related person 
rules. For each computation period, the amount of average excess 
expenditures that must be taken into account by such persons for each 
unit of the taxpayer's property is computed by--
    (A) Determining, for the computation period, the amount (if any) by 
which the excess expenditure amount for the unit exceeds the amount of 
interest allocated to the unit under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this 
section; and
    (B) Dividing the excess by the weighted average interest rate for 
the period.
    (iii) Special rule for corporations. If a corporation is related to 
another person for the purposes of the applicable related party rules, 
the District Director upon examination may require that the corporation 
apply this paragraph (c)(7) and other provisions of the regulations by 
excluding deferred interest from the total interest available for 
capitalization.
    (d) Election not to trace debt--(1) General rule. Taxpayers may 
elect not to trace debt. If the election is made, the average excess 
expenditures and weighted average interest rate under paragraph (c)(5) 
of this section are determined by treating all eligible debt as 
nontraced debt. For this purpose, debt specified in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) 
of this section (e.g., accounts payable) may be included in eligible 
debt, provided it would be treated as traced debt but for an election 
under this paragraph (d). The election not to trace debt is a method of 
accounting that applies to the determination of capitalized interest for 
all designated property of the taxpayer. The making or revocation of the 
election is a change in method of accounting requiring the consent of 
the Commissioner under section 446(e) and Sec. 1.446-1(e).
    (2) Example. The provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section are 
illustrated by the following example.

    Example. (i) Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in 
the production of a single unit of designated property during 1995 (unit 
A). Corporation X adopts the taxable year as the computation period and 
quarterly measurement dates. At each measurement date (March 31, June 
30, September 30, and December 31) Corporation X has the following 
outstanding indebtedness:


Noninterest-bearing accounts payable traced to unit A........   $100,000
Noninterest-bearing accounts payable that are not traced to             
 unit A......................................................   $300,000
Interest-bearing loans that are eligible debt within the                
 meaning of paragraph (a)(4) of this section.................   $900,000
                                                                        


[[Page 463]]

    (ii) Corporation X elects under this paragraph (d) not to trace 
debt. Eligible debt at each measurement date for purposes of calculating 
the weighted average interest rate under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this 
section is $1,000,000 ($100,000 + $900,000).

    (e) Election to use external rate--(1) In general. An eligible 
taxpayer may elect to use the highest applicable Federal rate (AFR) 
under section 1274(d) in effect during the computation period plus 3 
percentage points (AFR plus 3) as a substitute for the weighted average 
interest rate determined under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section. A 
taxpayer that makes this election may not trace debt. The use of the AFR 
plus 3 as provided under this paragraph (e)(1) constitutes a method of 
accounting. A taxpayer makes the election to use the AFR plus 3 method 
by using the AFR plus 3 as the taxpayer's weighted average interest 
rate, and any change to the AFR plus 3 method by a taxpayer that has 
never previously used the method does not require the consent of the 
Commissioner. Any other change to or from the use of the AFR plus 3 
method under this paragraph (e)(1) (other than by reason of a taxpayer 
ceasing to be an eligible taxpayer) is a change in method of accounting 
requiring the consent of the Commissioner under section 446(e) and 
Sec. 1.446-1(e). All changes to or from the AFR plus 3 method are 
effected on a cut-off basis.
    (2) Eligible taxpayer. A taxpayer is an eligible taxpayer for a 
taxable year for purposes of this paragraph (e) if the average annual 
gross receipts of the taxpayer for the three previous taxable years do 
not exceed $10,000,000 (the $10,000,000 gross receipts test) and the 
taxpayer has met the $10,000 gross receipts for all prior taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1994. For purposes of this paragraph 
(e)(2), the principles of section 263A(b)(2)(B) and (C) and Sec. 1.263A-
3(b) apply in determining whether a taxpayer is an eligible taxpayer for 
a taxable year.
    (f) Selection of computation period and measurement dates and 
application of averaging conventions--(1) Computation period--(i) In 
general. A taxpayer may (but is not required to) make the avoided cost 
calculation on the basis of a full taxable year. If the taxpayer uses 
the taxable year as the computation period, a single avoided cost 
calculation is made for each unit of designated property for the entire 
taxable year. If the taxpayer uses a computation period that is shorter 
than the full taxable year, an avoided cost calculation is made for each 
unit of designated property for each shorter computation period within 
the taxable year. If the taxpayer uses a shorter computation period, the 
computation period may not include portions of more than one taxable 
year and, except as provided in the case of short taxable years, each 
computation period within a taxable year must be the same length. In the 
case of a short taxable year, a taxpayer may treat a period shorter than 
the taxpayer's regular computation period as the first or last 
computation period, or as the only computation period for the year if 
the year is shorter than the taxpayer's regular computation period. A 
taxpayer must use the same computation periods for all designated 
property produced during a single taxable year.
    (ii) Method of accounting. The choice of a computation period is a 
method of accounting. Any change in the computation period is a change 
in method of accounting requiring the consent of the Commissioner under 
section 446(e) and Sec. 1.446-1(e).
    (iii) Production period beginning or ending during the computation 
period. The avoided cost method applies to the production of a unit of 
designated property on the basis of a full computation period, 
regardless of whether the production period for the unit of designated 
property begins or ends during the computation period.
    (2) Measurement dates--(i) In general. If a taxpayer uses the 
taxable year as the computation period, measurement dates must occur at 
quarterly or more frequent regular intervals. If the taxpayer uses 
computation periods that are shorter than the taxable year, measurement 
dates must occur at least twice during each computation period and at 
least four times during the taxable year (or consecutive 12-month period 
in the case of a short taxable year). The taxpayer must use the same 
measurement dates for all designated property produced during a 
computation period. Except in the case of a

[[Page 464]]

computation period that differs from the taxpayer's regular computation 
period by reason of a short taxable year (see paragraph (f)(1)(i) of 
this section), measurement dates must occur at equal intervals during 
each computation period that falls within a single taxable year. For any 
computation period that differs from the taxpayer's regular computation 
period by reason of a short taxable year, the measurement dates used by 
the taxpayer during that period must be consistent with the principles 
and purposes of section 263A(f). A taxpayer is permitted to modify the 
frequency of measurement dates from year to year.
    (ii) Measurement period. For purposes of this section, measurement 
period means the period that begins on the first day following the 
preceding measurement date and that ends on the measurement date.
    (iii) Measurement dates on which accumulated production expenditures 
must be taken into account. The first measurement date on which 
accumulated production expenditures must be taken into account with 
respect to a unit of designated property is the first measurement date 
following the beginning of the production period for the unit of 
designated property. The final measurement date on which accumulated 
production expenditures with respect to a unit of designated property 
must be taken into account is the first measurement date following the 
end of the production period for the unit of designated property. 
Accumulated production expenditures with respect to a unit of designated 
property must also be taken into account on all intervening measurement 
dates. See Sec. 1.263A-12 to determine when the production period begins 
and ends.
    (iv) More frequent measurement dates. When in the opinion of the 
District Director more frequent measurement dates are necessary to 
determine capitalized interest consistent with the principles and 
purposes of section 263A(f) for a particular computation period, the 
District Director may require the use of more frequent measurement 
dates. If a significant segment of the taxpayer's production activities 
(the first segment) requires more frequent measurement dates than 
another significant segment of the taxpayer's production activities, the 
taxpayer may request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service 
permitting, for a taxable year and all subsequent taxable years, a 
segregation of the two segments and, notwithstanding paragraph (f)(2)(i) 
of this section, the use of the more frequent measurement dates for only 
the first segment. The request for a ruling must be made in accordance 
with any applicable rules relating to submissions of ruling requests. 
The request must be filed on or before the due date (including 
extensions) of the original Federal income tax return for the first 
taxable year to which it will apply.
    (3) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of 
this paragraph (f):

    Example 1. Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in 
the production of designated property during 1995. Corporation X adopts 
the taxable year as the computation period and quarterly measurement 
dates. Corporation X must identify traced debt, accumulated production 
expenditures, and nontraced debt at each quarterly measurement date 
(March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31). Under paragraph 
(c)(5)(ii) of this section, Corporation X must calculate average excess 
expenditures for each unit of designated property by determining the 
amount by which accumulated production expenditures exceed traced debt 
for each unit at the end of each quarter and dividing the sum of these 
amounts by four. Under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) (C) of this section, 
Corporation X must calculate average nontraced debt by determining the 
amount of nontraced debt outstanding at the end of each quarter and 
dividing the sum of these amounts by four.
    Example 2. Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged in 
the production of designated property during 1995. Corporation X adopts 
a 6-month computation period with two measurement dates within each 
computation period. Corporation X must identify traced debt, accumulated 
production expenditures, and nontraced debt at each measurement date 
(March 31 and June 30 for the first computation period and September 30 
and December 31 for the second computation period). Under paragraph 
(c)(5)(ii) of this section, Corporation X must, for each computation 
period, calculate average excess expenditures for each unit of 
designated property by determining the amount by which accumulated 
production expenditures exceed traced debt for each unit at each 
measurement date during the period and dividing the

[[Page 465]]

sum of these amounts by two. Under paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(C) of this 
section, Corporation X must calculate average nontraced debt for each 
computation period by determining the amount of nontraced debt 
outstanding at each measurement date during the period and dividing the 
sum of these amounts by two.
    Example 3. (i) Corporation X, a calendar year taxpayer, is engaged 
in the production of two units of designated property during 1995. 
Production of Unit A starts in 1994 and ends on June 20, 1995. 
Production of Unit B starts on April 15, 1995, but does not end until 
1996. Corporation X adopts the taxable year as its computation period 
and does not elect under paragraph (d) of this section not to trace 
debt. Corporation X uses quarterly measurement dates and pays all 
interest on eligible debt in the quarter in which the interest is 
incurred. During 1995, Corporation X has two items of eligible debt. The 
debt and the manner in which it is used are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               Annual                                   
    No.         Principal       rate        Period       Use of proceeds
                             (percent)    outstanding                   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1..........      $1,000,000          9       1/01-9/01  Unit A.         
2..........       2,000,000         11      6/01-12/31  Nontraced.      
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Based on the annual 9 percent rate of interest, Corporation X 
incurs $7,500 of interest during each month that Loan #1 is outstanding.
    (iii) Accumulated production expenditures at the end of each quarter 
during 1995 are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Measurement date                  Unit A          Unit B    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
March 31................................      $1,200,000              $0
June 30.................................       1,800,000         500,000
Sept. 30................................               0       1,000,000
Dec. 31.................................               0       1,600,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (iv) Corporation X must first determine the amount of interest 
incurred on traced debt and capitalize the interest incurred on this 
debt (the traced debt amount). Loan # 1 is allocated to Unit A on the 
March 31 and June 30 measurement dates. Accordingly, Loan # 1 is treated 
as traced debt with respect to unit A for the measurement periods 
beginning January 1 and ending June 30. The interest incurred on Loan # 
1 during the period that Loan # 1 is treated as traced debt must be 
capitalized with respect to Unit A. Thus, $45,000 ($7,500 per month for 
6 months) is capitalized with respect to Unit A.
    (v) Second, Corporation X must determine average excess expenditures 
for Unit A and Unit B. For Unit A, this amount is $250,000 ([$200,000 + 
$800,000 + $0 +$0] <divide> 4). For Unit B, this amount is $775,000 ([$0 
+ $500,000 + $1,000,000 + $1,600,000]<divide>4).
    (vi) Third, Corporation X must determine the weighted average 
interest rate and apply that rate to the average excess expenditures for 
Units A and B. The rate is equal to the total amount of interest 
incurred on nontraced debt (i.e., interest incurred on all eligible debt 
reduced by interest incurred on traced debt) divided by the average 
nontraced debt. The interest incurred on nontraced debt equals $143,333 
([$1,000,000  x  9%  x  \8/12\] + [$2,000,000  x  11%  x  \7/12\] - 
$45,000). The average nontraced debt equals $1,500,000 ([$0 + $2,000,000 
+ $2,000,000 + $2,000,000] <divide> 4). The weighted average interest 
rate of 9.56 percent ($143,333 ' $1,500,000), is then applied to average 
excess expenditures for Units A and B. Accordingly, Corporation X 
capitalizes an additional $23,900 ($250,000  x  9.56%) with respect to 
Unit A and $74,090 ($775,000  x  9.56%) with respect to Unit B (the 
excess expenditure amounts).

    (g) Special rules--(1) Ordering rules--(i) Provisions preempted by 
section 263A(f). Interest must be capitalized under section 263A(f) 
before the application of section 163(d) (regarding the investment 
interest limitation), section 163(j) (regarding the limitation on 
interest paid to a tax-exempt related person), section 266 (regarding 
the election to capitalize carrying charges), section 469 (regarding the 
limitation on passive losses), and section 861 (regarding the allocation 
of interest to United States sources). Any interest that is capitalized 
under section 263A(f) is not taken into account as interest under those 
sections. However, in applying section 263A(f) with respect to the 
excess expenditure amount, the taxpayer must capitalize all interest 
that is neither investment interest under section 163(d), exempt related 
person interest under section 163(j), nor passive interest under section 
469 before capitalizing any interest that is either investment interest, 
exempt related person interest, or passive interest. Any interest that 
is not required to be capitalized after the application of section 
263A(f) is then taken into account as interest subject to sections 
163(d),

[[Page 466]]

163(j), 266, 469, and 861. If, after the application of section 263A(f), 
interest is deferred under sections 163(d), 163(j), 266, or 469, that 
interest is not subject to capitalization under section 263A(f) in any 
subsequent taxable year.
    (ii) Deferral provisions applied before this section. Interest 
(including contingent interest) that is subject to a deferral provision 
described in this paragraph (g)(1)(ii) is subject to capitalization 
under section 263A(f) only in the taxable year in which it would be 
deducted if section 263A(f) did not apply. Deferral provisions include 
sections 163(e)(3), 267, 446, and 461, and all other deferral or 
limitation provisions that are not described in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of 
this section. In contrast to the provisions of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of 
this section, deferral provisions are applied before the application of 
section 263A(f).
    (2) Application of section 263A(f) to deferred interest--(i) In 
general. This paragraph (g)(2) describes the time and manner of 
capitalizing and recovering the deferral amount. The deferral amount for 
any computation period equals the sum of--
    (A) The amount of interest that is incurred on traced debt that is 
deferred during the computation period and is not deductible for the 
taxable year that includes the computation period because of a deferral 
provision described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, and
    (B) The shortfall amount described in paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section.
    (ii) Capitalization of deferral amount. The rules described in 
paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section apply to the deferral amount 
unless the taxpayer elects under paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section to 
capitalize substitute costs.
    (iii) Deferred capitalization. If the taxpayer does not elect under 
paragraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section to capitalize substitute costs, 
deferred interest to which the deferral amount is attributable 
(determined under any reasonable method) is capitalized in the year or 
years in which the deferred interest would have been deductible but for 
the application of section 263A(f) (the capitalization year). For this 
purpose, any interest that is deferred from a prior computation period 
is taken into account in subsequent capitalization years in the same 
order in which the interest was deferred. If a unit of designated 
property to which previously deferred interest relates is sold before 
the capitalization year, the deferred interest applicable to that unit 
of property is taken into account in the capitalization year and treated 
as if recovered from the sale of the property. If the taxpayer continues 
to hold, throughout the capitalization year, a unit of depreciable 
property to which previously deferred interest relates, the adjusted 
basis and applicable recovery percentages for the unit of property are 
redetermined for the capitalization year and subsequent years so that 
the increase in basis is accounted for over the remaining recovery 
periods beginning with the capitalization year. See Example 2 of 
paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section.
    (iv) Substitute capitalization--(A) General rule. In lieu of 
deferred capitalization under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, the 
taxpayer may elect the substitute capitalization method described in 
this paragraph (g)(2)(iv). Under this method, the taxpayer capitalizes 
for the computation period in which interest is incurred and deferred 
(the deferral period) costs that would be deducted but for this 
paragraph (g)(2)(iv) (substitute costs). The taxpayer must capitalize an 
amount of substitute costs equal to the deferral amount for each unit of 
designated property, or if less, a prorata amount (determined in 
accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section) 
of the total substitute costs that would be deducted but for this 
paragraph (g)(2)(iv) during the deferral period. If the entire deferral 
amount is capitalized pursuant to this paragraph (g)(2)(iv) in the 
deferral period, any interest incurred and deferred in the deferral 
period is neither capitalized nor deducted during the deferral period 
and, unless subsequently capitalized as a substitute cost under this 
paragraph (g)(2)(iv), is deductible in the appropriate subsequent period 
without regard to section 263A(f).
    (B) Capitalization of amount carried forward. If the taxpayer has an 
insufficient amount of substitute costs in the deferral period, the 
amount by which

[[Page 467]]

substitute costs are insufficient with respect to each unit of 
designated property is a deferral amount carryforward to succeeding 
computation periods beginning with the next computation period. In any 
carryforward year, the taxpayer must capitalize an amount of substitute 
costs equal to the deferral amount carryforward or, if less, a prorata 
amount (determined in accordance with the principles of paragraph 
(c)(7)(i) of this section) of the total substitute costs that would be 
deducted during the carryforward year or years (the carryforward 
capitalization year) but for this paragraph (g)(2)(iv) (after applying 
the substitute cost method of this paragraph (g)(2)(iv) to the 
production of designated property in the carryforward period). If a unit 
of designated property to which the deferral amount carryforward relates 
is sold prior to the carryforward capitalization year, substitute costs 
applicable to that unit of property are taken into account in the 
carryforward capitalization year and treated as if recovered from the 
sale of the property. If the taxpayer continues to hold, throughout the 
capitalization year, a unit of depreciable property to which a deferral 
amount carryforward relates, the adjusted basis and applicable recovery 
percentages for the unit of property are redetermined for the 
carryforward capitalization year and subsequent years so that the 
increase in basis is accounted for over the remaining recovery periods 
beginning with the carryforward capitalization year. See Example 2 of 
paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section.
    (C) Method of accounting. The substitute capitalization method under 
this paragraph (g)(2)(iv) is a method of accounting that applies to all 
designated property of the taxpayer. A change to or from the substitute 
capitalization method is a change in method of accounting requiring the 
consent of the Commissioner under section 446(e) and Sec. 1.446-1(e).
    (v) Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of 
the avoided cost method when interest is subject to a deferral 
provision:

    Example 1. (i) Corporation X is a calendar year taxpayer and uses 
the taxable year as it computation period. During 1995, X is engaged in 
the construction of a warehouse which X will use in its storage 
business. The warehouse is completed and placed in service in December 
1995. X's average excess expenditures for 1995 equal $1,000,000. 
Throughout 1995, X's only outstanding debt is nontraced debt of $900,000 
and $1,200,000, bearing interest at 15 percent and 9 percent, 
respectively, per year. Of the $243,000 interest incurred during the 
year ([$900,000 x 15%] + [$1,200,000 x 9%] = [$135,000+$108,000]), 
$75,000 is deferred under section 267(a)(2).
    (ii) X must first determine the amount of interest required to be 
capitalized under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for 1995 (the 
deferral period) without applying section 267(a)(2). The weighted 
average interest rate is 11.6 percent ([$135,000+$108,000]<divide> 
$2,100,000), and the excess expenditure amount under paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section is $116,000 ($1,000,000 x 11.6%). Under paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section, X must then determine the amount of interest that would be 
capitalized by applying paragraph (c)(2) of this section without regard 
to the amount of deferred interest. Disregarding deferred interest, the 
amount of interest available for capitalization is $168,000 
([$900,000 x 15%] + [$1,200,000 x 9%]- $75,000). Thus, the full excess 
expenditure amount ($116,000) is capitalized from interest that is not 
deferred under section 267(a)(2) and there is no shortfall amount.
    Example 2. (i) The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that 
$140,000 of interest is deferred under section 267 (a)(2) in 1995. The 
taxpayer does not elect to use the substitute capitalization method. 
This interest is also deferred in 1996 but would be deducted in 1997 if 
section 263A(f) did not apply. As in Example 1, the excess expenditure 
amount is $116,000. However, the amount of interest available for 
capitalization after excluding the amount of deferred interest is 
$103,000 ([$900,000 x 15%] + [$1,200,000 x 9%]- $140,000). Thus, only 
$103,000 of interest is capitalized with respect to the warehouse in 
1995. Since $116,000 of interest would be capitalized if section 
267(a)(2) did not apply, the deferral amount determined under paragraphs 
(c)(2) and (g)(2)(i) of this section is $13,000 ($116,000 -$103,000), 
and $13,000 of deferred interest must be capitalized in the year in 
which it would be deducted if section 263A(f) did not apply.
    (ii) The $140,000 of interest deferred under section 267(a)(2) in 
1995 would be deducted in 1997 if section 263A(f) did not apply. X is 
therefore required to capitalize an additional $13,000 of interest with 
respect to the warehouse in 1997 and must redetermine its basis and 
recovery percentage.

    (3) Simplified inventory method--(i) In general. This paragraph 
(g)(3) provides

[[Page 468]]

a simplified method of capitalizing interest expense with respect to 
designated property that is inventory. Under this method, the taxpayer 
determines beginning and ending inventory and cost of goods sold 
applying all other capitalization provisions, including, for example, 
the simplified production method of Sec. 1.263A-2(b), but without regard 
to the capitalization of interest with respect to inventory. The 
taxpayer must establish a separate capital asset, however, in an amount 
equal to the aggregate interest capitalization amount (as defined in 
paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(C) of this section). Under the simplified 
inventory method, increases in the aggregate interest capitalization 
amount from one year to the next generally are treated as reductions in 
interest expense, and decreases in the aggregate interest capitalization 
amount from one year to the next are treated as increases to cost of 
goods sold.
    (ii) Segmentation of inventory--(A) General rule. Under the 
simplified inventory method, the taxpayer first separates its total 
ending inventory value into segments that are equal to the total ending 
inventory value divided by the inverse inventory turnover rate. Each 
inventory segment is then assigned an age starting with one year and 
increasing by one year for each additional segment. The inverse 
inventory turnover rate is determined by finding the average of 
beginning and ending inventory, dividing the average by the cost of 
goods sold for the year, and rounding the result to the nearest whole 
number. Beginning and ending inventory amounts are determined using 
total current cost of inventory for the year (rather than carrying 
value). Cost of goods sold, however, may be determined using either 
total current cost or the taxpayer's inventory method. In addition, for 
purposes of this paragraph (g)(3)(ii), current costs for a year (and, if 
applicable, the cost of goods sold for the year under the taxpayer's 
inventory method) are determined without regard to the capitalization of 
interest with respect to inventory.
    (B) Example. The provisions of paragraph (g)(3)(ii)(A) of this 
section are illustrated by the following example.

    Example. X, a taxpayer using the FIFO inventory method, determines 
that total cost of goods sold for 1995 equals $900, and the cost of both 
beginning and ending inventory equals $3,000. Thus, X's inverse 
inventory turnover rate equals 3 (3.33 rounded to the nearest whole 
number). Total ending inventory of $3,000 is divided into three segments 
of $1,000 each. One segment is treated as 3-year-old inventory, one 
segment is treated as 2-year-old inventory, and one segment is treated 
as 1-year-old inventory.

    (iii) Aggregate interest capitalization amount--(A) Computation 
period and weighted average interest rate. If a taxpayer elects the 
simplified inventory method, the taxpayer must use the taxable year as 
its computation period and use the weighted average interest rate 
determined under this paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(A) in determining the 
aggregate interest capitalization amount defined in paragraph 
(g)(3)(iii)(C) of this section and in determining the amount of interest 
capitalized with respect to any designated property that is not 
inventory. Under the simplified inventory method, the taxpayer 
determines the weighted average interest rate in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, treating all eligible debt (other 
than debt traced to noninventory property in the case of a taxpayer 
tracing debt) as nontraced debt (i.e., without tracing debt to 
inventory). A taxpayer that has elected under paragraph (e) of this 
section to use an external rate as a substitute for the weighted average 
interest rate determined under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section 
uses the rate described in paragraph (e)(1) as the weighted average 
interest rate.
    (B) Computation of the tentative aggregate interest capitalization 
amount. The weighted average interest rate is compounded annually by the 
number of years assigned to a particular inventory segment to produce an 
interest factor (applicable interest factor) for that segment. The 
amounts determined by multiplying the value of each inventory segment by 
its applicable interest factor are then combined to produce a tentative 
aggregate interest capitalization amount.
    (C) Coordination with other interest capitalization computations--
(1) In general. If the tentative aggregate interest

[[Page 469]]

capitalization amount for a year exceeds the aggregate interest 
capitalization amount (defined in paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(D) of this 
section) as of the close of the preceding year, then, for purposes of 
applying the rules of paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the excess is 
treated as an excess expenditure amount and the inventory to which the 
simplified inventory method of this paragraph (g)(3) applies is treated 
as a single unit of designated property. If, after these modifications, 
no paragraph (c)(7) interest allocation is necessary (i.e., the excess 
expenditure amounts for all units of designated property do not exceed 
the total amount of interest (including deferred interest) available for 
capitalization), the aggregate interest capitalization amount generally 
equals the tentative aggregate interest capitalization amount. If, on 
the other hand, a paragraph (c)(7) allocation is necessary, the 
tentative aggregate interest capitalization amount is generally adjusted 
to reflect the results of that allocation (i.e., the increase in the 
aggregate interest capitalization amount is limited to the amount of 
interest allocated to inventory, reduced, however, by any substitute 
costs that are capitalized with respect to inventory under applicable 
related party rules).
    (2) Deferred interest. In determining the aggregate interest 
capitalization amount, the tentative aggregate interest capitalization 
amount is adjusted (after the application of paragraph (c)(7) of this 
section) as appropriate to reflect the deferred interest rules of 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section. The tentative aggregate interest 
capitalization amount would be reduced, for example, by the amount of a 
taxpayer's deferred interest for a taxable year unless the taxpayer has 
elected the substitute capitalization method under paragraph (g)(2)(iv).
    (3) Other coordinating provisions. The Commissioner may prescribe, 
by revenue ruling or revenue procedure, additional provisions to 
coordinate the election and use of the simplified inventory method with 
other interest capitalization requirements and methods. See 
Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.
    (D) Treatment of increases or decreases in the aggregate interest 
capitalization amount. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 
(g)(3)(iii)(D), increases in the aggregate interest capitalization 
amount from one year to the next are treated as reductions in interest 
expense, and decreases in the aggregate interest capitalization amount 
from one year to the next are treated as increases to cost of goods 
sold. To the extent a taxpayer capitalizes substitute costs under either 
applicable related party rules or the deferred interest rules in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, increases in the aggregate interest 
capitalization amount are treated as reductions in applicable substitute 
costs, rather than interest expense.
    (E) Example. The provisions of this paragraph (g)(3)(iii) are 
illustrated by the following example.

    Example. The facts are the same as in the example in paragraph 
(g)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, and, in addition, X determines that its 
weighted average interest rate for 1995 is 10 percent. Additionally, 
assume that X has no deferred interest in 1995 or 1996 and no deferral 
amount carryforward to either 1995 or 1996. (See paragraph (g)(2) of 
this section.) Also assume that no allocation is necessary under 
paragraph (c)(7) of this section in either 1995 or 1996. Under the rules 
of paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, X divides ending inventory into 
segments of $1,000 each. One segment is 1-year old inventory, one 
segment is 2-year old inventory, and one segment is 3-year old 
inventory. Under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, X must 
compute the applicable interest factor for each segment. The applicable 
interest factor for the 1-year old inventory is not compounded. The 
applicable interest factor for the 2-year old inventory is compounded 
for 1 year. The applicable interest factor for the 3-year old inventory 
is compounded for 2 years. The interest factor applied to the 1-year old 
inventory segment is .1. The interest factor applied to the 2-year old 
inventory segment is .21 [(1.1 x 1.1)-1]. The interest factor applied to 
the 3-year old inventory is .331 [(1.1 x 1.1 x 1.1)-1]. Thus, the 
tentative aggregate interest capitalization amount for 1995 is $641 
(1,000  x  [.1 + .21 + .331]). Because X has no deferred interest in 
1995, no deferral amount carryforward to 1995, and no required 
allocation under paragraph (c)(7) of this section in 1995, X's aggregate 
interest capitalization amount equals its $641 tentative aggregate 
interest capitalization amount. If, in 1996, X computes an aggregate 
interest capitalization amount of $750, the $109 increase

[[Page 470]]

in the amount from 1995 to 1996 would be treated as a reduction in 
interest expense for 1996.

    (iv) Method of accounting. The simplified inventory method is a 
method of accounting that must be elected for and applied to all 
inventory within a single trade or business of the taxpayer (within the 
meaning of section 446(d) and Sec. 1.446-1(d)). This method may be 
elected only if the inventory in that trade or business consists only of 
designated property and only if the taxpayer's inverse inventory 
turnover rate for that trade or business (as defined in paragraph 
(g)(3)(ii)(A) of this section) is greater than or equal to one. A change 
from or to the simplified inventory method is a change in method of 
accounting requiring the consent of the Commissioner under section 
446(e) and Sec. 1.446-(1)(e).
    (4) Financial accounting method disregarded. The avoided cost method 
is applied under this section without regard to any financial or 
regulatory accounting principles for the capitalization of interest. For 
example, this section determines the amount of interest that must be 
capitalized without regard to Financial Accounting Standards Board 
(FASB) Statement Nos. 34, 71, and 90, issued by the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board, Norwalk, CT 06856-5116. Similarly, taxpayers are not 
permitted to net interest income and interest expense in determining the 
amount of interest that must be capitalized under this section with 
respect to certain restricted tax-exempt borrowings even though netting 
is permitted under FASB Statement No. 62.
    (5) Treatment of intercompany transactions--(i) General rule. If 
interest capitalized under section 263A(f) by a member of a consolidated 
group (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1502-1(h)) with respect to a unit of 
designated property is attributable to a loan from another member of the 
group (the lending member), the intercompany transaction provisions of 
the consolidated return regulations do not apply to the lending member's 
interest income with respect to that loan, except as provided in 
paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section. For this purpose, the capitalized 
interest expense that is attributable to a loan from another member is 
determined under any method that reasonably reflects the principles of 
the avoided cost method, including the traced and nontraced concepts. 
For purposes of this paragraph (g)(5)(i) and paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of 
this section, in order for a method to be considered reasonable it must 
be consistently applied.
    (ii) Special rule for consolidated group with limited outside 
borrowing. If, for any year, the aggregate amount of interest income 
described in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section for all members of the 
group with respect to all units of designated property exceeds the total 
amount of interest that is deductible for that year by all members of 
the group with respect to debt of a member owed to nonmembers (group 
deductible interest) after applying section 263A(f), the intercompany 
transaction provisions of the consolidated return regulations are 
applied to the excess, and the amount of interest income that must be 
taken into account by the group under paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this 
section is limited to the amount of the group deductible interest. The 
amount to which the intercompany transaction provisions of the 
consolidated return regulations apply by reason of this paragraph 
(g)(5)(ii) is allocated among the lending members under any method that 
reasonably reflects each member's share of interest income described in 
paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section. If a lending member has interest 
income that is attributable to more than one unit of designated 
property, the amount to which the intercompany transaction provisions of 
the consolidated return regulations apply by reason of this paragraph 
(g)(5)(ii) with respect to the member is allocated among the units in 
accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section.
    (iii) Example. The provisions of paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this 
section are illustrated by the following example.

    Example. (i) P and S1 are the members of a consolidated group. In 
1995, S1 begins and completes the construction of a shopping center and 
is required to capitalize interest with respect to the construction. 
S1's average excess expenditures for 1995 are $5,000,000. Throughout 
1995, S1's only borrowings include a $6,000,000 loan from P bearing 
interest at an annual rate of 10 percent ($600,000 per year). Under the 
avoided cost method, S1 is required to capitalize interest in the amount 
of $500,000 ([$600,000<divide>$6,000,000 x 5,000,000).

[[Page 471]]

    (ii) P's only borrowing from unrelated lenders is a $2,000,000 loan 
bearing interest at an annual rate of 10 percent ($200,000 per year). 
Under the principles of paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section, because 
the aggregate amount of interest described in paragraph (g)(5)(i) of 
this section ($500,000) exceeds the aggregate amount of currently 
deductible interest of the group ($200,000), the intercompany 
transaction provisions of the consolidated return regulations apply to 
the excess of $300,000 and the amount of P's interest income that is 
subject to current inclusion by reason of paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this 
section is limited to $200,000.

    (6) Notional principal contracts and other derivatives. [Reserved]
    (7) 15-day repayment rule. A taxpayer may elect to treat any 
eligible debt that is repaid within the 15-day period immediately 
preceding a quarterly measurement date as outstanding as of that 
measurement date for purposes of determining traced debt, average 
nontraced debt, and the weighted average interest rate. This election 
may be made or discontinued for any computation period and is not a 
method of accounting.

Sec. 1.263A-10  Unit of property.

    (a) In general. The unit of property as defined in this section is 
used as the basis to determine accumulated production expenditures under 
Sec. 1.263A-11 and the beginning and end of the production period under 
Sec. 1.263A-12. Whether property is 1-year or 2-year property under 
Sec. 1.263A-8(b)(1)(ii) is also determined separately with respect to 
each unit of property as defined in this section.
    (b) Units of real property--(1) In general. A unit of real property 
includes any components of real property owned by the taxpayer or a 
related person that are functionally interdependent and an allocable 
share of any common feature owned by the taxpayer or a related person 
that is real property even though the common feature does not meet the 
functional interdependence test. When the production period begins with 
respect to any functionally interdependent component or any common 
feature of the unit of real property, the production period has begun 
for the entire unit of real property. See, however, paragraph (b)(5) of 
this section for rules under which the costs of a common feature or 
benefitted property are excluded from accumulated production 
expenditures for one or more measurement dates. The portion of land 
included in a unit of real property includes land on which real property 
(including a common feature) included in the unit is situated, land 
subject to setback restrictions with respect to such property, and any 
other contiguous portion of the tract of land other than land that the 
taxpayer holds for a purpose unrelated to the unit being produced (e.g., 
investment purposes, personal use purposes, or specified future 
development as a separate unit of real property).
    (2) Functional interdependence. Components of real property produced 
by, or for, the taxpayer, for use by the taxpayer or a related person 
are functionally interdependent if the placing in service of one 
component is dependent on the placing in service of the other component 
by the taxpayer or a related person. In the case of property produced 
for sale, components of real property are functionally interdependent if 
they are customarily sold as a single unit. For example, the real 
property components of a single-family house (e.g., the land, 
foundation, and walls) are functionally interdependent. In contrast, 
components of real property that are expected to be separately placed in 
service or held for resale are not functionally interdependent. Thus, 
dwelling units within a multi-unit building that are separately placed 
in service or sold (within the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-12(d)(1)) are 
treated as functionally independent of any other units, even though the 
units are located in the same building.
    (3) Common features. For purposes of this section, a common feature 
generally includes any real property (as defined in Sec. 1.263A-8(c)) 
that benefits real property produced by, or for, the taxpayer or a 
related person, and that is not separately held for the production of 
income. A common feature need not be physically contiguous to the real 
property that it benefits. Examples of common features include

[[Page 472]]

streets, sidewalks, playgrounds, clubhouses, tennis courts, sewer lines, 
and cables that are not held for the production of income separately 
from the units of real property that they benefit.
    (4) Allocation of costs to unit. Except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(5) of this section, the accumulated production expenditures for a 
unit of real property include, in all cases, the costs that directly 
benefit, or are incurred by reason of the production of, the unit of 
real property. Accumulated production expenditures also include the 
adjusted basis of property used to produce the unit of real property. 
The accumulated costs of a common feature or land that benefits more 
than one unit of real property, or that benefits designated property and 
property other than designated property, is apportioned among the units 
of designated property, or among the designated property and property 
other than designated property, in determining accumulated production 
expenditures. The apportionment of the accumulated costs of the common 
feature (allocable share) or land (attributable land costs) generally 
may be made using any method that is applied on a consistent basis and 
that reasonably reflects the benefits provided. For example, an 
apportionment based on relative costs to be incurred, relative space to 
be occupied, or relative fair market values may be reasonable.
    (5) Treatment of costs when a common feature is included in a unit 
of real property--(i) General rule. Except as provided in this paragraph 
(b)(5), the accumulated production expenditures of a unit of real 
property include the costs of functionally interdependent components 
(benefitted property) and an allocable share of the cost of common 
features throughout the entire production period of the unit. See 
Sec. 1.263A-12, relating to the production period of a unit of property.
    (ii) Production activity not undertaken on benefitted property--(A) 
Direct production activity not undertaken--(1) In general. The costs of 
land attributable to a benefitted property may be treated as not 
included in accumulated production expenditures for a unit of real 
property for measurement dates prior to the first date a production 
activity (direct production activity), including the clearing and 
grading of land, has been undertaken with respect to the land 
attributable to the benefitted property. Thus, the costs of land 
attributable to a benefitted property (as opposed to land attributable 
to the common features) with respect to which no direct production 
activities have been undertaken may be treated as not included in the 
accumulated production expenditures of a unit of real property even 
though a production activity has begun on a common feature allocable to 
the unit.
    (2) Land attributable to a benefitted property. For purposes of this 
paragraph (b)(5)(ii), land attributable to a benefitted property 
includes all land in the unit of real property that includes the 
benefitted property other than land for a common feature. (Thus, land 
attributable to a benefitted property does not include land attributable 
to a common feature.)
    (B) Suspension of direct production activity after clearing and 
grading undertaken--(1) General rule. This paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) may 
be used to determine the accumulated production expenditures for a unit 
of real property, if the only production activity with respect to a 
benefitted property has been clearing and grading and no further direct 
production activity is undertaken with respect to the benefitted 
property for at least 120 consecutive days (i.e., direct production 
activity has ceased). Under this paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B), the 
accumulated production expenditures attributable to a benefitted 
property qualifying under this paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) may be excluded 
from the accumulated production expenditures of the unit of real 
property even though production continues on a common feature allocable 
to the unit. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B), production 
activity is considered to occur during any time which would not qualify 
as a cessation of production activities under the suspension period 
rules of Sec. 1.263A-12(g).
    (2) Accumulated production expenditures. If this paragraph 
(b)(5)(ii)(B) applies, accumulated production expenditures attributable 
to the benefitted property of the unit of real property

[[Page 473]]

may be treated as not included in the accumulated production 
expenditures for the unit starting with the first measurement period 
beginning after the first day of the 120 consecutive day period, but 
must be included in the accumulated production expenditures for the unit 
beginning in the measurement period in which direct production activity 
has resumed on the benefitted property. Accumulated production 
expenditures with respect to common features allocable to the unit of 
real property may not be excluded under this paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B).
    (iii) Common feature placed in service before the end of production 
of a benefitted property. To the extent that a common feature with 
respect to which all production activities to be undertaken by, or for, 
a taxpayer or a related person are completed is placed in service before 
the end of the production period of a unit that includes an allocable 
share of the costs of the common feature, the costs of the common 
feature are not treated as included in accumulated production 
expenditures of the unit for measurement periods beginning after the 
date the common feature is placed in service.
    (iv) Benefitted property sold before production completed on common 
feature. If a unit of real property is sold before common features 
included in the unit are completed, the production period of the unit 
ends on the date of sale. Thus, common feature costs actually incurred 
and properly allocable to the unit as of the date of sale are excluded 
from accumulated production expenditures for measurement periods 
beginning after the date of sale. Common feature costs properly 
allocable to the unit and actually incurred after the sale are not taken 
into account in determining accumulated production expenditures.
    (v) Benefitted property placed in service before production 
completed on common feature. Where production activities remain to be 
undertaken on a common feature allocable to a unit of real property that 
includes benefitted property, the costs of the benefitted property are 
not treated as included in the accumulated production expenditures for 
the unit for measurement periods beginning after the date the benefitted 
property is placed in service and all production activities reasonably 
expected to be undertaken by, or for, the taxpayer or a related person 
with respect to the benefitted property are completed.
    (6) Examples. The principles of paragraph (b) of this section are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. B, an individual, is in the trade or business of 
constructing custom-built houses for sale. B owns a 10-acre tract upon 
which B intends to build four houses on 2-acre lots. In addition, on the 
remaining 2 acres B plans to construct a perimeter road that benefits 
the four houses and is not held for the production of income separately 
from the sale of the houses. In 1995, B begins constructing the 
perimeter road and clears the land for one house. Under the principles 
of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, each planned house (including 
attributable land) is part of a separate unit of real property (house 
unit). Under the principles of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the 
perimeter road (including attributable land) constitutes a common 
feature with respect to each planned house (i.e., benefitted property). 
In accordance with paragraph (b)(1), the production period for all four 
house units begins when production commences on the perimeter road in 
1995. In addition, under the principles of paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section, the accumulated production expenditures for the four house 
units include the allocable costs of the road. In addition, for the 
house with respect to which B has cleared the land, the accumulated 
production expenditures for the house unit include the land costs 
attributable to the house. See paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section. 
However, the accumulated production expenditures for each of the three 
house units that include a house for which B has not yet undertaken a 
direct production activity do not include the land costs attributable to 
the house. See paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as Example 1, except that B 
undertakes no further direct production activity with respect to the 
house for which the land was cleared for a period of at least 120 days 
but continues constructing the perimeter road during this period. In 
accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, B may exclude 
the accumulated production expenditures attributable to the benefitted 
property from the accumulated production expenditures of the house unit 
starting with the first measurement period that begins after the first 
day of the 120 consecutive day period. B must include the accumulated 
production expenditures attributable to the benefitted property in the 
accumulated production expenditures for the house unit beginning with 
the measurement period in which direct production

[[Page 474]]

resumes on the benefitted property. The house unit will continue to 
include the accumulated production expenditures attributable to the 
perimeter road during the period in which direct production activity was 
suspended on the benefitted property.
    Example 3. (i) D, a corporation, is in the trade or business of 
developing commercial real property. D owns a 20-acre tract upon which D 
intends to build a shopping center with 150 stores. D intends to lease 
the stores. D will also provide on the 20 acres a 1500-car parking lot, 
which is not held by D for the production of income separately from the 
stores in the shopping center. Additionally, D will not produce any 
other common features as part of the project. D intends to complete the 
shopping center in phases and expects that each store will be placed in 
service independently of any other store.
    (ii) Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, each store 
(including attributable land) is part of a separate unit of real 
property (store unit). The 1500-car parking lot is a common feature 
benefitting each store, and D must include an allocable share of the 
parking lots in each store unit. See paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3). In 
accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(i), D includes in the accumulated 
production expenditures for each store unit during each store unit's 
production period: the costs capitalized with respect to the store 
(including attributable land costs in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) 
of this section) and an allocable share of the parking lot costs 
(including attributable land costs in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) 
of this section). Under paragraph (b)(4), the portion of the parking lot 
costs that is included in the accumulated production expenditures of a 
store unit is determined using a reasonable method of allocation.
    Example 4. X, a real estate developer, begins a project to construct 
a condominium building and a convenience store for the benefit of the 
condominium. X intends to separately lease the convenience store. 
Because the convenience store is held for the production of income 
separately from the condominium units that it benefits, the convenience 
store is not a common feature with respect to the condominium building. 
Instead, the convenience store is a separate unit of property with a 
separate production period and for which a separate determination of 
accumulated production expenditures must be made.
    Example 5. (i) In 1995, X, a real estate developer, begins a project 
consisting of a condominium building and a common swimming pool that is 
not held for the production of income separately from the condominium 
sales. The condominium building consists of 10 stories, and each story 
is occupied by a single condominium. Production of the swimming pool 
begins in January. No direct production activity is undertaken on any 
condominium until September, when direct production activity commences 
on each condominium. On December 31, 1995, 1 condominium that was 
completed in December has been sold, 3 condominiums that were completed 
in December have not been sold, and 6 condominiums are only partially 
complete; additionally, the swimming pool is completed. X is a calendar 
year taxpayer that uses a full taxable year as the computation period, 
and quarterly measurement dates.
    (ii) Under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, each 
condominium (including attributable land) is part of a separate unit of 
real property. Under the principles of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
the swimming pool is a common feature with respect to each condominium 
and under paragraph (b)(4) of this section the cost of the swimming pool 
is allocated equally among the condominiums.
    (iii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the production period 
of each of the 10 condominium units begins in January when production of 
the swimming pool begins. On X's March 31, 1995, and June 30, 1995, 
measurement dates, the accumulated production expenditures for each 
condominium unit include the allocable costs of the swimming pool, but 
not the land costs attributable to the condominium because no direct 
production activity has been undertaken on the condominium. See 
paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(A) of this section. On X's September 30, 1995, and 
December 31, 1995, measurement dates, the accumulated production 
expenditures for each unit include the allocable costs of the swimming 
pool, and the costs of the condominium (including attributable land 
costs) because a direct production activity has commenced on the 
condominium. See paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section.
    (iv) The production period for the condominium unit that includes 
the condominium that is sold as of the end of 1995 ends on the date the 
condominium is sold. See paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this section. The 
production period of each unit that is ready to be held for sale ends 
when all production activities have been completed on the unit, in this 
case on December 31, 1995, the date that the swimming pool included in 
the unit is completed. See Sec. 1.263A-12(d). Accordingly, interest 
capitalization ceases for each such unit that is sold or ready to be 
held for sale as of the end of 1995 (including each unit's allocable 
share of the completed swimming pool).
    (v) The production periods for the condominium units that include 
the condominiums that are only partially complete at the end of 1995 
continue after 1995. The accumulated production expenditures for each 
partially completed condominium unit continue to include the costs of 
the condominium (including attributable land costs) in addition

[[Page 475]]

to the costs of an allocable share of the completed swimming pool 
(including attributable land costs).
    Example 6. Assume the same facts as in Example 5, except that the 
swimming pool is only partially complete as of the end of 1995. Under 
these facts, X capitalizes no interest during 1996 for the 1 unit that 
includes the condominium sold during 1995 (including the costs of the 
allocable share of the swimming pool). See paragraph (b)(5)(iv) of this 
section. However, with respect to the 6 condominiums that are partially 
complete and the 3 condominiums that are completed but unsold, interest 
capitalization continues after the end of 1995. The accumulated 
production expenditures for each of these 9 units include the costs of 
an allocable share of the swimming pool. See paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this 
section. In determining the costs of an allocable share of the swimming 
pool included in the accumulated production expenditures for each of the 
9 units, X includes all costs of the swimming pool properly allocable to 
each unit, including those cost incurred as of the date of the sale of 
unit 1 that may have been used under applicable administrative 
procedures (e.g., Rev. Proc. 92-29, 1992-1 C.B. 748) in determining the 
basis of unit 1 solely for purposes of computing gain or loss on the 
sale of unit 1. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.
    Example 7. (i) Assume the same facts as in Example 5, except that X 
intends to lease rather than sell the condominiums and the completed 
swimming pool is placed in service for depreciation purposes on December 
31, 1995. Additionally, assume that all 10 condominiums are partially 
completed at the end of 1995.
    (ii) Under these facts, because the swimming pool is a common 
feature that is placed in service separately from the condominiums that 
it benefits, under paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section, the 
accumulated production expenditures of each of the condominium units do 
not include the costs of the allocable share of the swimming pool after 
1995.

    (c) Units of tangible personal property. Components of tangible 
personal property are a single unit of property if the components are 
functionally interdependent. Components of tangible personal property 
that are produced by, or for, the taxpayer, for use by the taxpayer or a 
related person, are functionally interdependent if the placing in 
service of one component is dependent on the placing in service of the 
other component by the taxpayer or a related person. In the case of 
tangible personal property produced for sale, components of tangible 
personal property are functionally interdependent if they are 
customarily sold as a single unit. For example, if an aircraft 
manufacturer customarily sells completely assembled aircraft, the unit 
of property includes all components of a completely assembled aircraft. 
If the manufacturer also customarily sells aircraft engines separately, 
any engines that are reasonably expected to be sold separately are 
treated as single units of property.
    (d) Treatment of installations. If the taxpayer produces or is 
treated as producing any property that is installed on or in other 
property, the production activity and installation activity relating to 
each unit of property generally are not aggregated for purposes of this 
section. However, if the taxpayer is treated as producing and installing 
any property for use by the taxpayer or a related person or if the 
taxpayer enters into a contract requiring the taxpayer to install 
property for use by a customer, the production activity and installation 
activity are aggregated for purposes of this section.

[T.D. 8584, 59 FR 67207, Dec. 29, 1994; 60 FR 16574, 16575, Mar. 31, 
1995]


<R05>
Sec. 1.263A-11  Accumulated production expenditures.

    (a) General rule. Accumulated production expenditures generally 
means the cumulative amount of direct and indirect costs described in 
section 263A(a) that are required to be capitalized with respect to the 
unit of property (as defined in Sec. 1.263A-10), including interest 
capitalized in prior computation periods, plus the adjusted bases of any 
assets described in paragraph (d) of this section that are used to 
produce the unit of property during the period of their use. Accumulated 
production expenditures may also include the basis of any property 
received by the taxpayer in a nontaxable transaction.
    (b) When costs are first taken into account--(1) In general. Except 
as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, costs are taken into 
account in the computation of accumulated production expenditures at the 
time and to the extent they would otherwise be taken into account under 
the taxpayer's method of accounting (e.g., after applying the 
requirements of section 461, including the economic performance 
requirement of section

[[Page 476]]

461(h)). Costs that have been incurred and capitalized with respect to a 
unit of property prior to the beginning of the production period are 
taken into account as accumulated production expenditures beginning on 
the date on which the production period of the property begins (as 
defined in Sec. 1.263A-12(c)). Thus, for example, the cost of raw land 
acquired for development, the cost of a leasehold in mineral properties 
acquired for development, and the capitalized cost of planning and 
design activities are taken into account as accumulated production 
expenditures beginning on the first day of the production period. For 
purposes of determining accumulated production expenditures on any 
measurement date during a computation period, the interest required to 
be capitalized for the computation period is deemed to be capitalized on 
the day immediately following the end of the computation period. For any 
subsequent measurement dates and computation periods, that interest is 
included in accumulated production expenditures. If the cost of land or 
common features is allocated among planned units of property that are 
completed in phases, any portion of the cost properly allocated to 
completed units is not reallocated to any incomplete units of property.
    (2) Dedication rule for materials and supplies. The costs of raw 
materials, supplies, or similar items are taken into account as 
accumulated production expenditures when they are incurred and dedicated 
to production of a unit of property. Dedicated means the first date on 
which the raw materials, supplies, or similar items are specifically 
associated with the production of any unit of property, including by 
record, assignment to the specific job site, or physical incorporation. 
In contrast, in the case of a component or subassembly that is 
reasonably expected to be become a part of (e.g., be incorporated into) 
any unit of property, costs incurred (including dedicated raw materials) 
for the component or subassembly are taken into account as accumulated 
production expenditures during the production of any portion of the 
component or subassembly and prior to its connection with (e.g., 
incorporation into) any specific unit of property. For purposes of the 
preceding sentence, components and subassemblies must be aggregated at 
each measurement date in a reasonable manner that is consistent with the 
purposes of section 263A(f).
    (c) Property produced under a contract--(1) Customer. If a unit of 
property produced under a contract is designated property under 
Sec. 1.263A-8(d)(2)(i) with respect to the customer, the customer's 
accumulated production expenditures include any payments under the 
contract that represent part of the purchase price of the unit of 
designated property or, to the extent costs are incurred earlier than 
payments are made (determined on a cumulative basis for each unit of 
designated property), any part of such price for which the requirements 
of section 461 have been satisfied. The customer has made a payment 
under this section if the transaction would be considered a payment by a 
taxpayer using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. 
The customer's accumulated production expenditures also include any 
other costs incurred by the customer, such as interest, or any other 
direct or indirect costs that are required to be capitalized under 
section 263A(a) and the regulations thereunder with respect to the 
production of the unit of designated property.
    (2) Contractor. If a unit of property produced under a contract is 
designated property under Sec. 1.263A-8(d)(2)(ii) with respect to the 
contractor, the contractor must treat the cumulative amount of payments 
made by the customer under the contract attributable to the unit of 
property as a reduction in the contractor's accumulated production 
expenditures. The customer has made a payment under this section if the 
transaction would be considered a payment by a taxpayer using the cash 
receipts and disbursements method of accounting.
    (d) Property used to produce designated property--(1) In general. 
Accumulated production expenditures include the adjusted bases (or 
portion thereof) of any equipment, facilities, or other similar assets, 
used in a reasonably proximate manner for the production of a unit of 
designated property during any measurement period in which the

[[Page 477]]

asset is so used. Examples of assets used in a reasonably proximate 
manner include machinery and equipment used directly or indirectly in 
the production process, such as assembly-line structures, cranes, 
bulldozers, and buildings. A taxpayer apportions the adjusted basis of 
an asset used in the production of more than one unit of designated 
property in a measurement period among such units of designated property 
using reasonable criteria corresponding to the use of the asset, such as 
machine hours, mileage, or units of production. If an asset used in a 
reasonably proximate manner for the production of a unit of designated 
property is temporarily idle (within the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-
1(e)(3)(iii)(E)) for an entire measurement period, the adjusted basis of 
the asset is excluded from the accumulated production expenditures for 
the unit during that measurement period. Notwithstanding this paragraph 
(d)(1), the portion of the depreciation allowance for equipment, 
facilities, or any other asset that is capitalized with respect to a 
unit of designated property in accordance with Sec. 1.263A-
1(e)(3)(ii)(I) is included in accumulated production expenditures 
without regard to the extent of use under this paragraph (d)(1) (i.e., 
without regard to whether the asset is used in a reasonably proximate 
manner for the production of the unit of designated property).
    (2) Example. The following example illustrates how the basis of an 
asset is allocated on the basis of time:

    Example. In 1995, X uses a bulldozer exclusively to clear the land 
on several adjacent real estate development projects, A, B, and C. A, B, 
and C are treated as separate units of property under the principles of 
Sec. 1.263A-10. X decides to allocate the basis of the bulldozer among 
the three projects on the basis of time. At the end of the first quarter 
of 1995, the production period has commenced for all three projects. The 
bulldozer was operated for 30 hours on project A, 80 hours on project B, 
and 10 hours on project C, for a total of 120 hours for the entire 
period. For purposes of determining accumulated production expenditures 
as of the end of the first quarter, \1/4\ of the adjusted basis of the 
bulldozer is allocated to project A, \2/3\ to project B, and \1/12\ to 
project C. Nonworking hours, regularly scheduled nonworking days, or 
other periods in which the bulldozer is temporarily idle (within the 
meaning of Sec. 1.263A-1(e)(3)(iii)(E)) during the measurement period 
are not taken into account in allocating the basis of the bulldozer.

    (3) Excluded equipment and facilities. The adjusted bases of 
equipment, facilities, or other assets that are not used in a reasonably 
proximate manner to produce a unit of property are not included in the 
computation of accumulated production expenditures. For example, the 
adjusted bases of equipment and facilities, including buildings and 
other structures, used in service departments performing administrative, 
purchasing, personnel, legal, accounting, or similar functions, are 
excluded from the computation of accumulated production expenditures 
under this paragraph (d)(3).
    (e) Improvements--(1) General rule. If an improvement constitutes 
the production of designated property under $1.263A-8(d)(3), accumulated 
production expenditures with respect to the improvement consist of--
    (i) All direct and indirect costs required to be capitalized with 
respect to the improvement,
    (ii) In the case of an improvement to a unit of real property--
    (A) An allocable portion of the cost of land, and
    (B) For any measurement period, the adjusted basis of any existing 
structure, common feature, or other property that is not placed in 
service or must be temporarily withdrawn from service to complete the 
improvement (associated property) during any part of the measurement 
period if the associated property directly benefits the property being 
improved, the associated property directly benefits from the 
improvement, or the improvement was incurred by reason of the associated 
property. See, however, the de minimis rule under paragraph (e)(2) of 
this section that applies in the case of associated property.
    (iii) In the case of an improvement to a unit of tangible personal 
property, the adjusted basis of the asset being improved if that asset 
either is not placed in service or must be temporarily withdrawn from 
service to complete the improvement.
    (2) De minimis rule. For purposes of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this 
section, the total costs of all associated property

[[Page 478]]

for an improvement unit (associated property costs) are excluded from 
the accumulated production expenditures for the improvement unit during 
its production period if, on the date the production period of the unit 
begins, the taxpayer reasonably expects that at no time during the 
production period of the unit will the accumulated production 
expenditures for the unit, determined without regard to the associated 
property costs, exceed 5 percent of the associated property costs.
    (f) Mid-production purchases. If a taxpayer purchases a unit of 
property for further production, the taxpayer's accumulated production 
expenditures include the full purchase price of the property plus, in 
accordance with the principles of paragraph (e) of this section, 
additional direct and indirect costs incurred by the taxpayer.
    (g) Related person costs. The activities of a related person are 
taken into account in applying the classification thresholds under 
Sec. 1.263A-8(b)(1)(ii)(B) and (C), and in determining the production 
period of a unit of designated property under Sec. 1.263A-12. However, 
only those costs incurred by the taxpayer are taken into account in the 
taxpayer's accumulated production expenditures under this section 
because the related person includes its own capitalized costs in the 
related person's accumulated production expenditures with respect to any 
unit of designated property upon which the parties engage in mutual 
production activities. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the 
accumulated production expenditures of any property transferred to a 
taxpayer in a nontaxable transaction are treated as accumulated 
production expenditures incurred by the taxpayer.
    (h) Installation. If the taxpayer installs property that is 
purchased by the taxpayer, accumulated production expenditures include 
the cost of the property that is installed in addition to the direct and 
indirect costs of installation.

<R05>
Sec. 1.263A-12  Production period.

    (a) In general. Capitalization of interest is required under 
Sec. 1.263A-9 for computation periods (within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.263A-9(f)(1)) that include the production period of a unit of 
designated property. In contrast, section 263A(a) requires the 
capitalization of all other direct or indirect costs, such as insurance, 
taxes, and storage, that directly benefit or are incurred by reason of 
the production of property without regard to whether they are incurred 
during a period in which production activity occurs.
    (b) Related person activities. Activities performed and costs 
incurred by a person related to the taxpayer that directly benefit or 
are incurred by reason of the taxpayer's production of designated 
property are taken into account in determining the taxpayer's production 
period (regardless of whether the related person is performing only a 
service or is producing a subassembly or component that the related 
person is required to treat as an item of designated property). These 
activities and the related person's costs are also taken into account in 
determining whether tangible personal property produced by the taxpayer 
is 1-year or 2-year property under Sec. 1.263A-8(b)(1)(ii) (B) and (C).
    (c) Beginning of production period--(1) In general. A separate 
production period is determined for each unit of property defined in 
Sec. 1.263A-10. The production period begins on the date that production 
of the unit of property begins.
    (2) Real property. The production period of a unit of real property 
begins on the first date that any physical production activity (as 
defined in paragraph (e) of this section) is performed with respect to a 
unit of real property. See Sec. 1.263A-10(b)(1). The production period 
of a unit of real property produced under a contract begins for the 
contractor on the date the contractor begins physical production 
activity on the property. The production period of a unit of real 
property produced under a contract begins for the customer on the date 
either the customer or the contractor begins physical production 
activity on the property.
    (3) Tangible personal property. The production period of a unit of 
tangible personal property begins on the first

[[Page 479]]

date by which the taxpayer's accumulated production expenditures, 
including planning and design expenditures, are at least 5 percent of 
the taxpayer's total estimated accumulated production expenditures for 
the property unit. Thus, the beginning of the production period is 
determined without regard to whether physical production activity has 
commenced. The production period of a unit of tangible personal property 
produced under a contract begins for the contractor when the 
contractor's accumulated production expenditures, without any reduction 
for payments from the customer, are at least 5 percent of the 
contractor's total estimated accumulated production expenditures. The 
production period for a unit of tangible personal property produced 
under a contract begins for the customer when the customer's accumulated 
production expenditures are at least 5 percent of the customer's total 
estimated accumulated production expenditures.
    (d) End of production period--(1) In general. The production period 
for a unit of property produced for self use ends on the date that the 
unit is placed in service and all production activities reasonably 
expected to be undertaken by, or for, the taxpayer or a related person 
are completed. The production period for a unit of property produced for 
sale ends on the date that the unit is ready to be held for sale and all 
production activities reasonably expected to be undertaken by, or for, 
the taxpayer or a related person are completed. See, however, 
Sec. 1.263A-10(b)(5)(iv) providing an exception for common features in 
the case of a benefitted property that is sold. In the case of a unit of 
property produced under a contract, the production period for the 
customer ends when the property is placed in service by the customer and 
all production activities reasonably expected to be undertaken are 
complete (i.e., generally, no earlier than when the customer takes 
delivery). In the case of property that is customarily aged (such as 
tobacco, wine, or whiskey) before it is sold, the production period 
includes the aging period.
    (2) Special rules. The production period does not end for a unit of 
property prior to the completion of physical production activities by 
the taxpayer even though the property is held for sale or lease, since 
all production activities reasonably expected to be undertaken by the 
taxpayer with respect to such property have not in fact been completed. 
See, however, Sec. 1.263A-10(b)(5) regarding separation of certain 
common features.
    (3) Sequential production or delivery. The production period ends 
with respect to each unit of property (as defined in Sec. 1.263A-10) and 
its associated accumulated production expenditures as the unit of 
property is completed within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section, without regard to the production activities or costs of any 
other units of property. Thus, for example, in the case of separate 
apartments in a multi-unit building, each of which is a separate unit of 
property within the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-10, the production period 
ends for each separate apartment when it is ready to be held for sale or 
placed in service within the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this 
section. In the case of a single unit of property that merely undergoes 
separate and distinct stages of production, the production period ends 
at the same time (i.e., when all separate stages of production are 
completed with respect to the entire amount of accumulated production 
expenditures for the property).
    (4) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (d) of this section are 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. E is engaged in the original construction of a high-rise 
office building with two wings. At the end of 1995, Wing #1, but not 
Wing #2, is placed in service. Moreover, at the end of 1995, all 
production activities reasonably expected to be undertaken on Wing #1 
are completed. In accordance with Sec. 1.263A-10(b)(1), Wing #1 and Wing 
#2 are separate units of designated property. E may stop capitalizing 
interest on Wing #1 but not on Wing #2.
    Example 2. F is in the business of constructing finished houses. F 
generally paints and finishes the interior of the house, although this 
does not occur until a potential buyer is located. Because F reasonably 
expects to undertake production activity (painting and finishing), the 
production period of each house does not end until these activities are 
completed.


[[Page 480]]


    (e) Physical production activities--(1) In general. The term 
physical production activities includes any physical activity that 
constitutes production within the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-8(d)(1). The 
production period begins and interest must be capitalized with respect 
to real property if any physical production activities are undertaken, 
whether alone or in preparation for the construction of buildings or 
other structures, or with respect to the improvement of existing 
structures. For example, the clearing of raw land constitutes the 
production of designated property, even if only cleared prior to resale.
    (2) Illustrations. The following is a partial list of activities any 
one of which constitutes a physical production activity with respect to 
the production of real property:
    (i) Clearing, grading, or excavating of raw land;
    (ii) Demolishing a building or gutting a standing building;
    (iii) Engaging in the construction of infrastructure, such as roads, 
sewers, sidewalks, cables, and wiring;
    (iv) Undertaking structural, mechanical, or electrical activities 
with respect to a building or other structure; or
    (v) Engaging in landscaping activities.
    (f) Activities not considered physical production. The activities 
described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section are not 
considered physical production activities:
    (1) Planning and design. Soil testing, preparing architectural 
blueprints or models, or obtaining building permits.
    (2) Incidental repairs. Physical activities of an incidental nature 
that may be treated as repairs under Sec. 1.162-4.
    (g) Suspension of production period--(1) In general. If production 
activities related to the production of a unit of designated property 
cease for at least 120 consecutive days (cessation period), a taxpayer 
may suspend the capitalization of interest with respect to the unit of 
designated property starting with the first measurement period that 
begins after the first day in which production ceases. The taxpayer must 
resume the capitalization of interest with respect to a unit beginning 
with the measurement period during which production activities resume. 
In addition, production activities are not considered to have ceased if 
they cease because of circumstances inherent in the production process, 
such as normal adverse weather conditions, scheduled plant shutdowns, or 
delays due to design or construction flaws, the obtaining of a permit or 
license, or the settlement of groundfill to construct property. Interest 
incurred on debt that is traced debt with respect to a unit of 
designated property during the suspension period is subject to 
capitalization with respect to the production of other units of 
designated property as interest on nontraced debt. See Sec. 1.263A-
9(c)(5)(i) of this section. For applications of the avoided cost method 
after the end of the suspension period, the accumulated production 
expenditures for the unit include the balance of accumulated production 
expenditures as of the beginning of the suspension period, plus any 
additional capitalized costs incurred during the suspension period. No 
further suspension of interest capitalization may occur unless the 
requirements for a new suspension period are satisfied.
    (2) Special rule. If a cessation period spans more than one taxable 
year, the taxpayer may suspend the capitalization of interest with 
respect to a unit beginning with the first measurement period of the 
taxable year in which the 120-day period is satisfied.
    (3) Method of accounting. An election to suspend interest 
capitalization under paragraph (g)(1) of this section is a method of 
accounting that must be consistently applied to all units that satisfy 
the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. However, the 
special rule in paragraph (g)(2) of this section is applied on an annual 
basis to all units of an electing taxpayer that satisfy the requirements 
of paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
    (4) Example. The provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section are 
illustrated by the following example.

    Example. (i) D, a calendar-year taxpayer, began production of a 
residential housing development on January 1, 1995. D, in applying the 
avoided cost method, chose a taxable year computation period and 
quarterly measurement dates. On April 10, 1995, all production 
activities ceased with respect to the units in the development until 
December 1,

[[Page 481]]

1996. The cessation, which occurred for a period of at least 120 
consecutive days, was not attributable to circumstances inherent in the 
production process. With respect to the units in the development, D 
incurred production expenditures of $2,000,000 from January 1, 1995 
through April 10, 1995. D incurred interest of $100,000 on traced debt 
with respect to the units for the period beginning January 1, 1995, and 
ending June 30, 1995. D did not incur any production expenditures for 
the more than 20-month cessation beginning April 10, 1995, and ending 
December 1, 1996, but incurred $200,000 of production expenditures from 
December 1, 1996, through December 31, 1996.
    (ii) D is required to capitalize the $100,000 interest on traced 
debt incurred during the two measurement periods beginning January 1, 
1995, and ending June 30, 1995. Because D satisfied the 120-day rule 
under this paragraph (g), D is not required to capitalize interest with 
respect to the accumulated production expenditures for the units for the 
measurement period beginning July 1, 1995, and ending September 30, 
1995, which is the first measurement period that begins after the date 
production activities cease. D is rquired to resume interest 
capitalization with respect to the $2,300,000 
(2,000,000+100,000+200,000) of accumulated production expenditures for 
the units for the measurement period beginning October 1, 1996, and 
ending December 31, 1996 (the measurement period during which production 
activities resume). Accordingly, D may suspend the capitalization of 
interest with respect to the units from July 1, 1995, through September 
30, 1996.

<R05>
Sec. 1.263A-13  Oil and gas activities.

    (a) In general. This section provides rules that are to be applied 
in tandem with Secs. 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-12, 1.263A-14, and 1.263A-
15 in capitalizing interest with respect to the development (within the 
meaning of section 263A(g)) of oil or gas property. For this purpose, 
oil or gas property consists of each separate operating mineral interest 
in oil or gas as defined in section 614(a), or, if a taxpayer makes an 
election under section 614(b), the aggregate of two or more separate 
operating mineral interests in oil or gas as described in section 614(b) 
(section 614 property). Thus, an oil or gas property is designated 
property unless the de minimis rule applies. A taxpayer must apply the 
rules in paragraph (c) of this section if the taxpayer cannot establish, 
at the beginning of the production period of the first well drilled on 
the property, a definite plan that identifies the number and location of 
other wells planned with respect to the property. If a taxpayer can 
establish such a plan at the beginning of the production period of the 
first well drilled on the property, the taxpayer may either apply the 
rules of paragraph (c) of this section or treat each of the planned 
wells as a separate unit and partition the leasehold acquisition costs 
and costs of common features based on the number of planned well units.
    (b) Generally applicable rules--(1) Beginning of production period--
(i) Onshore activities. In the case of onshore oil or gas development 
activities, the production period for a unit begins on the first date 
physical site preparation activities (such as building an access road, 
leveling a site for a drilling rig, or excavating a mud pit) are 
undertaken with respect to the unit.
    (ii) Offshore activities. In the case of offshore development 
activities, the production period for a unit begins on the first date 
physical site preparation activities, other than activities undertaken 
with respect to expendable wells, are undertaken with respect to the 
unit. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the first physical site 
preparation activity undertaken with respect to a section 614 property 
is generally the first activity undertaken with respect to the anchoring 
of a platform (e.g., drilling to drive the piles). For purposes of this 
section, an expendable well is a well drilled solely to determine the 
location and delineation of offshore hydrocarbon deposits.
    (2) End of production period. The production period ends for a 
productive well unit on the date the well is placed in service and all 
production activities reasonably expected to be undertaken by, or for, 
the taxpayer or a related person are completed. See Sec. 1.263A-12(d).
    (3) Accumulated production expenditures--(i) Costs included. 
Accumulated production expenditures for a well unit include the 
following costs (to the extent they are not intangible drilling and 
development costs allowable as a deduction under section 263(c), 263(i), 
or 291(b)(2)): the costs of acquiring the

[[Page 482]]

section 614 leasehold and the costs of taxes and similar items that are 
required to be capitalized under section 263A(a) with respect to the 
section 614 leasehold; the cost of real property associated with 
developing the section 614 property (e.g., casing); the basis of real 
property that constitutes a common feature within the meaning of 
Sec. 1.263A-10(b)(3); and the adjusted basis of property used to produce 
property (such as a mobile rig, drilling ship, or an offshore drilling 
platform).
    (ii) Improvement unit. To the extent section 614 costs are allocated 
to a well unit, the undepleted portion of those section 614 costs must 
also be included in the accumulated production expenditures for any 
improvement unit (within the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-8(d)(3)) with 
respect to that well unit.
    (c) Special rules when definite plan not established--(1) In 
general. The special rules of this paragraph (c) must be applied by a 
taxpayer that cannot establish, at the beginning of the production 
period of the first well drilled on the property, a definite plan that 
identifies the number and location of the wells planned with respect to 
the property. A taxpayer than can establish such a plan is permitted, 
but not required, to apply the rules of this paragraph (c), provided the 
rules of this paragraph (c) are consistently applied for all the 
taxpayer's oil or gas properties for which a definite plan can be 
established.
    (2) Oil and gas units--(i) First productive well unit. Until the 
first productive well is placed in service and all production activities 
reasonably expected to be undertaken by, or for, the taxpayer or a 
related person are completed, a first productive well unit includes the 
section 614 property and all real property associated with the 
development of the section 614 property. Thus, for example, a first 
productive well unit includes the section 614 property and real property 
associated with any nonproductive well drilled on the section 614 
property on or before the date the first productive well is placed in 
service and all production activities reasonably expected to be 
undertaken by, or for, the taxpayer or a related person are completed. 
For purposes of this section, a productive well is a well that produces 
in commercial quantities. See paragraph (c)(5) of this section, which 
provides a special rule whereby the costs of a section 614 property and 
common feature costs for a section 614 property generally are included 
only in the accumulated production expenditures for the first productive 
well unit.
    (ii) Subsequent units. Generally, real property associated with each 
productive or nonproductive well with respect to which production 
activities begin after the date the first productive well is placed in 
service and all production activities reasonably expected to be 
undertaken by, or for, the taxpayer or a related person are completed, 
constitutes a unit of real property. Additionally, a productive or 
nonproductive well that is included in a first productive well unit and 
for which development continues after the date the first productive well 
is placed in service and all production activities reasonably expected 
to be undertaken by, or for, the taxpayer or a related person are 
completed, generally is treated as a separate unit of property after 
that date. See, however, paragraph (c)(5) of this section, which 
provides rules for the treatment of costs included in the accumulated 
production expenditures of a first productive well unit.
    (3) Beginning of production period--(i) First productive well unit. 
The beginning of the production period of the first productive well unit 
is determined as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (ii) Subsequent wells. In applying paragraph (b) of this section to 
subsequent well units (as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section), any activities occurring prior to the date the production 
period ends for the first productive well unit are not taken into 
account in determining the beginning of the production period for the 
subsequent well units.
    (4) End of production period. The end of the production period for 
both the first productive well unit and subsequent productive well units 
is determined as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. See 
Sec. 1.263A-12(d). Nonproductive wells included in the first productive 
well unit need not be plugged and abandoned for the production period to 
end for a first productive well unit.

[[Page 483]]

    (5) Accumulated production expenditures--(i) First productive well 
unit. The accumulated production expenditures for a first productive 
well unit include all costs incurred with respect to the section 614 
property and associated real property at any time through the end of the 
production period for the first productive well unit. Thus, the costs of 
acquiring the section 614 property, the costs of taxes and similar items 
that are required to be capitalized under section 263A(a) with respect 
to the section 614 property, and the costs of common features, that are 
incurred at any time through the end of the production period of the 
first productive well unit (section 614 costs) are included in the 
accumulated production expenditures for the first productive well unit.
    (ii) Subsequent well unit. The accumulated production expenditures 
for a subsequent well do not include any costs included in the 
accumulated production expenditures for a first productive well unit. In 
the event that section 614 costs or common feature costs with respect to 
a section 614 property are incurred subsequent to the end of the 
production period of the first productive well unit, those common 
feature costs and undepleted section 614 costs are allocated among the 
accumulated production expenditures of wells being drilled as of the 
date such costs are incurred.
    (6) Allocation of interest capitalized with respect to first 
productive well unit. Interest attributable to any productive or 
nonproductive well included in the first productive well unit (within 
the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) is allocated among 
and capitalized to the basis of the property associated with the first 
productive well unit. See Sec. 1.263A-8(a)(2).
    (7) Example. The provisions of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by 
the following example.

    Example. (i) Corporation Z, an oil company, acquired a section 614 
property in an onshore tract, Tract B, for development. In 1995, 
Corporation Z began site preparation activities on Tract B and also 
commenced drilling Well 1 on Tract B. Corporation Z was unable to 
establish, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, a definite plan 
identifying the number and location of other wells planned on Tract B. 
In 1996, Corporation Z began drilling Well 2. On May 1, 1997, Well 2, a 
productive well, was placed in service and all production activities 
reasonably expected to be undertaken with respect to Well 2 were 
completed. By that date, also, Well 1 was abandoned.
    (ii) Well 2 is a first productive well (within the meaning of 
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section). Well 1 is a nonproductive well 
drilled prior to a first productive well. Under paragraph (c) of this 
section, Corporation Z must treat both Well 1 and Well 2 as part of the 
first productive well unit on the section 614 property. In accordance 
with paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section, the production period 
of the first productive well unit begins on the date physical site 
preparation activities are undertaken with respect to Well 1 in 1995 and 
ends on May 1, 1997, the date that Well 2 is placed in service and all 
production activities reasonably expected to be undertaken are 
completed. In accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the 
accumulated production expenditures for the first productive well unit 
include, among other capitalized costs, the entire section 614 property 
costs capitalized with respect to Tract B and all common feature costs 
incurred with respect to the section 614 property through May 1, 1997.
    (iii) Any well that Corporation Z begins after May 1, 1997, is a 
separate unit of property. See paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. 
Under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, the production period for 
any such well unit begins on the first day after May 1, 1997, on which 
Corporation Z undertakes physical site preparation activities with 
respect to the well unit. Moreover, Corporation Z does not include any 
of the section 614 property costs in the accumulated production 
expenditures for any well unit begun after May 1, 1997.

<R05>
Sec. 1.263A-15  Effective dates, transitional rules, and anti-abuse rule.

    (a) Effective dates--(1) Sections 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15 
generally apply to interest incurred in taxable years beginning on or 
after January 1, 1995. In the case of property that is inventory in the 
hands of the taxpayer, however, these sections are effective for taxable 
years beginning on or after

[[Page 484]]

January 1, 1995. Changes in methods of accounting necessary as a result 
of the rules in Secs. 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15 must be made under the 
terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner. Under these terms 
and conditions, the principles of Sec. 1.263A-7T(e) generally must be 
applied in revaluing inventory property.
    (2) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1995, taxpayers 
must take reasonable positions on their federal income tax returns when 
applying section 263A(f). For purposes of this paragraph (a)(2), a 
reasonable position is a position consistent with the temporary 
regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures, notices, and 
announcements concerning section 263A applicable in taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 1995. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this 
chapter. For this purpose, Notice 88-99, 1988-2 C.B. 422, applies to 
taxable years beginning after August 17, 1988, in the case of inventory, 
and to interest incurred in taxable years beginning after August 17, 
1988, in all other cases. Finally, under administrative procedures 
issued by the Commissioner, taxpayers may elect early application of 
Secs. 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15 to taxable years beginning on or after 
January 1, 1994, in the case of inventory property, and to interest 
incurred in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, in the 
case of property that is not inventory in the hands of the taxpayer.
    (b) Transitional rule for accumulated production expenditures--(1) 
In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
costs incurred before the effective date of section 263A are included in 
accumulated production expenditures (within the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-
11) with respect to noninventory property only to the extent those costs 
were required to be capitalized under section 263 when incurred and 
would have been taken into account in determining the amount of interest 
required to be capitalized under former section 189 (relating to the 
capitalization of real property interest and taxes) or pursuant to an 
election that was in effect under section 266 (relating to the election 
to capitalize certain carrying charges).
    (2) Property used to produce designated property. The basis of 
property acquired prior to 1987 and used to produce designated 
noninventory property after December 31, 1986, is included in 
accumulated production expenditures in accordance with Sec. 1.263A-11(d) 
without regard to whether the basis would have been taken into account 
under former section 189 or section 266.
    (c) Anti-abuse rule. The interest capitalization rules contained in 
Secs. 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15 must be applied by the taxpayer in a 
manner that is consistent with and reasonably carries out the purposes 
of section 263A(f). For example, in applying Sec. 1.263A-10, regarding 
the definition of a unit of property, taxpayers may not divide a single 
unit of property to avoid property classifying the property as 
designated property. Similarly, taxpayers may not use loans in lieu of 
advance payments, tax-exempt parties, loan restructurings at measurement 
dates, or obligations bearing an unreasonably low rate of interest (even 
if such rate equals or exceeds the applicable Federal rate under section 
1274(d)) to avoid the purposes of section 263A(f). For purposes of this 
paragraph (c), the presence of back-to-back loans with different rates 
of interest, and other uses of related parties to facilitate an 
avoidance of interest capitalization, evidences abuse. In such cases, 
the District Director may, based upon all the facts and circumstances, 
determine the amount of interest that must be capitalized in a manner 
that is consistent with and reasonably carries out the purposes of 
section 263A(f).

Sec. 1.264-1   Premiums on life insurance taken out in a trade or business.

    (a) When premiums are not deductible. Premiums paid by a taxpayer on 
a life insurance policy are not deductible from the taxpayer's gross 
income, even though they would otherwise be deductible as trade or 
business expenses, if they are paid on a life insurance policy covering 
the life of any officer or employee of the taxpayer, or any person 
(including the taxpayer) who is financially interested in any trade or 
business carried on by the taxpayer, when the taxpayer is directly or 
indirectly a beneficiary of the policy. For

[[Page 485]]

additional provisions relating to the nondeductibility of premiums paid 
on life insurance policies (whether under section 162 or any other 
section of the Code), see section 262, relating to personal, living, and 
family expenses, and section 265, relating to expenses allocable to tax-
exempt income.
    (b) When taxpayer is a beneficiary. If a taxpayer takes out a policy 
for the purpose of protecting himself from loss in the event of the 
death of the insured, the taxpayer is considered a beneficiary directly 
or indirectly under the policy. However, if the taxpayer is not a 
beneficiary under the policy, the premiums so paid will not be 
disallowed as deductions merely because the taxpayer may derive a 
benefit from the increased efficiency of the officer or employee 
insured. See section 162 and the regulations thereunder. A taxpayer is 
considered a beneficiary under a policy where, for example, he, as a 
principal member of a partnership, takes out an insurance policy on his 
own life irrevocably designating his partner as the sole beneficiary in 
order to induce his partner to retain his investment in the partnership. 
Whether or not the taxpayer is a beneficiary under a policy, the 
proceeds of the policy paid by reason of the death of the insured may be 
excluded from gross income whether the beneficiary is an individual or a 
corporation, except in the case of (1) certain transferees, as provided 
in section 101(a)(2); (2) portions of amounts of life insurance proceeds 
received at a date later than death under the provisions of section 
101(d); and (3) life insurance policy proceeds which are includible in 
the gross income of a husband or wife under section 71 (relating to 
alimony) or section 682 (relating to income of an estate or trust in 
case of divorce, etc.). (See section 101(e).) For further reference, 
see, generally, section 101 and the regulations thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 1.264-2   Single premium life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts.

    Amounts paid or accrued on indebtedness incurred or continued, 
directly or indirectly, to purchase or to continue in effect a single 
premium life insurance or endowment contract, or to purchase or to 
continue in effect a single premium annuity contract purchased (whether 
from the insurer, annuitant, or any other person) after March 1, 1954, 
are not deductible under section 163 or any other provision of chapter 1 
of the Code. This prohibition applies even though the insurance is not 
on the life of the taxpayer and regardless of whether or not the 
taxpayer is the annuitant or payee of such annuity contract. A contract 
is considered a single premium life insurance, endowment, or annuity 
contract, for the purposes of this section, if substantially all the 
premiums on the contract are paid within four years from the date on 
which the contract was purchased, or if an amount is deposited after 
March 1, 1954, with the insurer for payment of a substantial number of 
future premiums on the contract.


<R05>
Sec. 1.264-3   Effective date; taxable years ending after March 1, 1954, subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

    Pursuant to section 7851(a)(1)(C), the regulations prescribed in 
Sec. 1.264-2, to the extent that they relate to amounts paid or accrued 
on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry a single 
premium annuity contract purchased after March 1, 1954, and to the 
extent they consider a contract a single premium life insurance, 
endowment, or annuity contract if an amount is deposited after March 1, 
1954, with the insurer for payment of a substantial number of future 
premiums on the contract, shall also apply to taxable years beginning 
before January 1, 1954, and ending after March 1, 1954, and to taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after March 1, 1954, 
but before August 17, 1954, although such years are subject to the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1939.


<R05>
Sec. 1.264-4   Other life insurance, endowment, or annuity contracts.

    (a) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d) and 
(e) of this section, no deduction shall be allowed under section 163 or 
any other provision of chapter 1 of the Code for

[[Page 486]]

any amount (determined under paragraph (b) of this section) paid or 
accrued during the taxable year on indebtedness incurred or continued to 
purchase or continue in effect a life insurance, endowment, or annuity 
contract (other than a single premium contract or a contract treated as 
a single premium contract) if such indebtedness is incurred pursuant to 
a plan of purchase which contemplates the systematic direct or indirect 
borrowing of part or all of the increases in the cash value of such 
contract (either from the insurer or otherwise). For the purposes of the 
preceding sentence, the term of purchase includes the payment of part or 
all of the premiums on a contract, and not merely payment of the premium 
due upon inital issuance of the contract. The rule of this paragraph 
applies whether or not the taxpayer is the insured, payee, or annuitant 
under the contract. the rule of this paragraph does not apply to 
contracts purchased by the taxpayer on or before August 6, 1963, even 
though there is a substantial increase in premiums after such date. The 
rule of this paragraph does not apply to any amount paid or accrued on 
indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry a single premium 
life insurance, endowment, or annuity contract (including a contract 
treated as a single premium contract); the treatment of such amounts is 
governed by Sec. 1.264-2.
    (b) Determination of amount not allowed. The amount not allowed as a 
deduction under paragraph (a) of this section is determined with 
reference to the entire amount of borrowing to purchase or carry the 
contract, and is not limited with reference to the amount of borrowing 
of increases in the cash value. The rule of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. A, a calendar year taxpayer using the cash receipts and 
disbursements method of accounting, on January 1, 1964, purchases from a 
life insurance company a policy in the amount of $100,000 with an annual 
gross premium of $2,200. For the first policy year, A pays the annual 
premium by means other than by borrowing. For the second, third, fourth, 
and fifth policy years, A continues the policy in effect by incurring 
indebtedness pursuant to a plan referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
section. The years and amounts applicable to the policy are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      Cumulative                Interest
                                      cash value   Total loan   paid at 
                Years                     of      outstanding     4.8   
                                       contract                 percent 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1964................................        $370           0           0
1965................................       2,175      $2,200     $105.60
1966................................       4,000       4,400      211.20
1967................................       5,865       6,600      316.80
1968................................       7,745       8,800      422.40
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On these facts (assuming that none of the exceptions contained in 
paragraph (d) of this section are applicable), no deduction is allowed 
for the interest paid during the year 1968. Moreover, the interest 
deduction will be disallowed for the taxable years 1965 through 1967 if 
such taxable years are not closed by reason of the statute of 
limitations or other rule of law.

    (c) Special rules. For purposes of this section:
    (1) Determination of existence of a plan which contemplates 
systematic borrowing--(i) In general. The determination of whether 
indebtedness is incurred or continued pursuant to a plan referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section shall be made on the basis of all the 
facts and circumstances in each case. Unless the taxpayer shows 
otherwise, in the case of borrowing in connection with premiums for more 
than three years, the existence of a plan referred to in paragraph (a) 
of this section will be presumed. The mere fact that a taxpayer does not 
borrow to pay a premium in a particular year does not in and of itself 
preclude the existence of a plan referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
section. A plan referred to in paragraph (a) of this section need not 
exist at the time the contract is entered into, but may come into 
existence at any time during the 7-year period following the taxpayer's 
purchase of the contract or following a substantial increase (referred 
to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) in premiums on the contract.
    (ii) Premium attributable to more than one year. For purposes of 
subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, if the stated annual premiums due 
on a contract vary in amount, borrowing in connection with any premium, 
the amount of which exceeds the amount of any other premium, on such 
contract may be considered borrowing to pay premiums for

[[Page 487]]

more than one year. The preceding sentence shall not apply where the 
borrowing is in connection with a substantially increased premium within 
the meaning of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (2) Direct or indirect. A plan referred to in paragraph (a) of this 
section may contemplate direct or indirect borrowing of increases in 
cash value of the contract directly or indirectly to pay premiums and 
many contemplate borrowing either from an insurance carrier, from a 
bank, or from any other person. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer borrows 
$100,000 from a bank and uses the funds to purchase securities, later 
borrows $100,000 from a second bank and uses the funds to repay the 
first bank, later sells the securities and uses the funds as a part of a 
plan referred to in paragraph (a) of this section to pay premiums on a 
contract of cash value life insurance, the deduction for interest paid 
in continuing the loan from the second bank shall not be allowed 
(assuming that none of the exceptions contained in paragraph (d) of this 
section are applicable). Moreover, a plan referred to in paragraph (a) 
of this section need not involve a pledge of the contract, but may 
contemplate unsecured borrowing or the use of other property.
    (d) Exceptions. No deduction shall be denied under paragraph (a) of 
this section with respect to any amount paid or accrued during a taxable 
year on indebtedness incurred or continued as part of a plan referred to 
in paragraph (a) of this section if any of the following exceptions 
apply.
    (1) The 7-year exception--(i) In general. No part of 4 of the annual 
premiums due during the 7-year period (beginning with the date the first 
premium on the contract to which such plan relates was paid) is paid 
under such plan by means of indebtedness. For purposes of this 
exception, in the event of a substantial increase in any annual premium 
on a contract, a new 7-year period begins on the date such increased 
premium is paid. If premiums on a contract are payable other than on an 
annual basis (for example, monthly), the annual premium is the aggregate 
of premiums due for the year. See paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section 
for cases where one premium on a contract paid by means of indebtedness 
may be considered as more than one annual premium.
    (ii) Application of borrowings. For purposes of subdivision (i) of 
this subparagraph, if during a 7-year period referred to in such 
subdivision the taxpayer, directly or indirectly, borrows with respect 
to more than one annual premium on a contract, such borrowing shall be 
considered first attributable to the premium for the current policy year 
(within the meaning of subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph) and then 
attributable to premiums for prior policy years beginning with the most 
recent prior policy year (but not including any prior policy year to the 
extent that such taxpayer has indebtedness outstanding with respect to 
the premium for such prior policy year). If such borrowing exceeds the 
premiums paid for the current policy year and for prior policy years and 
the taxpayer has, with respect to the current policy year, deposited 
premiums in advance of the due date of such premiums, such excess 
borrowing shall be considered indebtedness incurred to carry the 
contract which is attributable to the premiums deposited for succeeding 
policy years beginning with the premium for the next succeeding policy 
year. The preceding sentence shall not apply to a single premium 
contract referred to in Sec. 1.264-2.
    (iii) Current policy year. For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this 
subparagraph, the term current policy year refers to the policy year 
which begins with or within the taxable year of the taxpayer.
    (iv) Illustrations. The provisions of subdivision (ii) of this 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. A, a calendar year taxpayer using the cash receipts and 
disbursements method of accounting, on January 1, 1964, purchases from a 
life insurance company a policy in the amount of $100,000 with an annual 
gross premium of $2,200. For the first four policy years, A initially 
pays the annual premium by means other than borrowing. On January 1, 
1968, pursuant to a plan referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, A 
borrows $10,000 with respect to the policy. Such borrowing is considered 
first attributable to paying the premium for the year 1968 and

[[Page 488]]

then attributable to paying the premiums for the years 1967, 1966, 1965, 
and 1964 (in part). No deduction is allowed for the interest paid by A 
on the $10,000 indebtedness during the year 1968.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that on 
January 1, 1964, A pays the first annual premium and deposits an amount 
equal to the second and third annual premiums, all such amounts 
initially being paid or deposited by means other than borrowing. On 
January 1, 1965, A deposits an amount equal to the fourth, fifth, and 
sixth annual premiums, and borrows $4,400 pursuant to a plan referred to 
in paragraph (a) of this section. Such borrowing is considered 
attributable to the premiums paid for the policy years 1965 and 1964. On 
January 1, 1966, A deposits an amount equal to the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth annual premiums, and borrows $6,600 pursuant to such plan. Such 
borrowing is considered attributable to the premium paid for the policy 
year 1966 and deposited for the policy years 1967 and 1968. No deduction 
is allowed for interest paid by A on the $11,000 indebtedness during 
1966. Moreover, the interest deduction will be disallowed for the 
taxable year 1965. However, if this contract is treated as a single 
premium contract under Sec. 1.264-2 (by reason of deposit with the 
insurer of an amount for payment of a substantial number of future 
premiums), the deduction for interest on indebtedness incurred or 
continued to purchase or carry the contract would be denied without 
reference to this section.

    (2) The $100 exception. The total amount paid or accrued during the 
taxable year by the taxpayer who has entered one or more plans referred 
to in paragraph (a) of this section for which (without regard to this 
subparagraph) no deduction would be allowable under paragraph (a) of 
this section does not exceed $100. Where the amount so paid or accrued 
during the taxable year exceeds $100, the entire amount shall be subject 
to the general rule of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (3) The unforeseen events exception. The amount is paid or accrued 
by the taxpayer on indebtedness incurred because of an unforeseen 
substantial loss of such taxpayer's income or an unforeseen substantial 
increase in such taxpayer's financial obligations. A loss of income or 
increase in financial obligations is not unforeseen, within the meaning 
of this subparagraph, if at the time of the purchase of the contract 
such event was or could have been foreseen. College education expenses 
are foreseeable; however, if college expenses substantially increase, 
then to the extent that such increases are unforeseen, this exception 
will apply. This exception applies only if the plan referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section arises because of the unforeseen event. 
Thus, for example, if a taxpayer or his family incur substantial 
unexpected medical expenses or the taxpayer is laid off from his job, 
and for that reason systematically borrows against the cash value of a 
previously purchased contract, the deduction for the interest paid on 
the loan will not be denied, whether or not the loan is used to pay a 
premium on the contract.
    (4) The trade or business exception. The indebtedness is incurred by 
the taxpayer in connection with his trade or business. To be within this 
exception, the indebtedness must be incurred to finance business 
obligations rather than to finance cash value life insurance. Thus, if a 
taxpayer pledges a life insurance, endowment, or annuity contract as 
part of the collateral for a loan to finance the expansion of inventory 
or capital improvements for his business, no part of the deduction for 
interest on such loan will be denied under paragraph (a) of this 
section. Borrowing by a business taxpayer to finance business life 
insurance such as under so-called keyman, split dollar, or stock 
retirement plans is not considered to be incurred in connection with the 
taxpayer's trade or business within the meaning of this subparagraph. 
The determination of whether the indebtedness is incurred in connection 
with the taxpayer's trade or business, within the meaning of this 
exception, rather than to finance cash value life insurance shall be 
made on the basis of all the facts and circumstances. The provisions of 
this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation M each year borrows substantial sums to carry 
on its business. Corporation M agrees to provide a retirement plan for 
its employees and purchases level premium life insurance to fund its 
obligation under the plan. The mere fact that M Corporation purchases a 
cash value life insurance policy will not cause its deduction for 
interest paid on its normal indebtedness to be denied even though the 
policy is later used as part of the collateral for its normal 
indebtedness.

[[Page 489]]

    Example 2. Corporation R has $200,000 of bonds outstanding and 
purchases cash value life insurance policies on several of its key 
employees. Such purchase by R Corporation will not, of itself, cause its 
deduction for interest on its bonded indebtedness to be denied. If, 
however, the premiums on the life insurance policies are $10,000 each 
year, the cash value increases by $8,000 each year, and R Corporation 
increases its indebtedness by $10,000 each year, its deduction for 
interest on such indebtedness will not be allowed under the rule of 
paragraph (a) of this section. On the other hand, the absence of such a 
directly parallel increase will not of itself establish that the 
deduction for interest is allowable.

    (e) Applicability of section. The rules of this section apply with 
respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, but only 
with respect to contracts purchased after August 6, 1963. With respect 
to contracts entered into on or before August 6, 1963, but purchased or 
acquired whether from the insurer, insured, or any other person (other 
than by gift, bequest, or inheritance, or in a transaction to which 
section 381(a) of the Code applies) after such date, the rules of this 
section apply after such purchase or acquisition.

<R05>
Sec. 1.265-1   Expenses relating to tax-exempt income.

    (a) Nondeductibility of expenses allocable to exempt income. (1) No 
amount shall be allowed as a deduction under any provision of the Code 
for any expense or amount which is otherwise allowable as a deduction 
and which is allocable to a class or classes of exempt income other than 
a class or classes of exempt interest income.
    (2) No amount shall be allowed as a deduction under section 212 
(relating to expenses for production of income) for any expense or 
amount which is otherwise allowable as a deduction and which is 
allocable to a class or classes of exempt interest income.
    (b) Exempt income and nonexempt income. (1) As used in this section, 
the term class of exempt income means any class of income (whether or 
not any amount of income of such class is received or accrued) wholly 
exempt from the taxes imposed by Subtitle A of the Code. For purposes of 
this section, a class of income which is considered as wholly exempt 
from the taxes imposed by subtitle A includes any class of income which 
is:
    (i) Wholly excluded from gross income under any provision of 
Subtitle A, or
    (ii) Wholly exempt from the taxes imposed by Subtitle A under the 
provisions of any other law.
    (2) As used in this section the term nonexempt income means any 
income which is required to be included in gross income.
    (c) Allocation of expenses to a class or classes of exempt income. 
Expenses and amounts otherwise allowable which are directly allocable to 
any class or classes of exempt income shall be allocated thereto; and 
expenses and amounts directly allocable to any class or classes of 
nonexempt income shall be allocated thereto. If an expense or amount 
otherwise allowable is indirectly allocable to both a class of nonexempt 
income and a class of exempt income, a reasonable proportion thereof 
determined in the light of all the facts and circumstances in each case 
shall be allocated to each.
    (d) Statement of classes of exempt income; records. (1) A taxpayer 
receiving any class of exempt income or holding any property or engaging 
in any activity the income from which is exempt shall submit with his 
return as a part thereof an itemized statement, in detail, showing (i) 
the amount of each class of exempt income, and (ii) the amount of 
expenses and amounts otherwise allowable allocated to each such class 
(the amount allocated by apportionment being shown separately) as 
required by paragraph (c) of this section. If an item is apportioned 
between a class of exempt income and a class of nonexempt income, the 
statement shall show the basis of the apportionment. Such statement 
shall also recite that each deduction claimed in the return is not in 
any way attributable to a class of exempt income.
    (2) The taxpayer shall keep such records as will enable him to make 
the allocations required by this section. See section 6001 and the 
regulations thereunder.

[[Page 490]]


<R05>
Sec. 1.265-2   Interest relating to tax exempt income.

    (a) In general. No amount shall be allowed as a deduction for 
interest on any indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry 
obligations, the interest on which is wholly exempt from tax under 
subtitle A of the Code, such as municipal bonds, Panama Canal loan 3-
percent bonds, or obligations of the United States, the interest on 
which is wholly exempt from tax under Subtitle A, and which were issued 
after September 24, 1917, and not originally subscribed for by the 
taxpayer. Interest paid or accrued within the taxable year on 
indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry (1) obligations 
of the United States issued after September 24, 1917, the interest on 
which is not wholly exempt from the taxes imposed under Subtitle A of 
the Code, or (2) obligations of the United States issued after September 
24, 1917, and originally subscribed for by the taxpayer, the interest on 
which is wholly exempt from the taxes imposed by Subtitle A of the Code, 
is deductible. For rules as to the inclusion in gross income of interest 
on certain governmental obligations, see section 103 and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (b) Special rule for certain financial institutions. (1) No 
deduction shall be disallowed, for taxable years ending after February 
26, 1964, under section 265(2) for interest paid or accrued by a 
financial institution which is a face-amount certificate company 
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 and 
following) and which is subject to the banking laws of the State in 
which it is incorporated, on face-amount certificates (as defined in 
section 2(a)(15) of the Investment Company Act of 1940) issued by such 
institution and on amounts received for the purchase of such 
certificates to be issued by the institution, if the average amount of 
obligations, the interest on which is wholly exempt from the taxes 
imposed by Subtitle A of the Code, held by such institution during the 
taxable year, does not exceed 15 percent of the average amount of the 
total assets of such institution during such year. See subparagraph (3) 
of this paragraph for treatment of interest paid or accrued on face-
amount certificates where the figure is in excess of 15 percent. 
Interest expense other than that paid or accrued on face-amount 
certificates or on amounts received for the purchase of such 
certificates does not come within the rules of this paragraph.
    (2) This subparagraph is prescribed under the authority granted the 
Secretary or his delegate under section 265(2) to prescribe regulations 
governing the determination of the average amount of tax-exempt 
obligations and of the total assets held during an institution's taxable 
year. The average amount of tax-exempt obligations held during an 
institution's taxable year shall be the average of the amounts of tax-
exempt obligations held at the end of each month ending within such 
taxable year. The average amount of total assets for a taxable year 
shall be the average of the total assets determined at the beginning and 
end of the institution's taxable year. If the Commissioner, however, 
determines that any such amount is not fairly representative of the 
average amount of tax-exempt obligations or total assets, as the case 
may be, held by such institution during such taxable year, then the 
Commissioner shall determine the amount which is fairly representative 
of the average amount of tax-exempt obligations or total assets, as the 
case may be. The percentage which the average amount of tax-exempt 
obligations is of the average amount of total assets is determined by 
dividing the average amount of tax-exempt obligations by the average 
amount of total assets, and multiplying by 100. The amount of tax-exempt 
obligations means that portion of the total assets of the institution 
which consists of obligations the interest on which is wholly exempt 
from tax under Subtitle A of the Code, and valued at their adjusted 
basis, appropriately adjusted for amortization of premium or discount. 
Total assets means the sum of the money, plus the aggregate of the 
adjusted basis of the property other than money held by the taxpayer in 
good faith for the purpose of the business. Such adjusted basis for any 
asset is its adjusted basis for determining gain upon sale or exchange 
for Federal income tax purposes.

[[Page 491]]

    (3) If the percentage computation required by subparagraph (2) of 
this paragraph results in a figure in excess of 15 percent for the 
taxable year, there is interest that does not come within the special 
rule for certain financial institutions contained in section 265(2). The 
amount of such interest is obtained by multiplying the total interest 
paid or accrued for the taxable year on face-amount certificates and on 
amounts received for the purchase of such certificates by the percentage 
figure equal to the excess of the percentage figure computed under 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph over 15 percent. See paragraph (a) 
for the disallowance of interest on indebtedness incurred or continued 
to purchase or carry obligations the interest on which is wholly exempt 
from tax under Subtitle A of the Code.
    (4) Every financial institution claiming the benefits of the special 
rule for certain financial institutions contained in section 265(2) 
shall file with its return for the taxable year:
    (i) A statement showing that it is a face-amount certificate company 
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-1 and 
following) and that it is subject to the banking laws of the State in 
which it is incorporated.
    (ii) A detailed schedule showing the computation of the average 
amount of tax-exempt obligations, the average amount of total assets of 
such institutions, and the total amount of interest paid or accrued on 
face-amount certificates and on amounts received for the purchase of 
such certificates for the taxable year.

<R05>
Sec. 1.265-3  Nondeductibility of interest relating to exempt-interest dividends.

    (a) In general. No deduction is allowed to a shareholder of a 
regulated investment company for interest on indebtedness that relates 
to exempt-interest dividends distributed by the company to the 
shareholder during the shareholder's taxable year.
    (b) Interest relating to exempt-interest dividends. (1) All or a 
portion of the interest on an indebtedness relates to exempt-interest 
dividends if the indebtedness is either incurred or continued to 
purchase or carry shares of stock of a regulated investment company that 
distributes exempt-interest dividends (as defined in section 852(b)(5) 
of the Code) to the holder of the shares during the shareholder's 
taxable year.
    (2) To determine the amount of interest that relates to the exempt-
interest dividends the total amount of interest paid or accrued on the 
indebtedness is multiplied by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction 
is the amount of exempt-interest dividends received by the shareholder. 
The denominator of the fraction is the sum of the exempt-interest 
dividends and taxable dividends received by the shareholder (excluding 
capital gain dividends received by the shareholder and capital gains 
required to be included in the shareholder's computation of long-term 
capital gains under section 852(b)(3)(D)).

Sec. 1.266-1   Taxes and carrying charges chargeable to capital account and treated as capital items.

    (a)(1) In general. In accordance with section 266, items enumerated 
in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be capitalized at the election 
of the taxpayer. Thus, taxes and carrying charges with respect to 
property of the type described in this section are chargeable to capital 
account at the election of the taxpayer, notwithstanding that they are 
otherwise expressly deductible under provisions of Subtitle A of the 
Code. No deduction is allowable for any items so treated.
    (2) See Secs. 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15 for rules regarding the 
requirement to capitalize interest, that apply prior to the application 
of this section. After applying Secs. 1.263A-8 through 1.263A-15, a 
taxpayer may elect to capitalize interest under section 266 with respect 
to designated property within the meaning of Sec. 1.263A-8(b), provided 
a computation under any provision of the Internal Revenue Code is not 
thereby materially distorted, including computations relating to the 
source of deductions.
    (b) Taxes and carrying charges. (1) The taxpayer may elect, as 
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, to treat

[[Page 492]]

the items enumerated in this subparagraph which are otherwise expressly 
deductible under the provisions of Subtitle A of the Code as chargeable 
to capital account either as a component of original cost or other 
basis, for the purposes of section 1012, or as an adjustment to basis, 
for the purposes of section 1016(a)(1). The items thus chargeable to 
capital account are:
    (i) In the case of unimproved and unproductive real property: Annual 
taxes, interest on a mortgage, and other carrying charges.
    (ii) In the case of real property, whether improved or unimproved 
and whether productive or unproductive:
    (a) Interest on a loan (but not theoretical interest of a taxpayer 
using his own funds),
    (b) Taxes of the owner of such real property measured by 
compensation paid to his employees,
    (c) Taxes of such owner imposed on the purchase of materials, or on 
the storage, use, or other consumption of materials, and
    (d) Other necessary expenditures, paid or incurred for the 
development of the real property or for the construction of an 
improvement or additional improvement to such real property, up to the 
time the development or construction work has been completed. The 
development or construction work with respect to which such items are 
incurred may relate to unimproved and unproductive real estate whether 
the construction work will make the property productive of income 
subject to tax (as in the case of a factory) or not (as in the case of a 
personal residence), or may relate to property already improved or 
productive (as in the case of a plant addition or improvement, such as 
the construction of another floor on a factory or the installation of 
insulation therein).
    (iii) In the case of personal property:
    (a) Taxes of an employer measured by compensation for services 
rendered in transporting machinery or other fixed assets to the plant or 
installing them therein,
    (b) Interest on a loan to purchase such property or to pay for 
transporting or installing the same, and
    (c) Taxes of the owner thereof imposed on the purchase of such 
property or on the storage, use, or other consumption of such property, 
paid or incurred up to the date of installation or the date when such 
property is first put into use by the taxpayer, whichever date is later.
    (iv) Any other taxes and carrying charges with respect to property, 
otherwise deductible, which in the opinion of the Commissioner are, 
under sound accounting principles, chargeable to capital account.
    (2) The sole effect of section 266 is to permit the items enumerated 
in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph to be chargeable to capital 
account notwithstanding that such items are otherwise expressly 
deductible under the provisions of Subtitle A of the Code. An item not 
otherwise deductible may not be capitalized under section 266.
    (3) In the absence of a provision in this section for treating a 
given item as a capital item, this section has no effect on the 
treatment otherwise accorded such item. Thus, items which are otherwise 
deductible are deductible notwithstanding the provisions of this 
section, and items which are otherwise treated as capital items are to 
be so treated. Similarly, an item not otherwise deductible is not made 
deductible by this section. Nor is the absence of a provision in this 
section for treating a given item as a capital item to be construed as 
withdrawing or modifying the right now given to the taxpayer under any 
other provisions of subtitle A of the Code, or of the regulations 
thereunder, to elect to capitalize or to deduct a given item.
    (c) Election to charge taxes and carrying charges to capital 
account. (1) If for any taxable year there are two or more items of the 
type described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, which relate to the 
same project to which the election is applicable, the taxpayer may elect 
to capitalize any one or more of such items even though he does not 
elect to capitalize the remaining items or to capitalize items of the 
same type relating to other projects. However, if expenditures for 
several items of the same type are incurred with respect to a single 
project, the election to capitalize must, if exercised, be exercised as 
to all items of that type. For purposes of this section,

[[Page 493]]

a project means, in the case of items described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) 
of this section, a particular development of, or construction of an 
improvement to, real property, and in the case of items described in 
paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the transportation and 
installation of machinery or other fixed assets.
    (2)(i) An election with respect to an item described in paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section is effective only for the year for which it is 
made.
    (ii) An election with respect to an item described in:
    (a) Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is effective until the 
development or construction work described in that subdivision has been 
completed;
    (b) Paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is effective until the 
later of either the date of installation of the property described in 
that subdivision, or the date when such property is first put into use 
by the taxpayer;
    (c) Paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section is effective as determined 
by the Commissioner.

Thus, an item chargeable to capital account under this section must 
continue to be capitalized for the entire period described in this 
subdivision applicable to such election although such period may consist 
of more than one taxable year.
    (3) If the taxpayer elects to capitalize an item or items under this 
section, such election shall be exercised by filing with the original 
return for the year for which the election is made a statement 
indicating the item or items (whether with respect to the same project 
or to different projects) which the taxpayer elects to treat as 
chargeable to capital account. Elections filed for taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 1954, and for taxable years ending before 
August 17, 1954, under section 24(a)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1939, and the regulations thereunder, shall have the same effect as if 
they were filed under this section. See section 7807(b)(2).
    (d) The following examples are illustrative of the application of 
the provisions of this section:

    Example 1. In 1956 and 1957 A pays annual taxes and interest on a 
mortgage on a piece of real property. During 1956, the property is 
vacant and unproductive, but throughout 1957 A operates the property as 
a parking lot. A may capitalize the taxes and mortgage interest paid in 
1956, but not the taxes and mortgage interest paid in 1957.
    Example 2. In February 1957, B began the erection of an office 
building for himself. B in 1957, in connection with the erection of the 
building, paid $6,000 social security taxes, which in his 1957 return he 
elected to capitalize. B must continue to capitalize the social security 
taxes paid in connection with the erection of the building until its 
completion.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (2) except that in 
November 1957, B also begins to build a hotel. In 1957 B pays $3,000 
social security taxes in connection with the erection of the hotel. B's 
election to capitalize the social security taxes paid in erecting the 
office building started in February 1957 does not bind him to capitalize 
the social security taxes paid in erecting the hotel; he may deduct the 
$3,000 social security taxes paid in erecting the hotel.
    Example 4. In 1957, M Corporation began the erection of a building 
for itself, which will take three years to complete. M Corporation in 
1957 paid $4,000 social security taxes and $8,000 interest on a building 
loan in connection with this building. M Corporation may elect to 
capitalize the social security taxes although it deducts the interest 
charges.
    Example 5. C purchases machinery in 1957 for use in his factory. He 
pays social security taxes on the labor for transportation and 
installation of the machinery, as well as interest on a loan to obtain 
funds to pay for the machinery and for transportation and installation 
costs. C may capitalize either the social security taxes or the 
interest, or both, up to the date of installation or until the machinery 
is first put into use by him, whichever date is later.

    (e) Allocation. If any tax or carrying charge with respect to 
property is in part a type of item described in paragraph (b) of this 
section and in part a type of item or items with respect to which no 
election to treat as a capital item is given, a reasonable proportion of 
such tax or carrying charge, determined in the light of all the facts 
and circumstances in each case, shall be allocated to each item. The 
rule of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. N Corporation, the owner of a factory in New York on which 
a new addition is under construction, in 1957 pays its general manager, 
B, a salary of $10,000 and also pays a New York State unemployment 
insurance tax of $81 on B's salary. B spends nine-tenths of his time in 
the general business of the

[[Page 494]]

firm and the remaining one-tenth in supervising the construction work. N 
Corporation treats as expenses $9,000 of B's salary, and charges the 
remaining $1,000 to capital account. N Corporation may elect to 
capitalize $8.10 of the $81 New York State unemployment insurance tax 
paid in 1957 since such tax is deductible under section 164.

<R05>
Sec. 1.267(a)-1   Deductions disallowed.

    (a) Losses. Except in cases of distributions in corporate 
liquidations, no deduction shall be allowed for losses arising from 
direct or indirect sales or exchanges of property between persons who, 
on the date of the sale or exchange, are within any one of the 
relationships specified in section 267(b). See Sec. 1.267(b)-1.
    (b) Unpaid expenses and interest. (1) No deduction shall be allowed 
a taxpayer for trade or business expenses otherwise deductible under 
section 162, for expenses for production of income otherwise deductible 
under section 212, or for interest otherwise deductible under section 
163:
    (i) If, at the close of the taxpayer's taxable year within which 
such items are accrued by the taxpayer or at any time within 2 1/2 
months thereafter, both the taxpayer and the payee are persons within 
any one of the relationships specified in section 267(b) (see 
Sec. 1.267(b)-1); and
    (ii) If the payeee is on the cash receipts and disbursements method 
of accounting with respect to such items of gross income for his taxable 
year in which or with which the taxable year of accrual by the debtor-
taxpayer ends; and
    (iii) If, within the taxpayer's taxable year within which such items 
are accrued by the taxpayer and 2 1/2 months after the close thereof, 
the amount of such items is not paid and the amount of such items is not 
otherwise (under the rules of constructive receipt) includible in the 
gross income of the payee.
    (2) The provisions of section 267(a)(2) and this paragraph do not 
otherwise affect the general rules governing the allowance of deductions 
under an accrual method of accounting. For example, if the accrued 
expenses or interest are paid after the deduction has become disallowed 
under section 267(a)(2), no deduction would be allowable for the taxable 
year in which payment is made, since an accrual item is deductible only 
in the taxable year in which it is properly accruable.
    (3) The expenses and interest specified in section 267(a)(2) and 
this paragraph shall be considered as paid for purposes of that section 
to the extent of the fair market value on the date of issue of notes or 
other instruments of similar effect received in payment of such expenses 
or interest if such notes or other instruments were issued in such 
payment by the taxpayer within his taxable year or within 2 1/2 months 
after the close thereof. The fair market value on the date of issue of 
such notes or other instruments of similar effect is includible in the 
gross income of the payee for the taxable year in which he receives the 
notes or other instruments.
    (4) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. A, an individual, is the holder and owner of an interest-
bearing note of the M Corporation, all the stock of which was owned by 
him on December 31, 1956. A and the M Corporation make their income tax 
returns for a calendar year. The M Corporation uses an accrual method of 
accounting. A uses a combination of accounting methods permitted under 
section 446(c)(4) in which he uses the cash receipts and disbursements 
method in respect of items of gross income. The M Corporation does not 
pay any interest on the note to A during the calendar year 1956 or 
within 2 1/2 months after the close of that year, nor does it credit any 
interest to A's account in such a manner that it is subject to his 
unqualified demand and thus is constructively received by him. M 
Corporation claims a deduction for the year 1956 for the interest 
accruing on the note in that year. Since A is on the cash receipts and 
disbursements method in respect of items of gross income, the interest 
is not includible in his return for the year 1956. Under the provisions 
of section 267(a)(2) and this paragraph, no deduction for such interest 
is allowable in computing the taxable income of the M Corporation for 
the taxable year 1956 or for any other taxable year. However, if the 
interest had actually been paid to A on or before March 15, 1957, or if 
it had been made available to A before that time (and thus had been 
constructively received by him), the M Corporation would be allowed to

[[Page 495]]

deduct the amount of the payment in computing its taxable income for 
1956.

    (c) Scope of section. Section 267(a) requires that deductions for 
losses or unpaid expenses or interest described therein be disallowed 
even though the transaction in which such losses, expenses, or interest 
were incurred was a bona fide transaction. However, section 267 is not 
exclusive. No deduction for losses or unpaid expenses or interest 
arising in a transaction which is not bona fide will be allowed even 
though section 267 does not apply to the transaction.


<R05>
Sec. 1.267(a)-2T  Temporary regulations; questions and answers arising under the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (temporary).

    (a) Introduction--(1) Scope. This section prescribes temporary 
question and answer regulations under section 267(a) and related 
provisions as amended by section 174 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984, Pub. 
L. No. 98-369.
    (2) Effective date. Except as otherwise provided by Answer 2 or 
Answer 3 in paragraph (c) of this section, the effective date set forth 
in section 174(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 applies to this section.
    (b) Questions applying section 267(a)(2) and (b) generally. The 
following questions and answers deal with the application of section 
267(a)(2) and (b) generally:
    Question 1: Does section 267(a)(2) ever apply to defer the deduction 
of an otherwise deductible amount if the person to whom the payment is 
to be made properly uses the completed contract method of accounting 
with respect to such amount?
    Answer 1: No. Section 267(a)(2) applies only if an otherwise 
deductible amount is owed to a related person under whose method of 
accounting such amount is not includible in income unless paid to such 
person. Regardless of when payment is made, an amount owed to a 
contractor using the completed contract method of accounting is 
includible in the income of the contractor in accordance with 
Sec. 1.451-3(d) in the year in which the contract is completed or in 
which certain disputes are resolved.
    Question 2: Does section 267(a)(2) ever apply to defer the deduction 
of otherwise deductible original issue discount as defined in sections 
163(e) and 1271 through 1275 (``the OID rules'')?
    Answer 2. No. Regardless of when payment is made, an amount owed to 
a lender that constitutes original issue discount is included in the 
income of the lender periodically in accordance with the OID rules. 
Similarly, section 267(a)(2) does not apply to defer an otherwise 
deductible amount to the extent section 467 or section 7872 requires 
periodic inclusion of such amount in the income of the person to whom 
payment is to be made, even though payment has not been made.
    Question 3: Does section 267(a)(2) ever apply to defer the deduction 
of otherwise deductible unstated interest determined to exist under 
section 483?
    Answer 3: Yes. If section 483 recharacterizes any amount as unstated 
interest and the other requirements of section 267(a)(2) are met, a 
deduction for such unstated interest will be deferred under section 267.
    Question 4: Does section 267(a)(2) ever apply to defer the deduction 
of otherwise deductible cost recovery, depreciation, or amortization?
    Answer 4: Yes, in certain cases. In general, section 267(a)(2) does 
not apply to defer the deduction of otherwise deductible cost recovery, 
depreciation, or amortization. Notwithstanding this general rule, if the 
other requirements of section 267(a)(2) are met, section 267(a)(2) does 
apply to defer deductions for cost recovery, depreciation, or 
amortization of an amount owed to a related person for interest or rent 
or for the performance or nonperformance of services, which amount the 
taxpayer payor capitalized or treated as a deferred expense (unless the 
taxpayer payor elected to capitalize or defer the amount and section 
267(a)(2) would not have deferred the deduction of such amount if the 
taxpayer payor had not so elected). Amounts owed for services that may 
be subject to this provision include, for example, amounts owed for 
acquisition, development, or organizational services or for covenants 
not to compete. In applying this rule, payments made between persons 
described in any of the paragraphs of section 267(b) (as modified by 
section 267(e)) will be closely scrutinized to determine

[[Page 496]]

whether they are made in respect of capitalized costs (or costs treated 
as deferred expenses) that are subject to deferral under section 
267(a)(2), or in respect of other capitalized costs not so subject.
    Question 5: If a deduction in respect of an otherwise deductible 
amount is deferred by section 267(a)(2) and, prior to the time the 
amount is includible in the gross income of the person to whom payment 
is to be made, such person and the payor taxpayer cease to be persons 
specified in any of the paragraphs of section 267(b) (as modified by 
section 267(e)), is the deduction allowable as of the day on which the 
relationship ceases?
    Answer 5: No. The deduction is not allowable until the day as of 
which the amount is includible in the gross income of the person to whom 
payment of the amount is made, even though the relationship ceases to 
exist at an earlier time.
    Question 6: Do references in other sections to persons described in 
section 267(b) incorporate changes made to section 267(b) by section 174 
of the Tax Reform Act of 1984?
    Answer 6: Yes. References in other sections to persons described in 
section 267(b) take into account changes made to section 267(b) by 
section 174 of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (without modification by 
section 267(e)(1)). For example, a transfer after December 31, 1983 (the 
effective date of the new section 267(b)(3) relationship added by the 
Tax Reform Act of 1984) of section 1245 class property placed in service 
before January 1, 1981, from one corporation to another corporation, 11 
percent of the stock of which is owned by the first corporation, will 
not constitute recovery property (as defined in section 168) in the 
hands of the second corporation by reason of section 168(e)(4) (A)(i) 
and (D).
    (c) Questions applying section 267(a) to partnerships. The following 
questions and answers deal with the application of section 267(a) to 
partnerships:
    Question 1: Does section 267(a) disallow losses and defer otherwise 
deductible amounts at the partnership (entity) level?
    Answer 1: Yes. If a loss realized by a partnership from a sale or 
exchange of property is disallowed under section 267(a)(1), that loss 
shall not enter into the computation of the partnership's taxable 
income. If an amount that otherwise would be deductible by a partnership 
is deferred by section 267(a)(2), that amount shall not enter into the 
computation of the partnership's taxable income until the taxable year 
of the partnership in which falls the day on which the amount is 
includible in the gross income of the person to whom payment of the 
amount is made.
    Question 2: Does section 267(a)(1) ever apply to disallow a loss if 
the sale or exchange giving rise to the loss is between two partnerships 
even though the two partnerships are not persons specified in any of the 
paragraphs of section 267(b)?
    Answer 2: Yes. If the other requirements of section 267(a)(1) are 
met, section 267(a)(1) applies to such losses arising as a result of 
transactions entered into after December 31, 1984 between partnerships 
not described in any of the paragraphs of section 267(b) as follows, and 
Sec. 1.267(b)-1(b) does not apply. If the two partnerships have one or 
more common partners (i.e., if any person owns directly, indirectly, or 
constructively any capital or profits interest in each of such 
partnerships), or if any partner in either partnership and one or more 
partners in the other partnership are persons specified in any of the 
paragraphs of section 267(b) (without modification by section 267(e)), a 
portion of the selling partnership's loss will be disallowed under 
section 267(a)(1). The amount disallowed under this rule is the greater 
of: (1) The amount that would be disallowed if the transaction giving 
rise to the loss had occurred between the selling partnership and the 
separate partners of the purchasing partnership (in proportion to their 
respective interests in the purchasing partnership); or (2) the amount 
that would be disallowed if such transaction had occurred between the 
separate partners of the selling partnership (in proportion to their 
respective interests in the selling partnership) and the purchasing 
partnership. Notwithstanding the general rule of this paragraph (c) 
Answer 2, no disallowance shall occur if the amount that would be 
disallowed pursuant to the immediately

[[Page 497]]

preceding sentence is less than 5 percent of the loss arising from the 
sale or exchange.
    Question 3: Does section 267(a)(2) ever apply to defer an otherwise 
deductible amount if the taxpayer payor is a partnership and the person 
to whom payment of such amount is to be made is a partnership even 
though the two partnerships are not persons specified in any of the 
paragraphs of section 267(b) (as modified by section 267(e))?
    Answer 3: Yes. If the other requirements of section 267(a)(2) are 
met, section 267(a)(2) applies to such amounts arising as a result of 
transactions entered into after December 31, 1984 between partnerships 
not described in any of the paragraphs of section 267(b) (as modified by 
section 267(e)) as follows, and Sec. 1.267(b)-1(b) does not apply. If 
the two partnerships have one or more common partners (i.e., if any 
person owns directly, indirectly, or constructively any capital or 
profits interest in each of such partnerships), or if any partner in 
either partnership and one or more partners in the other partnership are 
persons specified in any of the paragraphs of section 267(b) (without 
modification by section 267(e)), a portion of the payor partnership's 
otherwise allowable deduction will be deferred under section 267(a)(2). 
The amount deferred under this rule is the greater of: (1) The amount 
that would be deferred if the transaction giving rise to the otherwise 
allowable deduction had occurred between the payor partnership and the 
separate partners of the payee partnership (in proportion to their 
respective interests in the payee partnership); or (2) the amount that 
would be deferred if such transaction had occurred between the separate 
partners of the payor partnership (in proportion to their respective 
interests in the payor partnership) and the payee partnership. 
Notwithstanding the general rule of this paragraph (c) Answer 3, no 
deferral shall occur if the amount that would be deferred pursuant to 
the immediately preceding sentence is less than 5 percent of the 
otherwise allowable deduction.

    Example. On May 1, 1985, partnership AB enters into a transaction 
whereby it accrues an otherwise deductible amount to partnership AC. AC 
is on the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. A holds 
a 5 percent capital and profits interest in AB and a 49 percent capital 
and profits interest in AC, and A's interest in each item of the income, 
gain, loss, deduction, and credit of each partnership is 5 percent and 
49 percent, respectively. B and C are not related. Notwithstanding that 
AB and AC are not persons specified in section 267(b), 49 percent of the 
deduction in respect of such amount will be deferred under section 
267(a)(2). The result would be the same if A held a 49 percent interest 
in AB and a 5 percent interest in AC. However, if A held more than 50 
percent of the capital or profits interest of either AB or AC, the 
entire deduction in respect of such amount would be deferred under 
section 267(a)(2).

    Question 4: What does the phrase incurred at an annual rate not in 
excess of 12 percent mean as used in section 267(e)(5)(C)(ii)?
    Answer 4: The phrase refers to interest that accrues but is not 
includible in the income of the person to whom payment is to be made 
during the taxable year of the payor. Thus, in determining whether the 
requirements of section 267(e)(5) (providing an exception to certain 
provisions of section 267 for certain expenses and interest of 
partnerships owning low income housing) are met with respect to a 
transaction, the requirement of section 267(e)(5)(C)(ii) will be 
satisfied, even though the total interest (both stated and unstated) 
paid or accrued in any taxable year of the payor taxpayer exceeds 12 
percent, if the interest in excess of 12 percent per annum, compounded 
semi-annually, on the outstanding loan balance (principal and accrued 
but unpaid interest) is includible in the income of the person to whom 
payment is to be made no later than the last day of such taxable year of 
the payor taxpayer.

Sec. 1.267(a)-3  Deduction of amounts owed to related foreign persons.

    (a) Purpose and scope. This section provides rules under section 
267(a) (2) and (3) governing when an amount owed to a related foreign 
person that is otherwise deductible under Chapter 1 may be deducted. 
Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rules, and

[[Page 498]]

paragraph (c) of this section provides exceptions and special rules.
    (b) Deduction of amount owed to related foreign person--(1) In 
general. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, section 
267(a)(3) requires a taxpayer to use the cash method of accounting with 
respect to the deduction of amounts owed to a related foreign person. An 
amount that is owed to a related foreign person and that is otherwise 
deductible under Chapter 1 thus may not be deducted by the taxpayer 
until such amount is paid to the related foreign person. For purposes of 
this section, a related foreign person is any person that is not a 
United States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30), and that 
is related (within the meaning of section 267(b)) to the taxpayer at the 
close of the taxable year in which the amount incurred by the taxpayer 
would otherwise be deductible. Section 267(f) defines controlled group 
for purposes of section 267(b) without regard to the limitations of 
section 1563(b). An amount is treated as paid for purposes of this 
section if the amount is considered paid for purposes of section 1441 or 
section 1442 (including an amount taken into account pursuant to section 
884(f)).
    (2) Amounts covered. This section applies to otherwise deductible 
amounts that are of a type described in section 871(a)(1) (A), (B) or 
(D), or in section 881(a) (1), (2) or (4). The rules of this section 
also apply to interest that is from sources outside the United States. 
Amounts other than interest that are from sources outside the United 
States, and that are not income of a related foreign person effectively 
connected with the conduct by such related foreign person of a trade or 
business within the United States, are not subject to the rules of 
section 267(a) (2) or (3) or this section. See paragraph (c) of this 
section for rules governing the treatment of amounts that are income of 
a related foreign person effectively connected with the conduct of a 
trade or business within the United States by such related foreign 
person.
    (3) Change in method of accounting. A taxpayer that uses a method of 
accounting other than that required by the rules of this section must 
change its method of accounting to conform its method to the rules of 
this section. The taxpayer's change in method must be made pursuant to 
the rules of section 446(e), the regulations thereunder, and any 
applicable administrative procedures prescribed by the Commissioner. 
Because the rules of this section prescribe a method of accounting, 
these rules apply in the determination of taxpayer's earnings and 
profits pursuant to Sec. 1.1312-6(a).
    (4) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) FC, a corporation incorporated in Country X, owns 100 
percent of the stock of C, a domestic corporation. C uses the accrual 
method of accounting in computing its income and deductions, and is a 
calendar year taxpayer. In Year 1, C accrues an amount owed to FC for 
interest. C makes an actual payment of the amount owed to FC in Year 2.
    (ii) Regardless of its source, the interest owed to FC is an amount 
to which this section applies. Pursuant to the rules of this paragraph 
(b), the amount owed to FC by C will not be allowable as a deduction in 
Year 1. Section 267 does not preclude the deduction of this amount in 
Year 2.
    Example 2. (i) RS, a domestic corporation, is the sole shareholder 
of FSC, a foreign sales corporation. Both RS and FSC use the accrual 
method of accounting. In Year 1, RS accrues $z owed to FSC for 
commissions earned by FSC in Year 1. Pursuant to the foreign sales 
company provisions, sections 921 through 927, a portion of this amount, 
$x, is treated as effectively connected income of FSC from sources 
outside the United States. Accordingly, the rules of section 267(a)(3) 
and paragraph (b) of this section do not apply. See paragraph (c) of 
this section for the rules governing the treatment of amounts that are 
effectively connected income of FSC.
    (ii) The remaining amount of the commission, $y, is classified as 
exempt foreign trade income under section 923(a)(3) and is treated as 
income of FSC from sources outside the United States that is not 
effectively connected income. This amount is one to which the provisions 
of this section do not apply, since it is an amount other than interest 
from sources outside the United States and is not effectively connected 
income. Therefore, a deduction for $y is allowable to RS as of the day 
on which it accrues the otherwise deductible amount, without regard to 
section 267 (a)(2) and (a)(3) and the regulations thereunder.

    (c) Exceptions and special rules--(1) Effectively connected income 
subject to

[[Page 499]]

United States tax. The provisions of section 267(a)(2) and the 
regulations thereunder, and not the provisions of paragraph (b) of this 
section, apply to an amount that is income of the related foreign person 
that is effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade 
or business of such related foreign person. An amount described in this 
paragraph (c)(1) thus is allowable as a deduction as of the day on which 
the amount is includible in the gross income of the related foreign 
person as effectively connected income under sections 872(a)(2) or 
882(b) (or, if later, as of the day on which the deduction would be so 
allowable but for section 267(a)(2)). However, this paragraph (c)(1) 
does not apply if the related foreign person is exempt from United 
States income tax on the amount owed, or is subject to a reduced rate of 
tax, pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States (such as under 
an article relating to the taxation of business profits).
    (2) Items exempt from tax by treaty. Except with respect to 
interest, neither paragraph (b) of this section nor section 267 (a)(2) 
or (a)(3) applies to any amount that is income of a related foreign 
person with respect to which the related foreign person is exempt from 
United States taxation on the amount owed pursuant to a treaty 
obligation of the United States (such as under an article relating to 
the taxation of business profits). Interest that is effectively 
connected income of the related foreign person under sections 872(a)(2) 
or 882(b) is an amount covered by paragraph (c)(1) of this section. 
Interest that is not effectively connected income of the related foreign 
person is an amount covered by paragraph (b) of this section, regardless 
of whether the related foreign person is exempt from United States 
taxation on the amount owed pursuant to a treaty obligation of the 
United States.
    (3) Items subject to reduced rate of tax by treaty. Paragraph (b) of 
this section applies to amounts that are income of a related foreign 
person with respect to which the related foreign person claims a reduced 
rate of United States income tax on the amount owed pursuant to a treaty 
obligation of the United States (such as under an article relating to 
the taxation of royalties).
    (4) Amounts owed to a foreign personal holding company, controlled 
foreign corporation, or passive foreign investment company--(i) Foreign 
personal holding companies. If an amount to which paragraph (b) of this 
section otherwise applies is owed to a related foreign person that is a 
foreign personal holding company within the meaning of section 552, then 
the amount is allowable as a deduction as of the day on which the amount 
is includible in the income of the foreign personal holding company. The 
day on which the amount is includible in income is determined with 
reference to the method of accounting under which the foreign personal 
holding company computes its taxable income and earnings and profits for 
purposes of sections 551 through 558. See section 551(c) and the 
regulations thereunder for the reporting requirements of the foreign 
personal holding company provisions (sections 551 through 558).
    (ii) Controlled foreign corporations. If an amount to which 
paragraph (b) of this section otherwise applies is owed to a related 
foreign person that is a controlled foreign corporation within the 
meaning of section 957, then the amount is allowable as a deduction as 
of the day on which the amount is includible in the income of the 
controlled foreign corporation. The day on which the amount is 
includible in income is determined with reference to the method of 
accounting under which the controlled foreign corporation computes its 
taxable income and earnings and profits for purposes of sections 951 
through 964. See section 6038 and the regulations thereunder for the 
reporting requirements of the controlled foreign corporation provisions 
(sections 951 through 964).
    (iii) Passive foreign investment companies. If an amount to which 
paragraph (b) of this section otherwise applies is owed to a related 
foreign person that is a passive foreign investment company within the 
meaning of section 1296, then the amount is allowable as a deduction as 
of the day on which amount is includible in the income of the passive 
foreign investment company. The day on which the amount is includible

[[Page 500]]

in income is determined with reference to the method of accounting under 
which the earnings and profits of the passive foreign investment company 
are computed for purposes of sections 1291 through 1297. See sections 
1291 through 1297 and the regulations thereunder for the reporting 
requirements of the passive foreign investment company provisions. This 
exception shall apply, however, only if the person that owes the amount 
at issue has made and has in effect an election pursuant to section 1295 
with respect to the passive foreign investment company to which the 
amount at issue is owed.
    (iv) Examples. The rules of this paragraph (c)(4) may be illustrated 
by the following examples. Application of the provisions of sections 951 
through 964 are provided for illustration only, and do not provide 
substantive rules concerning the operation of those provisions. The 
principles of these examples apply equally to the provisions of 
paragraphs (c)(4) (i) through (iii) of this section.

    Example 1. P, a domestic corporation, owns 100 percent of the total 
combined voting power and value of the stock of both FC1 and FC2. P is a 
calendar year taxpayer that uses the accrual method of accounting in 
computing its income and deductions. FC1 is incorporated in Country X, 
and FC2 is incorporated in Country Y. FC1 and FC2 are controlled foreign 
corporations within the meaning of section 957, and are both calendar 
year taxpayers. FC1 computes its taxable income and earnings and 
profits, for purposes of sections 951 through 964, using the accrual 
method of accounting, while FC2 uses the cash method. In Year 1 FC1 has 
gross income of $10,000 that is described in section 952 (a) (``subpart 
F income''), and which includes interest owed to FC1 by P that is 
described in paragraph (b) of this section and that is otherwise 
allowable as a deduction to P under chapter 1. The interest owed to FC1 
is allowable as a deduction to P in Year 1.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that in 
Year 1 FC1 reports no subpart F income because of the application of 
section 954 (b)(3)(A) (the subpart F de minimis rule). Because the 
amount owed to FC1 by P is includible in FC1's gross income in Year 1, 
the interest owed to FC1 is allowable as a deduction to P in Year 1.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1. In Year 1, FC1 
accrues interest owed to FC2 that would be allowable as a deduction by 
FC1 under chapter 1 if FC1 were a domestic corporation. The interest 
owed to FC2 by FC1 is paid by FC1 in Year 2. Because FC2 uses the cash 
method of accounting in computing its taxable income for purposes of 
subpart F, the interest owed by FC1 is allowable as a deduction by FC1 
in Year 2, and not in Year 1.

    (d) Effective date. The rules of this section are effective with 
respect to interest that is allowable as a deduction under chapter 1 
(without regard to the rules of this section) in taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 1983, but are not effective with respect to interest 
that is incurred with respect to indebtedness incurred on or before 
September 29, 1983, or incurred after that date pursuant to a contract 
that was binding on that date and at all times thereafter (unless the 
indebtedness or the contract was renegotiated, extended, renewed, or 
revised after that date). The regulations in this section issued under 
section 267 apply to all other deductible amounts that are incurred 
after July 31, 1989, but do not apply to amounts that are incurred 
pursuant to a contract that was binding on September 29, 1983, and at 
all times thereafter (unless the contract was renegotiated, extended, 
renewed, or revised after that date).

Sec. 1.267(b)-1   Relationships.

    (a) In general. (1) The persons referred to in section 267(a) and 
Sec. 1.267 (a)-1 are specified in section 267(b).
    (2) Under section 267(b)(3), it is not necessary that either of the 
two corporations be a personal holding company or a foreign personal 
holding company for the taxable year in which the sale or exchange 
occurs or in which the expenses or interest are properly accruable, but 
either one of them must be such a company for the taxable year next 
preceding the taxable year in which the sale or exchange occurs or in 
which the expenses or interest are accrued.
    (3) Under section 267(b)(9), the control of certain educational and 
charitable organizations exempt from tax under section 501 includes any 
kind of control, direct or indirect, by means of which a person in fact 
controls such an organization, whether or not the control is legally 
enforceable and regardless of the method by which the control is 
exercised or exercisable. In the case

[[Page 501]]

of an individual, control possessed by the individual's family, as 
defined in section 267(c)(4) and paragraph (a)(4) of Sec. 1.267 (c)-1, 
shall be taken into account.
    (b) Partnerships. (1) Since section 267 does not include members of 
a partnership and the partnership as related persons, transactions 
between partners and partnerships do not come within the scope of 
section 267. Such transactions are governed by section 707 for the 
purposes of which the partnership is considered to be an entity separate 
from the partners. See section 707 and Sec. 1.707-1. Any transaction 
described in section 267(a) between a partnership and a person other 
than a partner shall be considered as occurring between the other person 
and the members of the partnership separately. Therefore, if the other 
person and a partner are within any one of the relationships specified 
in section 267(b), no deductions with respect to such transactions 
between the other person and the partnership shall be allowed:
    (i) To the related partner to the extent of his distributive share 
of partnership deductions for losses or unpaid expenses or interest 
resulting from such transactions, and
    (ii) To the other person to the extent the related partner acquires 
an interest in any property sold to or exchanged with the partnership by 
such other person at a loss, or to the extent of the related partner's 
distributive share of the unpaid expenses or interest payable to the 
partnership by the other person as a result of such transaction.
    (2) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. A, an equal partner in the ABC partnership, personally 
owns all the stock of M Corporation. B and C are not related to A. The 
partnership and all the partners use an accrual method of accounting, 
and are on a calendar year. M Corporation uses the cash receipts and 
disbursements method of accounting and is also on a calendar year. 
During 1956 the partnership borrowed money from M Corporation and also 
sold property to M Corporation, sustaining a loss on the sale. On 
December 31, 1956, the partnership accrued its interest liability to the 
M Corporation and on April 1, 1957 (more than 2 1/2 months after the 
close of its taxable year), it paid the M Corporation the amount of such 
accrued interest. Applying the rules of this paragraph, the transactions 
are considered as occurring between M Corporation and the partners 
separately. The sale and interest transactions considered as occurring 
between A and the M Corporation fall within the scope of section 267 (a) 
and (b), but the transactions considered as occurring between partners B 
and C and the M Corporation do not. The latter two partners may, 
therefore, deduct their distributive shares of partnership deductions 
for the loss and the accrued interest. However, no deduction shall be 
allowed to A for his distributive shares of these partnership 
deductions. Furthermore, A's adjusted basis for his partnership interest 
must be decreased by the amount of his distributive share of such 
deductions. See section 705(a)(2).
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) of this 
subparagraph except that the partnership and all the partners use the 
cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, and that M 
Corporation uses an accrual method. Assume further, that during 1956 M 
Corporation borrowed money from the partnership and that on a sale of 
property to the partnership during that year M Corporation sustained a 
loss. On December 31, 1956, the M Corporation accrued its interest 
liability on the borrowed money and on April 1, 1957 (more than 2 1/2 
months after the close of its taxable year) it paid the accrued interest 
to the partnership. The corporation's deduction for the accrued interest 
is not allowed to the extent of A's distributive share (one-third) of 
such interest income. M Corporation's deduction for the loss on the sale 
of the property to the partnership is not allowed to the extent of A's 
one-third interest in the purchased property.


<R05>
Sec. 1.267(c)-1   Constructive ownership of stock.

    (a) In general. (1) The determination of stock ownership for 
purposes of section 267(b) shall be in accordance with the rules in 
section 267(c).
    (2) For an individual to be considered under section 267(c)(2) as 
constructively owning the stock of a corporation which is owned, 
directly or indirectly, by or for members of his family it is not 
necessary that he own stock in the corporation either directly or 
indirectly. On the other hand, for an individual to be considered under 
section 267(c)(3) as owning the stock of a corporation owned either 
actually, or constructively under section 267(c)(1), by or for his 
partner, such individual must himself actually own, or constructively 
own under section 267(c)(1), stock of such corporation.

[[Page 502]]

    (3) An individual's constructive ownership, under section 267(c) (2) 
or (3), of stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a member of his 
family, or by or for his partner, is not to be considered as actual 
ownership of such stock, and the individual's constructive ownership of 
the stock is not to be attributed to another member of his family or to 
another partner. However, an individual's constructive ownership, under 
section 267(c)(1), of stock owned directly or indirectly by or for a 
corporation, partnership, estate, or trust shall be considered as actual 
ownership of the stock, and the individual's ownership may be attributed 
to a member of his family or to his partner.
    (4) The family of an individual shall include only his brothers and 
sisters, spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendants. In determining 
whether any of these relationships exist, full effect shall be given to 
a legal adoption. The term ancestors includes parents and grandparents, 
and the term lineal descendants includes children and grandchildren.
    (b) Examples. The application of section 267(c) may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. On July 1, 1957, A owned 75 percent, and AW, his wife, 
owned 25 percent, of the outstanding stock of the M Corporation. The M 
Corporation in turn owned 80 percent of the outstanding stock of the O 
Corporation. Under section 267(c)(1), A and AW are each considered as 
owning an amount of the O Corporation stock actually owned by M 
Corporation in proportion to their respective ownership of M Corporation 
stock. Therefore, A constructively owns 60 percent (75 percent of 80 
percent) of the O Corporation stock and AW constructively owns 20 
percent (25 percent of 80 percent) of such stock. Under the family 
ownership rule of section 267(c)(2), an individual is considered as 
constructively owning the stock actually owned by his spouse. A and AW, 
therefore, are each considered as constructively owning the M 
Corporation stock actually owned by the other. For the purpose of 
applying this family ownership rule, A's and AW's constructive ownership 
of O Corporation stock is considered as actual ownership under section 
267(c)(5). Thus, A constructively owns the 20 percent of the O 
Corporation stock constructively owned by AW, and AW constructively owns 
the 60 percent of the O Corporation stock constructively owned by A. In 
addition, the family ownership rule may be applied to make AWF, AW's 
father, the constructive owner of the 25 percent of the M Corporation 
stock actually owned by AW. As noted above, AW's constructive ownership 
of 20 percent of the O Corporation stock is considered as actual 
ownership for purposes of applying the family ownership rule, and AWF is 
thereby considered the constructive owner of this stock also. However, 
AW's constructive ownership of the stock constructively and actually 
owned by A may not be considered as actual ownership for the purpose of 
again applying the family ownership rule to make AWF the constructive 
owner of these shares. The ownership of the stock in the M and O 
Corporations may be tabulated as follows:

Assuming that the M Corporation and the O Corporation make their income 
tax returns for calendar years, and that there was no distribution in 
liquidation of the M or O Corporation, and further assuming that other 
corporation was a personal holding company under section 542 for the 
calendar year 1956, no deduction is allowable with respect to losses 
from sales or exchanges of property made on July 1, 1957, between the 
two corporations. Moreover, whether or not either corporation was a 
personal holding company, no loss would be allowable on a sale or 
exchange between A or AW and either corporation. A deduction would be 
allowed, however, for a loss sustained in an arm's length sale or 
exchange between A and AWF, and between AWF and the M or O Corporation.
    Example 2. On June 15, 1957, all of the stock of the N Corporation 
was owned in equal proportions by A and his partner, AP. Except in the 
case of distributions in liquidation by the N Corporation, no deduction 
is allowable with respect to losses from sales or exchanges of property 
made on June 15, 1957, between A and the N Corporation or AP and the N 
Corporation since each partner is considered as owning the stock owned 
by the other; therefore, each is considered as owning more than 50 
percent in value of the outstanding stock of the N Corporation.
    Example 3. On June 7, 1957, A owned no stock in X Corporation, but 
his wife, AW, owned 20 percent in value of the outstanding stock of X, 
and A's partner, AP, owned 60 percent in value of the outstanding stock 
of X. The partnership firm of A and AP owned no stock in X Corporation. 
The ownership of AW's stock is attributed to A, but not that of AP since 
A does not own any X Corporation stock either actually, or 
constructively under section 267(c)(1). A's constructive ownership of 
AW's stock is not the ownership required for the attribution of AP's 
stock. Therefore, deductions for losses from sales or exchanges of 
property made on June 7, 1957, between X Corporation and A or AW are 
allowable since neither person owned more than 50 percent in value of 
the outstanding stock of X, but deductions for losses from sales or 
exchanges between X Corporation and AP would not be allowable by section 
267(a) (except for distributions in liquidation of X Corporation).


<R05>
Sec. 1.267(d)-1   Amount of gain where loss previously disallowed.

    (a) General rule. (1) If a taxpayer acquires property by purchase or 
exchange from a transferor who, on the transaction, sustained a loss not 
allowable as a deduction by reason of section 267(a)(1) (or by reason of 
section 24(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), then any gain 
realized by the taxpayer on a sale or other disposition of the property 
after December 31, 1953, shall be recognized only to the extent that the 
gain exceeds the amount of such loss as is properly allocable to the 
property sold or otherwise disposed of by the taxpayer.
    (2) The general rule is also applicable to a sale or other 
disposition of property by a taxpayer when the basis of such property in 
the taxpayer's hands is determined directly or indirectly by reference 
to other property acquired by the taxpayer from a transferor through a 
sale or exchange in which a loss sustained by the transferor was not 
allowable. Therefore, section 267(d) applies to a sale or other 
disposition of property after a series of transactions if the basis of 
the property acquired in each transaction is determined by reference to 
the basis of the property transferred, and if the original property was 
acquired in a transaction in which a loss to a transferor was not 
allowable by reason of section 267(a)(1) (or by reason of section 24(b) 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939).
    (3) The benefit of the general rule is available only to the 
original transferee but does not apply to any original transferee (e.g., 
a donee) who acquired the property in any manner other than by purchase 
or exchange.
    (4) The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. H sells to his wife, W, for $500, certain corporate stock 
with an adjusted basis for determining loss to him of $800. The loss of 
$300 is not allowable to H by reason of section 267(a)(1) and paragraph 
(a) of Sec. 1.267 (a)-1. W later sells this stock for $1,000. Although 
W's realized gain is $500 ($1,000 minus $500, her basis), her recognized 
gain under section 267(d) is only $200, the excess of the realized gain 
of $500 over the loss of $300 not allowable to H. In determining capital 
gain or loss W's holding period commences on the date of the sale from H 
to W.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that W 
later sells her stock for $300 instead of $1,000. Her recognized loss is 
$200 and not $500 since section 267(d) applies only to the 
nonrecognition of gain and does not affect basis.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1) except that W 
transfers her stock as a gift to X. The basis of the stock in the hands 
of X for the purpose of determining gain, under the provisions of 
section 1015, is

[[Page 504]]

the same as W's, or $500. If X later sells the stock for $1,000 the 
entire $500 gain is taxed to him.
    Example 4. H sells to his wife, W, for $5,500, farmland, with an 
adjusted basis for determining loss to him of $8,000. The loss of $2,500 
is not allowable to H by reason of section 267(a)(1) and paragraph (a) 
of Sec. 1.267 (a)-1. W exchanges the farmland, held for investment 
purposes, with S, an unrelated individual, for two city lots, also held 
for investment purposes. The basis of the city lots in the hands of W 
($5,500) is a substituted basis determined under section 1031(d) by 
reference to the basis of the farmland. Later W sells the city lots for 
$10,000. Although W's realized gain is $4,500 (10,000 minus $5,500), her 
recognized gain under section 267(d) is only $2,000, the excess of the 
realized gain of $4,500 over the loss of $2,500 not allowable to H.

    (b) Determination of basis and gain with respect to divisible 
property--(1) Taxpayer's basis. When the taxpayer acquires divisible 
property or property that consists of several items or classes of items 
by a purchase or exchange on which loss is not allowable to the 
transferor, the basis in the taxpayer's hands of a particular part, 
item, or class of such property shall be determined (if the taxpayer's 
basis for that part is not known) by allocating to the particular part, 
item, or class a portion of the taxpayer's basis for the entire property 
in the proportion that the fair market value of the particular part, 
item, or class bears to the fair market value of the entire property at 
the time of the taxpayer's acquisition of the property.
    (2) Taxpayer's recognized gain. Gain realized by the taxpayer on 
sales or other dispositions after December 31, 1953, of a part, item, or 
class of the property shall be recognized only to the extent that such 
gain exceeds the amount of loss attributable to such part, item, or 
class of property not allowable to the taxpayer's transferor on the 
latter's sale or exchange of such property to the taxpayer.
    (3) Transferor's loss not allowable. (i) The transferor's loss on 
the sale or exchange of a part, item, or class of the property to the 
taxpayer shall be the excess of the transferor's adjusted basis for 
determining loss on the part, item, or class of the property over the 
amount realized by the transferor on the sale or exchange of the part, 
item, or class. The amount realized by the transferor on the part, item, 
or class shall be determined (if such amount is not known) in the same 
manner that the taxpayer's basis for such part, item, or class is 
determined. See subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.
    (ii) If the transferor's basis for determining loss on the part, 
item, or class cannot be determined, the transferor's loss on the 
particular part, item, or class transferred to the taxpayer shall be 
determined by allocating to the part, item, or class a portion of his 
loss on the entire property in the proportion that the fair market value 
of such part, item, or class bears to the fair market value of the 
entire property on the date of the taxpayer's acquisition of the entire 
property.
    (4) Examples. The application of the provisions of this paragraph 
may be illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. During 1953, H sold class A stock which had cost him 
$1,100, and common stock which had cost him $2,000, to his wife W for a 
lump sum of $1,500. Under section 24(b)(1)(A) of the 1939 Code, the loss 
of $1,600 on the transaction was not allowable to H. At the time the 
stocks were purchased by W, the fair market value of class A stock was 
$900 and the fair market value of common stock was $600. In 1954, W sold 
the class A stock for $2,500. W's recognized gain is determined as 
follows:

Amount realized by W on sale of class A stock................     $2,500
Less: Basis allocated to class A stock--$900/$1,500  x                  
 $1,500......................................................        900
                                                   ------------         
    Realized gain on transaction.............................      1,600
Less: Loss sustained by H on sale of class A stock to W not             
 allowable as a deduction:                                              
  Basis to H of class A stock.....................     $1,100           
  Amount realized by H on class A stock--$900/                          
   $1,500  x  $1,500..............................        900           
                                                   -----------          
    Unallowable loss to H on sale of class A stock...........        200
                                                   ------------         
  Recognized gain on sale of class A stock by W..............      1,400
                                                                        

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as those stated in Example (1) of 
this subparagraph except that H originally purchased both classes of 
stock for a lump sum of $3,100. The unallowable loss to H on the sale of 
all the stock to W is $1,600 ($3,100 minus $1,500). An exact 
determination of the unallowable loss sustained by H on sale to W of 
class A stock cannot be made because H's basis for class A stock cannot 
be determined. Therefore, a determination of the unallowable loss is 
made by allocating to class A stock a portion of H's loss on the entire 
property transferred to W in the proportion that the fair market

[[Page 505]]

value of class A stock at the time acquired by W ($900) bears to the 
fair market value of both classes of stock at that time ($1,500). The 
allocated portion is $900/$1,500  x  $1,600, or $960. W's recognized 
gain is, therefore, $640 (W's realized gain of $1,600 minus $960).

    (c) Special rules. (1) Section 267(d) does not affect the basis of 
property for determining gain. Depreciation and other items which depend 
on such basis are also not affected.
    (2) The provisions of section 267(d) shall not apply if the loss 
sustained by the transferor is not allowable to the transferor as a 
deduction by reason of section 1091, or section 118 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1939, which relate to losses from wash sales of stock or 
securities.
    (3) In determining the holding period in the hands of the transferee 
of property received in an exchange with a transferor with respect to 
whom a loss on the exchange is not allowable by reason of section 267, 
section 1223(2) does not apply to include the period during which the 
property was held by the transferor. In determining such holding period, 
however, section 1223(1) may apply to include the period during which 
the transferee held the property which he exchanged where, for example, 
he exchanged a capital asset in a transaction which, as to him, was 
nontaxable under section 1031 and the property received in the exchange 
has the same basis as the property exchanged.


<R05>
Sec. 1.267(d)-2   Effective date; taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

    Pursuant to section 7851(a)(1)(C), the regulations prescribed in 
Sec. 1.267(d)-1, to the extent that they relate to determination of gain 
resulting from the sale or other disposition of property after December 
31, 1953, with respect to which property a loss was not allowable to the 
transferor by reason of section 267(a)(1) (or by reason of section 24(b) 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), shall also apply to taxable years 
beginning before January 1, 1954, and ending after December 31, 1953, 
and taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending before 
August 17, 1954, which years are subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 
1939.


<R05>
Sec. 1.267(f)-1  Controlled groups.

    (a) In general--(1) Purpose. This section provides rules under 
section 267(f) to defer losses and deductions from certain transactions 
between members of a controlled group (intercompany sales). The purpose 
of this section is to prevent members of a controlled group from taking 
into account a loss or deduction solely as the result of a transfer of 
property between a selling member (S) and a buying member (B).
    (2) Application of consolidated return principles. Under this 
section, S's loss or deduction from an intercompany sale is taken into 
account under the timing principles of Sec. 1.1502-13 (intercompany 
transactions between members of a consolidated group), treating the 
intercompany sale as an intercompany transaction. For this purpose:
    (i) The matching and acceleration rules of Sec. 1.1502-13 (c) and 
(d), the definitions and operating rules of Sec. 1.1502-13 (b) and (j), 
and the simplifying rules of Sec. 1.1502-13(e)(1) apply with the 
adjustments in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to reflect that 
this section--
    (A) Applies on a controlled group basis rather than consolidated 
group basis; and
    (B) Generally affects only the timing of a loss or deduction, and 
not it's attributes (e.g., its source and character) or the holding 
period of property.
    (ii) The special rules under Sec. 1.1502-13(f) (stock of members) 
and (g) (obligations of members) apply under this section only to the 
extent the transaction is also an intercompany transaction to which 
Sec. 1.1502-13 applies.
    (iii) Any election under Sec. 1.1502-13 to take items into account 
on a separate entity basis does not apply under this section. See 
Sec. 1.1502-13(e)(3).
    (3) Other law. The rules of this section apply in addition to other 
applicable law (including nonstatutory authorities). For example, to the 
extent a loss or deduction deferred under this section is from a 
transaction that is also an intercompany transaction under Sec. 1.1502-
13(b)(1), attributes of the loss or deduction are also subject to 
recharacterization under Sec. 1.1502-13. See also, sections 269 
(acquisitions to evade or avoid income tax) and 482 (allocations among 
commonly controlled taxpayers). Any loss or deduction taken

[[Page 506]]

into account under this section can be deferred, disallowed, or 
eliminated under other applicable law. See, for example, section 1091 
(loss eliminated on wash sale).
    (b) Definitions and operating rules. The definitions in Sec. 1.1502-
13(b) and the operating rules of Sec. 1.1502-13(j) apply under this 
section with appropriate adjustments, including the following:
    (1) Intercompany sale. An intercompany sale is a sale, exchange, or 
other transfer of property between members of a controlled group, if it 
would be an intercompany transaction under the principles of 
Sec. 1.1502-13, determined by treating the references to a consolidated 
group as references to a controlled group and by disregarding whether 
any of the members join in filing consolidated returns.
    (2) S's losses or deductions. Except to the extent the intercompany 
sale is also an intercompany transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-13 
applies, S's losses or deductions subject to this section are determined 
on a separate entity basis. For example, the principles of Sec. 1.1502-
13(b)(2)(iii) (treating certain amounts not yet recognized as items to 
be taken into account) do not apply. A loss or deduction is from an 
intercompany sale whether it is directly or indirectly from the 
intercompany sale.
    (3) Controlled group; member. For purposes of this section, a 
controlled group is defined in section 267(f). Thus, a controlled group 
includes a FSC (as defined in section 922) and excluded members under 
section 1563(b)(2), but does not include a DISC (as defined in section 
992). Corporations remain members of a controlled group as long as they 
remain in a controlled group relationship with each other. For example, 
corporations become nonmembers with respect to each other when they 
cease to be in a controlled group relationship with each other, rather 
than by having a separate return year (described in Sec. 1.1502-
13(j)(7)). Further, the principles of Sec. 1.1502-13(j)(6) (former 
common parent treated as continuation of group) apply to any corporation 
if, immediately before it becomes a nonmember, it is both the selling 
member and the owner of property with respect to which a loss or 
deduction is deferred (whether or not it becomes a member of a different 
controlled group filing consolidated or separate returns). Thus, for 
example, if S and B merge together in a transaction described in section 
368(a)(1)(A), the surviving corporation is treated as the successor to 
the other corporation, and the controlled group relationship is treated 
as continuing.
    (4) Consolidated taxable income. References to consolidated taxable 
income (and consolidated tax liability) include references to the 
combined taxable income of the members (and their combined tax 
liability). For corporations filing separate returns, it ordinarily will 
not be necessary to actually combine their taxable incomes (and tax 
liabilities) because the taxable income (and tax liability) of one 
corporation does not affect the taxable income (or tax liability) of 
another corporation.
    (c) Matching and acceleration principles of Sec. 1.1502-13--(1) 
Adjustments to the timing rules. Under this section, S's losses and 
deductions are deferred until they are taken into account under the 
timing principles of the matching and acceleration rules of Sec. 1.1502-
13(c) and (d) with appropriate adjustments. For example, if S sells 
depreciable property to B at a loss, S's loss is deferred and taken into 
account under the principles of the matching rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(c) 
to reflect the difference between B's depreciation taken into account 
with respect to the property and the depreciation that B would take into 
account if S and B were divisions of a single corporation; if S and B 
subsequently cease to be in a controlled group relationship with each 
other, S's remaining loss is taken into account under the principles of 
the acceleration rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(d). For purposes of this 
section, the adjustments to Sec. 1.1502-13 (c) and (d) include the 
following:
    (i) Application on controlled group basis. The matching and 
acceleration rules apply on a controlled group basis, rather than a 
consolidated group basis. Thus if S and B are wholly-owned members of a 
consolidated group and 21% of the stock of S is sold to an unrelated 
person, S's loss continues to be deferred under this section because S 
and B continue to be members of a controlled group even though S is no

[[Page 507]]

longer a member of the consolidated group. Similarly, S's loss would 
continue to be deferred if S and B remain in a controlled group 
relationship after both corporations become nonmembers of their former 
consolidated group.
    (ii) Different taxable years. If S and B have different taxable 
years, the taxable years that include a December 31 are treated as the 
same taxable years. If S or B has a short taxable year that does not 
include a December 31, the short year is treated as part of the 
succeeding taxable year that does include a December 31.
    (iii) Transfer to a section 267(b) or 707(b) related person.  To the 
extent S's loss or deduction from an intercompany sale of property is 
taken into account under this section as a result of B's transfer of the 
property to a nonmember that is a person related to any member, 
immediately after the transfer, under sections 267(b) or 707(b), or as a 
result of S or B becoming a nonmember that is related to any member 
under section 267(b), the loss or deduction is taken into account but 
allowed only to the extent of any income or gain taken into account as a 
result of the transfer. The balance not allowed is treated as a loss 
referred to in section 267(d) if it is from a sale or exchange by B 
(rather than from a distribution).
    (iv) B's item is excluded from gross income or noncapital and 
nondeductible. To the extent S's loss would be redetermined to be a 
noncapital, nondeductible amount under the principles of Sec. 1.1502-13 
but is not redetermined because of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, 
then, if paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section does not apply, S's loss 
continues to be deferred and is not taken into account until S and B are 
no longer in a controlled group relationship. For example, if S sells 
all of the stock of corporation T to B at a loss and T subsequently 
liquidates into B in a transaction qualifying under section 332, S's 
loss is deferred until S and B (including their successors) are no 
longer in a controlled group relationship. See Sec. 1.1502-13(c)(6)(ii).
    (v) Circularity of references. References to deferral or elimination 
under the Internal Revenue Code or regulations do not include references 
to section 267(f) or this section. See, e.g., Sec. 1.1502-13(a)(4) 
(applicability of other law).
    (2) Attributes generally not affected. The matching and acceleration 
rules are not applied under this section to affect the attributes of S's 
intercompany item, or cause it to be taken into account before it is 
taken into account under S's separate entity method of accounting. 
However, the attributes of S's intercompany item may be redetermined, or 
an item may be taken into account earlier than under S's separate entity 
method of accounting, to the extent the transaction is also an 
intercompany transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-13 applies. Similarly, 
except to the extent the transaction is also an intercompany transaction 
to which Sec. 1.1502-13 applies, the matching and acceleration rules do 
not apply to affect the timing or attributes of B's corresponding items.
    (d) Intercompany sales of inventory involving foreign persons--(1) 
General rule. Section 267(a)(1) and this section do not apply to an 
intercompany sale of property that is inventory (within the meaning of 
section 1221(1)) in the hands of both S and B, if--
    (i) The intercompany sale is in the ordinary course of S's trade or 
business;
    (ii) S or B is a foreign corporation; and
    (iii) Any income or loss realized on the intercompany sale by S or B 
is not income or loss that is recognized as effectively connected with 
the conduct of a trade or business within the United States within the 
meaning of section 864 (unless the income is exempt from taxation 
pursuant to a treaty obligation of the United States).
    (2) Intercompany sales involving related partnerships. For purposes 
of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a partnership and a foreign 
corporation described in section 267(b)(10) are treated as members, 
provided that the income or loss of the foreign corporation is described 
in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (3) Intercompany sales in ordinary course. For purposes of this 
paragraph (d), whether an intercompany sale is in the ordinary course of 
business is determined under all the facts and circumstances.

[[Page 508]]

    (e) Treatment of a creditor with respect to a loan in nonfunctional 
currency. Sections 267(a)(1) and this section do not apply to an 
exchange loss realized with respect to a loan of nonfunctional currency 
if--
    (1) The loss is realized by a member with respect to nonfunctional 
currency loaned to another member;
    (2) The loan is described in Sec. 1.988-1(a)(2)(i);
    (3) The loan is not in a hyperinflationary currency as defined in 
Sec. 1.988-1(f); and
    (4) The transaction does not have as a significant purpose the 
avoidance of Federal income tax.
    (f) Receivables. If S acquires a receivable from the sale of goods 
or services to a nonmember at a gain, and S sells the receivable at fair 
market value to B, any loss or deduction of S from its sale to B is not 
deferred under this section to the extent it does not exceed S's income 
or gain from the sale to the nonmember that has been taken into account 
at the time the receivable is sold to B.
    (g) Earnings and profits. A loss or deduction deferred under this 
section is not reflected in S's earnings and profits before it is taken 
into account under this section. See, e.g., Secs. 1.312-6(a), 1.312-7, 
and 1.1502-33(c)(2).
    (h) Anti-avoidance rule. If a transaction is engaged in or 
structured with a principal purpose to avoid the purposes of this 
section (including, for example, by avoiding treatment as an 
intercompany sale or by distorting the timing of losses or deductions), 
adjustments must be made to carry out the purposes of this section.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this paragraph (j), 
unless otherwise stated, corporation P owns 75% of the only class of 
stock of subsidiaries S and B, X is a person unrelated to any member of 
the P controlled group, the taxable year of all persons is the calendar 
year, all persons use the accrual method of accounting, tax liabilities 
are disregarded, the facts set forth the only activity, and no member 
has a special status. If a member acts as both a selling member and a 
buying member (e.g., with respect to different aspects of a single 
transaction, or with respect to related transactions), the member is 
referred as to M (rather than as S or B). This section is illustrated by 
the following examples.

    Example 1. Matching and acceleration rules. (a) Facts. S holds land 
for investment with a basis of $130. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the 
land to B for $100. On a separate entity basis, S's loss is long-term 
capital loss. B holds the land for sale to customers in the ordinary 
course of business. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X for $110.
    (b) Matching rule. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, S's sale 
of land to B is an intercompany sale. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, S's $30 loss is taken into account under the timing principles 
of the matching rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(c) to reflect the difference for 
the year between B's corresponding items taken into account and the 
recomputed corresponding items. If S and B were divisions of a single 
corporation and the intercompany sale were a transfer between the 
divisions, B would succeed to S's $130 basis in the land and would have 
a $20 loss from the sale to X in Year 3. Consequently, S takes no loss 
into account in Years 1 and 2, and takes the entire $30 loss into 
account in Year 3 to reflect the $30 difference in that year between the 
$10 gain B takes into account and its $20 recomputed loss. The 
attributes of S's intercompany items and B's corresponding items are 
determined on a separate entity basis. Thus, S's $30 loss is long-term 
capital loss and B's $10 gain is ordinary income.
    (c) Acceleration resulting from sale of B stock. The facts are the 
same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that on July 1 of 
Year 3 P sells all of its B stock to X (rather than B's selling the land 
to X). Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, S's $30 loss is taken 
into account under the timing principles of the acceleration rule of 
Sec. 1.1502-13(d) immediately before the effect of treating S and B as 
divisions of a single corporation cannot be produced. Because the effect 
cannot be produced once B becomes a nonmember, S takes its $30 loss into 
account in Year 3 immediately before B becomes a nonmember. S's loss is 
long-term capital loss.
    (d) Subgroup principles applicable to sale of S and B stock. The 
facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this Example 1, except that on 
July 1 of Year 3 P sells all of its S and B stock to X (rather than B's 
selling the land to X). Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, S and B 
are considered to remain members of a controlled group as long as they 
remain in a controlled group relationship with each other (whether or 
not in the original controlled group). P's sale of their stock does not 
affect the controlled group relationship of S and B with each other. 
Thus, S's loss is not taken into account as a result of P's sale

[[Page 509]]

of the stock. Instead, S's loss is taken into account based on 
subsequent events (e.g., B's sale of the land to a nonmember).
    Example 2. Distribution of loss property. (a) Facts. S holds land 
with a basis of $130 and value of $100. On January 1 of Year 1, S 
distributes the land to P in a transaction to which section 311 applies. 
On July 1 of Year 3, P sells the land to X for $110.
    (b) No loss taken into account. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section, because P and S are not members of a consolidated group, 
Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(2)(iii) does not apply to cause S to recognize a $30 
loss under the principles of section 311(b). Thus, S has no loss to be 
taken into account under this section. (If P and S were members of a 
consolidated group, Sec. 1.1502-13(f)(2)(iii) would apply to S's loss in 
addition to the rules of this section, and the loss would be taken into 
account in Year 3 as a result of P's sale to X.)
    Example 3. Loss not yet taken into account under separate entity 
accounting method. (a) Facts. S holds land with a basis of $130. On 
January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B at a $30 loss but does not 
take into account the loss under its separate entity method of 
accounting until Year 4. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X for 
$110.
    (b) Timing. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, S's loss is 
determined on a separate entity basis. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section, S's loss is not taken into account before it is taken into 
account under S's separate entity method of accounting. Thus, although B 
takes its corresponding gain into account in Year 3, S has no loss to 
take into account until Year 4. Once S's loss is taken into account in 
Year 4, it is not deferred under this section because B's corresponding 
gain has already been taken into account. (If S and B were members of a 
consolidated group, S would be treated under Sec. 1.1502-13(b)(2)(iii) 
as taking the loss into account in Year 3.)
    Example 4. Consolidated groups. (a) Facts. P owns all of the stock 
of S and B, and the P group is a consolidated group. S holds land for 
investment with a basis of $130. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the 
land to B for $100. B holds the land for sale to customers in the 
ordinary course of business. On July 1 of Year 3, P sells 25% of B's 
stock to X. As a result of P's sale, B becomes a nonmember of the P 
consolidated group but S and B remain in a controlled group relationship 
with each other for purposes of section 267(f). Assume that if S and B 
were divisions of a single corporation, the items of S and B from the 
land would be ordinary by reason of B's activities.
    (b) Timing and attributes. Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
S's sale to B is subject to both Sec. 1.1502-13 and this section. Under 
Sec. 1.1502-13, S's loss is redetermined to be an ordinary loss by 
reason of B's activities. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, 
because S and B remain in a controlled group relationship with each 
other, the loss is not taken into account under the acceleration rule of 
Sec. 1.1502-13(d) as modified by paragraph (c) of this section. See 
Sec. 1.1502-13(a)(4). Nevertheless, S's loss is redetermined by 
Sec. 1.1502-13 to be an ordinary loss, and the character of the loss is 
not further redetermined under this section. Thus, the loss continues to 
be deferred under this section, and will be taken into account as 
ordinary loss based on subsequent events (e.g., B's sale of the land to 
a nonmember).
    (c) Resale to controlled group member. The facts are the same as in 
paragraph (a) of this Example 4, except that P owns 75% of X's stock, 
and B resells the land to X (rather than P's selling any B stock). The 
results for S's loss are the same as in paragraph (b) of this Example 4. 
Under paragraph (b) of this section, X is also in a controlled group 
relationship, and B's sale to X is a second intercompany sale. Thus, S's 
loss continues to be deferred and is taken into account under this 
section as ordinary loss based on subsequent events (e.g., X's sale of 
the land to a nonmember).
    Example 5. Intercompany sale followed by installment sale. (a) 
Facts. S holds land for investment with a basis of $130x. On January 1 
of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100x. B holds the land for 
investment. On July 1 of Year 3, B sells the land to X in exchange for 
X's $110x note. The note bears a market rate of interest in excess of 
the applicable Federal rate, and provides for principal payments of $55x 
in Year 4 and $55x in Year 5. Section 453A applies to X's note.
    (b) Timing and attributes. Under paragraph (c) of this section, S's 
$30x loss is taken into account under the timing principles of the 
matching rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(c) to reflect the difference in each 
year between B's gain taken into account and its recomputed loss. Under 
section 453, B takes into account $5x of gain in Year 4 and in Year 5. 
Therefore, S takes $20x of its loss into account in Year 3 to reflect 
the $20x difference in that year between B's $0 loss taken into account 
and its $20x recomputed loss. In addition, S takes $5x of its loss into 
account in Year 4 and in Year 5 to reflect the $5x difference in each 
year between B's $5x gain taken into account and its $0 recomputed gain. 
Although S takes into account a loss and B takes into account a gain, 
the attributes of B's $10x gain are determined on a separate entity 
basis, and therefore the interest charge under section 453A(c) applies 
to B's $10x gain on the installment sale beginning in Year 3.
    Example 6. Section 721 transfer to a related nonmember. (a) Facts. S 
owns land with a basis of $130. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land 
to B for $100. On July 1 of Year 3, B

[[Page 510]]

transfers the land to a partnership in exchange for a 40% interest in 
capital and profits in a transaction to which section 721 applies. P 
also owns a 25% interest in the capital and profits of the partnership.
    (b) Timing. Under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, because the 
partnership is a nonmember that is a related person under sections 
267(b) and 707(b), S's $30 loss is taken into account in Year 3, but 
only to the extent of any income or gain taken into account as a result 
of the transfer. Under section 721, no gain or loss is taken into 
account as a result of the transfer to the partnership, and thus none of 
S's loss is taken into account. Any subsequent gain recognized by the 
partnership with respect to the property is limited under section 
267(d). (The results would be the same if the P group were a 
consolidated group, and S's sale to B were also subject to Sec. 1.1502-
13.)
    Example 7. Receivables. (a) Controlled group. S owns goods with a 
$60 basis. In Year 1, S sells the goods to X for X's $100 note. The note 
bears a market rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal 
rate, and provides for payment of principal in Year 5. S takes into 
account $40 of income in Year 1 under its method of accounting. In Year 
2, the fair market value of X's note falls to $90 due to an increase in 
prevailing market interest rates, and S sells the note to B for its $90 
fair market value.
    (b) Loss not deferred. Under paragraph (f) of this section, S takes 
its $10 loss into account in Year 2. (If the sale were not at fair 
market value, paragraph (f) of this section would not apply and none of 
S's $10 loss would be taken into account in Year 2.)
    (c) Consolidated group. Assume instead that P owns all of the stock 
of S and B, and the P group is a consolidated group. In Year 1, S sells 
to X goods having a basis of $90 for X's $100 note (bearing a market 
rate of interest in excess of the applicable Federal rate, and providing 
for payment of principal in Year 5), and S takes into account $10 of 
income in Year 1. In Year 2, S sells the receivable to B for its $85 
fair market value. In Year 3, P sells 25% of B's stock to X. Although 
paragraph (f) of this section provides that $10 of S's loss (i.e., the 
extent to which S's $15 loss does not exceed its $10 of income) is not 
deferred under this section, S's entire $15 loss is subject to 
Sec. 1.1502-13 and none of the loss is taken into account in Year 2 
under the matching rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(c). See paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section (continued deferral under Sec. 1.1502-13). P's sale of B 
stock results in B becoming a nonmember of the P consolidated group in 
Year 3. Thus, S's $15 loss is taken into account in Year 3 under the 
acceleration rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(d). Nevertheless, B remains in a 
controlled group relationship with S and paragraph (f) of this section 
permits only $10 of S's loss to be taken into account in Year 3. See 
Sec. 1.1502-13(a)(4) (continued deferral under section 267). The 
remaining $5 of S's loss continues to be deferred under this section and 
taken into account under this section based on subsequent events (e.g., 
B's collection of the note or P's sale of the remaining B stock to a 
nonmember).
    Example 8. Selling member ceases to be a member. (a) Facts. P owns 
all of the stock of S and B, and the P group is a consolidated group. S 
has several historic assets, including land with a basis of $130 and 
value of $100. The land is not essential to the operation of S's 
business. On January 1 of Year 1, S sells the land to B for $100. On 
July 1 of Year 3, P transfers all of S's stock to newly formed X in 
exchange for a 20% interest in X stock as part of a transaction to which 
section 351 applies. Although X holds many other assets, a principal 
purpose for P's transfer is to accelerate taking S's $30 loss into 
account. P has no plan or intention to dispose of the X stock.
    (b) Timing. Under paragraph (c) of this section, S's $30 loss 
ordinarily is taken into account immediately before P's transfer of the 
S stock, under the timing principles of the acceleration rule of 
Sec. 1.1502-13(d). Although taking S's loss into account results in a 
$30 negative stock basis adjustment under Sec. 1.1502-32, because P has 
no plan or intention to dispose of its X stock, the negative adjustment 
will not immediately affect taxable income. P's transfer accelerates a 
loss that otherwise would be deferred, and an adjustment under paragraph 
(h) of this section is required. Thus, S's loss is never taken into 
account, and S's stock basis and earnings and profits are reduced by $30 
under Secs. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33 immediately before P's transfer of 
the S stock.
    (c) Nonhistoric assets. Assume instead that, with a principal 
purpose to accelerate taking into account any further loss that may 
accrue in the value of the land without disposing of the land outside of 
the controlled group, P forms M with a $100 contribution on January 1 of 
Year 1 and S sells the land to M for $100. On December 1 of Year 1, when 
the value of the land has decreased to $90, M sells the land to B for 
$90. On July 1 of Year 3, while B still owns the land, P sells all of 
M's stock to X and M becomes a nonmember. Under paragraph (c) of this 
section, M's $10 loss ordinarily is taken into account under the timing 
principles of the acceleration rule of Sec. 1.1502-13(d) immediately 
before M becomes a nonmember. (S's $30 loss is not taken into account 
under the timing principles of Sec. 1.1502-13(c) or Sec. 1.1502-13(d) as 
a result of M becoming a nonmember, but is taken into account based on 
subsequent events such as B's sale of the land to a nonmember or P's 
sale of the stock of S or B to a nonmember.) The land is not an historic 
asset of M and, although taking M's loss into account reduces P's basis 
in the M stock

[[Page 511]]

under Sec. 1.1502-32, the negative adjustment only eliminates the $10 
duplicate stock loss. Under paragraph (h) of this section, M's loss is 
never taken into account. M's stock basis, and the earnings and profits 
of M and P, are reduced by $10 under Secs. 1.1502-32 and 1.1502-33 
immediately before P's sale of the M stock.

    (k) Cross-reference. For additional rules applicable to the 
disposition or deconsolidation of the stock of members of consolidated 
groups, see Secs. 1.337(d)-1, 1.337(d)-2, 1.1502-13(f)(6), and 1.1502-
20.
    (l) Effective dates--(1) In general. This section applies with 
respect to transactions occurring in S's years beginning on or after 
July 12, 1995. If both this section and prior law apply to a 
transaction, or neither applies, with the result that items are 
duplicated, omitted, or eliminated in determining taxable income (or tax 
liability), or items are treated inconsistently, prior law (and not this 
section) applies to the transaction.
    (2) Avoidance transactions. This paragraph (l)(2) applies if a 
transaction is engaged in or structured on or after April 8, 1994, with 
a principal purpose to avoid the rules of this section (and instead to 
apply prior law). If this paragraph (l)(2) applies, appropriate 
adjustments must be made in years beginning on or after July 12, 1995, 
to prevent the avoidance, duplication, omission, or elimination of any 
item (or tax liability), or any other inconsistency with the rules of 
this section.
    (3) Prior law. For transactions occurring in S's years beginning 
before July 12, 1995 see the applicable regulations issued under 
sections 267 and 1502. See, e.g., Secs. 1.267(f)-1, 1.267(f)-1T, 
1.267(f)-2T, 1.267(f)-3, 1.1502-13, 1.1502-13T, 1.1502-14, 1.1502-14T, 
and 1.1502-31 (as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 edition revised as of 
April 1, 1995).

Sec. 1.268-1   Items attributable to an unharvested crop sold with the land.

    In computing taxable income no deduction shall be allowed in respect 
of items attributable to the production of an unharvested crop which is 
sold, exchanged, or involuntarily converted with the land and which is 
considered as property used in the trade or business under section 
1231(b)(4). Such items shall be so treated whether or not the taxable 
year involved is that of the sale, exchange, or conversion of such crop 
and whether they are for expenses, depreciation, or otherwise. If the 
taxable year involved is not that of the sale, exchange, or conversion 
of such crop, a recomputation of the tax liability for such year shall 
be made; such recomputation should be in the form of an ``amended 
return'' if necessary. For the adjustments to basis as a result of such 
disallowance, see section 1016(a)(11) and the regulations thereunder.


<R05>
Sec. 1.269-1   Meaning and use of terms.

    As used in section 269 and Secs. 1.269-2 through 1.269-7:
    (a) Allowance. The term allowance refers to anything in the internal 
revenue laws which has the effect of diminishing tax liability. The term 
includes, among other things, a deduction, a credit, an adjustment, an 
exemption, or an exclusion.
    (b) Evasion or avoidance. The phrase evasion or avoidance is not 
limited to cases involving criminal penalties, or civil penalties for 
fraud.
    (c) Control. The term control means the ownership of stock 
possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all 
classes of stock entitled to vote, or at least 50 percent of the total 
value of shares of all classes of stock of the corporation. For control 
to be ``acquired on or after October 8, 1940'', it is not necessary that 
all of such stock be acquired on or after October 8, 1940. Thus, if A, 
on October 7, 1940, and at all times thereafter, owns 40 percent of the 
stock of X Corporation and acquires on October 8, 1940, an additional 10 
percent of such stock, an acquisition within the meaning of such phrase 
is made by A on October 8, 1940. Similarly, if B, on October 7, 1940, 
owns certain assets and transfers on October 8, 1940, such assets to a 
newly organized Y Corporation in exchange for all the stock of Y 
Corporation, an acquisition within the meaning of such phrase is made by 
B on October 8, 1940. If, under the facts stated in the preceding 
sentence, B is a corporation, all of whose

[[Page 512]]

stock is owned by Z Corporation, then an acquisition within the meaning 
of such phrase is also made by Z Corporation on October 8, 1940, as well 
as by the shareholders of Z Corporation taken as a group on such date, 
and by any of such shareholders if such shareholders as a group own 50 
percent of the stock of Z on such date.
    (d) Person. The term person includes an individual, a trust, an 
estate, a partnership, an association, a company or a corporation.

<R05>
Sec. 1.269-2   Purpose and scope of section 269.

    (a) General. Section 269 is designed to prevent in the instances 
specified therein the use of the sections of the Internal Revenue Code 
providing deductions, credits, or allowances in evading or avoiding 
Federal income tax. See Sec. 1.269-3.
    (b) Disallowance of deduction, credit, or other allowance. Under the 
Code, an amount otherwise constituting a deduction, credit, or other 
allowance becomes unavailable as such under certain circumstances. 
Characteristic of such circumstances are those in which the effect of 
the deduction, credit, or other allowance would be to distort the 
liability of the particular taxpayer when the essential nature of the 
transaction or situation is examined in the light of the basic purpose 
or plan which the deduction, credit, or other allowance was designed by 
the Congress to effectuate. The distortion may be evidenced, for 
example, by the fact that the transaction was not undertaken for reasons 
germane to the conduct of the business of the taxpayer, by the unreal 
nature of the transaction such as its sham character, or by the unreal 
or unreasonable relation which the deduction, credit, or other allowance 
bears to the transaction. The principle of law making an amount 
unavailable as a deduction, credit, or other allowance in cases in which 
the effect of making an amount so available would be to distort the 
liability of the taxpayer, has been judicially recognized and applied in 
several cases. Included in these cases are Gregory v. Helvering (1935) 
(293 U.S. 465; Ct. D. 911, C.B. XIV-1, 193); Griffiths v. Helvering 
(1939) (308 U.S. 355; Ct. D. 1431, C.B. 1940-1, 136); Higgins v. Smith 
(1940) (308 U.S. 473; Ct. D. 1434, C.B. 1940-1, 127); and J. D. & A. B. 
Spreckles Co. v. Commissioner (1940) (41 B.T.A. 370). In order to give 
effect to such principle, but not in limitation thereof, several 
provisions of the Code, for example, section 267 and section 270, 
specify with some particularity instances in which disallowance of the 
deduction, credit, or other allowance is required. Section 269 is also 
included in such provisions of the Code. The principle of law and the 
particular sections of the Code are not mutually exclusive and in 
appropriate circumstances they may operate together or they may operate 
separately. See, for example, Sec. 1.269-6.

[T.D. 6595, 27 FR 3596, Apr. 14, 1962]


<R05>
Sec. 1.269-3   Instances in which section 269(a) disallows a deduction, credit, or other allowance.

    (a) Instances of disallowance. Section 269 specifies two instances 
in which a deduction, credit, or other allowance is to be disallowed. 
These instances, described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 269(a), 
are those in which:
    (1) Any person or persons acquire, or acquired on or after October 
8, 1940, directly or indirectly, control of a corporation, or
    (2) Any corporation acquires, or acquired on or after October 8, 
1940, directly or indirectly, property of another corporation (not 
controlled, directly or indirectly, immediately before such acquisition 
by such acquiring corporation or its stockholders), the basis of which 
property in the hands of the acquiring corporation is determined by 
reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor corporation.

In either instance the principal purpose for which the acquisition was 
made must have been the evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax by 
securing the benefit of a deduction, credit, or other allowance which 
such person, or persons, or corporation, would not otherwise enjoy. If 
this requirement is satisfied, it is immaterial by what method or by 
what conjunction of events the benefit was sought. Thus, an acquiring 
person or corporation can secure the

[[Page 513]]

benefit of a deduction, credit, or other allowance within the meaning of 
section 269 even though it is the acquired corporation that is entitled 
to such deduction, credit, or other allowance in the determination of 
its tax. If the purpose to evade or avoid Federal income tax exceeds in 
importance any other purpose, it is the principal purpose. This does not 
mean that only those acquisitions fall within the provisions of section 
269 which would not have been made if the evasion or avoidance purpose 
was not present. The determination of the purpose for which an 
acquisition was made requires a scrutiny of the entire circumstances in 
which the transaction or course of conduct occurred, in connection with 
the tax result claimed to arise therefrom.
    (b) Acquisition of control; transactions indicative of purpose to 
evade or avoid tax. If the requisite acquisition of control within the 
meaning of paragraph (1) of section 269(a) exists, the transactions set 
forth in the following subparagraphs are among those which, in the 
absence of additional evidence to the contrary, ordinarily are 
indicative that the principal purpose for acquiring control was evasion 
or avoidance of Federal income tax:
    (1) A corporation or other business enterprise (or the interest 
controlling such corporation or enterprise) with large profits acquires 
control of a corporation with current, past, or prospective credits, 
deductions, net operating losses, or other allowances and the 
acquisition is followed by such transfers or other action as is 
necessary to bring the deduction, credit, or other allowance into 
conjunction with the income (see further Sec. 1.269-6). This 
subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

    Example. Individual A acquires all of the stock of L Corporation 
which has been engaged in the business of operating retail drug stores. 
At the time of the acquisition, L Corporation has net operating loss 
carryovers aggregating $100,000 and its net worth is $100,000. After the 
acquisition, L Corporation continues to engage in the business of 
operating retail drug stores but the profits attributable to such 
business after the acquisition are not sufficient to absorb any 
substantial portion of the net operating loss carryovers. Shortly after 
the acquisition, individual A causes to be transferred to L Corporation 
the assets of a hardware business previously controlled by A which 
business produces profits sufficient to absorb a substantial portion of 
L Corporation's net operating loss carryovers. The transfer of the 
profitable business, which has the effect of using net operating loss 
carryovers to offset gains of a business unrelated to that which 
produced the losses, indicates that the principal purpose for which the 
acquisition of control was made is evasion or avoidance of Federal 
income tax.

    (2) A person or persons organize two or more corporations instead of 
a single corporation in order to secure the benefit of multiple surtax 
exemptions (see section 11(c)) or multiple minimum accumulated earnings 
credits (see section 535(c)(2) and (3)).
    (3) A person or persons with high earning assets transfer them to a 
newly organized controlled corporation retaining assets producing net 
operating losses which are utilized in an attempt to secure refunds.
    (c) Acquisition of property; transactions indicative of purpose to 
evade or avoid tax. If the requisite acquisition of property within the 
meaning of paragraph (2) of section 269(a) exists, the transactions set 
forth in the following subparagraphs are among those which, in the 
absence of additional evidence to the contrary, ordinarily are 
indicative that the principal purpose for acquiring such property was 
evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax:
    (1) A corporation acquires property having in its hands an aggregate 
carryover basis which is materially greater than its aggregate fair 
market value at the time of such acquisition and utilizes the property 
to create tax-reducing losses or deductions.
    (2) A subsidiary corporation, which has sustained large net 
operating losses in the operation of business X and which has filed 
separate returns for the taxable years in which the losses were 
sustained, acquires high earning assets, comprising business Y, from its 
parent corporation. The acquisition occurs at a time when the parent 
would not succeed to the net operating loss carryovers of the subsidiary 
if the subsidiary were liquidated, and the profits of business Y are 
sufficient to offset a substantial portion of the net operating loss 
carryovers attributable

[[Page 514]]

to business X (see further Example (3) of Sec. 1.269-6).
    (d) Ownership changes to which section 382(l)(5) applies; 
transactions indicative of purpose to evade or avoid tax--(1) In 
general. Absent strong evidence to the contrary, a requisite acquisition 
of control or property in connection with an ownership change to which 
section 382(l)(5) applies is considered to be made for the principal 
purpose of evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax unless the 
corporation carries on more than an insignificant amount of an active 
trade or business during and subsequent to the title 11 or similar case 
(as defined in section 382(l)(5)(G)). The determination of whether the 
corporation carries on more than an insignificant amount of an active 
trade or business is made without regard to the continuity of business 
enterprise set forth in Sec. 1.368-1(d). The determination is based on 
all the facts and circumstances, including, for example, the amount of 
business assets that continue to be used, or the number of employees in 
the work force who continue employment, in an active trade or business 
(although not necessarily the historic trade or business). Where the 
corporation continues to utilize a significant amount of its business 
assets or work force, the requirement of carrying on more than an 
insignificant amount of an active trade or business may be met even 
though all trade or business activities temporarily cease for a period 
of time in order to address business exigencies.
    (2) Effective date. The presumption under paragraph (d) of this 
section applies to acquisitions of control or property effected pursuant 
to a plan of reorganization confirmed by a court in a title 11 or 
similar case (within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A)) after August 
14, 1990.
    (e) Relationship of section 269 to 11 U.S.C. 1129(d). In determining 
for purposes of section 269 of the Internal Revenue Code whether an 
acquisition pursuant to a plan of reorganization in a case under title 
11 of the United States Code was made for the principal purpose of 
evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax, the fact that a governmental 
unit did not seek a determination under 11 U.S.C. 1129(d) is not taken 
into account and any determination by a court under 11 U.S.C. 1129(d) 
that the principal purpose of the plan is not avoidance of taxes is not 
controlling.

Sec. 1.269-4   Power of district director to allocate deduction, credit, or allowance in part.

    The district director is authorized by section 269(b) to allow a 
part of the amount disallowed by section 269(a), but he may allow such 
part only if and to the extent that he determines that the amount 
allowed will not result in the evasion or avoidance of Federal income 
tax for which the acquisition was made. The district director is also 
authorized to use other methods to give effect to part of the amount 
disallowed under section 269(a), but only to such extent as he 
determines will not result in the evasion or avoidance of Federal income 
tax for which the acquisition was made. Whenever appropriate to give 
proper effect to the deduction, credit, or other allowance, or such part 
of it which may be allowed, this authority includes the distribution, 
apportionment, or allocation of both the gross income and the 
deductions, credits, or other allowances the benefit of which was 
sought, between or among the corporations, or properties, or parts 
thereof, involved, and includes the disallowance of any such deduction, 
credit, or other allowance to any of the taxpayers involved.

Sec. 1.269-5  Time of acquisition of control.

    (a) In general. For purposes of section 269, an acquisition of 
control occurs when one or more persons acquire beneficial ownership of 
stock possessing at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power 
of all classes of stock entitled to vote or at least 50 percent of the 
total value of share of all classes of stock of the corporation.
    (b) Application of general rule to certain creditor acquisitions. 
(1) For purposes of section 269, creditors of an insolvent or bankrupt 
corporation (by themselves or in conjunction with other persons) acquire 
control of the corporation when they acquire beneficial ownership of the 
requisite

[[Page 515]]

amount of stock. Although insolvency or bankruptcy may cause the 
interests of creditors to predominate as a practical matter, creditor 
interests do not constitute beneficial ownership of the corporation's 
stock. Solely for purposes of section 269, creditors of a bankrupt 
corporation are treated as acquiring beneficial ownership of stock of 
the corporation no earlier than the time a bankruptcy court confirms a 
plan of reorganization.
    (2) The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following 
example.

    Example. Corporation L files a petition under chapter 11 of the 
Bankruptcy Code on January 5, 1987. A creditors' committee is formed. On 
February 22, 1987, and upon the request of the creditors, the bankruptcy 
court removes the debtor-in-possession from business management and 
operations and appoints a trustee. The trustee consults regularly with 
the creditors' committee in formulating both short-term and long-term 
management decisions. After three years, the creditors approve a plan of 
reorganization in which the outstanding stock of Corporation L is 
canceled and its creditors receive shares of stock constituting all of 
the outstanding shares. The bankruptcy court confirms the plan of 
reorganization on March 23, 1990, and the plan is put into effect on May 
25, 1990. For purposes of section 269, the creditors acquired control of 
Corporation L than March 23, 1990. Similarly, the determination of 
whether the creditors acquired control of Corporation L no earlier with 
the principal purpose of evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax is 
made by reference to the creditors' purposes as of no earlier than March 
23, 1990.

Sec. 1.269-6   Relationship of section 269 to section 382 before the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

    Section 269 and Secs. 1.269-1 through 1.269-5 may be applied to 
disallow a net operating loss carryover even though such carryover is 
not disallowed (in whole or in part) under section 382 and the 
regulations thereunder. This section may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    Example 1. L Corporation has computed its taxable income on a 
calendar year basis and has sustained heavy net operating losses for a 
number of years. Assume that A purchases all of the stock of L 
Corporation on December 31, 1955, for the principal purpose of utilizing 
its net operating loss carryovers by changing its business to a 
profitable new business. Assume further that A makes no attempt to 
revitalize the business of L Corporation during the calendar year 1956 
and that during January 1957 the business is changed to an entirely new 
and profitable business. The carryovers will be disallowed under the 
provisions of section 269(a) without regard to the application of 
section 382.
    Example 2. L Corporation has sustained heavy net operating losses 
for a number of years. In a merger under State law, P Corporation 
acquires all of the assets of L Corporation for the principal purpose of 
utilizing the net operating loss carryovers of L Corporation against the 
profits of P Corporation's business. As a result of the merger, the 
former stockholders of L Corporation own, immediately after the merger, 
12 percent of the fair market value of the outstanding stock of P 
Corporation. If the merger qualifies as a reorganization to which 
section 381(a) applies, the entire net operating loss carryovers will be 
disallowed under the provisions of section 269(a) without regard to the 
application of section 382.
    Example 3. L Corporation has been sustaining net operating losses 
for a number of years. P Corporation, a profitable corporation, on 
December 31, 1955, acquires all the stock of L Corporation for the 
purpose of continuing and improving the operation of L Corporation's 
business. Under the provisions of sections 334(b)(2) and 381(a)(1), P 
Corporation would not succeed to L Corporation's net operating loss 
carryovers if L Corporation were liquidated pursuant to a plan of 
liquidation adopted within two years after the date of the acquisition. 
During 1956, P Corporation transfers a profitable business to L 
Corporation for the principal purpose of using the profits of such 
business to absorb the net operating loss carryovers of L Corporation. 
The transfer is such as to cause the basis of the transferred assets in 
the hands of L Corporation to be determined by reference to their basis 
in the hands of P Corporation. L Corporation's net operating loss 
carryovers will be disallowed under the provisions of section 269(a) 
without regard to the application of section 382.

Sec. 1.269-7  Relationship of section 269 to sections 382 and 383 after the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

    Section 269 and Secs. 1.269-1 through 1.269-5 may be applied to 
disallow a deduction, credit, or other allowance notwithstanding that 
the utilization or amount of a deduction, credit, or other allowance is 
limited or reduced under section 382 or 383 and the regulations 
thereunder. However, the fact that the amount of taxable income or tax 
that

[[Page 516]]

may be offset by a deduction, credit, or other allowance is limited 
under section 382(a) or 383 and the regulations thereunder is relevant 
to the determination of whether the principal purpose of an acquisition 
is the evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax.

<R05>
Sec. 1.270-1   Limitation on deductions allowable to individuals in certain cases.

    (a) Recomputation of taxable income. (1) Under certain 
circumstances, section 270 limits the deductions (other than certain 
deductions described in subsection (b) thereof) attributable to a trade 
or business carried on by an individual which are otherwise allowable to 
such individual under the provisions of chapter 1 of the Code or the 
corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws. If, in each of five 
consecutive taxable years (including at least one taxable year beginning 
after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954), the 
deductions attributable to a trade or business carried on by an 
individual (other than the specially treated deductions described in 
paragraph (b) of this section) exceed the gross income derived from such 
trade or business by more than $50,000, the taxable income computed 
under section 63 (or the net income computed under the corresponding 
provisions of prior revenue laws) of such individual shall be recomputed 
for each of such taxable years.
    (2) In recomputing the taxable income (or the net income, in the 
case of taxable years which are otherwise subject to the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1939) for each of the five taxable years, the deductions 
(other than the specially treated deductions described in paragraph (b) 
of this section with the exception of the net operating loss deduction) 
attributable to the trade or business carried on by the individual shall 
be allowed only to the extent of (i) the gross income derived from such 
trade or business, plus (ii) $50,000. The specially treated deductions 
described in paragraph (b) of this section (other than the net operating 
loss deduction) shall each be allowed in full. The net operating loss 
deduction, to the extent attributable to such trade or business, shall 
be disallowed in its entirety. Thus, a carryover or a carryback of a net 
operating loss so attributable, either from a year within the period of 
five consecutive taxable years or from a taxable year outside of such 
period, shall be ignored in making the recomputation of taxable income 
or net income, as the case may be.
    (3) The limitations on deductions provided by section 270 are also 
applicable in determining under section 172, or the corresponding 
provisions of prior revenue laws, the amount of any net operating loss 
carryover or carryback from any year which falls within the provisions 
of section 270 to any year which does not fall within such provisions. 
Also, in determining under section 172, or the corresponding provisions 
of prior revenue laws, the amount of any net operating loss carryover 
from a year which falls within the provisions of section 270 to a year 
which does not fall within such provisions, the amount of net operating 
loss is to be reduced by the taxable income or net income, as the case 
may be (computed as provided in Sec. 1.172-5, or 26 CFR (1939) 39.122-
4(c) (Regulations 118), as the case may be and, in the case of any 
taxable year which falls within the provisions of section 270, 
determined after the application of section 270), of any taxable year 
preceding or succeeding the taxable year of the net operating loss to 
which such loss must first be carried back or carried over under the 
provisions of section 172(b), or the corresponding provisions of prior 
revenue laws, even though the net operating loss deduction is not an 
allowable deduction for such preceding or succeeding taxable year.
    (4) If an individual carries on several trades or businesses, the 
deductions attributable to such trades or businesses and the gross 
income derived therefrom shall not be aggregated in determining whether 
the deductions (other than the specially treated deductions) exceed the 
gross income derived from such trades or businesses by more than $50,000 
in any taxable year. For the purposes of section 270, each trade or 
business shall be considered separately. However, where a particular 
business of an individual is conducted in one or more forms such as a 
partnership, joint venture, or individual proprietorship,

[[Page 517]]

the individual's share of the profits and losses from each business unit 
must be aggregated to determine the applicability of section 270. See 
paragraphs (a)(8)(ii) and (b) of Sec. 1.702-1, relating to applicability 
of section 270 to a partner. Where it is established that for tax 
purposes a husband and wife are partners in the same trade or business 
or that each is participating independently of the other in the same 
trade or business with his and her own money, the husband's gross income 
and deductions from that trade or business shall be considered 
separately from the wife's gross income and deductions from that trade 
or business even though they file a joint return. Where a taxpayer is 
engaged in a trade or business in a community property State under 
circumstances such that the income therefrom is considered to be 
community income, the taxpayer and his spouse are treated for purposes 
of section 270 as two individuals engaged separately in the same trade 
or business and the gross income and deductions attributable to the 
trade or business are allocated one-half to the taxpayer and one-half to 
the spouse. Where several business activities emanate from a single 
commodity, such as oil or gas or a tract of land, it does not 
necessarily follow that such activities are one business for the 
purposes of section 270. However, in order to be treated separately, it 
must be established that such business activities are actually conducted 
separately and are not closely interrelated with each other. For the 
purposes of section 270, the trade or business carried on by an 
individual must be the same in each of the five consecutive years in 
which the deductions (other than the specially treated deductions) 
exceed the gross income derived from such trade or business by more than 
$50,000.
    (5) For the purposes of section 270, a taxable year may be part of 
two or more periods of five consecutive taxable years. Thus, if the 
deductions (other than the specially treated deductions) attributable to 
a trade or business carried on by an individual exceed the gross income 
therefrom by more than $50,000 for each of six consecutive taxable 
years, the fifth year of such six consecutive taxable years shall be 
considered to be a part both of a five-year period beginning with the 
first and ending with the fifth taxable year and of a five-year period 
beginning with the second and ending with the sixth taxable year.
    (6) For the purposes of section 270, a short taxable year required 
to effect a change in accounting period constitutes a taxable year. In 
determining the applicability of section 270 in the case of a short 
taxable year, items of income and deduction are not annualized.
    (b) Specially treated deductions. (1) For the purposes of section 
270 and paragraph (a) of this section, the specially treated deductions 
are:
    (i) Taxes,
    (ii) Interest,
    (iii) Casualty and abandonment losses connected with a trade or 
business deductible under section 165(c)(1) or the corresponding 
provisions of prior revenue laws,
    (iv) Losses and expenses of the trade or business of farming which 
are directly attributable to drought,
    (v) The net operating loss deduction allowed by section 172, or the 
corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, and
    (vi) Expenditures as to which a taxpayer is given the option, under 
law or regulations, either (a) to deduct as expenses when incurred, or 
(b) to defer or capitalize.
    (2) For the purpose of subparagraph (1)(iv) of this paragraph, an 
individual is engaged in the ``trade or business of farming'' if he 
cultivates, operates, or manages a farm for gain or profit, either as 
owner or tenant. An individual who receives a rental (either in cash or 
in kind) which is based upon farm production is engaged in the trade or 
business of farming. However, an individual who receives a fixed rental 
(without reference to production) is engaged in the trade or business of 
farming only if he participates to a material extent in the operation or 
management of the farm. An individual engaged in forestry or the growing 
of timber is not thereby engaged in the trade or business of farming. An 
individual cultivating or operating a farm for recreation or

[[Page 518]]

pleasure rather than a profit is not engaged in the trade or business of 
farming. The term farm is used in its ordinarily accepted sense and 
includes stock, dairy, poultry, fruit, crop, and truck farms, and also 
plantations, ranches, ranges, and orchards. An individual is engaged in 
the trade or business of farming if he is a member of a partnership 
engaged in the trade or business of farming.
    (3) In order for losses and expenses of the trade or business of 
farming to qualify as specially treated deductions under subparagraph 
(1)(iv) of this paragraph such losses and expenses must be directly 
attributable to drought conditions and not to other causes such as 
faulty management or unfavorable market conditions. In general, the 
following are the types of losses and expenses which, if otherwise 
deductible, may qualify as specially treated deductions under 
subparagraph (1)(iv) of this paragraph:
    (i) Losses for damages to or destruction of property as a result of 
drought conditions, if such property is used in the trade or business of 
farming or is purchased for resale in the trade or business of farming;
    (ii) Expenses directly related to raising crops or livestock which 
are destroyed or damaged by drought. Included in this category are, for 
example, payments for labor, fertilizer, and feed used in raising such 
crops or livestock. If such crops or livestock to which the expenditures 
relate are only partially destroyed or damaged by drought then only a 
proportionate part of the expenditures is regarded as specially treated 
deductions; and
    (iii) Expenses which would not have been incurred in the absence of 
drought conditions, such as expenses for procuring pasture or additional 
supplies of water or feed.
    (4) The expenditures referred to in subparagraph (1)(vi) of this 
paragraph include, but are not limited to, intangible drilling and 
development costs in the case of oil and gas wells as provided in 
section 263(c) and the regulations thereunder, and expenditures for the 
development of a mine or other natural deposit (other than an oil or gas 
well) as provided in section 616 and the regulations thereunder.
    (5) The provisions of section 270(b) do not operate to make an 
expenditure a deductible item if it is not otherwise deductible under 
the law applicable to the particular year in which it was incurred. 
Thus, for example, if it is necessary, pursuant to the provisions of 
section 270, to recompute the taxable or net income of an individual for 
the taxable years 1950 through 1954, the individual in making the 
recomputation may not deduct expenditures paid or incurred in the years 
1950 through 1953 which must be capitalized under the law applicable to 
those years, even though the expenditures are deductible under the Code.
    (c) Applicability to taxable years otherwise subject to the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1939. The net income of a taxable year otherwise subject 
to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be recomputed pursuant to 
section 270 if (i) such taxable year is included in a period of five 
consecutive taxable years which includes at least one taxable year 
beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, and 
(ii) the deductions (other than the specially treated deductions 
specified in section 270(b)) for each taxable year in such five-year 
period exceed the $50,000 limitation specified in section 270. As 
described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, a taxable year may be 
part of two or more periods of five consecutive taxable years, one 
meeting the requirements for recomputation pursuant to section 130 of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and the other meeting the requirements 
for recomputation pursuant to section 270 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1954, then the recomputation for such taxable year shall be made 
pursuant to section 270. For example, if a calendar year taxpayer 
sustains a loss from a trade or business for each of the years 1949 
through 1954, the years 1950, 1951, 1952, and 1953 may be a part of two 
such periods of five consecutive taxable years. If, however, a taxable 
year is part of a period of five consecutive taxable years which meets 
the requirements for recomputation pursuant to section 130 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1939, but is not part of a period which meets 
the requirements for recomputation, pursuant to section

[[Page 519]]

270, then a recomputation of net income for such taxable year must be 
made pursuant to section 130.
    (d) Redetermination of tax. The tax imposed by Chapter 1 of the 
Code, or by the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, for each 
of the five consecutive taxable years specified in paragraph (a) of this 
section shall be redetermined upon the basis of the taxable income or 
net income of the individual, as the case may be, recomputed in the 
manner described in paragraph (a) of this section. If the assessment of 
a deficiency is prevented (except for the provisions of Part II (section 
1311 and following), Subchapter Q, Chapter 1 of the Code, relating to 
the effect of limitations and other provisions in income tax cases) by 
the operation of any provision of law (e.g., sections 6501 and 6502, or 
the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, relating to the 
period of limitations upon assessment and collection) except section 
7122, or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, relating to 
compromises, or by any rule of law (e.g., res judicata), then the excess 
of the tax for such year as recomputed over the tax previously 
determined for such year shall be considered a deficiency for the 
purposes of section 270. The term tax previously determined shall have 
the same meaning as that assigned to such term by section 1314(a). See 
Sec. 1.1314 (a)-1.
    (e) Assessment of tax. Any amount determined as a deficiency in the 
manner described in paragraph (d) of this section in respect of any 
taxable year of the five consecutive taxable years specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section may be assessed and collected as if on the 
date of the expiration of the period of limitation for the assessment of 
a deficiency for the fifth taxable year of such five consecutive taxable 
years, one year remained before the expiration of the period of 
limitation upon assessment for the taxable year in respect of which the 
deficiency is determined. If the taxable year is one in respect of which 
an assessment could be made without regard to section 270, the amount of 
the actual deficiency as defined in section 6211(a) (whether it is 
greater than, equal to, or less than the deficiency determined under 
section 270(c)) shall be assessed and collected. However, if the 
assessment of a deficiency for such taxable year would be prevented by 
any provision of law (e.g., the period of limitation upon the assessment 
of tax) except section 7122, or the corresponding provision of prior 
revenue laws, relating to compromises, or by the operation of any rule 
of law (e.g., res judicata), then the excess of the tax recomputed as 
described in paragraph (d) of this section over the tax previously 
determined may be assessed and collected even though in fact there is no 
actual deficiency, as defined in section 6211(a), in respect of the 
given taxable year.
    (f) Effective date; cross reference. The provisions of section 270 
and this section apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 
1970. Thus, for instance, if the taxpayer had a profit of $2,000 
attributable to a trade or business in 1965, section 270 and this 
section would not apply to the taxable years 1966 through 1970, even 
though he had losses of more than $50,000 in each of the 5 years ending 
with 1970. For provisions relating to activities not engaged in for 
profit applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, 
see section 183 and the regulations thereunder.

Sec. 1.271-1   Debts owed by political parties.

    (a) General rule. In the case of a taxpayer other than a bank (as 
defined in section 581 and the regulations thereunder), no deduction 
shall be allowed under section 166 (relating to bad debts) or section 
165(g) (relating to worthlessness of securities) by reason of the 
worthlessness of any debt, regardless of how it arose, owed by a 
political party. For example, it is immaterial that the debt may have 
arisen as a result of services rendered or goods sold or that the 
taxpayer included the amount of the debt in income. In the case of a 
bank, no deduction shall be allowed unless, under the facts and 
circumstances, it appears that the bad debt was incurred to or purchased 
by, or the worthless security was acquired by, the taxpayer in 
accordance with its

[[Page 520]]

usual commercial practices. Thus, if a bank makes a loan to a political 
party not in accordance with its usual commercial practices but solely 
because the president of the bank has been active in the party no bad 
debt deduction will be allowed with respect to the loan.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Political party. For purposes of this section 
and Sec. 1.276-1, the term political party means a political party (as 
commonly understood), a National, State, or local committee thereof, or 
any committee, association, or organization, whether incorporated or 
not, which accepts contributions (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph) or makes expenditures (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph) for the purpose of influencing or attempting to influence the 
election of presidential or vice-presidential electors, or the 
selection, nomination, or election of any individual to any Federal, 
State, or local elective public office, whether or not such individual 
or electors are selected, nominated, or elected. Accordingly, a 
political party includes a committee or other group which accepts 
contributions or makes expenditures for the purpose of promoting the 
nomination of an individual for an elective public office in a primary 
election, or in any convention, meeting, or caucus of a political party. 
It is immaterial whether the contributions or expenditures are accepted 
or made directly or indirectly. Thus, for example, a committee or other 
group, is considered to be a political party, if, although it does not 
expend any funds, it turns funds over to another organization, which 
does expend funds for the purpose of attempting to influence the 
nomination of an individual for an elective public office. An 
organization which engages in activities which are truly nonpartisan in 
nature will not be considered a political party merely because it 
conducts activities with respect to an election campaign if, under all 
the facts and circumstances, it is clear that its efforts are not 
directed to the election of the candidates of any particular party or 
parties or to the selection, nomination or election of any particular 
candidate. For example, a committee or group will not be treated as a 
political party if it is organized merely to inform the electorate as to 
the identity and experience of all candidates involved, to present on a 
nonpreferential basis the issues or views of the parties or candidates 
as described by the parties or candidates, or to provide a forum in 
which the candidates are freely invited on a nonpreferential basis to 
discuss or debate the issues.
    (2) Contributions. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.276-1, 
the term contributions includes a gift, subscription, loan, advance, or 
deposit, of money or anything of value, and includes a contract, 
promise, or agreement to make a contribution, whether or not legally 
enforceable.
    (3) Expenditures. For purposes of this section and Sec. 1.276-1, the 
term expenditures includes a payment, distribution, loan, advance, 
deposit, or gift, of money or anything of value, and includes a 
contract, promise, or agreement to make an expenditure, whether or not 
legally enforceable.

Sec. 1.272-1   Expenditures relating to disposal of coal or domestic iron ore.

    (a) Introduction. Section 272 provides special treatment for certain 
expenditures paid or incurred by a taxpayer in connection with a 
contract (hereafter sometimes referred to as a ``coal royalty contract'' 
or ``iron ore royalty contract'') for the disposal of coal or iron ore 
the gain or loss from which is treated under section 631(c) as a section 
1231 gain or loss on the sale of coal or iron ore. See paragraph (e) of 
Sec. 1.631-3 for special rules relating to iron ore. The expenditures 
covered by section 272 are those which are attributable to the making 
and administering of such a contract or to the preservation of the 
economic interest retained under the contract. For examples of such 
expenditures, see paragraph (d) of this section. For a taxable year in 
which gross royalty income is realized under the contract of disposal, 
such expenditures shall not be allowed as a deduction. Instead, they are 
to be added to the adjusted depletion basis of the coal or iron ore 
disposed of in the taxable year in computing gain or loss under section 
631(c). However, where no gross royalty income is realized under the 
contract of disposal in a particular taxable year,

[[Page 521]]

such expenditure shall be treated without regard to section 272.
    (b) In general. (1) Where the disposal of coal or iron ore is 
covered by section 631(c), the provisions of section 272 and this 
section shall be applicable for a taxable year in which there is income 
under the contract of disposal. (For purposes of section 272 and this 
section, the term income means gross amounts received or accrued which 
are royalties or bonuses in connection with a contract to which section 
631(c) applies.) All expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer 
during the taxable year which are attributable to the making and 
administering of the contract disposing of the coal or iron ore and all 
expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year in order to 
preserve the owner's economic interest retained under the contract shall 
be disallowed as deductions in computing taxable income for the taxable 
year. The sum of such expenditures and the adjusted depletion basis of 
the coal or iron ore disposed of in the taxable year shall be used in 
determining the amount of gain or loss with respect to the disposal. See 
Sec. 1.631-3. For special rule in case of loss, see paragraph (c) of 
this section. Section 272 and this section do not apply to capital 
expenditures, and such expenditures are not taken into account in 
computing gain or loss under section 631(c) except to the extent they 
are properly part of the depletable basis of the coal or iron ore.
    (2) The expenditures covered under section 272 and this section are 
disallowed as a deduction only with respect to a taxable year in which 
income is realized under the coal royalty contract (or iron ore royalty 
contract) to which such expenditures are attributable. Where no income 
is realized under the contract in a taxable year, these expenditures 
shall be deducted as expenses for the production of income, or as a 
business expense, or they may be treated under section 266 (relating to 
taxes and carrying charges) if applicable.
    (3) The provisions of section 272 and this section apply to a 
taxable year in which income from the disposal by the owner of coal or 
iron ore held by him for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years 
beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) is 
subject to the provisions of section 631(c) even though the actual 
mining of coal or iron ore under the coal royalty contract (or iron ore 
royalty contract) does not take place during the taxable year. Where the 
right under the contract to mine coal or iron ore for which advance 
payment has been made expires, terminates, or is abandoned before the 
coal or iron ore is mined, and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.631-3 requires 
the owner to recompute his tax with respect to such payment, the 
recomputation must be made without applying the provisions of section 
272 and this section.
    (c) Losses. If, in any taxable year, the expenditures referred to in 
section 272 and this section plus the adjusted depletion basis (as 
defined in paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.631-3) of the coal or iron ore 
disposed of during the taxable year exceed the amount realized under the 
contract which is subject to section 631(c) during the taxable year, 
such excess shall be considered under section 1231 as a loss from the 
sale of property used in the trade or business and, to the extent not 
availed of as a reduction of gain under that section, shall be a loss 
deductible under section 165(a) (relating to the deduction of losses 
generally).
    (d) Examples of expenditures. (1) The expenditures referred to in 
section 272 include, but are not limited to, the following items, if 
such items are attributable to the making or administering of the 
contract or preserving the economic interest therein: Ad valorem taxes 
imposed by State or local authorities, costs of fire protection, costs 
of insurance (other than liability insurance), costs incurred in 
administering the contract (including costs of bookkeeping and technical 
supervision), interest on loans, expenses of flood control, legal and 
technical expenses, and expenses of measuring and checking quantities of 
coal or iron ore disposed of under the contract. Whether the interest on 
loans is attributable to the making or administering of the contract or 
preserving the economic interest therein will depend upon the use to 
which the borrowed monies are put.
    (2) Any expenditure referred to in this section which is applicable 
to

[[Page 522]]

more than one coal royalty contract or iron ore royalty contract shall 
be reasonably apportioned to each of such contracts. Furthermore, if an 
expenditure applies only in part to the making or administering of the 
contract or the preservation of the economic interest, then only such 
part shall be treated under section 272. The apportionment of the 
expenditure shall be made on a reasonable basis. For example, where a 
taxpayer has other income (such as income from oil or gas royalties, 
rentals, right of way fees, interest, or dividends) as well as income 
under section 631(c), and where the salaries of some of its employees or 
other expenses relate to both classes of income, such expenses shall be 
allocated reasonably between the income subject to section 631(c) and 
the other income. Where a taxpayer has more than one coal royalty 
contract or iron ore royalty contract, expenditures under this section 
relating to a contract from which no income has been received in the 
taxable year may not be allocated to income from another contract from 
which income has been received in the taxable year.
    (3) The taxpayer may have expenses which are not attributable even 
partly to making and administering a coal royalty contract or iron ore 
royalty contract or to the preservation of the economic interest 
retained under the contract and, accordingly, are not included in the 
expenditures described in section 272. These include such items as ad 
valorem taxes imposed by State or local authorities on property not 
covered by the contract, salaries, wages, or other expenses entirely 
incident to the ownership and protection of such property and 
depreciation of improvements thereon, fire insurance on such property, 
charitable contributions, and similar expenses unrelated to the making 
or to the administering of coal royalty contracts or iron ore royalty 
contracts or preserving the taxpayer's economic interest retained 
therein.
    (e) Nonapplication of section. For purposes of section 543, the 
provisions of section 272 shall have no application. For example, the 
taxpayer may, for the purposes of section 543(a)(3)(C) or the 
corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws, include in the sum of 
the deductions which are allowable under section 162 an amount paid to 
an attorney as compensation for legal services rendered in connection 
with the making of a coal royalty contract or iron ore royalty contract 
(assuming the expenditure otherwise qualifies under section 162 as an 
ordinary and necessary expense incurred in the taxpayer's trade or 
business), even though such expenditure is disallowed as a deduction 
under section 272.

Sec. 1.273-1   Life or terminable interests.

    Amounts paid as income to the holder of a life or a terminable 
interest acquired by gift, bequest, or inheritance shall not be subject 
to any deduction for shrinkage (whether called by depreciation or any 
other name) in the value of such interest due to the lapse of time. In 
other words, the holder of such an interest so acquired may not set up 
the value of the expected future payments as corpus or principal and 
claim deduction for shrinkage or exhaustion thereof due to the passage 
of time. For the treatment generally of distributions to beneficiaries 
of an estate or trust, see Subparts A, B, C, and D (section 641 and 
following), Subchapter J, Chapter 1 of the Code, and the regulations 
thereunder. For basis of property acquired from a decedent and by gifts 
and transfers in trust, see sections 1014 and 1015, and the regulations 
thereunder.

Sec. 1.274-1   Disallowance of certain entertainment, gift and travel expenses.

    Section 274 disallows in whole, or in part, certain expenditures for 
entertainment, gifts and travel which would otherwise be allowable under 
Chapter 1 of the Code. The requirements imposed by section 274 are in 
addition to the requirements for deductibility imposed by other 
provisions of the Code. If a deduction is claimed for an expenditure for 
entertainment, gifts, or travel, the taxpayer must first establish that 
it is otherwise allowable as a deduction under Chapter 1 of the Code 
before the

[[Page 523]]

provisions of section 274 become applicable. An expenditure for 
entertainment, to the extent it is lavish or extravagant, shall not be 
allowable as a deduction. The taxpayer should then substantiate such an 
expenditure in accordance with the rules under section 274(d). See 
Sec. 1.274-5. Section 274 is a disallowance provision exclusively, and 
does not make deductible any expense which is disallowed under any other 
provision of the Code. Similarly, section 274 does not affect the 
includability of an item in, or the excludability of an item from, the 
gross income of any taxpayer. For specific provisions with respect to 
the deductibility of expenditures: for an activity of a type generally 
considered to constitute entertainment, amusement, or recreation, and 
for a facility used in connection with such an activity, as well as 
certain travel expenses of a spouse, etc., see Sec. 1.274-2; for 
expenses for gifts, see Sec. 1.274-3; for expenses for foreign travel, 
see Sec. 1.274-4; for expenditures deductible without regard to business 
activity, see Sec. 1.274-6; and for treatment of personal portion of 
entertainment facility, see Sec. 1.274-7.

<R05>
Sec. 1.274-2  Disallowance of deductions for certain expenses for entertainment, amusement, recreation, or travel.

    (a) General rules--(1) Entertainment activity. Except as provided in 
this section, no deduction otherwise allowable under Chapter 1 of the 
Code shall be allowed for any expenditure with respect to entertainment 
unless the taxpayer establishes:
    (i) That the expenditure was directly related to the active conduct 
of the taxpayer's trade or business, or
    (ii) In the case of an expenditure directly preceding or following a 
substantial and bona fide business discussion (including business 
meetings at a convention or otherwise), that the expenditure was 
associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business.

Such deduction shall not exceed the portion of the expenditure directly 
related to (or in the case of an expenditure described in subdivision 
(ii) of this subparagraph, the portion of the expenditure associated 
with) the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business.
    (2) Entertainment facilities--(i) Expenditures paid or incurred 
after December 31, 1978, and not with respect to a club. Except as 
provided in this section with respect to a club, no deduction otherwise 
allowable under chapter 1 of the Code shall be allowed for any 
expenditure paid or incurred after December 31, 1978, with respect to a 
facility used in connection with entertainment.
    (ii) Expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with 
respect to entertainment facilities, or paid or incurred before January 
1, 1994, with respect to clubs--(a) Requirements for deduction. Except 
as provided in this section, no deduction otherwise allowable under 
chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be allowed for any 
expenditure paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with respect to a 
facility used in connection with entertainment, or for any expenditure 
paid or incurred before January 1, 1994, with respect to a club used in 
connection with entertainment, unless the taxpayer establishes--
    (1) That the facility or club was used primarily for the furtherance 
of the taxpayer's trade or business; and
    (2) That the expenditure was directly related to the active conduct 
of that trade or business.
    (b) Amount of deduction. The deduction allowable under paragraph 
(a)(2)(ii)(a) of this section shall not exceed the portion of the 
expenditure directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's 
trade or business.
    (iii) Expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1993, with 
respect to a club--(a) In general. No deduction otherwise allowable 
under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code shall be allowed for 
amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 1993, for membership in any 
club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social 
purpose. The purposes and activities of a club, and not its name, 
determine whether it is organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or 
other social purpose. Clubs organized for business, pleasure, 
recreation, or other social purpose include any membership organization 
if a principal

[[Page 524]]

purpose of the organization is to conduct entertainment activities for 
members of the organization or their guests or to provide members or 
their guests with access to entertainment facilities within the meaning 
of paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Clubs organized for business, 
pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose include, but are not 
limited to, country clubs, golf and athletic clubs, airline clubs, hotel 
clubs, and clubs operated to provide meals under circumstances generally 
considered to be conducive to business discussion.
    (b) Exceptions. Unless a principal purpose of the organization is to 
conduct entertainment activities for members or their guests or to 
provide members or their guests with access to entertainment facilities, 
business leagues, trade associations, chambers of commerce, boards of 
trade, real estate boards, professional organizations (such as bar 
associations and medical associations), and civic or public service 
organizations will not be treated as clubs organized for business, 
pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose.
    (3) Cross references. For definition of the term entertainment, see 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For the disallowance of deductions for 
the cost of admission to a dinner or program any part of the proceeds of 
which inures to the use of a political party or political candidate, and 
cost of admission to an inaugural event or similar event identified with 
any political party or political candidate, see Sec. 1.276-1. For rules 
and definitions with respect to:
    (i) ``Directly related entertainment'', see paragraph (c) of this 
section,
    (ii) ``Associated entertainment'', see paragraph (d) of this 
section,
    (iii) ``Expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with 
respect to entertainment facilities or before January 1, 1994, with 
respect to clubs'', see paragraph (e) of this section, and
    (iv) ``Specific exceptions'' to the disallowance rules of this 
section, see paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Definitions--(1) Entertainment defined--(i) In general. For 
purposes of this section, the term entertainment means any activity 
which is of a type generally considered to constitute entertainment, 
amusement, or recreation, such as entertaining at night clubs, cocktail 
lounges, theaters, country clubs, golf and athletic clubs, sporting 
events, and on hunting, fishing, vacation and similar trips, including 
such activity relating solely to the taxpayer or the taxpayer's family. 
The term entertainment may include an activity, the cost of which is 
claimed as a business expense by the taxpayer, which satisfies the 
personal, living, or family needs of any individual, such as providing 
food and beverages, a hotel suite, or an automobile to a business 
customer or his family. The term entertainment does not include 
activities which, although satisfying personal, living, or family needs 
of an individual, are clearly not regarded as constituting 
entertainment, such as (a) supper money provided by an employer to his 
employee working overtime, (b) a hotel room maintained by an employer 
for lodging of his employees while in business travel status, or (c) an 
automobile used in the active conduct of trade or business even though 
used for routine personal purposes such as commuting to and from work. 
On the other hand, the providing of a hotel room or an automobile by an 
employer to his employee who is on vacation would constitute 
entertainment of the employee.
    (ii) Objective test. An objective test shall be used to determine 
whether an activity is of a type generally considered to constitute 
entertainment. Thus, if an activity is generally considered to be 
entertainment, it will constitute entertainment for purposes of this 
section and section 274(a) regardless of whether the expenditure can 
also be described otherwise, and even though the expenditure relates to 
the taxpayer alone. This objective test precludes arguments such as that 
entertainment means only entertainment of others or that an expenditure 
for entertainment should be characterized as an expenditure for 
advertising or public relations. However, in applying this test the 
taxpayer's trade or business shall be considered. Thus, although 
attending a theatrical performance would generally be considered 
entertainment, it would not be so considered in the case of a 
professional theater critic, attending in his professional capacity. 
Similarly, if a manufacturer of

[[Page 525]]

dresses conducts a fashion show to introduce his products to a group of 
store buyers, the show would not be generally considered to constitute 
entertainment. However, if an appliance distributor conducts a fashion 
show for the wives of his retailers, the fashion show would be generally 
considered to constitute entertainment.
    (iii) Special definitional rules--(a) In general. Except as 
otherwise provided in (b) or (c) of this subdivision, any expenditure 
which might generally be considered either for a gift or entertainment, 
or considered either for travel or entertainment, shall be considered an 
expenditure for entertainment rather than for a gift or travel.
    (b) Expenditures deemed gifts. An expenditure described in (a) of 
this subdivision shall be deemed for a gift to which this section does 
not apply if it is:
    (1) An expenditure for packaged food or beverages transferred 
directly or indirectly to another person intended for consumption at a 
later time.
    (2) An expenditure for tickets of admission to a place of 
entertainment transferred to another person if the taxpayer does not 
accompany the recipient to the entertainment unless the taxpayer treats 
the expenditure as entertainment. The taxpayer may change his treatment 
of such an expenditure as either a gift or entertainment at any time 
within the period prescribed for assessment of tax as provided in 
section 6501 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
    (3) Such other specific classes of expenditure generally considered 
to be for a gift as the Commissioner, in his discretion, may prescribe.
    (c) Expenditures deemed travel. An expenditure described in (a) of 
this subdivision shall be deemed for travel to which this section does 
not apply if it is:
    (1) With respect to a transportation type facility (such as an 
automobile or an airplane), even though used on other occasions in 
connection with an activity of a type generally considered to constitute 
entertainment, to the extent the facility is used in pursuit of a trade 
or business for purposes of transportation not in connection with 
entertainment. See also paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(b) of this section for 
provisions covering nonentertainment expenditures with respect to such 
facilities.
    (2) Such other specific classes of expenditure generally considered 
to be for travel as the Commissioner, in his discretion, may prescribe.
    (2) Other definitions--(i) Expenditure. The term expenditure as used 
in this section shall include expenses paid or incurred for goods, 
services, facilities, and items (including items such as losses and 
depreciation).
    (ii) Expenses for production of income. For purposes of this 
section, any reference to trade or business shall include any activity 
described in section 212.
    (iii) Business associate. The term business associate as used in 
this section means a person with whom the taxpayer could reasonably 
expect to engage or deal in the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade 
or business such as the taxpayer's customer, client, supplier, employee, 
agent, partner, or professional adviser, whether established or 
prospective.
    (c) Directly related entertainment--(1) In general. Except as 
otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section (relating to 
associated entertainment) or under paragraph (f) of this section 
(relating to business meals and other specific exceptions), no deduction 
shall be allowed for any expenditure for entertainment unless the 
taxpayer establishes that the expenditure was directly related to the 
active conduct of his trade or business within the meaning of this 
paragraph.
    (2) Directly related entertainment defined. Any expenditure for 
entertainment, if it is otherwise allowable as a deduction under chapter 
1 of the Code, shall be considered directly related to the active 
conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business if it meets the requirements 
of any one of subparagraphs (3), (4), (5), or (6) of this paragraph.
    (3) Directly related in general. Except as provided in subparagraph 
(7) of this paragraph, an expenditure for entertainment shall be 
considered directly related to the active conduct of the

[[Page 526]]

taxpayer's trade or business if it is established that it meets all of 
the requirements of subdivisions (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this 
subparagraph.
    (i) At the time the taxpayer made the entertainment expenditure (or 
committed himself to make the expenditure), the taxpayer had more than a 
general expectation of deriving some income or other specific trade or 
business benefit (other than the goodwill of the person or persons 
entertained) at some indefinite future time from the making of the 
expenditure. A taxpayer, however, shall not be required to show that 
income or other business benefit actually resulted from each and every 
expenditure for which a deduction is claimed.
    (ii) During the entertainment period to which the expenditure 
related, the taxpayer actively engaged in a business meeting, 
negotiation, discussion, or other bona fide business transaction, other 
than entertainment, for the purpose of obtaining such income or other 
specific trade or business benefit (or, at the time the taxpayer made 
the expenditure or committed himself to the expenditure, it was 
reasonable for the taxpayer to expect that he would have done so, 
although such was not the case solely for reasons beyond the taxpayer's 
control).
    (iii) In light of all the facts and circumstances of the case, the 
principal character or aspect of the combined business and entertainment 
to which the expenditure related was the active conduct of the 
taxpayer's trade or business (or at the time the taxpayer made the 
expenditure or committed himself to the expenditure, it was reasonable 
for the taxpayer to expect that the active conduct of trade or business 
would have been the principal character or aspect of the entertainment, 
although such was not the case solely for reasons beyond the taxpayer's 
control). It is not necessary that more time be devoted to business than 
to entertainment to meet this requirement. The active conduct of trade 
or business is considered not to be the principal character or aspect of 
combined business and entertainment activity on hunting or fishing trips 
or on yachts and other pleasure boats unless the taxpayer clearly 
establishes to the contrary.
    (iv) The expenditure was allocable to the taxpayer and a person or 
persons with whom the taxpayer engaged in the active conduct of trade or 
business during the entertainment or with whom the taxpayer establishes 
he would have engaged in such active conduct of trade or business if it 
were not for circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control. For 
expenditures closely connected with directly related entertainment, see 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (4) Expenditures in clear business setting. An expenditure for 
entertainment shall be considered directly related to the active conduct 
of the taxpayer's trade or business if it is established that the 
expenditure was for entertainment occurring in a clear business setting 
directly in furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business. Generally, 
entertainment shall not be considered to have occurred in a clear 
business setting unless the taxpayer clearly establishes that any 
recipient of the entertainment would have reasonably known that the 
taxpayer had no significant motive, in incurring the expenditure, other 
than directly furthering his trade or business. Objective rather than 
subjective standards will be determinative. Thus, entertainment which 
occurred under any circumstances described in subparagraph (7)(ii) of 
this paragraph ordinarily will not be considered as occurring in a clear 
business setting. Such entertainment will generally be considered to be 
socially rather than commercially motivated. Expenditures made for the 
furtherance of a taxpayer's trade or business in providing a 
``hospitality room'' at a convention (described in paragraph 
(d)(3)(i)(b) of this section) at which goodwill is created through 
display or discussion of the taxpayer's products, will, however, be 
treated as directly related. In addition, entertainment of a clear 
business nature which occurred under circumstances where there was no 
meaningful personal or social relationship between the taxpayer and the 
recipients of the entertainment may be considered to have occurred in a 
clear business setting. For example, entertainment of business 
representatives and civic leaders at the opening of a new hotel or 
theatrical production,

[[Page 527]]

where the clear purpose of the taxpayer is to obtain business publicity 
rather than to create or maintain the goodwill of the recipients of the 
entertainment, would generally be considered to be in a clear business 
setting. Also, entertainment which has the principal effect of a price 
rebate in connection with the sale of the taxpayer's products generally 
will be considered to have occurred in a clear business setting. Such 
would be the case, for example, if a taxpayer owning a hotel were to 
provide occasional free dinners at the hotel for a customer who 
patronized the hotel.
    (5) Expenditures for services performed. An expenditure shall be 
considered directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's 
trade or business if it is established that the expenditure was made 
directly or indirectly by the taxpayer for the benefit of an individual 
(other than an employee), and if such expenditure was in the nature of 
compensation for services rendered or was paid as a prize or award which 
is required to be included in gross income under section 74 and the 
regulations thereunder. For example, if a manufacturer of products 
provides a vacation trip for retailers of his products who exceed sales 
quotas as a prize or award which is includible in gross income, the 
expenditure will be considered directly related to the active conduct of 
the taxpayer's trade or business.
    (6) Club dues, etc., allocable to business meals. An expenditure 
shall be considered directly related to the active conduct of the 
taxpayer's trade or business if it is established that the expenditure 
was with respect to a facility (as described in paragraph (e) of this 
section) used by the taxpayer for the furnishing of food or beverages 
under circumstances described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section 
(relating to business meals and similar expenditures), to the extent 
allocable to the furnishing of such food or beverages. This paragraph 
(c)(6) applies to club dues paid or incurred before January 1, 1987.
    (7) Expenditures generally considered not directly related. 
Expenditures for entertainment, even if connected with the taxpayer's 
trade or business, will generally be considered not directly related to 
the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business, if the 
entertainment occurred under circumstances where there was little or no 
possibility of engaging in the active conduct of trade or business. The 
following circumstances will generally be considered circumstances where 
there was little or no possibility of engaging in the active conduct of 
a trade or business:
    (i) The taxpayer was not present;
    (ii) The distractions were substantial, such as:
    (a) A meeting or discussion at night clubs, theaters, and sporting 
events, or during essentially social gatherings such as cocktail 
parties, or
    (b) A meeting or discussion, if the taxpayer meets with a group 
which includes persons other than business associates, at places such as 
cocktail lounges, country clubs, golf and athletic clubs, or at vacation 
resorts.

An expenditure for entertainment in any such case is considered not to 
be directly related to the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or 
business unless the taxpayer clearly establishes to the contrary.
    (d) Associated entertainment--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (f) of this section (relating to business meals and other 
specific exceptions) and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph (relating to 
expenditures closely connected with directly related entertainment), any 
expenditure for entertainment which is not directly related to the 
active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business will not be allowable 
as a deduction unless:
    (i) It was associated with the active conduct of trade or business 
as defined in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, and
    (ii) The entertainment directly preceded or followed a substantial 
and bona fide business discussion as defined in subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph.
    (2) Associated entertainment defined. Generally, any expenditure for 
entertainment, if it is otherwise allowable under Chapter 1 of the Code, 
shall be considered associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's 
trade or business if the taxpayer establishes that he had a clear 
business purpose in making the expenditure, such as to obtain new

[[Page 528]]

business or to encourage the continuation of an existing business 
relationship. However, any portion of an expenditure allocable to a 
person who was not closely connected with a person who engaged in the 
substantial and bona fide business discussion (as defined in 
subparagraph (3)(i) of this paragraph) shall not be considered 
associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business. 
The portion of an expenditure allocable to the spouse of a person who 
engaged in the discussion will, if it is otherwise allowable under 
chapter 1 of the Code, be considered associated with the active conduct 
of the taxpayer's trade or business.
    (3) Directly preceding or following a substantial and bona fide 
business discussion defined--(i) Substantial and bona fide business 
discussion--(a) In general. Whether any meeting, negotiation or 
discussion constitutes a ``substantial and bona fide business 
discussion'' within the meaning of this section depends upon the facts 
and circumstances of each case. It must be established, however, that 
the taxpayer actively engaged in a business meeting, negotiation, 
discussion, or other bona fide business transaction, other than 
entertainment, for the purpose of obtaining income or other specific 
trade or business benefit. In addition, it must be established that such 
a business meeting, negotiation, discussion, or transaction was 
substantial in relation to the entertainment. This requirement will be 
satisfied if the principal character or aspect of the combined 
entertainment and business activity was the active conduct of business. 
However, it is not necessary that more time be devoted to business than 
to entertainment to meet this requirement.
    (b) Meetings at conventions, etc. Any meeting officially scheduled 
in connection with a program at a convention or similar general 
assembly, or at a bona fide trade or business meeting sponsored and 
conducted by business or professional organizations, shall be considered 
to constitute a substantial and bona fide business discussion within the 
meaning of this section provided:
    (1) Expenses necessary to taxpayer's attendance. The expenses 
necessary to the attendance of the taxpayer at the convention, general 
assembly, or trade or business meeting, were ordinary and necessary 
within the meaning of section 162 or 212;
    (2) Convention program. The organization which sponsored the 
convention, or trade or business meeting had scheduled a program of 
business activities (including committee meetings or presentation of 
lectures, panel discussions, display of products, or other similar 
activities), and that such program was the principal activity of the 
convention, general assembly, or trade or business meeting.
    (ii) Directly preceding or following. Entertainment which occurs on 
the same day as a substantial and bona fide business discussion (as 
defined in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph) will be considered to 
directly precede or follow such discussion. If the entertainment and the 
business discussion do not occur on the same day, the facts and 
circumstances of each case are to be considered, including the place, 
date and duration of the business discussion, whether the taxpayer or 
his business associates are from out of town, and, if so, the date of 
arrival and departure, and the reasons the entertainment did not take 
place on the day of the business discussion. For example, if a group of 
business associates comes from out of town to the taxpayer's place of 
business to hold a substantial business discussion, the entertainment of 
such business guests and their wives on the evening prior to, or on the 
evening of the day following, the business discussion would generally be 
regarded as directly preceding or following such discussion.
    (4) Expenses closely connected with directly related entertainment. 
If any portion of an expenditure meets the requirements of paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section (relating to directly related entertainment in 
general), the remaining portion of the expenditure, if it is otherwise 
allowable under Chapter 1 of the Code, shall be considered associated 
with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business to the 
extent allocable to a person or persons closely connected with a person 
referred to in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section. The spouse of a 
person referred to in paragraph(c)(3)(iv) of this section will be

[[Page 529]]

considered closely connected to such a person for purposes of this 
subparagraph. Thus, if a taxpayer and his wife entertain a business 
customer and the customer's wife under circumstances where the 
entertainment of the customer is considered directly related to the 
active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business (within the meaning 
of paragraph (c)(3) of this section) the portion of the expenditure 
allocable to both wives will be considered associated with the active 
conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business under this subparagraph.
    (e) Expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1979, with 
respect to entertainment facilities or before January 1, 1994, with 
respect to clubs--(1) In general. Any expenditure paid or incurred 
before January 1, 1979, with respect to a facility, or paid or incurred 
before January 1, 1994, with respect to a club, used in connection with 
entertainment shall not be allowed as a deduction except to the extent 
it meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (2) Facilities used in connection with entertainment--(i) In 
general. Any item of personal or real property owned, rented, or used by 
a taxpayer shall (unless otherwise provided under the rules of 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph) be considered to constitute a 
facility used in connection with entertainment if it is used during the 
taxable year for, or in connection with, entertainment (as defined in 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section). Examples of facilities which might be 
used for, or in connection with, entertainment include yachts, hunting 
lodges, fishing camps, swimming pools, tennis courts, bowling alleys, 
automobiles, airplanes, apartments, hotel suites, and homes in vacation 
resorts.
    (ii) Facilities used incidentally for entertainment. A facility used 
only incidentally during a taxable year in connection with 
entertainment, if such use is insubstantial, will not be considered a 
``facility used in connection with entertainment'' for purposes of this 
section or for purposes of the recordkeeping requirements of section 
274(d). See Sec. 1.274-5(c)(6)(iii).
    (3) Expenditures with respect to a facility used in connection with 
entertainment--(i) In general. The phrase expenditures with respect to a 
facility used in connection with entertainment includes depreciation and 
operating costs, such as rent and utility charges (for example, water or 
electricity), expenses for the maintenance, preservation or protection 
of a facility (for example, repairs, painting, insurance charges), and 
salaries or expenses for subsistence paid to caretakers or watchmen. In 
addition, the phrase includes losses realized on the sale or other 
disposition of a facility.
    (ii) Club dues--(a) Club dues paid or incurred before January 1, 
1994. Dues or fees paid before January 1, 1994, to any social, athletic, 
or sporting club or organization are considered expenditures with 
respect to a facility used in connection with entertainment. The 
purposes and activities of a club or organization, and not its name, 
determine its character. Generally, the phrase social, athletic, or 
sporting club or organization has the same meaning for purposes of this 
section as that phrase had in section 4241 and the regulations 
thereunder, relating to the excise tax on club dues, prior to the repeal 
of section 4241 by section 301 of Public Law 89-44. However, for 
purposes of this section only, clubs operated solely to provide lunches 
under circumstances of a type generally considered to be conducive to 
business discussion, within the meaning of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this 
section, will not be considered social clubs.
    (b) Club dues paid or incurred after December 31, 1993. See 
paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section with reference to the disallowance 
of deductions for club dues paid or incurred after December 31, 1993.
    (iii) Expenditures not with respect to a facility. The following 
expenditures shall not be considered to constitute expenditures with 
respect to a facility used in connection with entertainment:
    (a) Out of pocket expenditures. Expenses (exclusive of operating 
costs and other expenses referred to in subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph) incurred at the time of an entertainment activity, even 
though in connection with the use of facility for entertainment 
purposes, such as expenses for food and beverages, or expenses for 
catering, or expenses for gasoline and fishing bait consumed on a 
fishing trip;

[[Page 530]]

    (b) Non-entertainment expenditures. Expenses or items attributable 
to the use of a facility for other than entertainment purposes such as 
expenses for an automobile when not used for entertainment; and
    (c) Expenditures otherwise deductible. Expenses allowable as a 
deduction without regard to their connection with a taxpayer's trade or 
business such as taxes, interest, and casualty losses. The provisions of 
this subdivision shall be applied in the case of a taxpayer which is not 
an individual as if it were an individual. See also Sec. 1.274-6.
    (iv) Cross reference. For other rules with respect to treatment of 
certain expenditures for entertainment-type facilities, see Sec. 1.274-
7.
    (4) Determination of primary use--(i) In general. A facility used in 
connection with entertainment shall be considered as used primarily for 
the furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or business only if it is 
established that the primary use of the facility during the taxable year 
was for purposes considered ordinary and necessary within the meaning of 
sections 162 and 212 and the regulations thereunder. All of the facts 
and circumstances of each case shall be considered in determining the 
primary use of a facility. Generally, it is the actual use of the 
facility which establishes the deductibility of expenditures with 
respect to the facility; not its availability for use and not the 
taxpayer's principal purpose in acquiring the facility. Objective rather 
than subjective standards will be determinative. If membership entitles 
the member's entire family to use of a facility, such as a country club, 
their use will be considered in determining whether business use of the 
facility exceeds personal use. The factors to be considered include the 
nature of each use, the frequency and duration of use for business 
purposes as compared with other purposes, and the amount of expenditures 
incurred during use for business compared with amount of expenditures 
incurred during use for other purposes. No single standard of 
comparison, or quantitative measurement, as to the significance of any 
such factor, however, is necessarily appropriate for all classes or 
types of facilities. For example, an appropriate standard for 
determining the primary use of a country club during a taxable year will 
not necessarily be appropriate for determining the primary use of an 
airplane. However, a taxpayer shall be deemed to have established that a 
facility was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or business 
if he establishes such primary use in accordance with subdivision (ii) 
or (iii) of this subparagraph. Subdivisions (ii) and (iii) of this 
subparagraph shall not preclude a taxpayer from otherwise establishing 
the primary use of a facility under the general provisions of this 
subdivision.
    (ii) Certain transportation facilities. A taxpayer shall be deemed 
to have established that a facility of a type described in this 
subdivision was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or 
business if:
    (a) Automobiles. In the case of an automobile, the taxpayer 
establishes that more than 50 percent of mileage driven during the 
taxable year was in connection with travel considered to be ordinary and 
necessary within the meaning of section 162 or 212 and the regulations 
thereunder.
    (b) Airplanes. In the case of an airplane, the taxpayer establishes 
that more than 50 percent of hours flown during the taxable year was in 
connection with travel considered to be ordinary and necessary within 
the meaning of section 162 or 212 and the regulations thereunder.
    (iii) Entertainment facilities in general. A taxpayer shall be 
deemed to have established that:
    (a) A facility used in connection with entertainment, such as a 
yacht or other pleasure boat, hunting lodge, fishing camp, summer home 
or vacation cottage, hotel suite, country club, golf club or similar 
social, athletic, or sporting club or organization, bowling alley, 
tennis court, or swimming pool, or,
    (b) A facility for employees not falling within the scope of section 
274(e) (2) or (5) was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or 
business if he establishes that more than 50 percent of the total 
calendar days of use of the facility by, or under authority of, the 
taxpayer during the taxable year were

[[Page 531]]

days of business use. Any use of a facility (of a type described in this 
subdivision) during one calendar day shall be considered to constitute a 
``day of business use'' if the primary use of the facility on such day 
was ordinary and necessary within the meaning of section 162 or 212 and 
the regulations thereunder. For the purposes of this subdivision, a 
facility shall be deemed to have been primarily used for such pruposes 
on any one calendar day if the facility was used for the conduct of a 
substantial and bona fide business discussion (as defined in paragraph 
(d)(3)(i) of this section) notwithstanding that the facility may also 
have been used on the same day for personal or family use by the 
taxpayer or any member of the taxpayer's family not involving 
entertainment of others by, or under the authority of, the taxpayer.
    (f) Specific exceptions to application of this section--(1) In 
general. The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section 
(imposing limitations on deductions for entertainment expenses) are not 
applicable in the case of expenditures set forth in subparagraph (2) of 
this paragraph. Such expenditures are deductible to the extent allowable 
under chapter 1 of the Code. This paragraph shall not be construed to 
affect the allowability or nonallowability of a deduction under section 
162 or 212 and the regulations thereunder. The fact that an expenditure 
is not covered by a specific exception provided for in this paragraph 
shall not be determinative of the allowability or nonallowability of the 
expenditure under paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. 
Expenditures described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph are subject 
to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) to the extent 
provided in Sec. 1.274-5.
    (2) Exceptions. The expenditures referred to in subparagraph (1) of 
this paragraph are set forth in subdivisions (i) through (ix) of this 
subparagraph.
    (i) Business meals and similar expenditures paid or incurred before 
January 1, 1987--(a) In general. Any expenditure for food or beverages 
furnished to an individual under circumstances of a type generally 
considered conducive to business discussion (taking into account the 
surroundings in which furnished, the taxpayer's trade, business, or 
income-producing activity, and the relationship to such trade, business 
or activity of the persons to whom the food or beverages are furnished) 
is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided 
for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. There is no 
requirement that business actually be discussed for this exception to 
apply.
    (b) Surroundings. The surroundings in which the food or beverages 
are furnished must be such as would provide an atmosphere where there 
are no substantial distractions to discussion. This exception applies 
primarily to expenditures for meals and beverages served during the 
course of a breakfast, lunch or dinner meeting of the taxpayer and his 
business associates at a restaurant, hotel dining room, eating club or 
similar place not involving distracting influences such as a floor show. 
This exception also applies to expenditures for beverages served apart 
from meals if the expenditure is incurred in surroundings similarly 
conducive to business discussion, such as an expenditure for beverages 
served during the meeting of the taxpayer and his business associates at 
a cocktail lounge or hotel bar not involving distracting influences such 
as a floor show. This exception may also apply to expenditures for meals 
or beverages served in the taxpayer's residence on a clear showing that 
the expenditure was commercially rather than socially motivated. 
However, this exception, generally, is not applicable to any expenditure 
for meals or beverages furnished in circumstances where there are major 
distractions not conducive to business discussion, such as at night 
clubs, sporting events, large cocktail parties, sizeable social 
gatherings, or other major distracting influences.
    (c) Taxpayer's trade or business and relationship of persons 
entertained. The taxpayer's trade, business, or income-producing 
activity and the relationship of the persons to whom the food or 
beverages are served to such trade, business or activity must be such as 
will reasonably indicate that the food or

[[Page 532]]

beverages were furnished for the primary purpose of furthering the 
taxpayer's trade or business and did not primarily serve a social or 
personal purpose. Such a business purpose would be indicated, for 
example, if a salesman employed by a manufacturing supply company meets 
for lunch during a normal business day with a purchasing agent for a 
manufacturer which is a prospective customer. Such a purpose would also 
be indicated if a life insurance agent meets for lunch during a normal 
business day with a client.
    (d) Business programs. Expenditures for business luncheons or 
dinners which are part of a business program, or banquets officially 
sponsored by business or professional associations, will be regarded as 
expenditures to which the exception of this subdivision (i) applies. In 
the case of such a business luncheon or dinner it is not always 
necessary that the taxpayer attend the luncheon or dinner himself. For 
example, if a dental equipment supplier purchased a table at a dental 
association banquet for dentists who are actual or prospective customers 
for his equipment, the cost of the table would not be disallowed under 
this section. See also paragraph (c)(4) of this section relating to 
expenditures made in a clear business setting.
    (ii) Food and beverages for employees. Any expenditure by a taxpayer 
for food and beverages (or for use of a facility in connection 
therewith) furnished on the taxpayer's business premises primarily for 
his employees is not subject to the limitations on allowability of 
deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. 
This exception applies not only to expenditures for food or beverages 
furnished in a typical company cafeteria or an executive dining room, 
but also to expenditures with respect to the operation of such 
facilities. This exception applies even though guests are occasionally 
served in the cafeteria or dining room.
    (iii) Certain entertainment and travel expenses treated as 
compensation--(A) In general. Any expenditure by a taxpayer for 
entertainment (or for use of a facility in connection therewith) or for 
travel described in section 274(m)(3), if an employee is the recipient 
of the entertainment or travel, is not subject to the limitations on 
allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section to the extent that the expenditure is treated by the 
taxpayer--
    (1) On the taxpayer's income tax return as originally filed, as 
compensation paid to the employee; and
    (2) As wages to the employee for purposes of withholding under 
chapter 24 (relating to collection of income tax at source on wages).
    (B) Expenses includible in income of persons who are not employees. 
Any expenditure by a taxpayer for entertainment (or for use of a 
facility in connection therewith), or for travel described in section 
274(m)(3), is not subject to the limitations on allowability of 
deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section to 
the extent the expenditure is includible in gross income as compensation 
for services rendered, or as a prize or award under section 74, by a 
recipient of the expenditure who is not an employee of the taxpayer. The 
preceding sentence shall not apply to any amount paid or incurred by the 
taxpayer if such amount is required to be included (or would be so 
required except that the amount is less that $600) in any information 
return filed by such taxpayer under part III of subchapter A of chapter 
61 and is not so included. See section 274(e)(9).
    (C) Example. The following example illustrates the provisions this 
paragraph (f):

    Example. If an employer rewards the employee (and the employee's 
spouse) with an expense paid vacation trip, the expense is deductible by 
the employer (if otherwise allowable under section 162 and the 
regulations thereunder) to the extent the employer treats the expenses 
as compensation and as wages. On the other hand, if a taxpayer owns a 
yacht which the taxpayer uses for the entertainment of business 
customers, the portion of salary paid to employee members of the crew 
which is allocable to use of the yacht for entertainment purposes (even 
though treated on the taxpayer's tax return as compensation and treated 
as wages for withholding tax purposes) would not come within this 
exception since the members of the crew were not recipients of the 
entertainment. If an expenditure of a type described in this subdivision 
properly constitutes a dividend paid to a shareholder or if it 
constitutes unreasonable compensation

[[Page 533]]

paid to an employee, nothing in this exception prevents disallowance of 
the expenditure to the taxpayer under other provisions of the Internal 
Revenue Code.

    (iv) Reimbursed entertainment expenses--(a) Introductory. In the 
case of any expenditure for entertainment paid or incurred by one person 
in connection with the performance by him of services for another person 
(whether or not such other person is an employer) under a reimbursement 
or other expense allowance arrangement, the limitations on allowability 
of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section 
shall be applied only once, either (1) to the person who makes the 
expenditure or (2) to the person who actually bears the expense, but not 
to both. For purposes of this subdivision (iv), the term reimbursement 
or other expense allowance arrangement has the same meaning as it has in 
section 62(2)(A), but without regard to whether the taxpayer is the 
employee of a person for whom services are performed. If an expenditure 
of a type described in this subdivision properly constitutes a dividend 
paid to a shareholder, unreasonable compensation paid to an employee, or 
a personal, living or family expense, nothing in this exception prevents 
disallowance of the expenditure to the taxpayer under other provisions 
of the Code.
    (b) Reimbursement arrangements between employee and employer. In the 
case of an expenditure for entertainment paid or incurred by an employee 
under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with his 
employer, the limitations on deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) 
through (e) of this section shall not apply:
    (1) Employees. To the employee except to the extent his employer has 
treated the expenditure on the employer's income tax return as 
originally filed as compensation paid to the employee and as wages to 
such employee for purposes of withholding under Chapter 24 (relating to 
collection of income tax at source on wages).
    (2) Employers. To the employer to the extent he has treated the 
expenditure as compensation and wages paid to an employee in the manner 
provided in (b)(1) of this subdivision.
    (c) Reimbursement arrangements between independent contractors and 
clients or customers. In the case of an expenditure for entertainment 
paid or incurred by one person (hereinafter termed ``independent 
contractor'') under a reimbursement or other expense allowance 
arrangement with another person other than an employer (hereinafter 
termed ``client or customer''), the limitations on deductions provided 
for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section shall not apply:
    (1) Independent contractors. To the independent contractor to the 
extent he accounts to his client or customer within the meaning of 
section 274(d) and the regulations thereunder. See Sec. 1.274-5.
    (2) Clients or customers. To the client or customer if the 
expenditure is disallowed to the independent contractor under paragraphs 
(a) through (e) of this section.
    (v) Recreational expenses for employees generally. Any expenditure 
by a taxpayer for a recreational, social, or similar activity (or for 
use of a facility in connection therewith), primarily for the benefit of 
his employees generally, is not subject to the limitations on 
allowability of deductions provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section. This exception applies only to expenditures made primarily 
for the benefit of employees of the taxpayer other than employees who 
are officers, shareholders on other owners who own a 10-percent or 
greater interest in the business, or other highly compensated employees. 
For purposes of the preceding sentence, an employee shall be treated as 
owning any interest owned by a member of his family (within the meaning 
of section 267(c)(4) and the regulations thereunder). Ordinarily, this 
exception applies to usual employee benefit programs such as expenses of 
a taxpayer (a) in holding Christmas parties, annual picnics, or summer 
outings, for his employees generally, or (b) of maintaining a swimming 
pool, baseball diamond, bowling alley, or golf course available to his 
employees generally. Any expenditure for an activity which is made under 
circumstances which discriminate in favor of employees who are officers, 
shareholders or other owners, or highly

[[Page 534]]

compensated employees shall not be considered made primarily for the 
benefit of employees generally. On the other hand, an expenditure for an 
activity will not be considered outside of this exception merely 
because, due to the large number of employees involved, the activity is 
intended to benefit only a limited number of such employees at one time, 
provided the activity does not discriminate in favor of officers, 
shareholders, other owners, or highly compensated employees.
    (vi) Employee, stockholder, etc., business meetings. Any expenditure 
by a taxpayer for entertainment which is directly related to bona fide 
business meetings of the taxpayer's employees, stockholders, agents, or 
directors held principally for discussion of trade or business is not 
subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided for in 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. For purposes of this 
exception, a partnership is to be considered a taxpayer and a member of 
a partnership is to be considered an agent. For example, an expenditure 
by a taxpayer to furnish refreshments to his employees at a bona fide 
meeting, sponsored by the taxpayer for the principal purpose of 
instructing them with respect to a new procedure for conducting his 
business, would be within the provisions of this exception. A similar 
expenditure made at a bona fide meeting of stockholders of the taxpayer 
for the election of directors and discussion of corporate affairs would 
also be within the provisions of this exception. While this exception 
will apply to bona fide business meetings even though some social 
activities are provided, it will not apply to meetings which are 
primarily for social or nonbusiness purposes rather than for the 
transaction of the taxpayer's business. A meeting under circumstances 
where there was little or no possibility of engaging in the active 
conduct of trade or business (as described in paragraph (c)(7) of this 
section) generally will not be considered a business meeting for 
purposes of this subdivision. This exception will not apply to a meeting 
or convention of employees or agents, or similar meeting for directors, 
partners or others for the principal purpose of rewarding them for their 
services to the taxpayer. However, such a meeting or convention of 
employees might come within the scope of subdivisions (iii) or (v) of 
this subparagraph.
    (vii) Meetings of business leagues, etc. Any expenditure for 
entertainment directly related and necessary to attendance at bona fide 
business meetings or conventions of organizations exempt from taxation 
under section 501(c)(6) of the Code, such as business leagues, chambers 
of commerce, real estate boards, boards of trade, and certain 
professional associations, is not subject to the limitations on 
allowability of deductions provided in paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section.
    (viii) Items available to the public. Any expenditure by a taxpayer 
for entertainment (or for a facility in connection therewith) to the 
extent the entertainment is made available to the general public is not 
subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions provided for in 
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. Expenditures for 
entertainment of the general public by means of television, radio, 
newspapers and the like, will come within this exception, as will 
expenditures for distributing samples to the general public. Similarly, 
expenditures for maintaining private parks, golf courses and similar 
facilities, to the extent that they are available for public use, will 
come within this exception. For example, if a corporation maintains a 
swimming pool which it makes available for a period of time each week to 
children participating in a local public recreational program, the 
portion of the expense relating to such public use of the pool will come 
within this exception.
    (ix) Entertainment sold to customers. Any expenditure by a taxpayer 
for entertainment (or for use of a facility in connection therewith) to 
the extent the entertainment is sold to customers in a bona fide 
transaction for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's 
worth is not subject to the limitations on allowability of deductions 
provided for in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. Thus, the 
cost of producing night club entertainment (such as salaries paid to 
employees of night clubs and amounts paid to performers) for sale to 
customers or

[[Page 535]]

the cost of operating a pleasure cruise ship as a business will come 
within this exception.
    (g) Additional provisions of section 274--travel of spouse, 
dependent or others. Section 274(m)(3) provides that no deduction shall 
be allowed under this chapter (except section 217) for travel expenses 
paid or incurred with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other 
individual accompanying the taxpayer (or an officer or employee of the 
taxpayer) on business travel, unless certain conditions are met. As 
provided in section 274(m)(3), the term other individual does not 
include a business associate (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of 
this section) who otherwise meets the requirements of sections 
274(m)(3)(B) and (C).

Sec. 1.274-3   Disallowance of deduction for gifts.

    (a) In general. No deduction shall be allowed under section 162 or 
212 for any expense for a gift made directly or indirectly by a taxpayer 
to any individual to the extent that such expense, when added to prior 
expenses of the taxpayer for gifts made to such individual during the 
taxpayer's taxable year, exceeds $25.
    (b) Gift defined--(1) In general. Except as provided in subparagraph 
(2) of this paragraph the term gift, for purposes of this section, means 
any item excludable from the gross income of the recipient under section 
102 which is not excludable from his gross income under any other 
provision of chapter 1 of the Code. Thus, a payment by an employer to a 
deceased employee's widow is not a gift, for purposes of this section, 
to the extent the payment constitutes an employee's death benefit 
excludable by the recipient under section 101(b). Similarly, a 
scholarship which is excludable from a recipient's gross income under 
section 117, and a prize or award which is excludable from a recipient's 
gross income under section 74(b), are not subject to the provisions of 
this section.
    (2) Items not treated as gifts. The term gift, for purposes of this 
section, does not include the following:
    (i) An item having a cost to the taxpayer not in excess of $4.00 on 
which the name of the taxpayer is clearly and permanently imprinted and 
which is one of a number of identical items distributed generally by 
such a taxpayer.
    (ii) A sign, display rack, or other promotional material to be used 
on the business premises of the recipient, or
    (iii) In the case of a taxable year of a taxpayer ending on or after 
August 13, 1981, an item of tangible personal property which is awarded 
before January 1, 1987, to an employee of the taxpayer by reason of the 
employee's length of service (including an award upon retirement), 
productivity, or safety achievement, but only to the extent that--
    (A) The cost of the item to the taxpayer does not exceed $400; or
    (B) The item is a qualified plan award (as defined in paragraph (d) 
of this section); or
    (iv) In the case of a taxable year of a taxpayer ending before 
August 13, 1981, an item of tangible personal property having a cost to 
the taxpayer not in excess of $100 which is awarded to an employee of 
the taxpayer by reason of the employee's length of service (including an 
award upon retirement) or safety achievement.

For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2) (iii) and (iv) of this section, the 
term tangible personal property does not include cash or any gift 
certificate other than a nonnegotiable gift certificate conferring only 
the right to receive tangible personal property. Thus, for example, if a 
nonnegotiable gift certificate entitles an employee to choose between 
selecting an item of merchandise or receiving cash or reducing the 
balance due on his account with the issuer of the gift certificate, the 
gift certificate is not tangible personal property for purposes of this 
section. To the extent that an item is not treated as a gift for 
purposes of this section, the deductibility of the expense of the item 
is not governed by this section, and the taxpayer need not take such 
item into account in determining whether the $25 limitation on gifts to 
any individual has been exceeded. For example, if an employee

[[Page 536]]

receives by reason of his length of service a gift of an item of 
tangible personal property that costs the employer $450, the 
deductibility of only $50 ($450 minus $400) is governed by this section, 
and the employer takes the $50 into account for purposes of the $25 
limitation on gifts to that employee. The fact that an item is wholly or 
partially excepted from the applicability of this section has no effect 
in determining whether the value of the item is includible in the gross 
income of the recipient. For rules relating to the taxability to the 
recipient of any item described in this subparagraph, see sections 61, 
74, and 102 and the regulations thereunder. For rules relating to the 
deductibility of employee achievement awards awarded after December 31, 
1986, see section 274 (j).
    (c) Expense for a gift. For purposes of this section, the term 
expense for a gift means the cost of the gift to the taxpayer, other 
than incidental costs such as for customary engraving on jewelry, or for 
packaging, insurance, and mailing or other delivery. A related cost will 
be considered ``incidental'' only if it does not add substantial value 
to the gift. Although the cost of customary gift wrapping will be 
considered an incidental cost, the purchase of an ornamental basket for 
packaging fruit will not be considered an incidental cost of packaging 
if the basket has a value which is substantial in relation to the value 
of the fruit.
    (d) Qualified plan award--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph the term qualified plan award, for 
purposes of this section, means an item of tangible personal property 
that is awarded to an employee by reason of the employee's length of 
service (including retirement), productivity, or safety achievement, and 
that is awarded pursuant to a permanent, written award plan or program 
of the taxpayer that does not discriminate as to eligibility or benefits 
in favor of employees who are officers, shareholders, or highly 
compensated employees. The ``permanency'' of an award plan shall be 
determined from all the facts and circumstances of the particular case, 
including the taxpayer's ability to continue to make the awards as 
required by the award plan. Although the taxpayer may reserve the right 
to change or to terminate an award plan, the actual termination of the 
award plan for any reason other than business necessity within a few 
years after it has taken effect may be evidence that the award plan from 
its inception was not a ``permanent'' award plan. Whether or not an 
award plan is discriminatory shall be determined from all the facts and 
circumstances of the particular case. An award plan may fail to qualify 
because it is discriminatory in its actual operation even though the 
written provisions of the award plan are not discriminatory.
    (2) Items not treated as qualified plan awards. The term qualified 
plan award, for purposes of this section, does not include an item 
qualifying under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to the extent that the 
cost of the item exceeds $1,600. In addition, that term does not include 
any items qualifying under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the 
average cost of all items (whether or not tangible personal property) 
awarded during the taxable year by the taxpayer under any plan described 
in paragraph (d)(1) of this section exceeds $400. The average cost of 
those items shall be computed by dividing (i) the sum of the costs for 
those items (including amounts in excess of the $1,600 limitation) by 
(ii) the total number of those items.
    (e) Gifts made indirectly to an individual--(1) Gift to spouse or 
member of family. If a taxpayer makes a gift to the wife of a man who 
has a business connection with the taxpayer, the gift generally will be 
considered as made indirectly to the husband. However, if the wife has a 
bona fide business connection with the taxpayer independently of her 
relationship to her husband, a gift to her generally will not be 
considered as made indirectly to her husband unless the gift is intended 
for his eventual use or benefit. Thus, if a taxpayer makes a gift to a 
wife who is engaged with her husband in the active conduct of a 
partnership business, the gift to the wife will not be considered an 
indirect gift to her husband unless it is intended for his eventual use 
or benefit. The same rules apply to gifts to any

[[Page 537]]

other member of the family of an individual who has a business 
connection with the taxpayer.
    (2) Gift to corporation or other business entity. If a taxpayer 
makes a gift to a corporation or other business entity intended for the 
eventual personal use or benefit of an individual who is an employee, 
stockholder, or other owner of the corporation or business entity, the 
gift generally will be considered as made indirectly to such individual. 
Thus, if a taxpayer provides theater tickets to a closely held 
corporation for eventual use by any one of the stockholders of the 
corporation, and if such tickets are gifts, the gifts will be considered 
as made indirectly to the individual who eventually uses such ticket. On 
the other hand, a gift to a business organization of property to be used 
in connection with the business of the organization (for example, a 
technical manual) will not be considered as a gift to an individual, 
even though, in practice, the book will be used principally by a readily 
identifiable individual employee. A gift for the eventual personal use 
or benefit of some undesignated member of a large group of individuals 
generally will not be considered as made indirectly to the individual 
who eventually uses, or benefits from, such gifts unless, under the 
circumstances of the case, it is reasonably practicable for the taxpayer 
to ascertain the ultimate recipient of the gift. Thus, if a taxpayer 
provides several baseball tickets to a corporation for the eventual use 
by any one of a large number of employees or customers of the 
corporation, and if such tickets are gifts, the gifts generally will not 
be treated as made indirectly to the individuals who use such tickets.
    (f) Special rules--(1) Partnership. In the case of a gift by a 
partnership, the $25 annual limitation contained in paragraph (a) of 
this section shall apply to the partnership as well as to each member of 
the partnership. Thus, in the case of a gift made by a partner with 
respect to the business of the partnership, the $25 limitation will be 
applied at the partnership level as well as at the level of the 
individual partner. Consequently, deductions for gifts made with respect 
to partnership business will not exceed $25 annually for each recipient, 
regardless of the number of partners.
    (2) Husband and wife. For purposes of applying the $25 annual 
limitation contained in paragraph (a) of this section, a husband and 
wife shall be treated as one taxpayer. Thus, in the case of gifts to an 
individual by a husband and wife, the spouses will be treated as one 
donor; and they are limited to a deduction of $25 annually for each 
recipient. This rule applies regardless of whether the husband and wife 
file a joint return or whether the husband and wife make separate gifts 
to an individual with respect to separate businesses. Since the term 
taxpayer in paragraph (a) of this section refers only to the donor of a 
gift, this special rule does not apply to treat a husband and wife as 
one individual where each is a recipient of a gift. See paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section.
    (g) Cross reference. For rules with respect to whether this section 
or Sec. 1.274-2 applies, see Sec. 1.274-2(b)(1) (iii).

[T.D. 6659, 28 FR 6505, June 25, 1963, as amended by T.D. 8230, 53 FR 
36451, Sept. 20, 1988]


<R05>
Sec. 1.274-4   Disallowance of certain foreign travel expenses.

    (a) Introductory. Section 274(c) and this section impose certain 
restrictions on the deductibility of travel expenses incurred in the 
case of an individual who, while traveling outside the United States 
away from home in the pursuit of trade or business (hereinafter termed 
``business activity''), engages in substantial personal activity not 
attributable to such trade or business (hereinafter termed ``nonbusiness 
activity''). Section 274(c) and this section are limited in their 
application to individuals (whether or not an employee or other person 
traveling under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement) 
who engage in nonbusiness activity while traveling outside the United 
States away from home, and do not impose restrictions on the 
deductibility of travel expenses incurred by an employer or client under 
an advance, reimbursement, or other arrangement with the individual who 
engages in nonbusiness activity. For purposes of this section, the term 
United States includes only the States and

[[Page 538]]

the District of Columbia, and any reference to ``trade or business'' or 
``business activity'' includes any activity described in section 212. 
For rules governing the determination of travel outside the United 
States away from home, see paragraph (e) of this section. For rules 
governing the disallowance of travel expense to which this section 
applies, see paragraph (f) of this section.
    (b) Limitations on application of section. The restrictions on 
deductibility of travel expenses contained in paragraph (f) of this 
section are applicable only if:
    (1) The travel expense is otherwise deductible under section 162 or 
212 and the regulations thereunder,
    (2) The travel expense is for travel outside the United States away 
from home which exceeds 1 week (as determined under paragraph (c) of 
this section), and
    (3) The time outside the United States away from home attributable 
to nonbusiness activity (as determined under paragraph (d) of this 
section) constitutes 25 percent or more of the total time on such 
travel.
    (c) Travel in excess of 1 week. This section does not apply to an 
expense of travel unless the expense is for travel outside the United 
States away from home which exceeds 1 week. For purposes of this 
section, 1 week means 7 consecutive days. The day in which travel 
outside the United States away from home begins shall not be considered, 
but the day in which such travel ends shall be considered, in 
determining whether a taxpayer is outside the United States away from 
home for more than 7 consecutive days. For example, if a taxpayer 
departs on travel outside the United States away from home on a 
Wednesday morning and ends such travel the following Wednesday evening, 
he shall be considered as being outside the United States away from home 
only 7 consecutive days. In such a case, this section would not apply 
because the taxpayer was not outside the United States away from home 
for more than 7 consecutive days. However, if the taxpayer travels 
outside the United States away from home for more than 7 consecutive 
days, both the day such travel begins and the day such travel ends shall 
be considered a ``business day'' or a ``nonbusiness day'', as the case 
may be, for purposes of determining whether nonbusiness activity 
constituted 25 percent or more of travel time under paragraph (d) of 
this section and for purposes of allocating expenses under paragraph (f) 
of this section. For purposes of determining whether travel is outside 
the United States away from home, see paragraph (e) of this section.
    (d) Nonbusiness activity constituting 25 percent or more of travel 
time--(1) In general. This section does not apply to any expense of 
travel outside the United States away from home unless the portion of 
time outside the United States away from home attributable to 
nonbusiness activity constitutes 25 percent or more of the total time on 
such travel.
    (2) Allocation on per day basis. The total time traveling outside 
the United States away from home will be allocated on a day-by-day basis 
to (i) days of business activity or (ii) days of nonbusiness activity 
(hereinafter termed ``business days'' or ``nonbusiness days'' 
respectively) unless the taxpayer establishes that a different method of 
allocation more clearly reflects the portion of time outside the United 
States away from home which is attributable to nonbusiness activity. For 
purposes of this section, a day spent outside the United States away 
from home shall be deemed entirely a business day even though spent only 
in part on business activity if the taxpayer establishes:
    (i) Transportation days. That on such day the taxpayer was traveling 
to or returning from a destination outside the United States away from 
home in the pursuit of trade or business. However, if for purposes of 
engaging in nonbusiness activity, the taxpayer while traveling outside 
the United States away from home does not travel by a reasonably direct 
route, only that number of days shall be considered business days as 
would be required for the taxpayer, using the same mode of 
transportation, to travel to or return from the same destination by a 
reasonably direct route. Also, if, while so traveling, the taxpayer 
interrupts the normal course of travel by engaging in substantial 
diversions for nonbusiness reasons of his own choosing, only that

[[Page 539]]

number of days shall be considered business days as equals the number of 
days required for the taxpayer, using the same mode of transportation, 
to travel to or return from the same destination without engaging in 
such diversion. For example, if a taxpayer residing in New York departs 
on an evening on a direct flight to Quebec for a business meeting to be 
held in Quebec the next morning, for purposes of determining whether 
nonbusiness activity constituted 25 percent or more of his travel time, 
the entire day of his departure shall be considered a business day. On 
the other hand, if a taxpayer travels by automobile from New York to 
Quebec to attend a business meeting and while en route spends 2 days in 
Ottawa and 1 day in Montreal on nonbusiness activities of his personal 
choice, only that number of days outside the United States shall be 
considered business days as would have been required for the taxpayer to 
drive by a reasonably direct route to Quebec, taking into account normal 
periods for rest and meals.
    (ii) Presence required. That on such day his presence outside the 
United States away from home was required at a particular place for a 
specific and bona fide business purpose. For example, if a taxpayer is 
instructed by his employer to attend a specific business meeting, the 
day of the meeting shall be considered a business day even though, 
because of the scheduled length of the meeting, the taxpayer spends more 
time during normal working hours of the day on nonbusiness activity than 
on business activity.
    (iii) Days primarily business. That during hours normally considered 
to be appropriate for business activity, his principal activity on such 
day was the pursuit of trade or business.
    (iv) Circumstances beyond control. That on such day he was prevented 
from engaging in the conduct of trade or business as his principal 
activity due to circumstances beyond his control.
    (v) Weekends, holidays, etc. That such day was a Saturday, Sunday, 
legal holiday, or other reasonably necessary standby day which 
intervened during that course of the taxpayer's trade or business while 
outside the United States away from home which the taxpayer endeavored 
to conduct with reasonable dispatch. For example, if a taxpayer travels 
from New York to London to take part in business negotiations beginning 
on a Wednesday and concluding on the following Tuesday, the intervening 
Saturday and Sunday shall be considered business days whether or not 
business is conducted on either of such days. Similarly, if in the above 
case the meetings which concluded on Tuesday evening were followed by 
business meetings with another business group in London on the 
immediately succeeding Thursday and Friday, the intervening Wednesday 
will be deemed a business day. However, if at the conclusion of the 
business meetings on Friday, the taxpayer stays in London for an 
additional week for personal purposes, the Saturday and Sunday following 
the conclusion of the business meeting will not be considered business 
days.
    (e) Domestic travel excluded--(1) In general. For purposes of this 
section, travel outside the United States away from home does not 
include any travel from one point in the United States to another point 
in the United States. However, travel which is not from one point in the 
United States to another point in the United States shall be considered 
travel outside the United States. If a taxpayer travels from a place 
within the United States to a place outside the United States, the 
portion, if any, of such travel which is from one point in the United 
States to another point in the United States is to be disregarded for 
purposes of determining:
    (i) Whether the taxpayer's travel outside the United States away 
from home exceeds 1 week (see paragraph (c) of this section),
    (ii) Whether the time outside the United States away from home 
attributable to nonbusiness activity constitutes 25 percent or more of 
the total time on such travel (see paragraph (d) of this section), or
    (iii) The amount of travel expense subject to the allocation rules 
of this section (see paragraph (f) of this section).
    (2) Determination of travel from one point in the United States to 
another

[[Page 540]]

point in the United States. In the case of the following means of 
transportation, travel from one point in the United States to another 
point in the United States shall be determined as follows:
    (i) Travel by public transportation. In the case of travel by public 
transportation, any place in the United States at which the vehicle 
makes a scheduled stop for the purpose of adding or discharging 
passengers shall be considered a point in the United States.
    (ii) Travel by private automobile. In the case of travel by private 
automobile, any such travel which is within the United States shall be 
considered travel from one point in the United States to another point 
in the United States.
    (iii) Travel by private airplane. In the case of travel by private 
airplane, any flight, whether or not constituting the entire trip, where 
both the takeoff and the landing are within the United States shall be 
considered travel from one point in the United States to another point 
in the United States.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of subparagraph (2) may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. Taxpayer A flies from Los Angeles to Puerto Rico with a 
brief scheduled stopover in Miami for the purpose of adding and 
discharging passengers and A returns by airplane nonstop to Los Angeles. 
The travel from Los Angeles to Miami is considered travel from one point 
in the United States to another point in the United States. The travel 
from Miami to Puerto Rico and from Puerto Rico to Los Angeles is not 
considered travel from one point in the United States to another point 
in the United States and, thus, is considered to be travel outside the 
United States away from home.
    Example 2. Taxpayer B travels by train from New York to Montreal. 
The travel from New York to the last place in the United States where 
the train is stopped for the purpose of adding or discharging passengers 
is considered to be travel from one point in the United States to 
another point in the United States.
    Example 3. Taxpayer C travels by automobile from Tulsa to Mexico 
City and back. All travel in the United States is considered to be 
travel from one point in the United States to another point in the 
United States.
    Example 4. Taxpayer D flies nonstop from Seattle to Juneau. Although 
the flight passes over Canada, the trip is considered to be travel from 
one point in the United States to another point in the United States.
    Example 5. If in Example (4) above, the airplane makes a scheduled 
landing in Vancouver, the time spent in traveling from Seattle to Juneau 
is considered to be travel outside the United States away from home. 
However, the time spent in Juneau is not considered to be travel outside 
the United States away from home.

    (f) Application of disallowance rules--(1) In general. In the case 
of expense for travel outside the United States away from home by an 
individual to which this section applies, except as otherwise provided 
in subparagraph (4) or (5) of this paragraph, no deduction shall be 
allowed for that amount of travel expense specified in subparagraph (2) 
or (3) of this paragraph (whichever is applicable) which is obtained by 
multiplying the total of such travel expense by a fraction:
    (i) The numerator of which is the number of nonbusiness days during 
such travel, and
    (ii) The denominator of which is the total number of business days 
and nonbusiness days during such travel.

For determination of ``business days'' and ``nonbusiness days'', see 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    (2) Nonbusiness activity at, near, or beyond business destination. 
If the place at which the individual engages in nonbusiness activity 
(hereinafter termed ``nonbusiness destination'') is at, near, or beyond 
the place to which he travels in the pursuit of a trade or business 
(hereinafter termed ``business destination''), the amount of travel 
expense referred to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be the 
amount of travel expense, otherwise allowable as a deduction under 
section 162 or section 212, which would have been incurred in traveling 
from the place where travel outside the United States away from home 
begins to the business destination, and returning. Thus, if the 
individual travels from New York to London on business, and then takes a 
vacation in Paris before returning to New York, the amount of the travel 
expense subject to allocation is the expense which would have been 
incurred in traveling from New York to London and returning.
    (3) Nonbusiness activity on the route to or from business 
destination. If the nonbusiness destination is on the route to or from 
the business destination, the amount of the travel expense referred

[[Page 541]]

to in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall be the amount of travel 
expense, otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 162 or 212, 
which would have been incurred in traveling from the place where travel 
outside the United States away from home begins to the nonbusiness 
destination and returning. Thus, if the individual travels on business 
from Chicago to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil with a scheduled stop in New York 
for the purpose of adding and discharging passengers, and while en route 
stops in Caracas, Venezuela for a vacation and returns to Chicago from 
Rio de Janeiro with another scheduled stop in New York for the purpose 
of adding and discharging passengers, the amount of travel expense 
subject to allocation is the expense which would have been incurred in 
traveling from New York to Caracas and returning.
    (4) Other allocation method. If a taxpayer establishes that a method 
other than allocation on a day-by-day basis (as determined under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section) more clearly reflects the portion of 
time outside the United States away from home which is attributable to 
nonbusiness activity, the amount of travel expense for which no 
deduction shall be allowed shall be determined by such other method.
    (5) Travel expense deemed entirely allocable to business activity. 
Expenses of travel shall be considered allocable in full to business 
activity, and no portion of such expense shall be subject to 
disallowance under this section, if incurred under circumstances 
provided for in subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph.
    (i) Lack of control over travel. Expenses of travel otherwise 
deductible under section 162 or 212 shall be considered fully allocable 
to business activity if, considering all the facts and circumstances, 
the individual incurring such expenses did not have substantial control 
over the arranging of the business trip. A person who is required to 
travel to a business destination will not be considered to have 
substantial control over the arranging of the business trip merely 
because he has control over the timing of the trip. Any individual who 
travels on behalf of his employer under a reimbursement or other expense 
allowance arrangement shall be considered not to have had substantial 
control over the arranging of his business trip, provided the employee 
is not:
    (a) A managing executive of the employer for whom he is traveling 
(and for this purpose the term managing executive includes only an 
employee who, by reason of his authority and responsibility, is 
authorized, without effective veto procedures, to decide upon the 
necessity for his business trip), or
    (b) Related to his employer within the meaning of section 267(b) but 
for this purpose the percentage referred to in section 267(b)(2) shall 
be 10 percent.
    (ii) Lack of major consideration to obtain a vacation. Any expense 
of travel, which qualifies for deduction under section 162 or 212, shall 
be considered fully allocable to business activity if the individual 
incurring such expenses can establish that, considering all the facts 
and circumstances, he did not have a major consideration, in determining 
to make the trip, of obtaining a personal vacation or holiday. If such a 
major consideration were present, the provisions of subparagraphs (1) 
through (4) of this paragraph shall apply. However, if the trip were 
primarily personal in nature, the traveling expenses to and from the 
destination are not deductible even though the taxpayer engages in 
business activities while at such destination. See paragraph (b) of 
Sec. 1.162-2.
    (g) Examples. The application of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. Individual A flew from New York to Paris where he 
conducted business for 1 day. He spent the next 2 days sightseeing in 
Paris and then flew back to New York. The entire trip, including 2 days 
for travel en route, took 5 days. Since the time outside the United 
States away from home during the trip did not exceed 1 week, the 
disallowance rules of this section do not apply.
    Example 2. Individual B flew from Tampa to Honolulu (from one point 
in the United States to another point in the United States) for a 
business meeting which lasted 3 days and for personal matters which took 
10 days. He then flew to Melbourne, Australia where he conducted 
business for 2 days and went sightseeing for 1 day. Immediately 
thereafter he flew back to Tampa, with a scheduled landing in Honolulu 
for the purpose of adding and discharging passengers. Although

[[Page 542]]

the trip exceeded 1 week, the time spent outside the United States away 
from home, including 2 days for traveling from Honolulu to Melbourne and 
return, was 5 days. Since the time outside the United States away from 
home during the trip did not exceed 1 week, the disallowance rules of 
this section do not apply.
    Example 3. Individual C flew from Los Angeles to New York where he 
spent 5 days. He then flew to Brussels where he spent 14 days on 
business and 5 days on personal matters. He then flew back to Los 
Angeles by way of New York. The entire trip, including 4 days for travel 
en route, took 28 days. However, the 2 days spent traveling from Los 
Angeles to New York and return, and the 5 days spent in New York are not 
considered travel outside the United States away from home and, thus, 
are disregarded for purposes of this section. Although the time spent 
outside the United States away from home exceeded 1 week, the time 
outside the United States away from home attributable to nonbusiness 
activities (5 days out of 21) was less than 25 percent of the total time 
outside the United States away from home during the trip. Therefore, the 
disallowance rules of this section do not apply.
    Example 4. D, an employee of Y Company, who is neither a managing 
executive of, nor related to, Y Company within the meaning of paragraph 
(f)(5)(i) of this section, traveled outside the United States away from 
home on behalf of his employer and was reimbursed by Y for his traveling 
expense to and from the business destination. The trip took more than a 
week and D took advantage of the opportunity to enjoy a personal 
vacation which exceeded 25 percent of the total time on the trip. Since 
D, traveling under a reimbursement arrangement, is not a managing 
executive of, or related to, Y Company, he is not considered to have 
substantial control over the arranging of the business trip, and the 
travel expenses shall be considered fully allocable to business 
activity.
    Example 5. E, a managing executive and principal shareholder of X 
Company, travels from New York to Stockholm, Sweden, to attend a series 
of business meetings. At the conclusion of the series of meetings, which 
last 1 week, E spends 1 week on a personal vacation in Stockholm. If E 
establishes either that he did not have substantial control over the 
arranging of the trip or that a major consideration in his determining 
to make the trip was not to provide an opportunity for taking a personal 
vacation, the entire travel expense to and from Stockholm shall be 
considered fully allocable to business activity.
    Example 6. F, a self-employed professional man, flew from New York 
to Copenhagen, Denmark, to attend a convention sponsored by a 
professional society. The trip lasted 3 weeks, of which 2 weeks were 
spent on vacation in Europe. F generally would be regarded as having 
substantial control over arranging this business trip. Unless F can 
establish that obtaining a vacation was not a major consideration in 
determining to make the trip, the disallowance rules of this section 
apply.
    Example 7. Taxpayer G flew from Chicago to New York where he spent 6 
days on business. He then flew to London where he conducted business for 
2 days. G then flew to Paris for a 5 day vacation after which he flew 
back to Chicago, with a scheduled landing in New York for the purpose of 
adding and discharging passengers. G would not have made the trip except 
for the business he had to conduct in London. The travel outside the 
United States away from home, including 2 days for travel en route, 
exceeded a week and the time devoted to nonbusiness activities was not 
less than 25 percent of the total time on such travel. The 2 days spent 
traveling from Chicago to New York and return, and the 6 days spent in 
New York are disregarded for purposes of determining whether the travel 
outside the United States away from home exceeded a week and whether the 
time devoted to nonbusiness activities was less than 25 percent of the 
total time outside the United States away from home. If G is unable to 
establish either that he did not have substantial control over the 
arranging of the business trip or that an opportunity for taking a 
personal vacation was not a major consideration in his determining to 
make the trip, 5/9ths (5 days devoted to nonbusiness activities out of a 
total 9 days outside the United States away from home on the trip) of 
the expenses attributable to transportation and food from New York to 
London and from London to New York will be disallowed (unless G 
establishes that a different method of allocation more clearly reflects 
the portion of time outside the United States away from home which is 
attributable to nonbusiness activity).

    (h) Cross reference. For rules with respect to whether an expense is 
travel or entertainment, see paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of Sec. 1.274-2.

<R05>
Sec. 1.274-5T  Substantiation requirements (temporary).

    (a) In general. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 
1986, no deduction or credit shall be allowed with respect to--
    (1) Traveling away from home (including meals and lodging),

[[Page 543]]

    (2) Any activity which is of a type generally considered to 
constitute entertainment, amusement, or recreation, or with respect to a 
facility used in connection with such an activity, including the items 
specified in section 274(e),
    (3) Gifts defined in section 274(b), or
    (4) Any listed property (as defined in section 280F(d)(4) and 
Sec. 1.280F-6T(b)), unless the taxpayer substantiates each element of 
the expenditure or use (as described in paragraph (b) of this section) 
in the manner provided in paragraph (c) of this section. This limitation 
supersedes the doctrine found in Cohan v. Commissioner, 39 F. 2d 540 (2d 
Cir. 1930). The decision held that, where the evidence indicated a 
taxpayer incurred deductible travel or entertainment expenses but the 
exact amount could not be determined, the court should make a close 
approximation and not disallow the deduction entirely. Section 274(d) 
contemplates that no deduction or credit shall be allowed a taxpayer on 
the basis of such approximations or unsupported testimony of the 
taxpayer. For purposes of this section, the term entertainment means 
entertainment, amusement, or recreation, and use of a facility therefor; 
and the term expenditure includes expenses and items (including items 
such as losses and depreciation).
    (b) Elements of an expenditure or use--(1) In general. Section 
274(d) and this section contemplate that no deduction or credit shall be 
allowed for travel, entertainment, a gift, or with respect to listed 
property unless the taxpayer substantiates the requisite elements of 
each expenditure or use as set forth in this paragraph (b).
    (2) Travel away from home. The elements to be provided with respect 
to an expenditure for travel away from home are--
    (i) Amount. Amount of each separate expenditure for traveling away 
from home, such as cost of transportation or lodging, except that the 
daily cost of the traveler's own breakfast, lunch, and dinner and of 
expenditures incidental to such travel may be aggregated, if set forth 
in reasonable categories, such as for meals, for gasoline and oil, and 
for taxi fares;
    (ii) Time. Dates of departure and return for each trip away from 
home, and number of days away from home spent on business;
    (iii) Place. Destinations or locality of travel, described by name 
of city or town or other similar designation; and
    (iv) Business purpose. Business reason for travel or nature of the 
business benefit derived or expected to be derived as a result of 
travel.
    (3) Entertainment in general. The elements to be proved with respect 
to an expenditure for entertainment are--
    (i) Amount. Amount of each separate expenditure for entertainment, 
except that such incidental items as taxi fares or telephone calls may 
be aggregated on a daily basis;
    (ii) Time. Date of entertainment;
    (iii) Place. Name, if any, address or location, and destination of 
type of entertainment, such as dinner or theater, if such information is 
not apparent from the designation of the place;
    (iv) Business purpose. Business reason for the entertainment or 
nature of business benefit derived or expected to be derived as a result 
of the entertainment and, except in the case of business meals described 
in section 274(e)(1), the nature of any business discussion or activity;
    (v) Business relationship. Occupation or other information relating 
to the person or persons entertained, including name, title, or other 
designation, sufficient to establish business relationship to the 
taxpayer.
    (4) Entertainment directly preceding or following a substantial and 
bona fide business discussion. If a taxpayer claims a deduction for 
entertainment directly preceding or following a substantial and bona 
fide business discussion on the ground that such entertainment was 
associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business, 
the elements to be proved with respect to such expenditure, in addition 
to those enumerated in paragraph (b)(3) (i), (ii), (iii), and (v) of 
this section are--
    (i) Time. Date and duration of business discussion;
    (ii) Place. Place of business discussion;
    (iii) Business purpose. Nature of business discussion, and business 
reason for

[[Page 544]]

the entertainment or nature of business benefit derived or expected to 
be derived as the result of the entertainment.
    (iv) Business relationship. Identification of those persons 
entertained who participated in the business discussion.
    (5) Gifts. The elements to be proved with respect to an expenditure 
for a gift are--
    (i) Amount. Cost of the gift to the taxpayer;
    (ii) Time. Date of the gift;
    (iii) Description. Description of the gift;
    (iv) Business purpose. Business reason for the gift or nature of 
business benefit derived or expected to be derived as a result of the 
gift; and
    (v) Business relationship. Occupation or other information relating 
to the recipient of the gift, including name, title, or other 
designation, sufficient to establish business relationship to the 
taxpayer.
    (6) Listed property. The elements to be proved with respect to any 
listed property are--
    (i) Amount--(A) Expenditures. The amount of each separate 
expenditure with respect to an item of listed property, such as the cost 
of acquisition, the cost of capital improvements, lease payments, the 
cost of maintenance and repairs, or other expenditures, and
    (B) Uses. The amount of each business/investment use (as defined in 
Sec. 1.280F-6T (d)(3) and (e)), based on the appropriate measure (i.e., 
mileage for automobiles and other means of transportation and time for 
other listed property, unless the Commissioner approves an alternative 
method), and the total use of the listed property for the taxable 
period.
    (ii) Time. Date of the expenditure or use with respect to listed 
property, and
    (iii) Business or investment purpose. The business purpose for an 
expenditure or use with respect to any listed property (see Sec. 1.274-
5T(c)(6)(i) (B) and (C) for special rules for the aggregation of 
expenditures and business use and Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(2) for the 
distinction between qualified business use and business/investment use).

See also Sec. 1.274-5T(e) relating to the substantiation of business use 
of employer-provided listed property and Sec. 1.274-6T for special rules 
for substantiating the business/investment use of certain types of 
listed property.
    (c) Rules of substantiation--(1) In general. Except as otherwise 
provided in this section and Sec. 1.274-6T, a taxpayer must substantiate 
each element of an expenditure or use (described in paragraph (b) of 
this section) by adequate records or by sufficient evidence 
corroborating his own statement. Section 274(d) contemplates that a 
taxpayer will maintain and produce such substantiation as will 
constitute proof of each expenditure or use referred to in section 274. 
Written evidence has considerably more probative value than oral 
evidence alone. In addition, the probative value of written evidence is 
greater the closer in time it relates to the expenditure or use. A 
contemporaneous log is not required, but a record of the elements of an 
expenditure or of a business use of listed property made at or near the 
time of the expenditure or use, supported by sufficient documentary 
evidence, has a high degree of credibility not present with respect to a 
statement prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of 
accurate recall. Thus, the corroborative evidence required to support a 
statement not make at or near the time of the expenditure or use must 
have a high degree of probative value to elevate such statement and 
evidence to the level of credibility reflected by a record made at or 
near the time of the expenditure or use supported by sufficient 
documentary evidence. The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) 
are designed to encourage taxpayers to maintain the records, together 
with documentary evidence, as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) Substantiation by adequate records--(i) In general. To meet the 
``adequate records'' requirements of section 274(d), a taxpayer shall 
maintain an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheets, 
or similar record (as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section), 
and documentary evidence (as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this 
section) which, in combination, are sufficient to establish each element 
of an expenditure or use

[[Page 545]]

specified in paragraph (b) of this section. It is not necessary to 
record information in an account book, diary, log, statement of expense, 
trip sheet, or similar record which duplicates information reflected on 
a receipt so long as the account book, etc. and receipt complement each 
other in an orderly manner.
    (ii) Account book, diary, etc. An account book, diary, log, 
statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record must be prepared or 
maintained in such manner that each recording of an element of an 
expenditure or use is made at or near the time of the expenditure or 
use.
    (A) Made at or near the time of the expenditure or use. For purposes 
of this section, the phrase made at or near the time of the expenditure 
or use means the element of an expenditure or use are recorded at a time 
when, in relation to the use or making of an expenditure, the taxpayer 
has full present knowledge of each element of the expenditure or use, 
such as the amount, time, place, and business purpose of the expenditure 
and business relationship. An expense account statement which is a 
transcription of an account book, diary, log, or similar record prepared 
or maintained in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph 
(c)(2)(ii) shall be considered a record prepared or maintained in the 
manner prescribed in the preceding sentence if such expense account 
statement is submitted by an employee to his employer or by an 
independent contractor to his client or customer in the regular course 
of good business practice. For example, a log maintained on a weekly 
basis, which accounts for use during the week, shall be considered a 
record made at or near the time of such use.
    (B) Substantiation of business purpose. In order to constitute an 
adequate record of business purpose within the meaning of section 274(d) 
and this paragraph (c)(2), a written statement of business purpose 
generally is required. However, the degree of substantiation necessary 
to establish business purpose will vary depending upon the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Where the business purpose is evident from 
the surrounding facts and circumstances, a written explanation of such 
business purpose will not be required. For example, in the case of a 
salesman calling on customers on an established sales route, a written 
explanation of the business purpose of such travel ordinarily will not 
be required. Similarly, in the case of a business meal described in 
section 274(e)(1), if the business purpose of such meal is evident from 
the business relationship to the taxpayer of the persons entertained and 
other surrounding circumstances, a written explanation of such business 
purpose will not be required.
    (C) Substantiation of business use of listed property--(1) Degree of 
substantiation. In order to constitute an adequate record (within the 
meaning of section 274(d) and this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)), which 
substantiates business/investment use of listed property (as defined in 
Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(3)), the record must contain sufficient information as 
to each element of every business/investment use. However, the level of 
detail required in an adequate record to substantiate business/
investment use may vary depending upon the facts and circumstances. For 
example, a taxpayer who uses a truck for both business and personal 
purposes and whose only business use of a truck is to make deliveries to 
customers on an established route may satisfy the adequate record 
requirement by recording the total number miles driven during the 
taxable year, the length of the delivery route once, and the date of 
each trip at or near the time of the trips. Alternatively, the taxpayer 
may establish the date of each trip with a receipt, record of delivery, 
or other documentary evidence.
    (2) Written record. Generally, an adequate record must be written. 
However, a record of the business use of listed property, such as a 
computer or automobile, prepared in a computer memory device with the 
aid of a logging program will constitute an adequate record.
    (D) Confidential information. If any information relating to the 
elements of an expenditure or use, such as place, business purpose, or 
business relationship, is of a confidential nature, such information 
need not be set forth in the account book, diary, log, statement of 
expense, trip sheet, or similar

[[Page 546]]

record, provided such information is recorded at or near the time of the 
expenditure or use and is elsewhere available to the district director 
to substantiate such element of the expenditure or use.
    (iii) Documentary evidence. Documentary evidence, such as receipts, 
paid bills, or similar evidence sufficient to support an expenditure 
shall be required for--
    (A) Any expenditure for lodging while traveling away from home, and
    (B) Any other expenditure of $75 or more ($25 or more for 
expenditures incurred before October 1, 1995) except, for transportation 
charges, documentary evidence will not be required if not readily 
available, provided, however, that the Commissioner, in his discretion, 
may prescribe rules waiving such requirements in circumstances where he 
determines it is impracticable for such documentary evidence to be 
required. Ordinarily, documentary evidence will be considered adequate 
to support an expenditure if it includes sufficient information to 
establish the amount, date, place, and the essential character of the 
expenditure. For example, a hotel receipt is sufficient to support 
expenditures for business travel if it contains the following: name, 
location, date, and separate amounts for charges such as for lodging, 
meals, and telephone. Similarly, a restaurant receipt is sufficient to 
support an expenditure for a business meal if it contains the following: 
name and location of the restaurant, the date and amount of the 
expenditure, the number of people served, and, if a charge is made for 
an item other than meals and beverages, an indication that such is the 
case. A document may be indicative of only one (or part of one) element 
of an expenditure. Thus, a cancelled check together with a bill from the 
payee, ordinarily would establish the element of cost. In contrast, a 
cancelled check drawn payable to a named payee would not by itself 
support a business expenditure without other evidence showing that the 
check was used for a certain business purpose.
    (iv) Retention of written evidence. The Commissioner may, in his 
discretion, prescribe rules under which an employer may dispose of the 
adequate records and documentary evidence submitted to him by employees 
who are required to, and do, make an adequate accounting to the employer 
(within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4) of this section) if the employer 
maintains adequate accounting procedures with respect to such employees 
(within the meaning of paragraph (f)(5) of this section.
    (v) Substantial compliance. If a taxpayer has not fully 
substantiated a particular element of an expenditure or use, but the 
taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that 
he has substantially complied with the ``adequate records'' requirements 
of this paragraph (c)(2) with respect to the expenditure or use, the 
taxpayer may be permitted to establish such element by evidence which 
the district director shall deem adequate.
    (3) Substantiation by other sufficient evidence--(i) In general. If 
a taxpayer fails to establish to the satisfaction of the district 
director that he has substantially complied with the ``adequate 
records'' requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section with respect 
to an element of an expenditure or use, then, except as otherwise 
provided in this paragraph, the taxpayer must establish such element--
    (A) By his own statement, whether written or oral, containing 
specific information in detail as to such element; and
    (B) By other corrobative evidence sufficient to establish such 
element.

If such element is the description of a gift, or the cost or amount, 
time, place, or date of an expenditure or use, the corrobative evidence 
shall be direct evidence, such as a statement in writing or the oral 
testimony of persons entertained or other witnesses setting forth 
detailed information about such element, or the documentary evidence 
described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If such element is either 
the business relationship to the taxpayer of persons entertained, or the 
business purpose of an expenditure, the corrobative evidence may be 
circumstantial evidence.
    (ii) Sampling--(A) In general. Except as provided in paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a taxpayer may maintain an adequate 
record for portions of a

[[Page 547]]

taxable year and use that record to substantiate the business/investment 
use of listed property for all or a portion of the taxable year if the 
taxpayer can demonstrate by other evidence that the periods for which an 
adequate record is maintained are representative of the use for the 
taxable year or a portion thereof.
    (B) Exception for pooled vehicles. The sampling method of paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section may not be used to substantiate the 
business/investment use of an automobile or other vehicle of an employer 
that is made available for use by more than one employee for all or a 
portion of a taxable year.
    (C) Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph 
(c)(3)(ii).

    Example 1. A, a sole proprietor and calendar year taxpayer, operates 
an interior decorating business out of her home. A uses an automobile 
for local business travel to visit the homes or offices of clients, to 
meet with suppliers and other subcontractors, and to pick up and deliver 
certain items to clients when feasible. There is no other business use 
of the automobile but A and other members of her family also use the 
automobile for personal purposes. A maintains adequate records for the 
first three months of 1986 that indicate that 75 percent of the use of 
the automobile was in A's business. Invoices from subcontractors and 
paid bills indicate that A's business continued at approximately the 
same rate for the remainder of 1986. If other circumstances do not 
change (e.g., A does not obtain a second car for exclusive use in her 
business), the determination that the business/investment use of the 
automobile for the taxable year is 75 percent is based on sufficient 
corroborative evidence.
    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that A 
maintains adequate records during the first week of every month, which 
indicate that 75 percent of the use of the automobile is in A's 
business. The invoices from A's business indicate that A's business 
continued at the same rate during the subsequent weeks of each month so 
that A's weekly records are representative of each month's business use 
of the automobile. Thus, the determination that the business/investment 
use of the automobile for the taxable year is 75 percent is based on 
sufficient corroborative evidence.
    Example 3. B, a sole proprietor and calendar year taxpayer, is a 
salesman in a large metropolitan area for a company that manufactures 
household products. For the first three weeks of each month, B uses his 
own automobile occasionally to travel within the metropolitan area on 
business. During these three weeks, B's use of the automobile for 
business purposes does not follow a consistent pattern from day to day 
or week to week. During the fourth week of each month, B delivers to his 
customers all the orders taken during the previous month. B's use of his 
automobile for business purposes, as substantiated by adequate records, 
is 70 percent of the total use during that fourth week. In this example, 
a determination based on the records maintained during that fourth week 
that the business/investment use of the automobile for the taxable year 
is 70 percent is not based on sufficient corroborative evidence because 
use during this week is not representative of use during other periods.

    (iii) Special rules. See Sec. 1.274-6T for special rules for 
substantiation by sufficient corroborating evidence with respect to 
certain listed property.
    (4) Substantiation in exceptional circumstances. If a taxpayer 
establishes that, by reason of the inherent nature of the situation--
    (i) He was unable to obtain evidence with respect to an element of 
the expenditure or use which conforms fully to the ``adequate records'' 
requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section,
    (ii) He is unable to obtain evidence with respect to such element 
which conforms fully to the ``other sufficient evidence'' requirements 
of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and
    (iii) He has presented other evidence, with respect to such element, 
which possesses the highest degree of probative value possible under the 
circumstances, such other evidence shall be considered to satisfy the 
substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this paragraph.
    (5) Loss of records due to circumstances beyond control of the 
taxpayer. Where the taxpayer establishes that the failure to produce 
adequate records is due to the loss of such records through 
circumstances beyond the taxpayer's control, such as destruction by 
fire, flood, earthquake, or other casualty, the taxpayer shall have a 
right to substantiate a deduction by reasonable reconstruction of his 
expenditures or use.
    (6) Special rules--(i) Separate expenditure or use--(A) In general. 
For the purposes of this section, each separate payment or use by the 
taxpayer shall ordinarily be considered to constitute a separate 
expenditure. However, concurrent or repetitious expenses or uses

[[Page 548]]

may be substantiated as a single item. To illustrate the above rules, 
where a taxpayer entertains a business guest at dinner and thereafter at 
the theater, the payment for dinner shall be considered to constitute 
one expenditure and the payment for the tickets for the theater shall be 
considered to constitute a separate expenditure. Similarly, if during a 
day of business travel a taxpayer makes separate payments for breakfast, 
lunch, and dinner, he shall be considered to have made three separate 
expenditures. However, if during entertainment at a cocktail lounge the 
taxpayer pays separately for each serving of refreshments, the total 
amount expended for the refreshments will be treated as a single 
expenditure. A tip may be treated as a separate expenditure.
    (B) Aggregation of expenditures. Except as otherwise provided in 
this section, the account book, diary, log, statement of expense, trip 
sheet, or similar record required by paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section shall be maintained with respect to each separate expenditure 
and not with respect to aggregate amounts for two or more expenditures. 
Thus, each expenditure for such items as lodging and air or rail travel 
shall be recorded as a separate item and not aggregated. However, at the 
option of the taxpayer, amounts expended for breakfast, lunch, or 
dinner, may be aggregated. A tip or gratuity which is related to an 
underlying expense may be aggregated with such expense. In addition, 
amounts expended in connection with the use of listed property during a 
taxable year, such as for gasoline or repairs for an automobile, may be 
aggregated. If these expenses are aggregated, the taxpayer must 
establish the date and amount, but need not prove the business purpose 
of each expenditure. Instead, the taxpayer may prorate the expenses 
based on the total business use of the listed property. For other 
provisions permitting recording of aggregate amounts in an account book, 
diary, log, statement of expense, trip sheet, or similar record, see 
paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(3) of this section (relating to incidental 
costs of travel and entertainment).
    (C) Aggregation of business use. Uses which may be considered part 
of a single use, for example, a round trip or uninterrupted business 
use, may be accounted for by a single record. For example, use of a 
truck to make deliveries at several different locations which begins and 
ends at the business premises and which may include a stop at the 
business premises in between two deliveries may be accounted for by a 
single record of miles driven. In addition, use of a passenger 
automobile by a salesman for a business trip away from home over a 
period of time may be accounted for by a single record of miles 
traveled. De minimis personal use (such as a stop for lunch on the way 
between two business stops) is not an interruption of business use.
    (ii) Allocation of expenditure. For purposes of this section, if a 
taxpayer has established the amount of an expenditure, but is unable to 
establish the portion of such amount which is attributable to each 
person participating in the event giving rise to the expenditure, such 
amount shall ordinarily be allocated to each participant on a pro rata 
basis, if such determination is material. Accordingly, the total number 
of persons for whom a travel or entertainment expenditure is incurred 
must be established in order to compute the portion of the expenditure 
allocable to such person.
    (iii) Primary use of a facility. Section 274(a) (1)(B) and (2)(C) 
deny a deduction for any expenditure paid or incurred before January 1, 
1979, with respect to a facility, or paid or incurred before January 1, 
1994, with respect to a club, used in connection with an entertainment 
activity unless the taxpayer establishes that the facility (including a 
club) was used primarily for the furtherance of the taxpayer's trade or 
business. A determination whether a facility before January 1, 1979, or 
a club before January 1, 1994, was used primarily for the furtherance of 
the taxpayer's trade or business will depend upon the facts and 
circumstances of each case. In order to establish that a facility was 
used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or business, the 
taxpayer shall maintain records of the use of the facility, the cost of 
using the facility, mileage or its equivalent

[[Page 549]]

(if appropriate), and such other information as shall tend to establish 
such primary use. Such records of use shall contain--
    (A) For each use of the facility claimed to be in furtherance of the 
taxpayer's trade or business, the elements of an expenditure specified 
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and
    (B) For each use of the facility not in furtherance of the 
taxpayer's trade or business, an appropriate description of such use, 
including cost, date, number of persons entertained, nature of 
entertainment and, if applicable, information such as mileage or its 
equivalent. A notation such as ``personal use'' or ``family use'' would, 
in the case of such use, be sufficient to describe the nature of 
entertainment.

If a taxpayer fails to maintain adequate records concerning a facility 
which is likely to serve the personal purposes of the taxpayer, it shall 
be presumed that the use of such facility was primarily personal.
    (iv) Additional information. In a case where it is necessary to 
obtain additional information, either--
    (A) To clarify information contained in records, statements, 
testimony, or documentary evidence submitted by a taxpayer under the 
provisions of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, or
    (B) To establish the reliability or accuracy of such records, 
statements, testimony, or documentary evidence, the district director 
may, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, obtain such 
additional information by personal interview or otherwise as he 
determines necessary to implement properly the provisions of section 274 
and the regulations thereunder.
    (7) Specific exceptions. Except as otherwise prescribed by the 
Commissioner, substantiation otherwise required by this paragraph is not 
required for--
    (i) Expenses described in section 274(e)(2) relating to food and 
beverages for employees, section 274(e)(3) relating to expenses treated 
as compensation, section 274(e)(8) relating to items available to the 
public, and section 274(e)(9) relating to entertainment sold to 
customers, and
    (ii) Expenses described in section 274(e)(5) relating to 
recreational, etc., expenses for employees, except that a taxpayer shall 
keep such records or other evidence as shall establish that such 
expenses were for activities (or facilities used in connection 
therewith) primarily for the benefit of employees other than employees 
who are officers, shareholders or other owners (as defined in section 
274(e)(5)), or highly compensated employees.
    (d) Disclosure on returns--(1) In general. The Commissioner may, in 
his discretion, prescribe rules under which any taxpayer claiming a 
deduction or credit for entertainment, gifts, travel, or with respect to 
listed property, or any other person receiving advances, reimbursements, 
or allowances for such items, shall make disclosure on his tax return 
with respect to such items. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply 
notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.
    (2) Business use of passenger automobiles and other vehicles. (i) On 
returns for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1984, taxpayers 
that claim a deduction or credit with respect to any vehicle are 
required to answer certain questions providing information about the use 
of the vehicle. The information required on the tax return relates to 
mileage (total, business, commuting, and other personal mileage), 
percentage of business use, date placed in service, use of other 
vehicles, after-work use, whether the taxpayer has evidence to support 
the business use claimed on the return, and whether or not the evidence 
is written.
    (ii) Any employer that provides the use of a vehicle to an employee 
must obtain information from the employee sufficient to complete the 
employer's tax return. Any employer that provides more than five 
vehicles to its employees need not include any information on its 
return. The employer, instead, must obtain the information from its 
employees, indicate on its return that it has obtained the information, 
and retain the information received. Any employer--
    (A) That can satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1.274-6T(a)(2), 
relating to vehicles not used for personal purposes,
    (B) That can satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1.274-6T(a)(3), 
relating to vehicles

[[Page 550]]

not used for personal purposes other than commuting, or
    (C) That treats all use of vehicles by employees as personal use 
need not obtain information with respect to those vechicles, but instead 
must indicate on its return that it has vehicles exempt from the 
requirements of this paragraph (d)(2).
    (3) Business use of other listed property. On returns for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1984, taxpayers that claim a 
deduction or credit with respect to any listed property other than a 
vehicle (for example, a yacht, airplane, or certain computers) are 
required to provide the following information:
    (i) The date that the property was placed in service,
    (ii) The percentage of business use,
    (iii) Whether evidence is available to support the percentage of 
business use claimed on the return, and
    (iv) Whether the evidence is written.
    (e) Substantiation of the business use of listed property made 
available by an employer for use by an employee--(1) Employee--(i) In 
general. An employee may not exclude from gross income as a working 
condition fringe any amount of the value of the availability of listed 
property provided by an employer to the employee, unless the employee 
substantiates for the period of availability the amount of the exclusion 
in accordance with the requirements of section 274(d) and either this 
section or Sec. 1.274-6T.
    (ii) Vehicles treated as used entirely for personal purposes. If an 
employer includes the value of the availability of a vehicle (as defined 
in Sec. 1.61-21(e)(2)) in an employee's gross income without taking into 
account any exclusion for a working condition fringe allowable under 
section 132 and the regulations thereunder with respect to the vehicle, 
the employee must substantiate any deduction claimed under Secs. 1.162-
25 and 1.162-25T for the business/investment use of the vehicle in 
accordance with the requirements of section 274(d) and either this 
section or Sec. 1.274-6T.
    (2) Employer--(i) In general. An employer substantiates its 
business/investment use of listed property by showing either--
    (A) That, based on evidence that satisfies the requirements of 
section 274(d) or statements submitted by employees that summarize such 
evidence, all or a portion of the use of the listed property is by 
employees in the employer's trade or business and, if any employee used 
the property for personal purposes, the employer included an appropriate 
amount in the employee's income, or
    (B) In the case of a vehicle, the employer treats all use by 
employees as personal use and includes an appropriate amount in the 
employees' income.
    (ii) Reliance on employee records. For purposes of substantiating 
the business/investment use of listed property that an employer provides 
to an employee and for purposes of the information required by paragraph 
(d)(2) and (3) of this section, the employer may rely on adequate 
records maintained by the employee or on the employee's own statement if 
corroborated by other sufficient evidence unless the employer knows or 
has reason to know that the statement, records, or other evidence are 
not accurate. The employer must retain a copy of the adequate records 
maintained by the employee or the other sufficient evidence, if 
available. Alternatively, the employer may rely on a statement submitted 
by the employee that provides sufficient information to allow the 
employer to determine the business/investment use of the property unless 
the employer knows or has reason to know that the statement is not based 
on adequate records or on the employee's own statement corroborated by 
other sufficient evidence. If the employer relies on the employee's 
statement, the employer must retain only a copy of the statement. The 
employee must retain a copy of the adequate records or other evidence.
    (f) Reporting and substantiation of expenses of certain employees 
for travel, entertainment, gifts, and with respect to listed property--
(1) In general. The purpose of this paragraph is to provide rules for 
reporting and substantiation of certain expenses paid or incurred by 
employees in connection with the performance of services as employees. 
For purposes of this paragraph, the term business expenses means 
ordinary and necessary

[[Page 551]]

expenses for travel, entertainment, gifts, or with respect to listed 
property which are deductible under section 162, and the regulations 
thereunder, to the extent not disallowed by section 262, 274(c), and 
280F. Thus, the term business expenses does not include personal, 
living, or family expenses disallowed by section 262, travel expenses 
disallowed by section 274(c), or cost recovery deductions and credits 
with respect to listed property disallowed by section 280F(d)(3) because 
the use of such property is not for the convenience of the employer and 
required as a condition of employment. Except as provided in paragraph 
(f)(2), advances, reimbursements, or allowances for such expenditures 
must be reported as income by the employee.
    (2) Reporting of expenses for which the employee is required to make 
an adequate accounting to his employer--(i) Reimbursements equal to 
expenses. For purposes of computing tax liability, an employee need not 
report on his tax return business expenses for travel, transportation, 
entertainment, gifts, or with respect to listed property, paid or 
incurred by him solely for the benefit of his employer for which he is 
required to, and does, make an adequate accounting to his employer (as 
defined in paragraph (f)(4) of this section) and which are charged 
directly or indirectly to the employer (for example, through credit 
cards) or for which the employee is paid through advances, 
reimbursements, or otherwise, provided that the total amount of such 
advances, reimbursements, and charges is equal to such expenses.
    (ii) Reimbursements in excess of expenses. In case the total of the 
amounts charged directly or indirectly to the employer or received from 
the employer as advances, reimbursements, or otherwise, exceeds the 
business expenses paid or incurred by the employee and the employee is 
required to, and does, make an adequate accounting to his employer for 
such expenses, the employee must include such excess (including amounts 
received for expenditures not deductible by him) in income.
    (iii) Expenses in excess of reimbursements. If an employee incurs 
deductible business expenses on behalf of his employer which exceed the 
total of the amounts charged directly or indirectly to the employer and 
received from the employer as advances, reimbursements, or otherwise, 
and the employee makes an adequate accounting to his employer, the 
employee must be able to substantiate any deduction for such excess with 
such records and supporting evidence as will substantiate each element 
of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this section) in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Reporting of expenses for which the employee is not required to 
make an adequate accounting to his employer. If the employee is not 
required to make an adequate accounting to his employer for his business 
expenses or, though required, fails to make an adequate accounting for 
such expenses, he must submit, as a part of his tax return, the 
appropriate form issued by the Internal Revenue Service for claiming 
deductions for employee business expenses (e.g., Form 2106, Employee 
Business Expenses, for 1985) and provide the information requested on 
that form, including the information required by paragraph (d)(2) and 
(3) of this section if the employee's business expenses are with respect 
to the use of listed property. In addition, the employee must maintain 
such records and supporting evidence as will substantiate each element 
of an expenditure or use (described in paragraph (b) of this section) in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) Definition of an ``adequate accounting'' to the employer--(i) In 
general. For purposes of this paragraph an adequate accounting means the 
submission to the employer of an account book, diary, log, statement of 
expense, trip sheet, or similar record maintained by the employee in 
which the information as to each element of an expenditure or use 
(described in paragraph (b) of this section) is recorded at or near the 
time of the expenditure or use, together with supporting documentary 
evidence, in a manner which conforms to all the ``adequate records'' 
requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. An adequate accounting 
requires that the employee account for all amounts received from his 
employer during the taxable year as advances, reimbursements, or 
allowances (including those

[[Page 552]]

charged directly or indirectly to the employer through credit cards or 
otherwise) for travel, entertainment, gifts, and the use of listed 
property. The methods of substantiation allowed under paragraph (c)(4) 
or (c)(5) of this section also will be considered to be an adequate 
accounting if the employer accepts an employee's substantiation and 
establishes that such substantiation meets the requirements of such 
paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5). For purposes of an adequate accounting, the 
method of substantiation allowed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section 
will not be permitted.
    (ii) Procedures for adequate accounting without documentary 
evidence. The Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe rules under 
which an employee may make an adequate accounting to his employer by 
submitting an account book, log, diary, etc., alone, without submitting 
documentary evidence.
    (iii) Employer. For purposes of this section, the term employer 
includes an agent of the employer or a third party payor who pays 
amounts to an employee under a reimbursement or other expense allowance 
arrangement.
    (5) Substantiation of expenditures by certain employees. An employee 
who makes an adequate accounting to his employer within the meaning of 
this paragraph will not again be required to substantiate such expense 
account information except in the following cases:
    (i) An employee whose business expenses exceed the total of amounts 
charged to his employer and amounts received through advances, 
reimbursements or otherwise and who claims a deduction on his return for 
such excess,
    (ii) An employee who is related to his employer within the meaning 
of section 267(b), but for this purpose the percentage referred to in 
section 267(b)(2) shall be 10 percent, and
    (iii) Employees in cases where it is determined that the accounting 
procedures used by the employer for the reporting and substantiation of 
expenses by such employees are not adequate, or where it cannot be 
determined that such procedures are adequate. The district director will 
determine whether the employer's accounting procedures are adequate by 
considering the facts and circumstances of each case, including the use 
of proper internal controls. For example, an employer should require 
that an expense account be verified and approved by a reasonable person 
other than the person incurring such expenses. Accounting procedures 
will be considered inadequate to the extent that the employer does not 
require an adequate accounting from his employees as defined in 
paragraph (f)(4) of this section, or does not maintain such 
substantiation. To the extent an employer fails to maintain adequate 
accounting procedures he will thereby obligate his employees to 
substantiate separately their expense account information.
    (g) Substantiation by reimbursement arrangements or per diem, 
mileage, and other traveling allowances. For guidance, see 
Sec. 1.274(d)-1.
    (h) Reporting and substantiation of certain reimbursements of 
persons other than employees--(1) In general. The purpose of this 
paragraph is to provide rules for the reporting and substantiation of 
certain expenses for travel, entertainment, gifts, or with respect to 
listed property paid or incurred by one person (hereinafter termed 
``independent contractor'') in connection with services performed for 
another person other than an employer (hereinafter termed ``client or 
customer'') under a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement 
with such client or customer. For purposes of this paragraph, the term 
business expenses means ordinary and necessary expenses for travel, 
entertainment, gifts, or with respect to listed property which are 
deductible under section 162, and the regulations thereunder, to the 
extent not disallowed by sections 262 and 274(c). Thus, the term 
business expenses does not include personal, living, or family expenses 
disallowed by section 262 or travel expenses disallowed by section 
274(c), and reimbursements for such expenditures must be reported as 
income by the independent contractor. For purposes of this paragraph, 
the term reimbursements means advances, allowances, or reimbursements 
received by an independent contractor for travel, entertainment, gifts, 
or with respect to listed property in connection with the performance by 
him of services for his

[[Page 553]]

client or customer, under a reimbursement or other expense allowance 
arrangement with his client or customer, and includes amounts charged 
directly or indirectly to the client or customer through credit card 
systems or otherwise. See paragraph (j) of this section relating to the 
substantiation of meal expenses while traveling away from home.
    (2) Substantiation by independent contractors. An independent 
contractor shall substantiate, with respect to his reimbursements, each 
element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this section) 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section; 
and, to the extent he does not so substantiate, he shall include such 
reimbursements in income. An independent contractor shall so 
substantiate a reimbursement for entertainment regardless of whether he 
accounts (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3) of this section) for 
such entertainment.
    (3) Accounting to a client or customer under section 274(e)(4)(B). 
Section 274(e)(4)(B) provides that section 274(a) (relating to 
disallowance of expenses for entertainment) shall not apply to 
expenditures for entertainment for which an independent contractor has 
been reimbursed if the independent contractor accounts to his client or 
customer, to the extent provided by section 274(d). For purposes of 
section 274(e)(4)(B), an independent contractor shall be considered to 
account to his client or customer for an expense paid or incurred under 
a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with his client 
or customer if, with respect to such expense for entertainment, he 
submits to his client or customer adequate records or other sufficient 
evidence conforming to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (4) Substantiation by client or customer. A client or customer shall 
not be required to substantiate, in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (c) of this section, reimbursements to an independent 
contractor for travel and gifts, or for entertainment unless the 
independent contractor has accounted to him (within the meaning of 
section 274(e)(4)(B) and paragraph (h)(3) of this section) for such 
entertainment. If an independent contractor has so accounted to a client 
or customer for entertainment, the client or customer shall substantiate 
each element of the expenditure (as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section) in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (i) [Reserved]
    (j) Authority for an optional method of computing meal expenses 
while traveling away from home. The Commissioner may establish a method 
under which a taxpayer may elect to use a specified amount or amounts 
for meals while traveling away from home in lieu of substantiating the 
actual cost of meals. The taxpayer would not be relieved of 
substantiating the actual cost of other travel expenses as well as the 
time, place, and business purpose of the travel. See paragraphs (b)(2) 
and (c) of this section.
    (k) Exceptions for qualified nonpersonal use vehicles--(1) In 
general. The substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this 
section do not apply to any qualified nonpersonal use vehicle (as 
defined in paragraph (k)(2) of this section).
    (2) Qualified nonpersonal use vehicle--(i) In general. For purposes 
of section 274(d) and this section, the term qualified nonpersonal use 
vehicle means any vehicle which, by reason of its nature (i.e., design), 
is not likely to be used more than a de minimis amount for personal 
purposes.
    (ii) List of vehicles. Vehicles which are qualified nonpersonal use 
vehicles include the following--
    (A) Clearly marked police and fire vehicles (as defined and to the 
extent provided in paragraph (k)(3) of this section),
    (B) Ambulances used as such or hearses used as such,
    (C) Any vehicle designed to carry cargo with a loaded gross vehicle 
weight over 14,000 pounds,
    (D) Bucket trucks (``cherry pickers''),
    (E) Cement mixers,
    (F) Combines,
    (G) Cranes and derricks,
    (H) Delivery trucks with seating only for the driver, or only for 
the driver plus a folding jump seat,
    (I) Dump trucks (including garbage trucks),

[[Page 554]]

    (J) Flatbed trucks,
    (K) Forklifts,
    (L) Passenger buses used as such with a capacity of at least 20 
passengers,
    (M) Qualified moving vans (as defined in paragraph (k)(4) of this 
section),
    (N) Qualified specialized utility repair trucks (as defined in 
paragraph (k)(5) of this section),
    (O) Refrigerated trucks,
    (P) School buses (as defined in section 4221(d)(7)(C)),
    (Q) Tractors and other special purpose farm vehicles,
    (R) Unmarked vehicles used by law enforcement officers (as defined 
in paragraph (k)(6) of this section) if the use is officially 
authorized, and
    (S) Such other vehicles as the Commissioner may designate.
    (3) Clearly marked police or fire vehicles. A police or fire vehicle 
is a vehicle, owned or leased by a governmental unit, or any agency or 
instrumentality thereof, that is required to be used for commuting by a 
police officer or fire fighter who, when not on a regular shift, is on 
call at all times, provided that any personal use (other than commuting) 
of the vehicle outside the limit of the police officer's arrest powers 
or the fire fighter's obligation to respond to an emergency is 
prohibited by such governmental unit. A police or fire vehicle is 
clearly marked if, through painted insignia or words, it is readily 
apparent that the vehicle is a police or fire vehicle. A marking on a 
license plate is not a clear marking for purposes of this paragraph (k).
    (4) Qualified moving van. The term qualified moving van means any 
truck or van used by a professional moving company in the trade or 
business of moving household or business goods if--
    (i) No personal use of the van is allowed other than for travel to 
and from a move site (or for de minimis personal use, such as a stop for 
lunch on the way between two move sites),
    (ii) Personal use for travel to and from a move site is an irregular 
practice (i.e., not more than five times a month on average), and
    (iii) Personal use is limited to situations in which it is more 
convenient to the employer, because of the location of the employee's 
residence in relation to the location of the move site, for the van not 
to be returned to the employer's business location.
    (5) Qualified specialized utility repair truck. The term qualified 
specialized utility repair truck means any truck (not including a van or 
pickup truck) specifically designed and used to carry heavy tools, 
testing equipment, or parts if--
    (i) The shelves, racks, or other permanent interior construction 
which has been installed to carry and store such heavy items is such 
that it is unlikely that the truck will be used more than a de minimis 
amount for personal purposes, and
    (ii) The employer requires the employee to drive the truck home in 
order to be able to respond in emergency situations for purposes of 
restoring or maintaining electricity, gas, telephone, water, sewer, or 
steam utility services.
    (6) Unmarked law enforcement vehicles--(i) In general. The 
substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this section do not 
apply to officially authorized uses of an unmarked vehicle by a ``law 
enforcement officer''. To qualify for this exception, any personal use 
must be authorized by the Federal, State, county, or local governmental 
agency or department that owns or leases the vehicle and employs the 
officer, and must be incident to law-enforcement functions, such as 
being able to report directly from home to a stakeout or surveillance 
site, or to an emergency situation. Use of an unmarked vehicle for 
vacation or recreation trips cannot qualify as an authorized use.
    (ii) Law enforcement officer. The term law enforcement officer means 
an individual who is employed on a full-time basis by a governmental 
unit that is responsible for the prevention or investigation of crime 
involving injury to persons or property (including apprehension or 
detention of persons for such crimes), who is authorized by law to carry 
firearms, execute search warrants, and to make arrests (other than 
merely a citizen's arrest), and who regularly carries firearms (except 
when it is not possible to do so because of the requirements of 
undercover work). The

[[Page 555]]

term law enforcement officer may include an arson investigator if the 
investigator otherwise meets the requirements of this paragraph 
(k)(6)(ii), but does not include Internal Revenue Service special 
agents.
    (7) Trucks and vans. The substantiation requirements of section 
274(d) and this section apply generally to any pickup truck or van, 
unless the truck or van has been specially modified with the result that 
it is not likely to be used more than a de minimis amount for personal 
purposes. For example, a van that has only a front bench for seating, in 
which permanent shelving that fills most of the cargo area has been 
installed, that constantly carries merchandise or equipment, and that 
has been specially painted with advertising or the company's name, is a 
vehicle not likely to be used more than a de minimis amount for personal 
purposes.
    (8) Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of 
paragraph (k)(3) and (6) of this section:

    Example 1. Detective C, who is a ``law enforcement officer'' 
employed by a state police department, headquartered in city M, is 
provided with an unmarked vehicle (equipped with radio communication) 
for use during off-duty hours because C must be able to communicate with 
headquarters and be available for duty at any time (for example, to 
report to a surveillance or crime site). The police department generally 
has officially authorized personal use of the vehicle by C but has 
prohibited use of the vehicle for recreational purposes or for personal 
purposes outside the state. Thus, C's use of the vehicle for commuting 
between headquarters or a surveillance site and home and for personal 
errands is authorized personal use as described in paragraph (k)(6)(i) 
of this section. With respect to these authorized uses, the vehicle is 
not subject to the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and the 
value of these uses is not included in C's gross income.
    Example 2. Detective T is a ``law enforcement officer'' employed by 
city M. T is authorized to make arrests only within M's city limits. T, 
along with all other officers on the force, is ordinarily on duty for 
eight hours each work day and on call during the other sixteen hours. T 
is provided with the use of a clearly marked police vehicle in which T 
is required to commute to his home in city M. The police department's 
official policy regarding marked police vehicles prohibits personal use 
(other than commuting) of the vehicles outside the city limits. When not 
using the vehicle on the job, T uses the vehicle only for commuting, 
personal errands on the way between work and home, and personal errands 
within city M. All use of the vehicle by T conforms to the requirements 
of paragraph (k)(3) of this section. Therefore, the value of that use is 
excluded from T's gross income as a working condition fringe and the 
vehicle is not subject to the substantiation requirements of section 
274(d).

    (l) Definitions. For purposes of section 274(d) and this section, 
the terms automobile and vehicle have the same meanings as prescribed in 
Sec. 1.61-21(d)(1)(ii) and Sec. 1.61-21(e)(2), respectively. Also, for 
purposes of section 274(d) and this section, the terms employer, 
``employee, and personal use have the same meanings as prescribed in 
Sec. 1.274-6T(e).
    (m) Effective date. Section 274(d), as amended by the Tax Reform Act 
of 1984 and Public Law 99-44, and this section (except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(2) and (3) of this section) apply with respect to taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 1985. Section 274(d) and this section 
apply to any deduction or credit claimed in a taxable year beginning 
after December 31, 1985, with respect to any listed property, regardless 
of the taxable year in which the property was placed in service. 
However, except as provided in Sec. 1.132-5(h) with respect to qualified 
nonpersonal use vehicles, the substantiation requirements of section 
274(d) and this section do not apply to the determination of an 
employee's working condition fringe exclusion or to the determination 
under Sec. 1.162-25(b) of an employee's deduction before the date that 
those requirements apply, under this paragraph (m), to the employer, if 
the employer is taxable.

<R05>
Sec. 1.274-6  Expenditures deductible without regard to trade or business or other income producing activity.

    The provisions of Secs. 1.274-1 through 1.274-5, inclusive, do not 
apply to any deduction allowable to the taxpayer without regard to its 
connection with the taxpayer's trade or business or

[[Page 556]]

other income producing activity. Examples of such items are interest, 
taxes such as real property taxes, and casualty losses. Thus, if a 
taxpayer owned a fishing camp, the taxpayer could still deduct mortgage 
interest and real property taxes in full even if deductions for its use 
are not allowable under section 274(a) and Sec. 1.274-2. In the case of 
a taxpayer which is not an individual, the provisions of this section 
shall be applied as if it were an individual. Thus, if a corporation 
sustains a casualty loss on an entertainment facility used in its trade 
or business, it could deduct the loss even though deductions for the use 
of the facility are not allowable.

[T.D. 8051, 50 FR 36576, Sept. 9, 1985]


<R05>
Sec. 1.274-6T  Substantiation with respect to certain types of listed property for taxable years beginning after 1985 (temporary).

    (a) Written policy statements as to vehicles--(1) In general. Two 
types of written policy statements satisfying the conditions described 
in paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section, if initiated and kept by an 
employer to implement a policy of no personal use, or no personal use 
except for commuting, of a vehicle provided by the employer, qualify as 
sufficient evidence corroborating the taxpayer's own statement and 
therefore will satisfy the employer's substantiation requirements under 
section 274(d). Therefore, the employee need not keep a separate set of 
records for purposes of the employer's substantiation requirements under 
section 274(d) with respect to use of a vehicle satisfying these written 
policy statement rules. A written policy statement adopted by a 
governmental unit as to employee use of its vehicles is eligible for 
these exceptions to the section 274(d) substantiation rules. Thus, a 
resolution of a city council or a provision of state law or a state 
constitution would qualify as a written policy statement, as long as the 
conditions described in paragraph (a)(2) and (3) of this section are 
met.
    (2) Vehicles not used for personal purposes--(i) Employers. A policy 
statement that prohibits personal use by an employee satisfies an 
employer's substantiation requirements under section 274(d) if all the 
following conditions are met--
    (A) The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided 
to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade 
or business,
    (B) When the vehicle is not used in the employer's trade or 
business, it is kept on the employer's business premises, unless it is 
temporarily located elsewhere, for example, for maintenance or because 
of a mechanical failure,
    (C) No employee using the vehicle lives at the employer's business 
premises,
    (D) Under a written policy of the employer, neither an employee, nor 
any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, may use the 
vehicle for personal purposes, except for de minimis personal use (such 
as a stop for lunch between two business deliveries), and
    (E) The employer reasonably believes that, except for de minimis 
use, neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable 
to the employee, uses the vehicle for any personal purpose.

There must also be evidence that would enable the Commissioner to 
determine whether the use of the vehicle meets the preceding five 
conditions.
    (ii) Employees. An employee, in lieu of substantiating the business/
investment use of an employer-provided vehicle under Sec. 1.274-5T, may 
treat all use of the vehicle as business/investment use if the following 
conditions are met--
    (A) The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided 
to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade 
or business,
    (B) When the vehicle is not used in the employer's trade or 
business, it is kept on the employer's business premises, unless it is 
temporarily located elsewhere, for example, for maintenance or because 
of a mechanical failure,
    (C) No employee using the vehicle lives at the employer's business 
premises,
    (D) Under a written policy of the employer, neither the employee, 
nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, may use 
the vehicle for personal purposes, except for de

[[Page 557]]

minimis personal use (such as a stop for lunch between two business 
deliveries), and
    (E) Except for de minimis personal use, neither the employee, nor 
any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, uses the 
vehicle for any personal purpose.

There must also be evidence that would enable the Commissioner to 
determine whether the use of the vehicle meets the preceding five 
conditions.
    (3) Vehicles not used for personal purposes other than commuting--
(i) Employers. A policy statement that prohibits personal use by an 
employee, other than commuting, satisfies an employer's substantiation 
requirements under section 274(d) if all the following conditions are 
met--
    (A) The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided 
to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade 
or business and is used in the employer's trade or business,
    (B) For bona fide noncompensatory business reasons, the employer 
requires the employee to commute to and/or from work in the vehicle,
    (C) The employer has established a written policy under which 
neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would be taxable to 
the employee, may use the vehicle for personal purposes, other than for 
commuting or de minimis personal use (such as a stop for a personal 
errand on the way between a business delivery and the employee's home),
    (D) The employer reasonably believes that, except for de minimis 
personal use, neither the employee, nor any individual whose use would 
be taxable to the employee, uses the vehicle for any personal purpose 
other than commuting,
    (E) The employee required to use the vehicle for commuting is not a 
control employee (as defined in Sec. 1.61-2T(f) (5) and (6)) required to 
use an automobile (as defined in Sec. 1.61-2T(d)(1)(ii)), and
    (F) The employer accounts for the commuting use by including in the 
employee's gross income the commuting value provided in Sec. 1.61-
2T(f)(3) (to the extent not reimbursed by the employee).

There must be evidence that would enable the Commissioner to determine 
whether the use of the vehicle met the preceding six conditions.
    (ii) Employees. An employee, in lieu of substantiating the business/
investment use of an employer-provided vehicle under Sec. 1.274-5T, may 
substantiate any exclusion allowed under section 132 for a working 
condition fringe by including in income the commuting value of the 
vehicle (determined by the employer pursuant to Sec. 1.61-2T(f)(3)) if 
all the following conditions are met:
    (A) The vehicle is owned or leased by the employer and is provided 
to one or more employees for use in connection with the employer's trade 
or business and is used in the employer's trade or business,
    (B) For bona fide noncompensatory business reasons, the employer 
requires the employee to commute to and/or from work in the vehicle,
    (C) Under a written policy of the employer, neither the employee, 
nor any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, may use 
the vehicle for personal purposes, other than for commuting or de 
minimis personal use (such as a stop for a personal errand on the way 
between a business delivery and the employee's home),
    (D) Except for de minimis personal use, neither the employee, nor 
any individual whose use would be taxable to the employee, uses the 
vehicle for any personal purpose other than commuting,
    (E) The employee required to use the vehicle for commuting is not a 
control employee (as defined in Sec. 1.61-2T(f) (5) and (6) required to 
use an automobile (as defined in Sec. 1.61-2T(d)(1)(ii)), and
    (F) The employee includes in gross income the commuting value 
determined by the employer as provided in Sec. 1.61-2T(f)(3) (to the 
extent that the employee does not reimburse the employer for the 
commuting use).

There must also be evidence that would enable the Commissioner to 
determine whether the use of the vehicle met the preceding six 
conditions.
    (b) Vehicles used in connection with the business of farming--(1) In 
general. If, during a taxable year or shorter period, a vehicle, not 
otherwise described in

[[Page 558]]

section 274(i), Sec. 1.274-5T(k), or paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this 
section, is owned or leased by an employer and used during most of a 
normal business day directly in connection with the business of farming 
(as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), the employer, in lieu 
of substantiating the use of the vehicle as prescribed in Sec. 1.274-
5T(b)(6)(i)(B), may determine any deduction or credit with respect to 
the vehicle as if the business/investment use (as defined in 
Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(3)(i)) and the qualified business use (as defined in 
Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(2)) of the vehicle in the business of farming for the 
taxable year or shorter period were 75 percent plus that percentage, if 
any, attributable to an amount included in an employee's gross income. 
If the vehicle is also available for personal use by employees, the 
employer must include the value of that personal use in the gross income 
of the employees, allocated among them in the manner prescribed in 
Sec. 1.132-5T(g).
    (2) Directly in connection with the business of farming. The phrase 
directly in connection with the business of farming means that the 
vehicle must be used directly in connection with the business of 
operating a farm (i.e., cultivating land or raising or harvesting any 
agricultural or horticultural commodity, or the raising, shearing, 
feeding, caring for, training, and management of animals) or incidental 
thereto (for example, trips to the feed and supply store).
    (3) Substantiation by employees. If an employee is provided with the 
use of a vehicle to which this paragraph (b) applies, the employee may, 
in lieu of substantiating the business/investment use of the vehicle in 
the manner prescribed in Sec. 1.274-5T, substantiate any exclusion 
allowed under section 132 for a working condition fringe as if the 
business/investment use of the vehicle were 75 percent, plus that 
percentage, if any, determined by the employer to be attributable to the 
use of the vehicle by individuals other than the employee, provided that 
the employee includes in gross income the amount determined by the 
employer as includible in the employee's gross income. See Sec. 1.132-
5T(g)(3) for examples illustrating the allocation of use of a vehicle 
among employees.
    (c) Vehicles treated as used entirely for personal purposes. An 
employer may satisfy the substantiation requirements under section 
274(d) for a taxable year or shorter period with respect to the business 
use of a vehicle that is provided to an employee by including the value 
of the availability of the vehicle during the relevant period in the 
employee's gross income without any exclusion for a working condition 
fringe with respect to the vehicle and, if required, by withholding any 
taxes. Under these circumstances, the employer's business/investment use 
of the vehicle during the relevant period is 100 percent. The employer's 
qualified business use of the vehicle is dependent upon the relationship 
of the employee to the employer (see Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(2)).
    (d) Limitation. If a taxpayer chooses to satisfy the substantiation 
requirements of section 274(d) and Sec. 1.274-5T by using one of the 
methods prescribed in paragraphs (a) (2) or (3), (b), or (c) of this 
section and files a return with the Internal Revenue Service for a 
taxable year consistent with such choice, the taxpayer may not later use 
another of these methods. Similarly, if a taxpayer chooses to satisfy 
the substantiation requirements of section 274(d) in the manner 
prescribed in Sec. 1.274-5T and files a return with the Internal Revenue 
Service for a taxable year consistent with such choice, the taxpayer may 
not later use a method prescribed in paragraph (a) (2) or (3), (b), or 
(c) of this section. This rule applies to an employee for purposes of 
substantiating any working condition fringe exclusion as well as to an 
employer. For example, if an employee excludes on his federal income tax 
return for a taxable year 90 percent of the value of the availability of 
an employer-provided automobile on the basis of records that allegedly 
satisfy the ``adequate records'' requirement of Sec. 1.274-5T(c)(2), and 
that requirement is not satisfied, then the employee may not satisfy the 
substantiation requirements of section 274(d) for the taxable year by 
any method prescribed in this section, but may present other 
corroborative evidence as prescribed in Sec. 1.274-5T(c)(3).

    (e) Definitions--(1) In general. The definitions provided in this 
paragraph (e) apply for purposes of section 274(d), Sec. 1.274-5T, and 
this section.
    (2) Employer and employee. The terms employer and employee include 
the following:
    (i) A sole proprietor shall be treated as both an employer and 
employee,
    (ii) A partnership shall be treated as an employer of its partners, 
and
    (iii) A partner shall be treated as an employee of the partnership.
    (3) Automobile. The term automobile has the same meaning as 
prescribed in Sec. 1.61-2T(d)(1)(ii).
    (4) Vehicle. The term vehicle has the same meaning as prescribed in 
Sec. 1.61-2T(e)(2).
    (5) Personal use. Personal use by an employee of an employer-
provided vehicle includes use in any trade or business other than the 
trade or business of being the employee of the employer providing the 
vehicle.
    (f) Effective date. This section is effective for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 1985.

Sec. 1.274-7   Treatment of certain expenditures with respect to entertainment-type facilities.

    If deductions are disallowed under Sec. 1.274-2 with respect to any 
portion of a facility, such portion shall be treated as an asset which 
is used for personal, living, and family purposes (and not as an asset 
used in a trade or business). Thus, the basis of such a facility will be 
adjusted for purposes of computing depreciation deductions and 
determining gain or loss on the sale of such facility in the same manner 
as other property (for example, a residence) which is regarded as used 
partly for business and partly for personal purposes.

Sec. 1.274(d)-1  Substantiation requirements.

    (a) Substantiation by reimbursement arrangements or per diem, 
mileage, and other traveling allowances--(1) In general. The 
Commissioner may, in his discretion, prescribe rules in pronouncements 
of general applicability under which allowances for expenses described 
in paragraph (a)(2) of this section will, if in accordance with 
reasonable business practice, be regarded as equivalent to 
substantiation by adequate records or other sufficient evidence for 
purposes of Sec. 1.274-5T(c) of the amount of such expenses and as 
satisfying, with respect to the amount of such expenses, the 
requirements of an adequate accounting to the employer for purposes of 
Sec. 1.274-5T(f)(4). If the total allowance received exceeds the 
deductible expenses paid or incurred by the employee, such excess must 
be reported as income on the employee's return. See Sec. 1.274-5T(j) 
relating to the substantiation of meal expenses while traveling away 
from home.
    (2) Allowances for expenses described. An allowance for expenses is 
described in this paragraph (a)(2) if it is a--
    (i) Reimbursement arrangement covering ordinary and necessary 
expenses of traveling away from home (exclusive of transportation 
expenses to and from destination);
    (ii) Per diem allowance providing for ordinary and necessary 
expenses of traveling away from home (exclusive of transportation costs 
to and from destination); or
    (iii) Mileage allowance providing for ordinary and necessary 
expenses of local travel and transportation while traveling away from 
home.
    (3) Limitation. A mileage allowance described in paragraph 
(a)(2)(iii) of this section is available only to the owner of a vehicle.
    (b) [Reserved]

<R05>
Sec. 1.276-1   Disallowance of deductions for certain indirect contributions to political parties.

    (a) In general. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no 
deduction shall be allowed for income tax purposes in respect of any 
amount paid or incurred after March 15, 1966, in a taxable year of the 
taxpayer beginning after December 31, 1965, for any expenditure to which 
paragraph (b)(1), (c), (d), or (e) of this section is applicable. 
Section 276 is a disallowance provision exclusively and does not make 
deductible any expenses which are not otherwise allowed under the Code. 
For certain other rules in respect of deductions for expenditures for 
political purposes, see Secs. 1.162-15(b), 1.162-20, and 1.271-1.
    (b) Advertising in convention program--(1) General rule. (i) Except 
as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, no deduction shall be 
allowed for an expenditure for advertising in a convention program of a 
political party. For purposes of this subparagraph it is immaterial who 
publishes the convention program or to whose use the proceeds of the 
program inure (or are intended to inure). A convention program is any 
written publication (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) which 
is distributed or displayed in connection with or at a political 
convention, conclave, or meeting. Under certain conditions payments to a 
committee organized for the purpose of bringing a political convention 
to an area are deductible under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.162-15. This 
rule is not affected by the provisions of this section. For example, 
such payments may be deductible notwithstanding the fact that the 
committee purchases from a political party the right to publish a 
pamphlet in connection with a convention and that the deduction of costs 
of advertising in the pamphlet is prohibited under this section.
    (ii) The application of the provisions of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. M Corporation publishes the convention program of the Y 
political party for a convention not described in subparagraph (2) of 
this paragraph. The corporation makes no payment of any kind to or on 
behalf of the party or any of its candidates and no part of the proceeds 
of the publication and sale of the program inures directly or indirectly 
to the benefit of any political party or candidate. P Corporation 
purchases an advertisement in the program. P Corporation may not deduct 
the cost of such advertisement.

    (2) Amounts paid or incurred on or after January 1, 1968, for 
advertising in programs of certain national political conventions. (i) 
Subject to the limitations in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a 
deduction may be allowed for any amount paid or incurred on or after 
January 1, 1968, for advertising in a convention program of a political 
party distributed in connection with a convention held for the purpose 
of nominating candidates for the offices of President and Vice President 
of the United States, if the proceeds from the program are actually used 
solely to defray the costs of conducting the convention (or are set 
aside for such use at the next convention of the party held for such 
purpose) and if the amount paid or incurred for the advertising is 
reasonable. If such amount is not reasonable or if any part of the 
proceeds is used for a purpose other than that of defraying such 
convention costs, no part of the amount is deductible. Whether or not an 
amount is reasonable shall be determined in light of the business the 
taxpayer may expect to receive either directly as a result of the 
advertising or as a result of the convention being held in an area in 
which the taxpayer has a principal place of business. For these 
purposes, an amount paid or incurred for advertising will not be 
considered as reasonable if it is greater than the amount which would be 
paid for comparable advertising in a comparable convention program of a 
nonpolitical organization. Institutional advertising (e.g., advertising 
of a type not designed to sell specific goods or services to persons 
attending the convention) is not advertising which may be expected to 
result directly in business for the taxpayer sufficient to make the 
expenditures reasonable. Accordingly, an amount

[[Page 561]]

spent for institutional advertising in a convention program may be 
deductible only if the taxpayer has a principal place of business in the 
area where the convention is held. An official statement made by a 
political party after a convention as to the use made of the proceeds 
from its convention program shall constitute prima facie evidence of 
such use.
    (ii) No deduction may be taken for any amount described in this 
subparagraph which is not otherwise allowable as a deduction under 
section 162, relating to trade or business expenses. Therefore, in order 
for any such amount to be deductible, it must first satisfy the 
requirements of section 162, and, in addition, it must also satisfy the 
more restrictive requirements of this subparagraph.
    (c) Advertising in publication other than convention program. No 
deduction shall be allowed for an expenditure for advertising in any 
publication other than a convention program if any part of the proceeds 
of such publication directly or indirectly inures (or is intended to 
inure) to or for the use of a political party or a political candidate. 
For purposes of this paragraph, a publication includes a book, magazine, 
pamphlet, brochure, flier, almanac, newspaper, newsletter, handbill, 
billboard, menu, sign, scorecard, program, announcement, radio or 
television program or announcement, or any similar means of 
communication. For the definition of inurement of proceeds to a 
political party or a political candidate, see paragraph (f)(3) of this 
section.
    (d) Admission to dinner or program. No deduction shall be allowed 
for an expenditure for admission to any dinner or program, if any part 
of the proceeds of such event directly or indirectly inures (or is 
intended to inure) to or for the use of a political party or a political 
candidate. For purposes of this paragraph, a dinner or program includes 
a gala, dance, ball, theatrical or film presentation, cocktail or other 
party, picnic, barbecue, sporting event, brunch, tea, supper, auction, 
bazaar, reading, speech, forum, lecture, fashion show, concert, opening, 
meeting, gathering, or any similar event. For the definition of 
inurement of proceeds to a political party or a political candidate and 
of admission to a dinner or program, see paragraph (f) of this section.
    (e) Admission to inaugural event. (1) No deduction shall be allowed 
for an expenditure for admission to an inaugural ball, inaugural gala, 
inaugural parade, or inaugural concert, or to any similar event (such as 
a dinner or program, as defined in paragraph (d) of this section), in 
connection with the inauguration or installation in office of any 
official, or any equivalent event for an unsuccessful candidate, if the 
event is identified with a political party or a political candidate. For 
purposes of this paragraph, the sponsorship of the event and the use to 
which the proceeds of the event are or may be put are irrelevant, except 
insofar as they may tend to identify the event with a political party or 
a political candidate. For the definition of admission to an inaugural 
event, see paragraph (f)(4) of this section.
    (2) The application of the provisions of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. An inaugural reception for A, a prominent member of Y party 
who has been recently elected judge of the municipal court of F city, is 
held with the proceeds going to the city treasury. The price of 
admission to such affair is not deductible.

    (f) Definitions--(1) Political party. For purposes of this section 
the term political party has the same meaning as that provided for in 
paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.271-1.
    (2) Political candidate. For purposes of this section, the term 
political candidate is to be construed in accordance with the purpose of 
section 276 to deny tax deductions for certain expenditures which may be 
used directly or indirectly to finance political campaigns. The term 
includes a person who, at the time of the event or publication with 
respect to which the deduction is being sought, has been selected or 
nominated by a political party for any elective office. It also includes 
an individual who is generally believed, under the facts and 
circumstances at the time of the event or publication, by the persons 
making expenditures in connection therewith to be an individual who is 
or

[[Page 562]]

who in the reasonably foreseeable future will be seeking selection, 
nomination, or election to any public office. For purposes of the 
preceding sentence, the facts and circumstances to be considered 
include, but are not limited to, the purpose of the event or publication 
and the disposition to be made of the proceeds. In the absence of 
evidence to the contrary it shall be presumed that persons making 
expenditures in connection with an event or publication generally 
believe that an incumbent of an elective public office will run for 
reelection to his office or for election to some other public office.
    (3) Inurement of proceeds to political party or political 
candidate--(i) In general. Subject to the special rules presented in 
subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph (relating to a political 
candidate), proceeds directly or indirectly inure to or for the use of a 
political party or a political candidate (a) if the party or candidate 
may order the disposition of any part of such proceeds, regardless of 
what use is actually made thereof, or (b) if any part of such proceeds 
is utilized by any person for the benefit of the party or candidate. 
These conditions are equally applicable in determining whether the 
proceeds are intended to inure. Accordingly, it is immaterial whether 
the event or publication operates at a loss if, had there been a profit, 
any part of the proceeds would have inured to or for the use of a 
political party or a political candidate. Moreover, it shall be presumed 
that where a dinner, program, or publication is sponsored by or 
identified with a political party or political candidate, the proceeds 
of such dinner, program, or publication directly or indirectly inure (or 
are intended to inure) to or for the use of the party or candidate. On 
the other hand, proceeds are not considered to directly or indirectly 
inure to the benefit of a political party or political candidate if the 
benefit derived is so remote as to be negligible or merely a coincidence 
of the relationship of a political candidate to a trade or business 
profiting from an expenditure of funds. For example, the proceeds of 
expenditures made by a taxpayer in the ordinary course of his trade or 
business for advertising in a publication, such as a newspaper or 
magazine, are not considered as inuring to the benefit of a political 
party or political candidate merely because the publication endorses a 
particular political candidate or candidates of a particular political 
party, the publisher independently contributes to the support of a 
political party or candidate out of his own personal funds, or the 
principal stockholder of the publishing firm is a candidate for public 
office.
    (ii) Proceeds to political party. If a political party may order the 
disposition of any part of the proceeds of a publication or event 
described in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, such proceeds inure 
to the use of the party regardless of what the proceeds are to be used 
for or that their use is restricted to a particular purpose unrelated to 
the election of specific candidates for public office. Accordingly, 
where a political party holds a dinner for the purpose of raising funds 
to be used in a voter registration drive, voter education program, or 
nonprofit political research program, partisan or nonpartisan, the 
proceeds are considered to directly or indirectly inure to or for the 
use of the political party. Proceeds may inure to or for the use of a 
political party even though they are to be used for purposes which may 
not be directly related to any particular election (such as to pay 
office rent for its permanent quarters, salaries to permanent employees, 
or utilities charges, or to pay the cost of an event such as a dinner or 
program as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).
    (iii) Proceeds to political candidate. Proceeds directly or 
indirectly inure (or are intended to inure) to or for the use of a 
political candidate if, in addition to meeting the conditions described 
in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, (a) some part of the proceeds 
is or may be used directly or indirectly for the purpose of furthering 
his candidacy for selection, nomination, or election to any elective 
public office, and (b) they are not received by him in the ordinary 
course of a trade or business (other than the trade or business of 
holding public office). Proceeds may so inure whether or not the 
expenditure sought to be deducted was

[[Page 563]]

paid or incurred before the commencement of political activities with 
respect to the selection, nomination, or election referred to in (a) of 
this subdivision, or after such selection, nomination, or election has 
been made or has taken place. For example, proceeds of an event which 
may be used by an individual who, under the facts and circumstances at 
the time of the event, the persons making expenditures in connection 
therewith generally believe will in the reasonably foreseeable future 
run for a public office, and which may be used in furtherance of such 
individual's candidacy, generally will be deemed to inure (or to be 
intended to inure) to or for the use of a political candidate for the 
purpose of furthering such individual's candidacy. Or, as another 
example, proceeds of an event occurring after an election, which may be 
used by a candidate in that election to repay loans incurred in directly 
or indirectly furthering his candidacy, or in reimbursement of expenses 
incurred in directly or indirectly furthering his candidacy, will be 
deemed to directly or indirectly inure (or to be intended to inure) to 
or for the use of a political candidate for the purpose of furthering 
his candidacy. For purposes of this subdivision, if the proceeds 
received by a candidate exceed substantially the fair market value of 
the goods furnished or services rendered by him, the proceeds are not 
received by the candidate in the ordinary course of his trade or 
business.
    (iv) The application of the provisions of this subparagraph may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation O pays the Y political party $100,000 per 
annum for the right to publish the Y News, and retains the entire 
proceeds from the sale of the publication. Amounts paid or incurred for 
advertising in the Y News are not deductible because a part of the 
proceeds thereof indirectly inures to or for the use of a political 
party.
    Example 2. The X political party holds a highly publicized ball 
honoring one of its active party members and admission tickets are 
offered to all. The guest of honor is a prominent national figure and a 
former incumbent of a high public office. The price of admission is 
designed to cover merely the cost of entertainment, food, and the 
ballroom, and all proceeds are paid to the hotel where the function is 
held, with the political party bearing the cost of any deficit. No 
deduction may be taken for the price of admission to the ball since the 
proceeds thereof inure to or for the use of a political party.
    Example 3. Taxpayer A, engaged in a trade or business, purchases a 
number of tickets for admission to a fundraising affair held on behalf 
of political candidate B. The funds raised by this affair can be used by 
B for the purpose of furthering his candidacy. These expenditures are 
not deductible by A notwithstanding that B donates the proceeds of the 
affair to a charitable organization.
    Example 4. A, an individual taxpayer who publishes a newspaper, is a 
candidate for elective public office. X Corporation advertises its 
products in A's newspaper, paying substantially more than the normal 
rate for such advertising. X Corporation may not deduct any portion of 
the cost of that advertising.

    (4) Admission to dinners, programs, inaugural events. For purposes 
of this section, the cost of admission to a dinner, program, or 
inaugural event includes all charges, whether direct or indirect, for 
attendance and participation at such function. Thus, for example, 
amounts spent to be eligible for door prizes, for the privilege of 
sitting at the head table, or for transportation furnished as part of 
such an event, or any separate charges for food or drink, are amounts 
paid for admission.

Sec. 1.278-1   Capital expenditures incurred in planting and developing citrus and almond groves.

    (a) General rule. (1)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (2)(iii) 
of this paragraph and paragraph (b) of this section, there shall be 
charged to capital account any amount (allowable as a deduction without 
regard to section 278 or this section) which is attributable to the 
planting, cultivation, maintenance, or development of any citrus or 
almond grove (or part thereof), and which is incurred before the close 
of the fourth taxable year beginning with the taxable year in which the 
trees were planted. For purposes of section 278 and this section, such 
an amount shall be considered as ``incurred'' in accordance with the 
taxpayer's regular tax accounting method used in reporting income and 
expenses connected with the citrus or almond grove operation. For 
purposes of this

[[Page 564]]

paragraph, the portion of a citrus or almond grove planted in 1 taxable 
year shall be treated separately from the portion of such grove planted 
in another taxable year. The provisions of section 278 and this section 
apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, in the case of 
a citrus grove, and to taxable years beginning after January 12, 1971, 
in the case of an almond grove.
    (ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. T, a fiscal year taxpayer plants a citrus grove 5 weeks 
before the close of his taxable year ending in 1971. T is required to 
capitalize any amount (allowable as a deduction without regard to 
section 278 or this section) attributable to the planting, cultivation, 
maintenance, or development of such grove until the close of his taxable 
year ending in 1974.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that T 
plants one portion of such grove 5 weeks before the close of his taxable 
year ending in 1971 and another portion of such grove at the beginning 
of his taxable year ending in 1972. The required capitalization period 
for expenses attributable to the first portion of such grove shall run 
until the close of T's taxable year ending in 1974. The required 
capitalization period for expenses attributable to the second portion of 
such grove shall run until the close of T's taxable year ending in 1975.

    (2)(i) For purposes of section 278 and this section a citrus grove 
is defined as one or more trees of the rue family, often thorny and 
bearing large fruit with hard, usually thick peel and pulpy flesh, such 
as the orange, grapefruit, lemon, lime, citron, tangelo, and tangerine.
    (ii) For purposes of section 278 and this section, an almond grove 
is defined as one or more trees of the species Prunus amygdalus.
    (iii) An amount attributable to the cultivation, maintenance, or 
development of a citrus or almond grove (or part thereof) shall include, 
but shall not be limited to, the following developmental or cultural 
practices expenditures: Irrigation, cultivation, pruning, fertilizing, 
management fees, frost protection, spraying, and upkeep of the citrus or 
almond grove. The provisions of section 278(a) and this paragraph shall 
apply to expenditures for fertilizer and related materials 
notwithstanding the provisions of section 180, but shall not apply to 
expenditures attributable to real estate taxes or interest, to soil and 
water conservation expenditures allowable as a deduction under section 
175, or to expenditures for clearing land allowable as a deduction under 
section 182. Further, the provisions of section 278(a) and this 
paragraph apply only to expenditures allowable as deductions without 
regard to section 278 and have no application to expenditures otherwise 
chargeable to capital account, such as the cost of the land and 
preparatory expenditures incurred in connection with the citrus or 
almond grove.
    (iv) For purposes of section 278 and this section, a citrus or 
almond tree shall be considered to be ``planted'' on the date on which 
the tree is placed in the permanent grove from which production is 
expected.
    (3)(i) The period during which expenditures described in section 
278(a) and this paragraph are required to be capitalized shall, once 
determined, be unaffected by a sale or other disposition of the citrus 
or almond grove. Such period shall, in all cases, be computed by 
reference to the taxable years of the owner of the grove at the time 
that the citrus or almond trees were planted. Therefore, if a citrus or 
almond grove subject to the provisions of section 278 or this paragraph 
is sold or otherwise transferred by the original owner of the grove 
before the close of his fourth taxable year beginning with the taxable 
year in which the trees were planted, expenditures described in section 
278(a) or this paragraph made by the purchaser or other transferee of 
the citrus or almond grove from the date of his acquisition until the 
close of the original holder's fourth such taxable year are required to 
be capitalized.
    (ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following example:

    Example. T, a fiscal year taxpayer, plants a citrus grove at the 
beginning of his taxable year ending in 1971. At the beginning of his 
taxable year ending in 1972, T sells the grove to X. The required period 
during which expenditures described in section 278 (a) are required to 
be capitalized runs from the date on which T planted the grove until the 
end of T's taxable year ending in 1974. Therefore, X

[[Page 565]]

must capitalize any such expenditures incurred by him from the time he 
purchased the grove from T until the end of T's taxable year ending in 
1974.

    (b) Exceptions. (1) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to 
amounts allowable as deductions (without regard to section 278 or this 
section) and attributable to a citrus or almond grove (or part thereof) 
which is replanted by a taxpayer after having been lost or damaged 
(while in the hands of such taxpayer) by reason of freeze, disease, 
drought, pests, or casualty.
    (2)(i) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to amounts 
allowable as deductions (without regard to section 278 or this section), 
and attributable to a citrus grove (or part thereof) which was planted 
or replanted prior to December 30, 1969, or to an almond grove (or part 
thereof) which was planted or replanted prior to December 30, 1970.
    (ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. T, a fiscal year taxpayer with a taxable year of July 1, 
1969, through v June 30, 1970, plants a citrus grove on August 1, 1969. 
Since the grove was planted prior to December 30, 1969, no expenses 
incurred with respect to the grove shall be subject to the provisions of 
paragraph (a).
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that T 
plants the grove on March 1, 1970. Since the grove was planted after 
December 30, 1969, all amounts allowable as deductions (without regard 
to section 278 or this section) and attributable to the grove shall be 
subject to the provisions of paragraph (a). However, since paragraph (a) 
applies only to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, T must 
capitalize only those amounts incurred during his taxable years ending 
in 1971, 1972, and 1973.

<R05>
Sec. 1.279-1   General rule; purpose.

    An obligation issued to provide a consideration directly or 
indirectly for a corporate acquisition, although constituting a debt 
under section 385, may have characteristics which make it more 
appropriate that the participation in the corporation which the 
obligation represents be treated for purposes of the deduction of 
interest as if it were a stockholder interest rather than a creditors 
interest. To deal with such cases, section 279 imposes certain 
limitations on the deductibility of interest paid or incurred on 
obligations which have certain equity characteristics and are classified 
as corporate acquisition indebtedness. Generally, section 279 provides 
that no deduction will be allowed for any interest paid or incurred by a 
corporation during the taxable year with respect to its corporate 
acquisition indebtedness to the extent such interest exceeds $5 million. 
However, the $5 million limitation is reduced by the amount of interest 
paid or incurred on obligations issued under the circumstances described 
in section 279(a)(2) but which are not corporate acquisition 
indebtedness. Section 279(b) provides that an obligation will be 
corporate acquisition indebtedness if it was issued under certain 
circumstances and meets the four tests enumerated therein. Although an 
obligation may satisfy the conditions referred to in the preceding 
sentence, it may still escape classification as corporate acquisition 
indebtedness if the conditions as described in sections 279(d) (3), (4), 
and (5), 279(f), or 279(i) are present. However, no inference should be 
drawn from the rules of section 279 as to whether a particular 
instrument labeled a bond, debenture, note, or other evidence of 
indebtedness is in fact a debt. Before the determination as to whether 
the deduction for payments pursuant to an obligation as described in 
this section is to be disallowed, the obligation must first qualify as 
debt in accordance with section 385. If the obligation is not debt under 
section 385, it will be unnecessary to apply section 279 to any payments 
pursuant to such obligation.

[T.D. 7262, 38 FR 5844, Mar. 5, 1973]


<R05>
Sec. 1.279-2   Amount of disallowance of interest on corporate acquisition indebtedness.

    (a) In general. Under section 279(a), no deduction is allowed for 
any interest paid or incurred by a corporation during the taxable year 
with respect to its corporate acquisition indebtedness to the extent 
that such interest exceeds:
    (1) $5 million, reduced by
    (2) The amount of interest paid or incurred by such corporation 
during such

[[Page 566]]

year on any obligation issued after December 31, 1967, to provide 
consideration directly or indirectly for an acquisition described in 
section 279(b)(1) but which is not corporate acquisition indebtedness. 
Such an obligation is not corporate acquisition indebtedness if it:
    (i) Was issued prior to October 10, 1969, or
    (ii) Was issued after October 9, 1969, but does not meet any one or 
more of the tests of section 279(b) (2), (3), or (4), or
    (iii) Was originally deemed to be corporate acquisition indebtedness 
but is no longer so treated by virtue of the application of paragraphs 
(3) or (4) of section 279(d) or
    (iv) Is specifically excluded from treatment as corporate 
acquisition indebtedness by virtue of sections 279(d)(5), (f), or (i).

The computation of the amount by which the $5 million limitation 
described in this paragraph is to be reduced with respect to any taxable 
year is to be made as of the last day of the taxable year in which an 
acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) occurs. In no case shall the 
$5 million limitation be reduced below zero.
    (b) Certain terms defined. When used in section 279 and the 
regulations thereunder:
    (1) The term issued includes the giving of a note or other evidence 
of indebtedness to a bank or other lender as well as an issuance of a 
bond or debenture. In the case of obligations which are registered with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, the date of issue is the date on 
which the issue is first offered to the public. In the case of 
obligations which are not so registered, the date of issue is the date 
on which the obligation is sold to the first purchaser.
    (2) The term interest includes both stated interest and unstated 
interest (such as original issue discount as defined in paragraph (a)(1) 
of Sec. 1.163-4 and amounts treated as interest under section 483).
    (3) The term money means cash and its equivalent.
    (4) The term control shall have the meaning assigned to such term by 
section 368(c).
    (5) The term affiliated group shall have the meaning assigned to 
such term by section 1504(a), except that all corporations other than 
the acquired corporation shall be treated as includible corporations 
(without any exclusion under section 1504(b)) and the acquired 
corporation shall not be treated as an includible corporation. This 
definition shall apply whether or not some or all of the members of the 
affiliated group file a consolidated return.
    (c) Examples. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. On March 4, 1973, X Corporation, a calendar year 
taxpayer, issues an obligation which satisfies the test of section 
279(b)(1) but fails to satisfy either of the tests of section 279(b) (2) 
or (3). Since at least one of the tests of section 279(b) is not 
satisfied the obligation is not corporate acquisition indebtedness. 
However, since the test of section 279(b)(1) is satisfied, the interest 
on the obligation will reduce the $5 million limitation provided by 
section 279 (a)(1).
    Example 2. On January 1, 1969, X Corporation, a calendar year 
taxpayer, issues an obligation, which satisfies all the tests of section 
279(b), requiring it to pay $3.5 million of interest each year. Since 
the obligation was issued before October 10, 1969, the obligation cannot 
be corporate acquisition indebtedness, and a deduction for the $3.5 
million of interest attributable to such obligation is not subject to 
disallowance under section 279(a). However, since the obligation was 
issued after December 31, 1967, in an acquisition described in section 
279(b)(1), under section 279(a)(2) the $3.5 million of interest 
attributable to such obligation reduces the $5 million limitation 
provided by section 279(a)(1) to $1.5 million.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (2). Assume further 
that on January 1, 1970, X Corporation issues more obligations which are 
classified as corporate acquisition indebtedness and which require X 
Corporation to pay $4 million of interest each year. For 1970 the amount 
of interest paid or accrued on corporate acquisition indebtedness, which 
may be deducted is $1.5 million ($5 million maximum provided by section 
279(a)(1) less $3.5 million, the reduction required under section 
279(a)(2)). Thus, $2.5 million of the $4 million interest incurred on a 
corporate acquisition indebtedness is subject to disallowance under 
section 279(a) for the taxable year 1970.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example (3). Assume further 
that on the last day of each of the taxable years 1971, 1972,

[[Page 567]]

and 1973 of X Corporation neither of the conditions described in section 
279(b)(4) was present.

Under these circumstances, such obligations for all taxable years after 
1973 are not corporate acquisition indebtedness under section 279(d)(4). 
Therefore, the $2.5 million of interest previously not deductible is not 
deductible for all taxable years after 1973. Although such obligations 
are no longer treated as corporate acquisition indebtedness, the 
interest attributable thereto must be applied in further reduction of 
the $5 million limitation. The $5 million limitation of section 
279(a)(1) is therefore reduced to zero. While the limitation is at the 
zero level any interest paid or incurred on corporate acquisition 
indebtedness will be disallowed.

<R05>
Sec. 1.279-3   Corporate acquisition indebtedness.

    (a) Corporate acquisition indebtedness. For purposes of section 279, 
the term corporate acquisition indebtedness means any obligation 
evidenced by a bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence 
of indebtedness issued after October 9, 1969, by a corporation (referred 
to in section 279 and the regulations thereunder as ``issuing 
corporation'') if the obligation is issued to provide consideration 
directly or indirectly for the acquisition of stock in, or certain 
assets of, another corporation (as described in paragraph (b) of this 
Sec. 1.279-3), is ``subordinated'' (as described in paragraph (c) of 
this Sec. 1.279-3), is ``convertible'' (as described in paragraph (d) of 
this Sec. 1.279-3), and satisfies either the ratio of debt to equity 
test (as described in paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.279-5) or the projected 
earnings test (as described in paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.279-5).
    (b) Acquisition of stock or assets. (1) Section 279(b)(1) describes 
one of the tests to be satisfied if an obligation is to be classified as 
corporate acquisition indebtedness. Under section 279(b)(1), the 
obligation must be issued to provide consideration directly or 
indirectly for the acquisition of:
    (i) Stock (whether voting or nonvoting) in another corporation 
(referred to in section 279 and the regulations thereunder as ``acquired 
corporation''), or
    (ii) Assets of another corporation (referred to in section 279 and 
the regulations thereunder as ``acquired corporation'') pursuant to a 
plan under which at least two-thirds (in value) of all the assets 
(excluding money) used in trades or businesses carried on by such 
corporation are acquired.

The fact that the corporation that issues the obligation is not the same 
corporation that acquires the acquired corporation does not prevent the 
application of section 279. For example, if X Corporation acquires all 
the stock of Y Corporation through the utilization of an obligation of Z 
Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of X Corporation, this section 
will apply.
    (2) Direct or indirect consideration. Obligations are issued to 
provide direct consideration for an acquisition within the meaning of 
section 279(b)(1) where the obligations are issued to the shareholders 
of an acquired corporation in exchange for stock in such acquired 
corporation or where the obligations are issued to the acquired 
corporation in exchange for its assets. The application of the 
provisions of this subsection relating to indirect consideration for an 
acquisition of stock or assets depends upon the facts and circumstances 
surrounding the acquisition and the issuance of the obligations. 
Obligations are issued to provide indirect consideration for an 
acquisition of stock or assets within the meaning of section 279(b)(1) 
where (i) at the time of the issuance of the obligations the issuing 
corporation anticipated the acquisition of such stock or assets and the 
obligations would not have been issued if the issuing corporation had 
not so anticipated such acquisition, or where (ii) at the time of the 
acquisition the issuing corporation foresaw or reasonably should have 
foreseen that it would be required to issue obligations, which it would 
not have otherwise been required to issue if the acquisition had not 
occurred, in order to meet its future economic needs.
    (3) Stock acquisition. (i) For purposes of section 279, an 
acquisition in which the issuing corporation issues an obligation to 
provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of 
stock in the acquired corporation shall be treated as a stock 
acquisition within the meaning of section

[[Page 568]]

279(b)(1)(A). Where the stock of one corporation is acquired from 
another corporation and such stock constitutes at least two-thirds (in 
value) of all the assets (excluding money) of the latter corporation, 
such acquisition shall be deemed an asset acquisition as described in 
section 279(b)(1)(B) and subparagraph (4) of this section. If the 
issuing corporation acquires less than two-thirds (in value) of all the 
assets (excluding money) used in trades or businesses carried on by the 
acquired corporation within the meaning of section 279(b)(1)(B) and 
subparagraph (4) of this paragraph and such assets include stock of 
another corporation, the acquisition of such stock is a stock 
acquisition within the meaning of section 279(b)(1)(A) and of this 
subparagraph. In such a case the amount of the obligation which is 
characterized as corporate acquisition indebtedness shall bear the same 
relationship to the total amount of the obligation issued as the fair 
market value of the stock acquired bears to the total of the fair market 
value of the assets acquired and stock acquired, as of the date of 
acquisition. For rules with respect to acquisitions of stock, where the 
total amount of stock of the acquired corporation held by the issuing 
corporation never exceeded 5 percent of the total combined voting power 
of all classes of stock of the acquired corporation entitled to vote, 
see Sec. 1.279-4(b)(1).
    (ii) If the issuing corporation acquired stock of an acquired 
corporation in an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(A), and 
liquidated the acquired corporation under section 334(b)(2) and the 
regulations thereunder before the last day of the taxable year in which 
such stock acquisition is made, such obligation issued to provide 
consideration directly or indirectly to acquire such stock of the 
acquired corporation shall be considered as issued in an acquisition 
described in section 279(b)(1)(B).
    (4) Asset acquisition. (i) For purposes of section 279, an 
acquisition in which the issuing corporation issues an obligation to 
provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of 
assets of an acquired corporation pursuant to a plan under which at 
least two-thirds of the gross value of all the assets (excluding money) 
used in trades and businesses carried on by such acquired corporation 
are acquired shall be treated as an asset acquisition within the meaning 
of section 279(b)(1)(B). For purposes of section 279(b)(1)(B), the gross 
value of any acquired asset shall be its fair market value as of the day 
of its acquisition. In determining the fair market value of an asset, no 
reduction shall be made for any liabilities, mortgages, liens, or other 
encumbrances to which the asset or any part thereof may be subjected. 
For purposes of this subparagraph, an asset which has been actually used 
in the trades and businesses of a corporation but which is temporarily 
not being used in such trades and businesses shall be treated as if it 
is being used in such manner. For purposes of this paragraph, the day of 
acquisition will be determined by reference to the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the transaction.
    (ii) For purposes of the two-thirds test described in section 
279(b)(1)(B), the stock of any corporation which is controlled by the 
acquired corporation shall be considered as an asset used in the trades 
and businesses of such acquired corporation.
    (5) Certain nontaxable transactions. (i) Under section 279(e), an 
acquisition of stock of a corporation of which the issuing corporation 
is in control in a transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized 
shall be deemed an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(A) only if 
immediately before such transaction the acquired corporation was in 
existence, and the issuing corporation was not in control of such 
corporation. If the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated 
group, then in accordance with section 279(g), the affiliated group 
shall be treated as the issuing corporation. Thus, any stock of the 
acquired corporation, owned by members of the affiliated group, shall be 
aggregated in determining whether the issuing corporation was in control 
of the acquired corporation.
    (ii) The $5 million limitation provided by section 279(a)(1) is not 
reduced by the interest on an obligation issued in a transaction which, 
under section 279 (e), is deemed not to be an acquisition described in 
section 279(b)(1).

[[Page 569]]

    (iii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. On January 1, 1973, W Corporation, a calendar year 
taxpayer, issues to the public 10,000 10 year convertible bonds each 
with a principal of $1,000 for $9 million. On June 6, 1973, W 
Corporation transfers the $9 million proceeds of such bond issue to X 
Corporation in exchange for X Corporation's common stock in a 
transaction that satisfies the provisions of section 351(a). On December 
31, 1973, W Corporation's ratio of debt to equity is 1 1/2 to 1 and its 
project earnings exceed three times the annual interest to be paid or 
incurred. Immediately prior to the transaction between the two 
corporations W Corporation owned no stock in X Corporation which had 
been in existence for several years. However, immediately after this 
transaction W Corporation is in control of X Corporation. Since X 
Corporation, the acquired corporation, was in existence and W 
Corporation, the issuing corporation, was not in control of X 
Corporation immediately before the section 351 transaction (a 
transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized) and since W 
Corporation is now in control of X Corporation, the acquisition of X 
Corporation's common stock by W Corporation is not protected from 
treatment as an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1)(A). However, 
the obligation will not be deemed to be corporate acquisition 
indebtedness since the test of section 279(b)(4) is not met. The 
interest on the obligation will reduce the $5 million limitation of 
section 279(a).
    Example 2. Assume the facts are the same as described in Example 
(1), except that X Corporation was not in existence prior to June 6, 
1973, but rather is newly created by W Corporation on such date. Since X 
Corporation, the acquired corporation, was not in existence before June 
6, 1973, the date on which W Corporation, the issuing corporation, 
acquired control of X Corporation in a transaction on which gain or loss 
is not recognized, the acquisition is not deemed to be an acquisition 
described in section 279(b)(1)(A). Thus, under the provisions of 
subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the $5 million limitation 
provided by section 279(a)(1) will not be reduced by the yearly interest 
incurred on the convertible bonds issued by W Corporation.
    Example 3. Assume that the facts are the same as described in 
Example (1), except that W Corporation was in control of X Corporation 
immediately before the transaction. Since W Corporation was in control 
of X Corporation immediately before the section 351(a) transaction and 
is in control of X Corporation after such transaction, the result will 
be the same as in Example (2).

    (c) Subordinated obligation--(1) In general. An obligation which is 
issued to provide consideration for an acquisition described in section 
279(b)(1) is subordinated within the meaning of section 279(b)(2) if it 
is either:
    (i) Subordinated to the claims of trade creditors of the issuing 
corporation generally, or
    (ii) Expressly subordinated in right of payment to the payment of 
any substantial amount of unsecured indebtedness, whether outstanding or 
subsequently issued, of the issuing corporation, irrespective of whether 
such subordination relates to payment of interest, or principal, or 
both. In applying section 279 (b)(2) and this paragraph in any case 
where the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group of 
corporations, the affiliated group shall be treated as the issuing 
corporation.
    (2) Expressly subordinated obligation. In applying subparagraph 
(1)(ii) of this paragraph, an obligation is considered expressly 
subordinated whether the terms of the subordination are provided in the 
evidence of indebtedness itself, or in another agreement between the 
parties to such obligation. An obligation shall be considered to be 
expressly subordinated within the meaning of subparagraph (1)(ii) of 
this paragraph if such obligation by its terms can become subordinated 
in right of payment to the payment of any substantial amount of 
unsecured indebtedness which is outstanding or which may be issued 
subsequently. However, an obligation shall not be considered expressly 
subordinated if such subordination occurs solely by operation of law, 
such as in the case of bankruptcy laws. For purposes of this paragraph, 
the term substantial amount of unsecured indebtedness means an amount of 
unsecured indebtedness equal to 5 percent or more of the face amount of 
the obligations issued within the meaning of section 279(b)(1).
    (d) Convertible obligation. An obligation which is issued to provide 
consideration directly or indirectly for an acquisition described in 
section 279 (b)(1) is convertible within the meaning of section 
279(b)(3) if it is either-- (1) Convertible directly or indirectly into 
stock of the issuing corporation, or (2)

[[Page 570]]

Part of an investment unit or other arrangement which includes, in 
addition to such bond or other evidence of indebtedness, an option to 
acquire directly or indirectly stock in the issuing corporation. Stock 
warrants or convertible preferred stock included as part of an 
investment unit constitute options within the meaning of the preceding 
sentence. Indebtedness is indirectly convertible if the conversion 
feature gives the holder the right to convert into another bond of the 
issuing corporation which is then convertible into the stock of the 
issuing corporation. In any case where the corporation which in fact 
issues an obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition 
described in section 279(b)(1) is a member of an affiliated group, the 
provisions of section 279(b)(3) and this paragraph are deemed satisfied 
if the stock into which either the obligation or option which is part of 
an investment unit or other arrangement is convertible, directly or 
indirectly, is stock of any member of the affiliated group.
    (e) Ratio of debt to equity and projected earnings test. For rules 
with respect to the application of section 279(b)(4) (relating to the 
ratio of debt to equity and the ratio of projected earnings to annual 
interest to be paid or incurred), see paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of 
Sec. 1.279-5.
    (f) Certain obligations issued after October 9, 1969--(1) In 
general. Under section 279(i), an obligation shall not be corporate 
acquisition indebtedness if such obligation is issued after October 9, 
1969, to provide consideration for the acquisition of:
    (i) Stock or assets pursuant to a binding written contract which was 
in effect on October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter before such 
acquisition, or
    (ii) Stock in any corporation where the issuing corporation, on 
October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter before such acquisition, 
owned at least 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all 
classes of stock entitled to vote of the acquired corporation.

Subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall cease to apply when (at any 
time on or after October 9, 1969) the issuing corporation has acquired 
control of the acquired corporation. The interest attributable to any 
obligation which satisfies the conditions stated in the first sentence 
of this subparagraph shall reduce the $5 million limitation of section 
279(a)(1).
    (2) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. On September 5, 1969, M Corporation, a calendar year 
taxpayer, entered into a binding written contract with N Corporation to 
purchase 20 percent of the voting stock of N Corporation. The contract 
was in effect on October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter before the 
acquisition of the stock on January 1, 1970. Pursuant to such contract M 
Corporation issued on January 1, 1970, to N Corporation an obligation 
which satisfies the tests of section 279(b) requiring it to pay $1 
million of interest each year. However, under the provisions of 
subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph, such obligation is not corporate 
acquisition indebtedness since it was issued to provide consideration 
for the acquisition of stock pursuant to a binding written contract 
which was in effect on October 9, 1969, and at all times thereafter 
before such acquisition. The $1 million of yearly interest on the 
obligation reduces the $5 million limitation provided for in section 
279(a)(1) to $4 million since such interest is attributable to an 
obligation which was issued to provide consideration for the acquisition 
of stock in an acquired corporation.
    Example 2. On October 9, 1969, O Corporation, a calendar year 
taxpayer, owned 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all 
classes of stock entitled to vote of P Corporation. P Corporation has no 
other class of stock. On January 1, 1970, while still owning such voting 
stock O Corporation issued to the shareholders of P Corporation to 
provide consideration for an additional 40 percent of P Corporation's 
voting stock an obligation which satisfied the tests of section 279(b) 
requiring it to pay $4 million of interest each year. Hence, O 
Corporation acquired control of P Corporation, and the provisions of 
subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph ceased to apply to O Corporation. 
Thus, 75 percent of the obligation issued by O Corporation to provide 
consideration for the stock of P Corporation is not corporate 
acquisition indebtedness (that is, of the 40 percent of the voting stock 
of P Corporation which was acquired, only 30 percent was needed to give 
O Corporation control). Since 25 percent of the obligation is corporate 
acquisition indebtedness, $1 million of interest attributable to such 
obligation is subject to disallowance under section 279(a) for the 
taxable year 1970. The remaining $3 million of interest attributable to 
the obligation will reduce the $5

[[Page 571]]

million limitation provided by in section 279(a)(1).

    (g) Exemptions for certain acquisitions of foreign corporations--(1) 
In general. Under section 279(f), the term corporate acquisition 
indebtedness does not include any indebtedness issued to any person to 
provide consideration directly or indirectly for the acquisition of 
stock in, or assets of, any foreign corporation substantially all the 
income of which, for the 3-year period ending with the date of such 
acquisition or for such part of such period as the foreign corporation 
was in existence, is from sources without the United States. The 
interest attributable to any obligation excluded from treatment as 
corporate acquisition indebtedness by reason of this paragraph shall 
reduce the $5 million limitation of 279(a)(1).
    (2) Foreign corporation. For purposes of this paragraph, the term 
foreign corporation shall have the same meaning as in section 
7701(a)(5).
    (3) Income from sources without the United States. For purposes of 
this paragraph, the term income from sources without the United States 
shall be determined in accordance with sections 862 and 863. If more 
than 80 percent of a foreign corporation's gross income is derived from 
sources without the United States, such corporation shall be considered 
to be deriving substantially all of its income from sources without the 
United States.

<R05>
Sec. 1.279-4   Special rules.

    (a) Special 3-year rule. Under section 279(d)(4), if an obligation 
which has been deemed to be corporate acquisition indebtedness for any 
taxable year would not be such indebtedness for each of any 3 
consecutive taxable years thereafter if the ratio of debt to equity and 
the ratio of projected earnings to annual interest to be paid or 
incurred of section 279 (b)(4) were applied as of the close of each of 
such 3 years, then such obligation shall not be corporate acquisition 
indebtedness for any taxable years after such 3 consecutive taxable 
years. The test prescribed by section 279(b)(4) shall be applied as of 
the close of any taxable year whether or not the issuing corporation 
issues any obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition 
described in section 279(b)(1) in such taxable year. Thus, for example, 
if a corporation, reporting income on a calendar year basis, has an 
obligation outstanding as of December 31, 1975, which was classified as 
a corporate acquisition indebtedness as of the close of 1972 and such 
obligation would not have been classified as corporate acquisition 
indebtedness as of the close of 1973, 1974, and 1975 because neither of 
the conditions of section 279(b)(4) were present as of such dates, then 
such obligation shall not be corporate acquisition indebtedness for 1976 
and all taxable years thereafter. Such obligation shall not be 
reclassified as corporate acquisition indebtedness in any taxable year 
following 1975, even if the issuing corporation issues more obligations 
(whether or not found to be corporate acquisition indebtedness) in such 
later years to provide consideration for the acquisition of additional 
stock in, or assets of, the same acquired corporation with respect to 
which the original obligation was issued. The interest attributable to 
such obligation shall reduce the $5 million limitation provided by 
section 279(a)(1) for 1976 and all taxable years thereafter.
    (b) Five percent stock rule--(1) In general. Under section 
279(d)(5), if an obligation issued to provide consideration for an 
acquisition of stock in another corporation meets the tests of section 
279(b), such obligation shall be corporate acquisition indebtedness for 
a taxable year only if at sometime after October 9, 1969, and before the 
close of such year the issuing corporation owns or has owned 5 percent 
or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock 
entitled to vote in the acquired corporation. If the issuing corporation 
is a member of an affiliated group, then in accordance with section 
279(g) the affiliated group shall be treated as the issuing corporation. 
Thus, any stock of the acquired corporation owned by members of the 
affiliated group shall be aggregated to determine if the percentage 
limitation provided by this subparagraph is exceeded. Once an obligation 
is deemed to be corporate acquisition indebtedness such obligation will 
continue to be

[[Page 572]]

deemed corporate acquisition indebtedness for all taxable years 
thereafter unless the provisions of section 279(d) (3) or (4) apply, 
notwithstanding the fact that the issuing corporation owns less than 5 
percent of the combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to 
vote of the acquired corporation in any or all taxable years thereafter.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation Y uses the calendar year as its taxable year 
and has only one class of stock outstanding. On June 1, 1972, X 
Corporation which is also a calendar year taxpayer and which has never 
been a shareholder of Y Corporation acquires from the shareholders of Y 
Corporation 4 percent of the stock of Y Corporation in exchange for 
obligations which satisfy the conditions of section 279(b). At no time 
during 1972 does X Corporation own 5 percent or more of the stock of Y 
Corporation. Accordingly, under the provisions of subparagraph (1) of 
this paragraph, for 1972 the obligations issued by X Corporation to 
provide consideration for the acquisition of Y Corporation's stock do 
not constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1). Assume further 
that on February 24, 1973, X Corporation acquires from the shareholders 
of Y Corporation an additional 7 percent of the stock of Y Corporation 
in exchange for obligations which satisfy all of the tests of section 
279(b). On December 28, 1973, X Corporation sells all of its stock in Y 
Corporation. For 1973, the obligations issued by X Corporation in 1972 
and in 1973 constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness since X 
Corporation at some time after October 9, 1969, and before the close of 
1973 owned 5 percent or more of the voting stock of Y Corporation. 
Furthermore, such obligations shall be corporate acquisition 
indebtedness for all taxable years thereafter unless the special 
provisions of section 279(d) (3) or (4) could apply.

    (c) Changes in obligation--(1) In general. Under section 279(h), for 
purposes of section 279:
    (i) Any extension, renewal, or refinancing of an obligation 
evidencing a preexisting indebtedness shall not be deemed to be the 
issuance of a new obligation, and
    (ii) Any obligation which is corporate acquisition indebtedness of 
the issuing corporation is also corporate acquisition indebtedness of 
any corporation which in any transaction or by operation of law assumes 
liability for such obligation or becomes liable for such obligation as 
guarantor, endorser, or indemnitor.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. On January 1, 1971, X Corporation, which files its return 
on the basis of a calendar year, issues an obligation, which satisfies 
the tests of section 279(b), and is deemed to be corporate acquisition 
indebtedness. On January 1, 1973, an agreement is concluded between X 
Corporation and the holder of the obligation whereby the maturity date 
of such obligation is extended until December 31, 1979. Under the 
provisions of subparagraph (1)(i) of this paragraph such extended 
obligation is not deemed to be a new obligation, and still constitutes 
corporate acquisition indebtedness.
    Example 2. On June 12, 1971, X Corporation, a calendar year 
taxpayer, issued convertible and subordinated obligations to acquire the 
stock of Z Corporation. The obligations were deemed corporate 
acquisition indebtedness on December 31, 1971. On March 4, 1973, X 
Corporation and Y Corporation consolidated to form XY Corporation in 
accordance with State law. Corporation XY is liable for the obligations 
issued by X Corporation by operation of law and the obligations continue 
to be corporate acquisition indebtedness. In 1975 XY Corporation 
exchanges its own nonconvertible obligations for the obligations X 
Corporation issued. The obligations of XY Corporation issued in exchange 
for those of X Corporation will be deemed to be corporate acquisition 
indebtedness.

<R05>
Sec. 1.279-5   Rules for application of section 279(b).

    (a) Taxable years to which applicable--(1) First year of 
disallowance. Under section 279(d)(1), the deduction of interest on any 
obligation shall not be disallowed under section 279(a) before the first 
taxable year of the issuing corporation as of the last day of which the 
application of either section 279(b)(4) (A) or (B) results in such 
obligation being classified as corporate acquisition indebtedness. See 
section 279(c)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the time when 
an obligation is subjected to the test of section 279(b)(4).
    (2) General rule for succeeding years. Under section 279(d)(2), 
except as provided in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of

[[Page 573]]

section 279(d), if an obligation is determined to be corporate 
acquisition indebtedness as of the last day of any taxable year of the 
issuing corporation, such obligation shall be corporate acquisition 
indebtedness for such taxable year and all subsequent taxable years.
    (b) Time of determination--(1) In general. The determination of 
whether an obligation meets the conditions of section 279(b) (1), (2), 
and (3) shall be made as of the day on which the obligation is issued.
    (2) Ratio of debt to equity, projected earnings, and annual interest 
to be paid or incurred. (i) Under section 279(c)(1), the determination 
of whether an obligation meets the conditions of section 279(b)(4) is 
first to be made as of the last day of the taxable year of the issuing 
corporation in which it issues the obligation to provide consideration 
directly or indirectly for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) 
of stock in, or assets of, the acquired corporation. An obligation which 
is not corporate acquisition indebtedness only because it does not 
satisfy the test of section 279(b)(4) in the taxable year of the issuing 
corporation in which the obligation is issued for stock in, or assets 
of, the acquired corporation may be subjected to the test of section 
279(b)(4) again. A retesting will occur in any subsequent taxable year 
of the issuing corporation in which the issuing corporation issues any 
obligation to provide consideration directly or indirectly for an 
acquisition described in section 279(b)(1) with respect to the same 
acquired corporation, irrespective of whether such subsequent obligation 
is itself classified as corporate acquisition indebtedness. If the 
issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group, then in 
accordance with section 279(g) the affiliated group shall be treated as 
the issuing corporation. Thus, if any member of the affiliated group 
issues an obligation to acquire additional stock in, or assets of, the 
acquired corporation, this paragraph shall apply.
    (ii) For purposes of section 279(b)(4) and this paragraph, in any 
case where the issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group 
(see section 279(g) and Sec. 1.279-6 for rules regarding application of 
section 279 to certain affiliated groups) which does not file a 
consolidated return and all the members of which do not have the same 
taxable year, determinations with respect to the ratio of debt to equity 
of, and projected earnings of, and annual interest to be paid or 
incurred by, any member of the affiliated group shall be made as of the 
last day of the taxable year of the corporation which in fact issues the 
obligation to provide consideration for an acquisition described in 
section 279(b)(1).
    (3) Redetermination where control or substantially all the 
properties have been acquired. Under section 279(d)(3), if an obligation 
is determined to be corporate acquisition indebtedness as of the close 
of a taxable year of the issuing corporation in which section 
279(c)(3)(A)(i) (relating to the projected earnings of the issuing 
corporation only) applied, but would not be corporate acquisition 
indebtedness if the determination were made as of the close of the first 
taxable year of such corporation thereafter in which section 
279(c)(3)(A)(ii) (relating to the projected earnings of both the issuing 
corporation and the acquired corporation) could apply, such obligation 
shall be considered not to be corporate acquisition indebtedness for 
such later taxable year and all taxable years thereafter. Where an 
obligation ceases to be corporate acquisition indebtedness as a result 
of the application of this paragraph, the interest on such obligation 
shall not be disallowed under section 279(a) as a deduction for the 
taxable year in which the obligation ceases to be corporate acquisition 
indebtedness and all taxable years thereafter. However, under section 
279(a)(2) the interest paid or incurred on such obligation which is 
allowed as a deduction will reduce the $5 million limitation provided by 
section 279(a)(1).
    (4) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. In 1971, X Corporation, which files its Federal income 
tax return on the basis of a calendar year, issues its obligations to 
provide consideration for the acquisition of 15 percent of the voting 
stock of both Y Corporation and Z Corporation. Y Corporation and Z 
Corporation each have only one class of stock. When issued, such 
obligations satisfied the tests prescribed in

[[Page 574]]

section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) and would have constituted corporate 
acquisition indebtedness but for the test prescribed in section 
279(b)(4). On December 31, 1971, the application of section 279(b)(4) 
results in X Corporation's obligations issued in 1971 not being treated 
as corporate acquisition indebtedness for that year.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that in 
1972, X Corporation issues more obligations which come within the tests 
of section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) to acquire an additional 10 percent 
of the voting stock of Y Corporation. No stock of Z Corporation is 
acquired after 1971. The application of section 279(b)(4)(B) (relating 
to the projected earnings of X Corporation) as of the end of 1972 
results in the obligations issued in 1972 to provide consideration for 
the acquisition of the stock of Y Corporation being treated as corporate 
acquisition indebtedness. Since X Corporation during 1972 did issue 
obligations to acquire more stock of Y Corporation, under the provisions 
of section 279(c)(1) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph the 
obligations issued by X Corporation in 1971 to acquire stock in Y 
Corporation are again tested to determine whether the test of section 
279(b)(4) with respect to such obligations is satisfied for 1972. Thus, 
since such obligations issued by X Corporation to acquire Y 
Corporation's stock in 1971 previously came within the provisions of 
section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) and the projected earnings test of 
section 279(b)(4)(B) is satisfied for 1972, all of such obligations are 
to be deemed to constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness for 1972 
and subsequent taxable years. The obligations issued in 1971 to acquire 
stock in Z Corporation continue not to constitute corporate acquisition 
indebtedness.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Examples (1) and (2). In 
1973, X Corporation issues more obligations which come within the tests 
of section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) to acquire more stock (but not 
control) in Y Corporation. On December 31, 1973, it is determined with 
respect to X Corporation that neither of the conditions described in 
section 279(b)(4) are present. Thus, the obligations issued in 1973 do 
not constitute corporate acquisition indebtedness. However, the 
obligations issued in 1971 and 1972 by X Corporation to acquire stock in 
Y Corporation continue to be treated as corporate acquisition 
indebtedness.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example (3), except that X 
Corporation acquires control of Y Corporation in 1973. Since X 
Corporation has acquired control of Y Corporation, the average annual 
earnings (as defined in section 279(c)(3)(B) and the annual interest to 
be paid or incurred (as provided by section 279(c)(4)) of both X 
Corporation and Y Corporation under section 279(c)(3)(A)(ii) are taken 
into account in computing for 1973 the ratio of projected earnings to 
annual interest to be paid or incurred described in section 
279(b)(4)(B). Assume further that after applying section 279(b)(4)(B) 
the obligations issued in 1973 escape treatment as corporate acquisition 
indebtedness for 1973. Under section 279(d)(3), all of the obligations 
issued by X Corporation to acquire stock in Y Corporation in 1971 and 
1972 are removed from classification as corporate acquisition 
indebtedness for 1973 and all subsequent taxable years.
    Example 5. In 1975, M Corporation, which files its Federal income 
tax return on the basis of a calendar year, issues its obligations to 
acquire 30 percent of the voting stock of N Corporation. N Corporation 
has only one class of stock. Such obligations satisfy the tests 
prescribed in section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3). Additionally, as of the 
close of 1975, M Corporation's ratio of debt to equity exceeds the ratio 
of 2 to 1 and its projected earnings do not exceed three times the 
annual interest to be paid or incurred. The obligations issued by M 
Corporation are corporate acquisition indebtedness for 1975 since all 
the provisions of section 279(b) are satisfied. In 1976 M Corporation 
issues its obligations to acquire from the shareholders of N Corporation 
an additional 60 percent of the voting stock of N Corporation, thereby 
acquiring control of N Corporation. However, with respect to the 
obligations issued by M Corporation in 1975, there is no redetermination 
under section 279(d)(3) and subparagraph (3) of this paragraph as to 
whether such obligations may escape classification as corporate 
acquisition indebtedness because in 1975 it was the ratio of debt to 
equity test which caused such obligations to be corporate acquisition 
indebtedness. If in 1975, M Corporation met the conditions of section 
279(b)(4) solely because of the ratio of projected earnings to annual 
interest to be paid or incurred described in section 279(b)(4)(B), its 
obligation issued in 1975 could be retested in 1976.

    (c) Acquisition of stock or assets of several corporations. An 
issuing corporation which acquires stock in, or assets of, more than one 
corporation during any taxable year must apply the tests described in 
section 279(b) (1), (2), and (3) separately with respect to each 
obligation issued to provide consideration for the acquisition of the 
stock in, or assets of, each such acquired corporation. Thus, if an 
acquisition is made with obligations of the issuing corporation that 
satisfy the tests described in section 279(b) (2) and (3) and 
obligations that fail to satisfy such tests, only those obligations 
satisfying such tests

[[Page 575]]

need be further considered to determine whether they constitute 
corporate acquisition indebtedness. Those obligations which meet the 
test of section 279(b)(1) but which are not deemed corporate acquisition 
indebtedness shall be taken into account for purposes of determining the 
reduction in the $5 million limitation of section 279(a)(1).
    (d) Ratio of debt to equity and projected earnings--(1) In general. 
One of the four tests to determine whether an obligation constitutes 
corporate acquisition indebtedness is contained in section 279(b)(4). An 
obligation will meet the test of section 279(b)(4) if, as of a day 
determined under section 279(c)(1) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
either:
    (i) The ratio of debt to equity (as defined in paragraph (f) of this 
section) of the issuing corporation exceeds 2 to 1, or
    (ii) The projected earnings (as defined in subparagraph (2) of this 
paragraph) of the issuing corporation, or of both the issuing 
corporation and acquired corporation in any case where subparagraph 
(2)(ii) of this paragraph is applicable, do not exceed three times the 
annual interest to be paid or incurred (as defined in paragraph (e) of 
this section) by such issuing corporation, or, where applicable, by such 
issuing corporation and acquired corporation. Where paragraphs 
(d)(2)(ii) and (e)(1)(ii) of this section are applicable in computing 
projected earnings and annual interest to be paid or incurred, 100 
percent of the acquired corporation's projected earnings and annual 
interest to be paid or incurred shall be included in such computation, 
even though less than all of the stock or assets of the acquired 
corporation have been acquired.
    (2) Projected earnings. The term projected earnings means the 
``average annual earnings'' (as defined in subparagraph (3) of this 
paragraph) of:
    (i) The issuing corporation only, if subdivision (ii) of this 
subparagraph, does not apply, or
    (ii) Both the issuing corporation and the acquired corporation, in 
any case where the issuing corporation as of the close of its taxable 
year has acquired control, or has acquired substantially all of the 
properties, of the acquired corporation.

For purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, an acquisition of 
``substantially all of the properties'' of the acquired corporation 
means the acquisition of assets representing at least 90 percent of the 
fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair 
market value of the gross assets held by the acquired corporation 
immediately prior to the acquisition.
    (3) Average annual earnings. (i) The term average annual earnings 
referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph is, for any 
corporation, the amount of its earnings and profits for any 3-year 
period ending with the last day of a taxable year of the issuing 
corporation in which it issues any obligation to provide consideration 
for an acquisition described in section 279(b)(1), computed without 
reduction for:
    (a) Interest paid or incurred,
    (b) Depreciation or amortization allowed under Chapter 1 of the 
Code,
    (c) Liability for tax under Chapter 1 of the Code, and
    (d) Distributions to which section 301(c)(1) apply (other than such 
distributions from the acquired corporation to the issuing corporation), 
and reduced to an annual average for such 3-year period. For the rules 
to determine the amount of earnings and profits of any corporation, see 
section 312 and the regulations thereunder.
    (ii) Except as provided for in subdivision (iii) of this 
subparagraph, for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph in 
the case of any corporation, the earnings and profits for such 3-year 
period shall be reduced to an annual average by dividing such earnings 
and profits by 36 and multiplying the quotient by 12. If a corporation 
was not in existence during the entire 36-month period as of the close 
of the taxable year referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, 
its average annual earnings shall be determined by dividing its earnings 
and profits for the period of its existence by the number of whole 
calendar months in such period and multiplying the quotient by 12.
    (iii) Where the issuing corporation acquires substantially all of 
the properties of an acquired corporation, the computation of earnings 
and profits of

[[Page 576]]

such acquired corporation shall be made for the period of such 
corporation beginning with the first day of the 3-year period of the 
issuing corporation and ending with the last day prior to the date on 
which substantially all of the properties were acquired. In determining 
the number of whole calendar months for such acquired corporation where 
the period for determining its earnings and profits includes 2 months 
which are not whole calendar months and the total number of days in such 
2 fractional months exceeds 30 days, the number of whole calendar months 
for such period shall be increased by one. Where the number of days in 
the 2 fractional months total 30 days or less such fractional months 
shall be disregarded. After the number of whole calendar months is 
determined, the calculation for average annual earnings shall be made in 
the same manner as described in the last sentence of subdivision (ii) of 
this subparagraph.
    (e) Annual interest to be paid or incurred--(1) In general. For 
purposes of section 279(b)(4)(B), the term annual interest to be paid or 
incurred means:
    (i) If subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph does not apply, the 
annual interest to be paid or incurred by the issuing corporation only, 
for the taxable year beginning immediately after the day described in 
section 279(c)(1), determined by reference to its total indebtedness 
outstanding as of such day, or
    (ii) If projected earnings are determined under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) 
of this section, the annual interest to be paid or incurred by both the 
issuing corporation and the acquired corporation for 1 year beginning 
immediately after the day described in section 279(c)(1), determined by 
reference to their combined total indebtedness outstanding as of such 
day. However, where the issuing corporation acquires substantially all 
of the properties of the acquired corporation, the annual interest to be 
paid or incurred will be determined by reference to the total 
indebtedness outstanding of the issuing corporation only (including any 
indebtedness it assumed in the acquisition) as of the day described in 
section 279(c)(1).

The term annual interest to be paid or incurred refers to both actual 
interest and unstated interest. Such unstated interest includes original 
issue discount as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of Sec. 1.163-4 and 
amounts treated as interest under section 483. For purposes of this 
paragraph and paragraph (f) of this section (relating to the ratio of 
debt to equity), the indebtedness of any corporation shall be determined 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Thus, for 
example, the indebtedness of a corporation includes short-term 
liabilities, such as accounts payable to suppliers, as well as long-term 
indebtedness. Contingent liabilities, such as those arising out of 
discounted notes, the assignment of accounts receivable, or the 
guarantee of the liability of another, shall be included in the 
determination of the indebtedness of a corporation if the contingency is 
likely to become a reality. In addition, the indebtedness of a 
corporation includes obligations issued by the corporation, secured only 
by property of the corporation, and with respect to which the 
corporation is not personally liable. See section 279(g) and Sec. 1.279-
6 for rules with respect to the computation of annual interest to be 
paid or incurred in regard to members of an affiliated group of 
corporations.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of these paragraphs may be illustrated 
by the following examples:

    Example 1. Corporation X's earnings and profits calculated in 
accordance with section 279(c)(3)(B) for 1972, 1971, and 1970 
respectively were $29 million, $23 million, and $20 million. The 
interest to be paid or incurred during the calendar year of 1973 as 
determined by reference to the issuing corporation's total outstanding 
indebtedness as of December 31, 1972, was $10 million. By dividing the 
sum of the earnings and profits for the 3 years by 36 (the number of 
whole calendar months in the 3-year period) and multiplying the quotient 
by 12, the average annual earnings for X Corporation is $24 million. 
Since the projected earnings of X Corporation do not exceed by three 
times the annual interest to be paid or incurred (they exceed by only 
2.4 times), one of the circumstances described in section 279(b)(4) is 
present.
    Example 2. On March 1, 1972, W Corporation acquires substantially 
all of the properties of Z Corporation in exchange for W Corporation's 
bonds which satisfy the tests of section 279(b) (2) and (3). W 
Corporation files its income tax returns on the basis of fiscal years 
ending June 30. Z Corporation, which

[[Page 577]]

was formed on September 1, 1969, is a calendar year taxpayer. The 
earnings and profits of W Corporation for the last 3 fiscal years ending 
June 30, 1972, calculated in accordance with the provisions of section 
279(c)(3)(B) were $300 million, $400 million, and $380 million, 
respectively. The average annual earnings of W Corporation is $360 
million ($1,080 million <divide> 36 x 12). The earnings and profits of Z 
Corporation calculated in accordance with the provisions of section 
279(c)(3)(B) were $4 million for the period of September 1, 1969 to 
December 31, 1969, $10 million and $14 million for the calendar years of 
1970 and 1971, respectively, and $2 million for the period of January 1, 
1972, through February 29, 1972, or a total of $30 million. To arrive at 
the average annual earnings, the sum of the earnings and profits, $30 
million, must be divided by 30 (the number of whole calendar months that 
Z Corporation was in existence during W Corporation's 3-year period 
ending with the day prior to the date substantially all the assets were 
acquired) and the quotient is multiplied by 12, which results in an 
average annual earnings of $12 million ($30 million<divide>30 x 12) for 
Z Corporation. The combined average annual earnings of W Corporation and 
Z Corporation is $372 million. The interest for the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1973, to be paid or incurred by W Corporation on its 
outstanding indebtedness as of June 30, 1972, is $110 million. Since the 
projected earnings exceed the annual interest to be paid or incurred by 
more than three times, the obligation will not be corporate acquisition 
indebtedness, unless the issuing corporation's debt to equity ratio 
exceeds 2 to 1.

    (f) Ratio of debt to equity--(1) In general. The condition described 
in section 279(b)(4)(A) is present if the ratio of debt to equity of the 
issuing corporation exceeds 2 to 1. Under section 279(c)(2), the term 
ratio of debt to equity means the ratio which the total indebtedness of 
the issuing corporation bears to the sum of its money and all its other 
assets (in an amount equal to adjusted basis for determining gain) less 
such total indebtedness. For the meaning of the term indebtedness, see 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section. See section 279(g) and Sec. 1.279-6 
for rules with respect to the computation of the ratio of debt to equity 
in regard to an affiliated group of corporations.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of section 279(b)(4)(A) and this 
paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

[$5 million interest to be paid or incurred  x  $80 million owed to X 
Bank by its customers/$100 million total indebtedness]

    Example 1. On June 1, 1971, X Corporation, which files its federal 
income tax returns on a calendar year basis, issues an obligation for 
$45 million to the shareholders of Y Corporation to provide 
consideration for the acquisition of all of the stock of Y Corporation. 
Such obligation has the characteristics of corporate acquisition 
indebtedness described in section 279(b) (2) and (3). The projected 
earnings of X Corporation and Y Corporation exceed 3 times the annual 
interest to be paid or incurred by those corporations and, accordingly, 
the condition described in section 279(b)(4)(B) is not present. Also, on 
December 31, 1971, X Corporation has total assets with an adjusted basis 
of $150 million (including the newly acquired stock of Y Corporation 
having a basis of $45 million) and total indebtedness of $90 million. 
Hence, X Corporation's equity is $60 million computed by subtracting its 
$90 million of total indebtedness from its $150 million of total assets. 
Since X Corporation's ratio of debt to equity of 1.5 to 1 ($90 million 
of total indebtedness over $60 million equity) does not exceed 2 to 1, 
the condition described in section 279(b)(4)(A) is not present. 
Therefore, X Corporation's obligation for $45 million is not corporate 
acquisition indebtedness because on December 31, 1971, neither of the 
conditions specified in section 279(b)(4) existed.

    (g) Special rules for banks and lending or finance companies--(1) 
Debt to equity and projected earnings. Under section 279(c)(5), with 
respect to any corporation which is a bank (as defined in section 581) 
or is primarily engaged in a lending or finance business, the following 
rules are to be applied:
    (i) In determining under paragraph (f) of this section the ratio of 
debt to equity of such corporation (or of the affiliated group of which 
such corporation is a member), the total indebtedness of such 
corporation (and the assets of such corporation) shall be reduced by an 
amount equal to the total indebtedness owed to such corporation which 
arises out of the banking business of such corporation, or out of the 
lending or finance business of such corporation, as the case may be;
    (ii) In determining under paragraph (e) of this section the annual 
interest to be paid or incurred by such corporation (or by the issuing 
corporation and acquired corporation referred to in section 279(c)(4)(B) 
or by the affiliated group of corporations of which such

[[Page 578]]

corporation is a member), the amount of such interest (determined 
without regard to this subparagraph) shall be reduced by an amount which 
bears the same ratio to the amount of such interest as the amount of the 
reduction for the taxable year under subdivision (i) of this 
subparagraph bears to the total indebtedness of such corporation; and
    (iii) In determining under section 279(c)(3)(B) the average annual 
earnings, the amount of the earnings and profits for the 3-year period 
shall be reduced by the sum of the reductions under subdivision (ii) of 
this subparagraph for such period.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term lending or finance business 
means a business of making loans or purchasing or discounting accounts 
receivable, notes, or installment obligations. Additionally, the rules 
stated in this paragraph regarding the application of the ratio of debt 
to equity, the determination of the annual interest to be paid or 
incurred, and the determination of the average annual earnings also 
apply if the bank or lending or finance company is a member of an 
affiliated group of corporations. However, the rules are to be applied 
only for purposes of determining the debt, equity, projected earnings 
and annual interest of the bank or lending or finance company which then 
are taken into account in determining the debt to equity ratio and ratio 
of projected earnings to annual interest to be paid or incurred by the 
affiliated group as a whole. Thus, these rules are to be applied to 
reduce the bank's or lending or finance corporation's indebtedness, 
annual interest to be paid or incurred, and average annual earnings 
which are taken into account with respect to the group, but are not to 
reduce the indebtedness of, annual interest to be paid or incurred by, 
and average annual earnings of, any corporation in the affiliated group 
which is not a bank or a lending or finance company. In determining 
whether any corporation which is a member of an affiliated group is 
primarily engaged in a lending or finance business, only the activities 
of such corporation, and not those of the whole group, are to be taken 
into account. See Sec. 1.279-6 for the application of section 279 to 
certain affiliated groups of corporations.
    (2) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by 
the following examples:

    Example 1. As of the close of the taxable year, X Bank has a total 
indebtedness of $100 million, total assets of $115 million, and $80 
million is owed to X Bank by its customers. Bank X's indebtedness is $20 
million ($100 million total indebtedness less $80 million owed to the X 
Bank by its customers) and its assets are $35 million ($115 million 
total assets less $80 million owed to the bank by its customers). If its 
annual interest to be paid or incurred is $5 million, such amount is 
reduced by $4 million. Thus, X Bank's annual interest to be paid or 
incurred is $1 million.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1). X Bank has 
earnings and profits of $23 million for the 3-year period used to 
determine projected earnings. In computing the average annual earnings, 
the $23 million amount will be reduced by $12 million (three times the 
$4 million reduction of interest in Example (1), assuming that the 
reduction was the same for each year). Thus X Bank's earnings and 
profits for such 3-year period are $11 million ($23 million total 
earnings and profits less $12 million reduction).

    (h) Statement to be attached to return. In any case where any 
corporation claims a deduction in excess of $5 million for interest paid 
or incurred during the taxable year on obligations issued to provide 
consideration for acquisitions described in section 279(b)(1) of stock 
in, or assets of, an acquired corporation, the corporation shall attach 
to its return for such taxable year a statement which includes the 
particular provisions of section 279 and, in sufficient detail, the 
facts establishing that such obligations were not corporate acquisition 
indebtedness, or that the amount of the deduction for interest on its 
corporate acquisition indebtedness did not exceed the amount of interest 
which may be deducted on such obligations under section 279(a).

Sec. 1.279-6  Application of section 279 to certain affiliated groups.

    (a) In general. Under section 279(g), in any case in which the 
issuing corporation is a member of an affiliated group, the application 
of section 279 shall be determined by treating all of the members of the 
affiliated group in the aggregate as the issuing corporation, except 
that the ratio of debt to equity of, projected earnings of, and the 
annual

[[Page 579]]

interest to be paid or incurred by any corporation (other than the 
issuing corporation determined without regard to this paragraph) shall 
be included in the determinations required under section 279(b)(4) as of 
any day only if such corporation is a member of the affiliated group on 
such day, and, in determining projected earnings of such corporation 
under section 279(c)(3), there shall be taken into account only the 
earnings and profits of such corporation for the period during which it 
was a member of the affiliated group. The total amount of an affiliated 
member's assets, indebtedness, projected earnings, and interest to be 
paid or incurred will enter into the computation required by this 
section, irrespective of any minority ownership in such member.
    (b) Aggregate money and other assets. In determining the aggregate 
money and all the other assets of the affiliated group, the money and 
all the other assets of each member of such group shall be separately 
computed and such separately computed amounts shall be added together, 
except that adjustments shall be made, as follows:
    (1) There shall be eliminated from the aggregate money and all the 
other assets of the affiliated group intercompany receivables as of the 
date described in section 279(c)(1);
    (2) There shall be eliminated from the total assets of the 
affiliated group any amount which represents stock ownership in any 
member of such group;
    (3) In any case where gain or loss is not recognized on transactions 
between members of an affiliated group under paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, the basis of any asset involved in such transaction shall be 
the transferor's basis;
    (4) The basis of property in a transaction to which Sec. 1.1502-13 
applies is the basis of the property determined under that section; and
    (5) There shall be eliminated from the money and all the other 
assets of the affiliated group any other amount which, if included, 
would result in a duplication of amounts in the aggregate money and all 
the other assets of the affiliated group.
    (c) Aggregate indebtedness. For purposes of applying section 279(c), 
in determining the aggregate indebtedness of an affiliated group of 
corporations the total indebtedness of each member of such group shall 
be separately determined, and such separately determined amounts shall 
be added together, except that there shall be eliminated from such total 
indebtedness as of the date described in section 279(c)(1):
    (1) The amount of intercompany accounts payable,
    (2) The amount of intercompany bonds or other evidences of 
indebtedness, and
    (3) The amount of any other indebtedness which, if included, would 
result in a duplication of amounts in the aggregate indebtedness of such 
affiliated group.
    (d) Aggregate projected earnings. In the case of an affiliated group 
of corporations (whether or not such group files a consolidated return 
under section 1501), the aggregate projected earnings of such group 
shall be computed by separately determining the projected earnings of 
each member of such group under paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.279-5, and then 
adding together such separately determined amounts, except that:
    (1) A dividend (a distribution which is described in section 
301(c)(1) other than a distribution described in section 243(c)(1)) 
distributed by one member to another member shall be eliminated, and
    (2) In determining the earnings and profits of any member of an 
affiliated group, there shall be eliminated any amount of interest 
income received or accrued, and of interest expense paid or incurred, 
which is attributable to intercompany indebtedness,
    (3) No gain or loss shall be recognized in any transaction between 
members of the affiliated group, and
    (4) Members of an affiliated group who file a consolidated return 
shall not apply the provisions of Sec. 1.1502-18 dealing with inventory 
adjustments in determining earnings and profits for purposes of this 
section.
    (e) Aggregate interest to be paid or incurred. For purposes of 
section 279(c)(4), in determining the aggregate annual

[[Page 580]]

interest to be paid or incurred by an affiliated group of corporations, 
the annual interest to be paid or incurred by each member of such 
affiliated group shall be separately calculated under paragraph (e) of 
Sec. 1.279-5, and such separately calculated amounts shall be added 
together, except that any amount of annual interest to be paid or 
incurred on any intercompany indebtedness shall be eliminated from such 
aggregate interest.

Sec. 1.279-7   Effect on other provisions.

    Under section 279(j), no inference is to be drawn from any provision 
in section 279 and the regulations thereunder that any instrument 
designated as a bond, debenture, note, or certificate or other evidence 
of indebtedness by its issuer represents an obligation or indebtedness 
of such issuer in applying any other provision of this title. Thus, for 
example, an instrument, the interest on which is not subject to 
disallowance under section 279 could, under section 385 and the 
regulations thereunder, be found to constitute a stock interest, so that 
any amounts paid or payable thereon would not be deductible.

Sec. 1.280C-1  Disallowance of certain deductions for wage or salary expenses.

    If an employer elects to claim the targeted jobs credit under 
section 44B (as amended by the Revenue Act of 1978), or elects to claim 
the new jobs credit under section 44B (as in effect prior to enactment 
of the Revenue Act of 1978), the employer must reduce its deduction for 
wage or salary expenses paid or incurred in the year the credit is 
earned by the amount allowable as credit (determined without regard to 
the provisions of section 53). In the case in which wages and salaries 
are capitalized the amount subject to depreciation must be reduced by an 
amount equal to the amount of the credit (determined without regard to 
the provisions of section 53) in determining the depreciation deduction. 
In the case of an employer who uses the full absorption method of 
inventory costing under Sec. 1.471-11, the portion of the basis of the 
inventory attributable to the wage or salary expenses giving rise to the 
credit and paid or incurred in the year the credit is earned must be 
reduced by the amount of the credit allowable (determined without regard 
to the provisions of section 53). If the employer is an organization 
that is under common control (as described in Sec. 1.52-1), it must 
reduce its deduction for wage or salary expenses by the amount of the 
credit apportioned to it under Sec. 1.52-1 (a) or (b). The deduction for 
wage and salary expenses must be reduced in the year the credit is 
earned, even if the employer is unable to use the credit in that year 
because of the limitations imposed by section 53.

Sec. 1.280C-3  Disallowance of certain deductions for qualified clinical testing expenses when section 28 credit is allowable.

    (a) In general. If a taxpayer is entitled to a credit under section 
28 for qualified clinical testing expenses (as defined in section 
28(b)), it must reduce the amount of any deduction for qualified 
clinical testing expenses paid or incurred in the year the credit is 
earned by the amount allowable as credit for such expenses (determined 
without regard to section 28(d)(2)).
    (b) Capitalization of qualified clinical testing expenses. In a case 
in which qualified clinical testing expenses are capitalized, the amount 
chargeable to the capital account for a taxable year must be reduced by 
the excess of the amount of the credit allowable for the taxable year 
under section 28 (determined without regard to section 28(d)(2)) over 
the amount allowable as a deduction for qualified clinical testing 
expenses (determined without regard to paragraph (a) of this section) 
for the taxable year. See section 174 and the regulations thereunder.
    (c) Controlled group of corporations; organizations under common 
control. In the case of a taxpayer described in paragraph (d)(5) of 
Sec. 1.28-1 of this chapter 

[[Page 581]]

(relating to controlled groups of corporations and organizations under 
common control), paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be applied 
in accordance with the rules prescribed for aggregation of expenditures 
under that paragraph.
    (d) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:

    Example. A incurs $1,000 in clinical testing expenses for which a 
$500 credit is allowable under section 28. A also elects under section 
174 of the Code to amortize these expenses over a 5-year period 
beginning in the year the credit is claimed. Under paragraph (a), the 
current year amortization deduction of $200 ($1,000<divide>5) is 
disallowed. Moreover, the amount which would otherwise be capitalized, 
$800, is reduced by the excess of the amount of the section 28 credit 
claimed for the taxable year over the amount of the allowable section 
174 amortization deduction for the taxable year, or $300 ($500-$200). 
Thus, the amount chargeable to the capital account for the taxable year 
is $500 ($800-$300). A is entitled to amortize $500 over the remaining 
amortization period resulting in a deduction of $125 for each of the 
remaining four years.

Sec. 1.280C-4  Credit for increasing research activities.

    (a) In general. The election under section 280C(c)(3) to have the 
provisions of section 280C(c) (1) and (2) not apply shall be made by 
claiming the reduced credit under section 41(a) determined by the method 
provided in section 280C(c)(3)(B) on an original return for the taxable 
year, filed at any time on or before the due date (including extensions) 
for filing the income tax return for such year. An election, once made 
for any taxable year, shall be irrevocable for that taxable year.
    (b) Transition rule--(1) In general. In the case of a taxable year 
beginning after December 31, 1988, for which the due date (including 
extensions) for filing the return is on or before March 4, 1990, the 
election under section 280C(c)(3) shall be made by claiming the reduced 
credit under section 41(a) determined by the method provided in section 
280C(c)(3)(B) on an original or amended return for such taxable year 
filed on or before March 3, 1990.
    (2) Taxpayers who made an election under former section 41(h). If a 
taxpayer--
    (i) Prior to December 19, 1989, made an election for a taxable year 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section under section 41(h) (as it 
existed before it was repealed by section 7814(e) of the Revenue 
Reconciliation Act of 1989) by not claiming any credit allowable under 
section 41(a), and
    (ii) Has not filed an amended return on or before March 3, 1990 
claiming the full credit allowable under section 41(a), the taxpayer 
will be treated as having made an election under section 280C(c)(3). 
Therefore, the provisions of section 280C(c) (1) and (2) shall not apply 
in such taxable year. However, in order to obtain the benefit of the 
reduced credit under section 41(a) determined by the method provided in 
section 280C(c)(3)(B), such a taxpayer must claim the reduced credit on 
an amended return filed before the expiration of the period prescribed 
in section 6511 for filing a claim for credit or refund of the tax 
imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.
    (c) Effective date. The provisions of this section are effective for 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1988.

Sec. 1.280F-1T  Limitations on investment tax credit and recovery deductions under section 168 for passenger automobiles and certain other listed property; 
          overview of regulations (temporary).

    (a) In general. Section 280F(a) limits the amount of investment tax 
credit determined under section 46(a) and recovery deductions under 
section 168 for passenger automobiles. Section 280F(b) denies the 
investment tax credit and requires use of the straight line method of 
recovery for listed property that is not predominantly used in a 
qualified business use. In certain circumstances, section 280F(b) 
requires the recapture of an amount of cost recovery deductions 
previously claimed by the taxpayer. Section 280F(c) provides that 
lessees are to be subject to restrictions substantially equivalent to 

[[Page 582]]

those imposed on owners of such property under section 280F (a) and (b). 
Section 280F(d) provides definitions and special rules; note that 
section 280F(d) (2) and (3) apply with respect to all listed property, 
even if the other provisions of section 280F do not affect the treatment 
of the property.
    (b) Key to Code provisions. The following table identifies the 
provisions of section 280F under which regulations are provided, and 
lists each provision below with its corresponding regulation section:

           (d)(10)             ..................  ..................  ......................        (d)(6)     
                                                                                                                

Sections 1.280F-2T(f) and 1.280F-4T(b) also provide special rules for 
improvements to passenger automobiles and other listed property that 
qualify as capital expenditures.
    (c) Effective dates--(1) In general. This section and Secs. 1.280F-
2T through 1.280F-6T apply to property placed in service or leased after 
June 18, 1984, in taxable years ending after that date. Section 1.280F-7 
applies to property leased after December 31, 1986, in taxable years 
ending after that date.
    (2) Exception. This section and Secs. 1.280F-2T through 1.280F-6T 
shall not apply to any property:
    (i) Acquired pursuant to a binding contract in effect on June 18, 
1984, and at all times thereafter, or under construction by the taxpayer 
on that date, but only if the property is placed in service before 
January 1, 1985 (January 1, 1987, in the case of 15-year real property), 
or
    (ii) Leased pursuant to a binding contract in effect on June 18, 
1984, and at all times thereafter, but only if the lessee first uses 
such property under the lease before January 1, 1985 (January 1, 1987, 
in the case of 15-year real property).
    (3) Leased passenger automobiles. Section 1.280F-5T(e) generally 
applies to passenger automobiles leased after April 2, 1985, and before 
January 1, 1987, in taxable years ending after April 2, 1985. Section 
1.280F-5T(e) generally applies to passenger automobiles leased after 
April 2, 1985, in taxable years ending after that date. Section 1.280F-
5T(e) does not apply to any passenger automobile that is leased pursuant 
to a binding contract, which is entered into no later than April 2, 
1985, and which is in effect at all times thereafter, but only if the 
automobile is used under the lease before August 1, 1985. If 
Sec. 1.280F-5T(e) does not apply to a passenger automobile, see

<R05>
Sec. 1.280F-2T  Limitations on recovery deductions and the investment tax credit for certain passenger automobiles (Temporary).

    (a) Limitation on amount of investment tax credit--(1) General rule. 
The amount of the investment tax credit determined under section 46(a) 
for any passenger automobile shall not exceed $1,000. For a passenger 
automobile placed in service after December 31, 1984, the $1,000 amount 
shall be increased by the automobile price inflation adjustment (as 
defined in section 280F(d)(7)) for the calendar year in which the 
automobile is placed in service.
    (2) Election of reduced investment tax credit. If the taxpayer 
elects under section 48(q)(4) to reduce the amount of the investment tax 
credit in lieu of adjusting the basis of the passenger automobile under 
section 48(q)(1), the amount of the investment tax credit for any 
passenger automobile shall not exceed two-thirds of the amount 
determined under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

[[Page 583]]

    (b) Limitations on allowable recovery deductions--(1) Recovery 
deduction for year passenger automobile is placed in service. For the 
taxable year that a taxpayer places a passenger automobile in service, 
the allowable recovery deduction under section 168(a) shall not exceed 
$4,000. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section for the adjustment to this 
limitation.
    (2) Recovery deduction for remaining taxable years during the 
recovery period. For any taxable year during the recovery period 
remaining after the year that the property is placed in service, the 
allowable recovery deduction under section 168(a) shall not exceed 
$6,000. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section for the adjustment to this 
limitation.
    (3) Adjustment to limitation by reason of automobile price inflation 
adjustment. The limitations on the allowable recovery deductions 
prescribed in paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section are increased by 
the automobile price inflation adjustment (as defined in section 
280F(d)(7)) for the calendar year in which the automobile is placed in 
service.
    (4) Coordination with section 179. For purposes of section 280F(a) 
and this section, any deduction allowable under section 179 (relating to 
the election to expense certain depreciable trade or business assets) is 
treated as if that deduction were a recovery deduction under section 
168. Thus, the amount of the section 179 deduction is subject to the 
limitations described in paragraph (b) (1) and (2) of this section.
    (c) Disallowed recovery deductions allowed for years subsequent to 
the recovery period--(1) In general. (i) Except as otherwise provided in 
this paragraph (c), the ``unrecovered basis'' (as defined in paragraph 
(c)(1)(ii) of this section) of any passenger automobile is treated as a 
deductible expense in the first taxable year succeeding the end of the 
recovery period.
    (ii) The term unrecovered basis means the excess (if any) of:
    (A) The unadjusted basis (as defined in section 168(d)(1)(A), except 
that there is no reduction by reason of an election to expense a portion 
of the basis under section 179) of the passenger automobile, over
    (B) The amount of the recovery deductions (including any section 179 
deduction elected by the taxpayer) which would have been allowable for 
taxable years in the recovery period (determined after the application 
of section 280F (a) and paragraph (b) of this section and as if all use 
during the recovery period were used described in section 168(c)(1)).
    (2) Special rule when taxpayer elects to use the section 168(b)(3) 
optional recovery percentages. If the taxpayer elects to use the 
optional recovery percentages under section 168(b)(3) or must use the 
straight line method over the earnings and profits life (as defined and 
described in Sec. 1.280F-3T(f)), the second succeeding taxable year 
after the end of the recovery period is treated as the first succeeding 
taxable year after the end of the recovery period for purposes of this 
paragraph (c) because of the half-year convention. For example, assume a 
calendar-year taxpayer places in service on July 1, 1984, a passenger 
automobile (i.e., 3-year recovery property) and elects under section 
168(b)(3) to recover its cost over 5 years using the straight line 
optional percentages. Based on these facts, calendar year 1990 is 
treated as the first succeeding taxable year after the end of the 
recovery period.
    (3) Deduction limited to $6,000 for any taxable year. The amount 
that may be treated as a deductible expense under this paragraph (c) in 
the first taxable year succeeding the recovery period shall not exceed 
$6,000. Any excess shall be treated as an expense for the succeeding 
taxable years. However, in no event may any deduction in a succeeding 
taxable year exceed $6,000. The limitation on amounts deductible as an 
expense under this paragraph (c) with respect to any passenger 
automobile is increased by the automobile price inflation adjustment (as 
defined in section 280F(d)(7)) for the calendar year in which such 
automobile is placed in service.
    (4) Deduction treated as a section 168 recovery deduction. Any 
amount allowable as an expense in a taxable year after the recovery 
period by reason of this paragraph (c) shall be treated as a recovery 
deduction allowable under

[[Page 584]]

section 168. However, a deduction is allowable by reason of this 
paragraph (c) with respect to any passenger automobile for a taxable 
year only to the extent that a deduction under section 168 would be 
allowable with respect to the automobile for that year. For example, no 
recovery deduction is allowable for a year during which a passenger 
automobile is disposed of or is used exclusively for personal purposes.
    (d) Additional reduction in limitations by reason of personal use of 
passenger automobile or by reason of a short taxable year. See paragraph 
(i) of this section for rules regarding the additional reduction in the 
limitations prescribed by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section by 
reason of the personal use of a passenger automobile or by reason of a 
short taxable year.
    (e) Examples. The provisions of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this 
section may be illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of 
these examples, assume that all taxpayers use the calendar year and that 
no short taxable years are involved.

    Example 1. (i) On July 1, 1984, B purchases for $45,000 and places 
in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property 
under section 168. In 1984, B does not elect under section 179 to 
expense a portion of the cost of the automobile. The automobile is used 
exclusively in B's business during taxable years 1984 through 1990.
    (ii) The maximum amount of B's investment tax credit is $1,000 
(i.e., the lesser of $1,000 or .06 x $45,000). B's unadjusted basis for 
purposes of section 168 is $44,500 (i.e., $45,000 reduced under section 
48(q)(1) by $500). B selects the use of the accelerated recovery 
percentages under section 168(b)(1).
    (iii) The maximum amount of B's recovery deduction for 1984 is 
$4,000 (i.e, the lesser of $4,000 or .25 x $44,500); for 1985, $6,000 
(i.e., the lesser of $6,000 or .38 x $44,500); and for 1986, $6,000 
(i.e., the lesser of $6,000 or .37 x $44,500).
    (iv) At the beginning of taxable year 1987, B's unrecovered basis in 
the automobile is $28,500 (i.e., $44,500-$16,000). Under paragraph (c) 
of this section, B may expense $6,000 of the unrecovered basis in the 
automobile in 1987. This expense is treated as a recovery deduction 
under section 168. For taxable years 1988 through 1990, B may deduct 
$6,000 of the unrecovered basis per year. At the beginning of 1991, B's 
unrecovered basis in the automobile is $4,500. During that year, B 
disposes of the automobile. B is not allowed a deduction for 1991 
because no deduction would be allowable under section 168 based on these 
facts.

    Example 2. (i) On July 1, 1984, C purchases for $50,000 and places 
in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property 
under section 168. The automobile is used exclusively in C's business 
during taxable years 1984 through 1992. In 1984, C does not elect under 
section 179 to expense a portion of the automobile's cost. C elects 
under section 48(q)(4) to take a reduced investment tax credit in lieu 
of the section 48(q)(1) basis adjustment.
    (ii) The maximum amount of C's investment tax credit is $666.67 
(i.e., the lesser of \2/3\ of $1,000 or .04 x $50,000). C's unadjusted 
basis for purposes of section 168 is $50,000. C elects to use the 
optional recovery percentages under section 168(b)(3) based on a 5-year 
recovery period.
    (iii) The maximum amount of C's recovery deduction for 1984 is 
$4,000 (i.e., the lesser of $4,000 or .10 x $50,000); for taxable years 
1985 through 1988, $6,000 per year (i.e., the lesser of $6,000 or .20 of 
$50,000). C's recovery deduction for 1989 is $5,000 (i.e., the lesser of 
.10 x $50,000 or $6,000).
    (iv) At the beginning of taxable year 1990, C's unrecovered basis in 
the automobile is $17,000. Under paragraph (c) of this section, C may 
expense $6,000 of the unrecovered basis in the automobile in 1990. this 
expense is treated as a recovery deduction under section 168. For 
taxable years 1991 and 1992, C may deduct $6,000, and $5,000, 
respectively of the unrecovered basis per year.

    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (2), except that C 
disposes of the passenger automobile on July 1, 1990. Under paragraph 
(c) of this section, C is not allowed a deduction for 1990 or for any 
succeeding taxable year because no deduction would be allowable under 
section 168 based on these facts.

    Example 4. (i) On July 1, 1984, G purchases for $15,000 and places 
in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property 
under section 168. The automobile is used exclusively in G's business 
during taxable years 1984 through 1987. In 1984, G elects under section 
179 to expense $5,000 of the cost of the property.
    (ii) The maximum amount of G's investment tax credit is $600 (i.e., 
the lesser of .06 x $10,000 or $1,000).
    (iii) G's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $9,700 
(i.e., $15,000 minus the sum of $5,000 (the amount of the expense 
elected under section 179) and $300 (one-half of the investment tax 
credit under section 48(q)(1))). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, 
the allowable deduction under section 179 is treated as a recovery 
deduction under section 168 for purposes of this section. Thus, the 
maximum amount of G's section 179 deduction is $4,000 (i.e., the lesser 
of $4,000 or $5,000+.25 x $9,700). G is entitled to no further recovery 
deduction under section 168 for 1984.

[[Page 585]]

The amount of G's 1985 and 1986 recovery deductions are $3,686 (i.e., 
the lesser of .38 x $9,700 or $6,000) and $3,589 (i.e., the lesser of 
.37 x $9,700 or $6,000), respectively. At the beginning of 1987, G's 
unrecovered basis in the automobile is $3,425 (i.e., $14,700-$11,275). 
Under paragraph (c) of this section, G may expense the remaining $3,425 
in 1987.

    Example 5. (i) On July 1, 1984, D purchases for $55,000 and places 
in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property 
under section 168. The automobile is used exclusvely in D's business 
during taxable years 1984 through 1993. In 1984, D elects under section 
179 to expense $5,000 of the cost of the property.
    (ii) The maximum amount of D's investment tax credit is $1,000 
(i.e., the lesser of $1,000 or .06 x $50,000).
    (iii) D's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $49,500 
(i.e., $55,000 minus the sum of $5,000 (the amount of the expense 
elected under section 179) and $500 (one-half of the investment tax 
credit under section 48 (q)(1))). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section, the allowable deduction under section 179 is treated as a 
recovery deduction under section 168 for purposes of this section. Thus, 
the maximum amount of D's section 179 deduction is $4,000 (i.e., the 
lesser of $4,000 or $5,000+.25 x $49,500). D is entitled to no further 
recovery deduction under section 168 for 1984. The maximum amount of D's 
1985 recovery deduction is $6,000 (i.e., the lesser of $6,000 or 
.38 x $49,500); and for 1986, $6,000 (i.e., the lesser of $6,000 or .37 
of $49,500).
    (iv) At the beginning of 1987, D's unrecovered basis is $38,500. D 
may expense the remaining unrecovered basis at the rate of $6,000 per 
year through 1992 and $2,500 in 1993.

    Example 6. Assume the same facts as in Example (5), except that in 
1993, D uses the automobile only 60 percent in his business. Under 
paragraph (c)(4) of this section for 1993, D may expense $1,500 (i.e., 
.60 x $2,500). D is entitled to no further deductions with respect to 
the automobile in any later year.

    Example 7. (i) On July 1, 1984, F purchases for $44,500 and places 
in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property 
under section 168. The automobile is used exclusively in F's business 
during taxable years 1984 through 1992. In 1984, F elects under section 
179 to expense $5,000 of the cost of the property.
    (ii) F elects under section 48(q)(4) to take a reduced investment 
tax credit in lieu of the section 48(q)(1) basis adjustment. The maximum 
amount of F's investment tax credit is $666.67 (i.e., the lesser of \2/
3\ of $1,000 or .04 x $39,500).
    (iii) F's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $39,500 
(i.e., $44,500-$5,000 (the amount of the expense elected under section 
179)). F elects to use the optional recovery percentage under section 
168(b)(3) based on a 5-year recovery period. Under paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section, the allowable section 179 deduction is treated as a 
recovery deduction under section 168 for purposes of this section. Thus, 
the maximum amount of F's section 179 deduction is $4,000 (i.e., the 
lesser of $4,000 or $5,000+.10 x $39,500). F is entitled to no further 
recovery deduction under section 168 for 1984. The maximum amounts of 
F's recovery deductions for 1985 through 1988 are $6,000 per year (i.e., 
the lesser of $6,000 or .20 x $39,500). F's recovery deduction for 1989 
(the first taxable year after the 5-year recovery period but the sixth 
recovery year for purposes of section 168) is $3,950 (i.e., the lesser 
of .10 x $39,500 or $6,000).
    (iv) Under paragraph (c), taxable year 1990 is considered to be the 
first taxable year succeeding the end of the recovery period. At the 
beginning of taxable year 1990, F's unrecovered basis in the automobile 
is $12,550 (i.e., $44,500-$31,950). Under paragraph (c), F may expense 
$6,000 of his unrecovered basis in the automobile in 1990 and in 1991. 
This expense is treated as a recovery deduction under section 168. For 
taxable year 1992, F may expense the remaining $550 of his unrecovered 
basis in the automobile.

    (f) Treatment of improvements that qualify as capital expenditures. 
An improvement to a passenger automobile that qualifies as a capital 
expenditure under section 263 is treated as a new item of recovery 
property placed in service in the year the improvement is made. However, 
the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section on the amount of 
recovery deductions allowable are determined by taking into account as a 
whole both the improvement and the property of which the improvement is 
a part. If that improvement also qualifies as an investment in new 
section 38 property under section 48(b) and Sec. 1.48-2(b)(2), the 
limitation in paragraph (a)(1) of this section on the amount of the 
investment tax credit for that improvement is determined by taking into 
account any investment tax credit previously allowed for the passenger 
automobile (including any prior improvement considered part of the 
passenger automobile). Thus, the maximum credit allowable for the 
automobile (including the improvement) will be $1,000 (or \2/3\ of 
$1,000, in the case of an election to take a reduced credit under 
section 48(q)(4)) (adjusted under section 280F(d)(7) to reflect the 
automobile price inflation adjustment for the year the property of

[[Page 586]]

which the improvement is a part is placed in service).
    (g) Treatment of section 1031 or section 1033 transactions--(1) 
Treatment of exchanged passenger automobile. For a taxable year in which 
a transaction described in section 1031 or section 1033 occurs, the 
unadjusted basis of an exchanged or converted passenger automobile shall 
cease to be taken into account in determining any recovery deductions 
allowable under section 168 as of the beginning of the taxable year in 
which the exchange or conversion occurs. Thus, no recovery deduction is 
allowable for the exchanged or converted automobile in the year of the 
exchange or conversion.
    (2) Treatment of acquired passenger automobile--(i) In general. The 
acquired automobile is treated as new property placed in service in the 
year of the exchange (or in the replacement year) and that year is its 
first recovery year.
    (ii) Limitations on recovery deductions. If the exchanged (or 
converted) automobile was acquired after the effective date of section 
280F (as set out in Sec. 1.280F-1(c)), the basis of that automobile as 
determined under section 1031(d) or section 1033(b) (whichever is 
applicable) must be reduced for purposes of computing recovery 
deductions with respect to the acquired automobile (but not for purposes 
of determining the amount of the investment tax credit and gain or loss 
on the sale or other disposition of the property) by the excess (if any) 
of:
    (A) The sum of the amounts that would have been allowable as 
recovery deductions with respect to the exchanged (or converted) 
automobile during taxable years preceding the year of the exchange (or 
conversion) if all of the use of the automobile during those years was 
use described in section 168(c), over
    (B) The sum of the amounts allowable as recovery deductions during 
those years.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (g) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. (i) In 1982, F purchases and places in service a 
passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property under section 
168. The automobile is used exclusively in F's business.
    (ii) On July 1, 1984, F exchanges the passenger automobile and 
$1,000 cash for a new passenger automobile (``like kind'' property). 
Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, no recovery deduction is allowed 
in 1984 for the exchanged automobile. Any investment tax credit claimed 
with respect to that automobile is subject to recapture under section 
47.
    (iii) F's basis in the acquired property (as determined under 
section 1031(d) and F's qualified investment are $20,000. Under the 
provisions of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, the acquired property 
is treated as new recovery property placed in service in 1984 to the 
extent of the full $20,000 of basis. The maximum amount of F's 
investment tax credit is limited to $1,000 (i.e., the lesser of $1,000 
or .06 x $20,000). Cost recovery deductions are computed pursuant to 
paragraph (b) of this section.

    Example 2. (i) On July 1, 1984, E purchases for $30,000 and places 
in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property 
under section 168. In 1984, E's business use percentage is 80 percent 
and such use constitutes his total business/investment use.
    (ii) E elects under section 48(q)(4) to take a reduced investment 
tax credit in lieu of the section 48 (q)(1) basis adjustment. The 
maximum amount of E's investment tax credit is $533.33 (i.e., the lesser 
of \2/3\ of $1,000 x .80 or .80 x .04 x $30,000).
    (iii) E's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $30,000. E 
selects the use of the accelerated recovery percentages under section 
168(b)(1). The maximum amount of E's recovery deduction for 1984 is 
$3,200 (i.e., the lesser of .80 x $4,000 or .80 x .25 x $30,000).
    (iv) On June 10, 1985, E exchanges the passenger automobile and 
$1,000 cash for a new passenger automobile (``like kind'' property). 
Under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, no recovery deduction is 
allowable in 1985 for the exchanged automobile. The investment tax 
credit claimed is subject to recapture under section 47. Under paragraph 
(g)(2)(ii) of this section, E's basis in the acquired property for 
purposes of computing recovery deductions under section 280F is $27,000 
(i.e., $27,800 (section 1031(d) basis)--$800). The acquired automobile 
is used exclusively in F's business during taxable years 1985 through 
1988. Under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the acquired property is 
treated as new recovery property placed in service in 1985. Assume that 
the automobile price inflation adjustment (as described under section 
280F(d)(7)) is zero. E's qualified investment in the property, as 
determined under Sec. 1.46-3(c)(1), is $27,800. The maximum amount of 
E's investment tax credit is $1,000 (i.e., the lesser of $1,000 or 
.06 x $27,800). E's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is 
$26,500 (i.e., $27,000 reduced under section 48(q)(1) by $500). Cost

recovery deductions are computed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section.

    (h) Other nonrecognition transactions. [Reserved]
    (i) Limitation under this section applies before other limitations--
(1) Personal use. The limitations imposed upon the maximum amount of the 
allowable investment tax credit and the allowable recovery deductions 
(as described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section) must be 
adjusted during any taxable year in which a taxpayer makes any use of a 
passenger automobile other than for business/investment use (as defined 
in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(3)). The limitations on the amount of the allowable 
investment tax credit (as described in paragraph (a) of this section) 
and the allowable cost recovery deductions (as described in paragraphs 
(b) and (c) of this section) are redetermined by multiplying the 
limitations by the percentage of business/investment use (determined on 
an annual basis) during the taxable year.
    (2) Short taxable year. The limitations imposed upon the maximum 
amount of the allowable recovery deductions (as described in paragraphs 
(a) through (c) of this section) must be adjusted during any taxable 
year in which a taxpayer has a short taxable year. In this case, the 
limitation is adjusted by multiplying the limitation that would have 
been applied if the taxable year were not a short taxable year by a 
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months and part-months 
in the short taxable year and the denominator of which is 12.
    (3) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (i) may be 
illustrated by the following examples:

    Example 1. On July 1, 1984, A purchases and places in service a 
passenger automobile and uses it 80 percent for business/investment use 
during 1984. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the maximum amount 
of the investment tax credit that A may claim for the automobile is $800 
(i.e., .80 x $1,000).
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that A 
elects under section 48(q)(4) to take a reduced investment tax credit in 
lieu of the section 48(q)(1) basis adjustment. Under paragraph (i)(1) of 
this section, the maximum amount of the investment tax credit that A may 
claim for the automobile is $533.33 (i.e., .80 x \2/3\  x $1,000).
    Example 3. On July 1, 1984, B purchases and places in service a 
passenger automobile and uses it 60 percent for business/investment use 
during 1984. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the maximum amount 
of the investment tax credit that B may claim for the automobile is $600 
(i.e., .60 x $1,000). B uses the car 70 percent for business/investment 
use during 1985 and 80 percent during 1986. Under paragraph (i)(1) of 
this section, the maximum amount of recovery deductions that B may claim 
for 1984, 1985, and 1986 are $2,400 (i.e., .60 x $4,000), $4,200 (i.e., 
.70 x $6,000), and $4,800 (i.e., .80 x $6,000), respectively.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example (3) with the added 
facts that B's unrecovered basis at the beginning of 1987 is $6,000 and 
that B uses the automobile 85 percent for business/investment use during 
1987. Under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, the maximum amount that B 
may claim as an expense for 1987 is $5,000 (i.e., .85 x $6,000).
    Example 5. On August 1, 1984, C purchases and places in service a 
passenger automobile and uses it exclusively for business. Taxable year 
1984 for C is a short taxable year which consists of 6 months. Under 
paragraph (i)(2) of this section, the maximum amount that C may claim as 
a recovery deduction for 1984 is $2,000 (i.e., \6/12\ x $4,000).
    Example 6. Assume the same facts as in Example (5), except that C 
uses the passenger automobile 70 percent for business/investment use 
during 1984. Under paragraph (i) (1) and (2) of this section, the 
maximum amount that C may claim as a recovery deduction for 1984 is 
$1,400 (i.e., .70 x \6/12\  x $4,000).

<R05>
Sec. 1.280F-3T  Limitations on recovery deductions and the investment tax credit when the business use percentage of listed property is not greater than 50 
          percent (temporary).

    (a) In general. Section 280F(b), generally, imposes limitations with 
respect to the amount allowable as an investment tax credit under 
section 46(a) and the amount allowable as a recovery deduction under 
section 168 in the case of listed property (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-
6T(b)) if certain business use of the property (referred to as 
``qualified business use'') does not exceed 50 percent during a taxable 
year. Qualified business use generally means use in a trade or business, 
rather than use in an investment or other activity conducted for the 
production of income within the meaning of section 212. See Sec. 1.280F-

[[Page 588]]

6T(d) for the distinction between ``business/ investment use'' and 
``qualified business use.''
    (b) Limitation on the amount of investment tax credit--(1) Denial of 
investment tax credit when business use percentage not greater than 50 
percent. Listed property is not treated as section 38 property to any 
extent unless the business use percentage (as defined in section 
280F(d)(6) and Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(1)) is greater than 50 percent. For 
example, if a taxpayer uses listed property in a trade or business in 
the taxable year in which it is placed in service, but the business use 
percentage is not greater than 50 percent, no investment tax credit is 
allowed for that listed property. If, in the taxable year in which 
listed property is placed in service, the only business/investment use 
(as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(3)) of that property is qualified 
business use (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(2)(i)), and the business 
use percentage is 55 percent, the investment tax credit is allowed for 
the 55 percent of the listed property that is treated as section 38 
property. The credit allowed is unaffected by any increase in the 
business use percentage in a subsequent taxable year.
    (2) Recapture of investment tax credit. Listed property ceases to be 
section 38 property to the extent that the business/investment use (as 
defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(3)) for any taxable year is less than the 
business/investment use for the taxable year in which the property is 
placed in service. See Sec. 1.47-2(c). If the business use percentage 
(as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(1)) of listed property is greater than 
50 percent for the taxable year in which the property is placed in 
service, and less than or equal to 50 percent for any subsequent taxable 
year, that property ceases to be section 38 property in its entirety in 
that subsequent taxable year. Under Sec. 1.47-1(c)(1)(ii)(b), the 
property (or a portion thereof) is treated as ceasing to be section 38 
property on the first day of the taxable year in which the cessation 
occurs.
    (c) Limitation on the method of cost recovery under section 168 when 
business use of property not greater than 50 percent--(1) Year of 
acquisition. If any listed property (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(b)) is 
not predominantly used in a qualified business use (as defined in 
Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(4)) in the year it is acquired, the recovery 
deductions allowed under section 168 for the property for that taxable 
year and for succeeding taxable years are to be determined using the 
straight line method over its earnings and profits life (as defined in 
paragraph (f) of this section). Additionally, the taxpayer is not 
entitled to make any election under section 179 with respect to the 
property for that year.
    (2) Subsequent years. If any listed property is not subject to 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section because such property is predominantly 
used in a qualified business use (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(4)) 
during the year it is acquired but is not predominantly used in a 
qualified business use during a subsequent taxable year, the rules of 
this paragraph (c)(2) apply. In such a case, the taxpayer must determine 
the recovery deductions allowed under section 168 for the taxable year 
that the listed property is not predominantly used in a qualified 
business use and for any subsequent taxable year as if such property was 
not predominantly used in a qualified business use in the year in which 
it was acquired and there had been no section 179 election with respect 
to the property. Thus, the recovery deductions allowable under section 
168 for the remaining taxable years are computed by determining the 
applicable recovery percentage that would apply if the taxpayer had used 
the straight line method over the property's earnings and profits life 
beginning with the year the property was placed in service.
    (3) Effect of rule on recovery property that is not listed property. 
The mandatory use of the straight line method over the property's 
earnings and profits life under paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this 
section does not have any effect on the proper method of cost recovery 
for other recovery property of that same class placed in service in the 
same taxable year by the taxpayer and does not constitute an election to 
use an optional recovery period under section 168(b)(3).

[[Page 589]]

    (d) Recapture of excess recovery deductions claimed--(1) In general. 
If paragraph (c)(2) of this section is applicable, any excess 
depreciation (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) must be 
included in the taxpayer's gross income and added to the property's 
adjusted basis for the first taxable year in which the property is not 
predominantly used in a qualified business use (as defined in 
Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(4)).
    (2) Definition of excess depreciation. For purposes of this section, 
the term excess depreciation means the excess (if any) of:
    (i) The amount of the recovery deductions allowable with respect to 
the property for taxable years before the first taxable year in which 
the property was not predominantly used in a qualified business use, 
over
    (ii) The amount of the recovery deductions which would have been 
allowable for those years if the property had not been predominantly 
used in a qualified business use for the year it was acquired and there 
had been no section 179 election with respect to the property.

For purposes of paragraph (d)(2)(i), any deduction allowable under 
section 179 (relating to the election to expense certain depreciable 
trade or business assets) is treated as if that deduction was a recovery 
deduction under section 168.
    (3) Recordkeeping requirement. A taxpayer must be able to 
substantiate the use of any listed property, as prescribed in section 
274(d)(4) and Sec. 1.274-5T or Sec. 1.274-6T, for any taxable year for 
which recapture under section 280F(b)(3) and paragraph (d) (1) and (2) 
of this section may occur even if the taxpayer has fully depreciated (or 
expensed) the listed property in a prior year. For example, in the case 
of 3-year recovery property, the taxpayer shall maintain a log, journal, 
etc. for six years even though the taxpayer fully depreciated the 
property in the first three years.
    (e) Earnings and profits life--(1) Definition. The earnings and 
profits life with respect to any listed property is generally the 
following:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               The applicable recovery  
              In the case of--                       period is--        
------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-year property............................   5 years.                  
5-year property............................   12 years.                 
10-year property...........................   25 years.                 
18-year real property and low-income          40 years.                 
 housing.                                                               
15-year public utility property............   35 years.                 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, if the recovery period applicable to any recovery property 
under section 168 is longer than the above assigned recovery period, 
such longer recovery period shall be used. For example, generally, the 
recovery period for recovery property used predominantly outside the 
United States is the property's present class life (as defined in 
section 168(g)(2)). In many cases, a property's present class life is 
longer than the recovery period assigned to the property under the above 
table. Pursuant to this paragraph (e)(1), the property's recovery period 
is its present class life.
    (2) Applicable recovery percentages. If the applicable recovery 
period is determined pursuant to the table prescribed in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section, the applicable recovery percentage is:
    (i) For property other than 18-year real property or low-income 
housing:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                           And the recovery period is-- 
        If the recovery year is--        -------------------------------
                                             5      12      25      35

    (ii) For 18-year real property: [Reserved]
    (iii) For low-income housing: [Reserved]
    (f) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples. For purposes of these examples, assume that all 
taxpayers use the calendar year and that no short taxable years are 
involved.

    Example 1. On July 1, 1984, B purchases for $50,000 and places in 
service an item of listed property (other than a passenger automobile) 
which is 3-year recovery property under section 168. For the first 
taxable year that the property is in service, B used the property 40 
percent in a trade or business, 40 percent for the production of income, 
and 20 percent for personal purposes. Although B's total business/
investment use is greater than 50 percent, the business use percentage 
for that taxable year is only 40 percent. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, no investment tax credit is allowed for the property.

    Example 2. (i) On January 1, 1985, C purchases for $40,000 and 
places in service an item of listed property (other than a passenger 
automobile) that is 3-year recovery property under section 168. Seventy 
percent of the use of the property is in C's trade or business and 30 
percent of the use is for personal purposes. C does not elect a reduced 
investment tax credit under section 48(q)(4). The amount of C's 
investment tax credit is $1,680 (i.e., $40,000  x  .60  x  .10  x  .70).
    (ii) In addition, in 1986, only 55 percent of the use of the 
property is in C's trade or business and 45 percent of the use is for 
personal purposes. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the property 
ceases to be section 38 property to the extent that the use in a trade 
or business decreased below 70 percent. As a result, a portion of the 
investment tax credit must be recaptured as an increase in tax liability 
for 1986 under the rules of section 47 (relating to the recapture of 
investment tax credit). See section 47(a)(5) and Sec. 1.47-2(e) for 
rules relating to the computation of the recapture amount.

    Example 3. On July 1, 1984, B purchases and places in service an 
item of listed property (other than a passenger automobile) that is 3-
year recovery property. B elects to take a reduced investment tax credit 
under section 48(q)(4). In 1984, B uses the property exclusively in his 
business. Assume that B's 1984 allowable recovery deduction is $12,500. 
In 1985 and 1986, the property is not predominantly used in a qualified 
business use. The investment tax credit claimed is subject to recapture 
in full under section 47 in 1985 since the property ceases to be section 
38 property in its entirety on January 1, 1985. Under paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section, B must treat the property for 1985 and subsequent 
taxable years as if he recovered its cost over a 5-year recovery period 
(i.e., its earnings and profits life) using the straight line method 
(with the half-year convention) from the time it was placed in service. 
Therefore, taxable year 1985 is treated as the property's second 
recovery year (of its 5-year recovery period) and the applicable 
recovery deduction using the straight line method must be used to 
determine the recovery deduction. Under paragraph (d) of this section, B 
must recapture any excess depreciation claimed for taxable year 1984. If 
B had used the straight line method over a 5-year recovery period his 
recovery deduction for 1984 would have been $5,000. Under paragraph 
(d)(2) of this section, B's excess depreciation is $7,500 (i.e., $12,500 
- $5,000) and that amount must be included in B's 1985 gross income and 
added to the property's basis. The taxable years 1986 through 1989 are 
the property's second through sixth recovery years, respectively, of 
such property's 5-year recovery period.

    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example (3), except that in 
1986 B used the property exclusively in his business. B is entitled to 
no investment tax credit with respect to the property in 1986 and must 
continue to recover the property's cost over a 5-year recovery period 
using the straight line method.

    Example 5. On July 1, 1984, H purchases and places in service listed 
property (other than a passenger automobile) which is 3-year recovery 
property under section 168. H selects the use of the accelerated 
recovery percentages under section 168. In 1984 through 1986, H uses the 
property exclusively for business. In 1987, the property is not 
predominantly used in a qualified business use. Under paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section, H must compute his 1987 and subsequent taxable year's 
recovery deductions using the straight line method over a 5-year 
recovery period with 1987 treated as the fourth recovery year. Under 
paragraph (d) of this section, H must recapture any excess depreciation 
claimed for taxable years 1984 through 1986 even though by 1987 the full 
cost of the property had already been recovered.

    Example 6. Assume the same facts as in Example (5), except that H 
uses the property exclusively for personal purposes in 1987. Under 
paragraph (d) of this section, H must recapture any excess depreciation 
claimed for taxable years 1984 through 1986. H is entitled to no cost 
recovery deduction under the 5-year straight line method for 1987. 
Assume further that in 1988 H uses the property 70 percent in

[[Page 591]]

his business. Thus, H's business use percentage for that year is 70 
percent. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, H must compute his 1988 
cost recovery deduction using the straight line method over a 5-year 
recovery period with 1988 treated as the fifth recovery year.

    Example 7. (i) On July 1, 1984, F purchases for $70,000 and places 
in service listed property (other than a passenger automobile) which is 
3-year recovery property under section 168. F's business use percentage 
for 1984 through 1986 is 60 percent. F elects under section 179 to 
expense $5,000 of the cost of the property.
    (ii) F elects a reduced investment tax credit under section 
48(q)(4). The maximum amount of F's investment tax credit is $1,560 
(i.e., $65,000 x .04 x .60).
    (iii) F's unadjusted basis for purposes of section 168 is $65,000 
(i.e., $70,000 reduced by the $5,000 section 179 expense). F selects the 
use of the accelerated recovery percentages under section 168(b)(1). F's 
recovery deduction for 1984 is $9,750 (i.e., $65,000 x .25 x .60).
    (iv) In 1985, the property is not predominantly used in a qualified 
business use. The investment tax credit claimed is subject to recapture 
in full under section 47 in 1985 since the property ceases to be section 
38 property in its entirety on January 1, 1985. Under paragraph (c)(2) 
of this section, F must treat the property for 1985 and subsequent 
taxable years as if he recovered its cost over a 5-year recovery period 
(i.e., its earnings and profits life) using the straight line method 
(with the half year convention) from the time it was placed in service. 
Under paragraph (d) of this section, F must recapture any excess 
depreciation claimed for taxable year 1984. F's excess depreciation is 
$10,550 [i.e., ($65,000 x .25 x .60+$5,000)-($70,000 x .10 x .60)]. This 
amount must be included in F's 1985 gross income and added to the 
property's adjusted basis.

    Example 8. (i) On July 1, 1984, G purchases for $60,000 and places 
in service a passenger automobile which is 3-year recovery property 
under section 168.
    (ii) In 1984, G's business use percentage is 80 percent and such use 
constitutes his total business/investment use. G elects under section 
48(q)(4) to take a reduced investment tax credit in lieu of the basis 
adjustment under section 48(q)(1). The maximum amount of G's investment 
tax credit is $533.33 (i.e., the lesser of .80 x \2/3\ x $1,000 or 
$60,000 x .80 x .04).
    (iii) In 1984, G does not elect under section 179 to expense a 
portion of the automobile's cost. G selects the use of the accelerated 
recovery percentages under section 168. G's unadjusted basis for 
purposes of section 168 is $60,000. The maximum amount of G's 1984 
recovery deduction is $3,200 (i.e., the lesser of .80 x $4,000 or 
.80 x .25 x $60,000).
    (iv) In 1985, G's business use percentage is 80 percent and such use 
constitutes his total business/investment use. The maximum amount of G's 
1985 recovery deduction is $4,800 (i.e., the lesser of .80 x $6,000 or 
.80 x .38 x $60,000).
    (v) In 1986, G's business use percentage is 45 percent and such use 
constitutes his total business/investment use. Under paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, as a result of the decline in the business use percentage 
to 50 percent or less, the automobile ceases to be section 38 property 
in its entirety and G must recapture (pursuant to Secs. 1.47-1(c) and 
1.47-2(e)) the investment tax credit previously claimed. Since G's 
business use percentage in 1986 is not greater than 50 percent, under 
the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, G must recompute (for 
recapture purposes) his recovery deductions for 1984 and 1985 using the 
straight line method over a 5-year recovery period (i.e., earnings and 
profits life for 3-year recovery property using the half-year 
convention) to determine if any excess depreciation must be included in 
his 1986 taxable income. G's recomputed recovery deductions for 1984 and 
1985 are $3,200 (i.e., the lesser of .80 x $4,000 or 
.80 x .10 x $60,000), and $4,800 (i.e., the lesser of .80 x $6,000 or 
.80 x .20 x $60,000), respectively. G does not have to recapture any 
excess depreciation since his recovery deductions for 1984 and 1985 
computed using the straight line method over a 5-year recovery period 
are the same as the amounts actually claimed during those years.
    (vi) Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for 1986 and succeeding 
taxable years G must compute his remaining recovery deductions using the 
straight line method over a 5-year recovery period beginning with the 
third recovery year. The maximum amount of G's 1986 recovery deduction 
is $2,700 (i.e., the lesser of .45 x $6,000 or .45 x .20 x $60,000). For 
taxable years 1987 through 1993, G's business use percentage is 55 
percent and such use constitutes his total business/investment use. G's 
1987 and 1988 recovery deductions are $3,300 per year (i.e., the lesser 
of .55 x $6,000 or .55 x .20 x $60,000). For taxable year 1989 (the last 
recovery year), G's recovery deduction is $3,300 (i.e., 
.55 x .10 x $60,000 or .55 x $6,000).
    (vii) As of the beginning of 1990, G will have claimed a total of 
$20,600 of recovery deductions. Under Sec. 1.280F-2T(c), G may expense 
his remaining unrecovered basis (up to a certain amount per year) in the 
first succeeding taxable year after the end of the recovery period and 
in taxable years thereafter. If G had used his automobile for 100 
percent business use in taxable years 1984 through 1989, G could have 
claimed a recovery deduction of $4,000 in 1984 and a recovery deduction 
of $6,000 in each of those remaining years. At the beginning of 1990, 
therefore, G's unrecovered basis (as defined in section 280F(d)(8)) is 
$26,000 (i.e., $60,000-$34,000). The

[[Page 592]]

maximum amount of G's 1990 recovery deduction is $3,300 (i.e., 
.55 x $6,000). At the beginning of 1991, G's unrecovered basis is 
$20,000 (i.e., $26,000 adjusted under section 280F(d)(2) and 
Sec. 1.280F-4T(a) to account for the amount that would have been claimed 
in 1990 for 100 percent business/investment use during that year). The 
maximum amount of G's 1991 recovery deduction is $3,300 (i.e., 
.55 x $6,000) and his unrecovered basis as of the beginning of 1992 is 
$14,000 (i.e., $20,000-$6,000). In 1992, G disposes of the automobile. G 
is not allowed a recovery deduction for 1992.

<R05>
Sec. 1.280F-4T  Special rules for listed property (temporary).

    (a) Limitations on allowable recovery deductions in subsequent 
taxable years--(1) Subsequent taxable years affected by reason of 
personal use in prior years. For purposes of computing the amount of the 
recovery deduction for ``listed property'' for a subsequent taxable 
year, the amount that would have been allowable as a recovery deduction 
during an earlier taxable year if all of the use of the property was use 
described in section 168(c) is treated as the amount of the recovery 
deduction allowable during that earlier taxable year. The preceding 
sentence applies with respect to all earlier taxable years, beginning 
with the first taxable year in which some or all use of the ``listed 
property'' is use described in section 168(c). For example, on July 1, 
1984, B purchases and places in service listed property (other than a 
passenger automobile) which is 5-year recovery property under section 
168. B selects the use of the accelerated percentages under section 168. 
B's business/investment use of the property (all of which is qualified 
business use as defined in section 280F(d)(6)(B) and Sec. 1.280F-
6T(d)(2)) in 1984 through 1988 is 80 percent, 70 percent, 60 percent, 
and 55 percent, respectively, and B claims recovery deductions for those 
years based on those percentages. B's qualified business use for the 
property for 1989 and taxable years thereafter increases to 100 percent. 
Pursuant to this rule, B may not claim a recovery deduction in 1989 (or 
for any subsequent taxable year) for the increase in business use 
because there is no adjusted basis remaining to be recovered for cost 
recovery purposes after 1988.
    (2) Special rule for passenger automobiles. In the case of a 
passenger automobile that is subject to the limitations of Sec. 1.280F-
2T, the amount treated as the amount that would have been allowable as a 
recovery deduction if all of the use of the automobile was use described 
in section 168(c) shall not exceed $4,000 for the year the passenger 
automobile is placed in service and $6,000 for each succeeding taxable 
year (adjusted to account for the automobile price inflation adjustment, 
if any, under section 280F(d)(7) and for short taxable year under 
Sec. 1.280F-2T(i)(2)). See. Sec. 1.280F-3T(g). Example 8.
    (b) Treatment of improvements that qualify as capital expenditures--
(1) In general. In the case of any improvement that qualifies as a 
capital expenditure under section 263 made to any listed property other 
than a passenger automobile, the rules of this paragraph (b) apply. See 
Sec. 1.280F-2T(f) for the treatment of an improvement made to a 
passenger automobile.
    (2) Investment tax credit allowed for the improvement. If the 
improvement qualifies as an investment in new section 38 property under 
section 48(b) and Sec. 1.48-2(b), the investment tax credit for that 
improvement is limited by paragraph (b)(1) of Sec. 1.280F-3T, as applied 
to the item of listed property as a whole.
    (3) Cost recovery of the improvement. The improvement is treated as 
a new item of recovery property. The method of cost recovery with 
respect to that improvement is limited by Sec. 1.280F-3T(c), as applied 
to the item of listed property as a whole.

<R05>
Sec. 1.280F-5T  Leased property (temporary).

    (a) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the 
limitation on cost recovery deductions and the investment tax credit 
provided in section 280F (a) and (b) and Secs. 1.280F-2T and 1.280F-3T 
do not apply to any listed property leased or held for leasing by any 
person regularly engaged in the

[[Page 593]]

business of leasing listed property. If a person is not regularly 
engaged in the business of leasing listed property, the limitations on 
cost recovery deductions and the investment tax credit provided in 
section 280F and Secs. 1.280F-2T and 1.280F-3T apply to such property 
leased or held for leasing by such person. The special rules for lessees 
set out in this section apply with respect to all lessees of listed 
property, even those whose lessors are not regularly engaged in the 
business of leasing listed property. For rules on determining inclusion 
amounts with respect to passenger automobiles, see paragraphs (d), (e) 
and (g) of this section, and see Sec. 1.280F-7(a). For rules on 
determining inclusion amounts with respect to other listed property, see 
paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, and see Sec. 1.280F-7(b).
    (b) Section 48(d) election. If a lessor elects under section 48(d) 
with respect to any listed property to treat the lessee as having 
acquired such property, the amount of the investment tax credit allowed 
to the lessee is subject to the limitation prescribed in Sec. 1.280F-
3T(b) (1) and (2). If a lessor elects under section 48(d) with respect 
to any passenger automobile to treat the lessee as having acquired such 
automobile, the amount of the investment tax credit allowed to the 
lessee is also subject to the limitations prescribed in Sec. 1.280F-2T 
(a) and (i).
    (c) Regularly engaged in the business of leasing. For purposes of 
paragraph (a) of this section, a person shall be considered regularly 
engaged in the business of leasing listed property only if contracts to 
lease such property are entered into with some frequency over a 
continuous period of time. The determination shall be made on the basis 
of the facts and circumstances in each case, taking into account the 
nature of the person's business in its entirety. Occasional or 
incidental leasing activity is insufficient. For example, a person 
leasing only one passenger automobile during a taxable year is not 
regularly engaged in the business of leasing automobiles. In addition, 
an employer that allows an employee to use the employer's property for 
personal purposes and charges such employee for the use of the property 
is not regularly engaged in the business of leasing with respect to the 
property used by the employee.
    (d) Inclusions in income of lessees of passenger automobiles leased 
after June 18, 1984, and before April 3, 1985--(1) In general. If a 
taxpayer leases a passenger automobile after June 18, 1984, but before 
April 3, 1985, for each taxable year (except the last taxable year) 
during which the taxpayer leases the automobile, the taxpayer must 
include in gross income an inclusion amount (prorated for the number of 
days of the lease term included in that taxable year), determined under 
this paragraph (d)(1), and multiplied by the business/investment use (as 
defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(3)(i)) for the particular taxable year. The 
inclusion amount:
    (i) Is 7.5 percent of the excess (if any) of the automobile's fair 
market value over $16,500 for each of the first three taxable years 
during which a passenger automobile is leased.
    (ii) Is 6 percent of the excess (if any) of the automobile's fair 
market value over $22,500 for the fourth taxable year during which a 
passenger automobile is leased.
    (iii) Is 6 percent of the excess (if any) of the automobile's fair 
market value over $28,500 for the fifth taxable year during which a 
passenger automobile is leased.
    (iv) Is 6 percent of the excess (if any) of the automobile's fair 
market value over $34,500 for the sixth taxable year during which a 
passenger automobile is leased.

For the seventh and subsequent taxable years during which a passenger 
automobile is leased, the inclusion amount is 6 percent of the excess 
(if any) of the automobile's fair market value over the sum of (A) 
$16,500 and (B) $6,000 multiplied by the number of such taxable years in 
excess of three years. See paragraph (g)(2) of this section for the 
definition of fair market value.
    (2) Additional inclusion amount when less than predominant use in a 
qualified business use. (i) If a passenger automobile, which is leased 
after June 18, 1984, and before April 3, 1985, is not used predominantly 
in a qualified business use during a taxable year, the lessee must add 
to gross income in the

[[Page 594]]

first taxable year that the automobile is not so used (and only in that 
year) an inclusion amount determined under this paragraph (d)(2). This 
inclusion amount is in addition to the amount required to be included in 
gross income under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
    (ii) If the fair market value (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section) of the automobile is greater than $16,500, the inclusion 
amount is determined by multiplying the average of the business/
investment use (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section) by the 
appropriate dollar amount from the table in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of 
this section. If the fair market value (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) 
of this section) of the automobile is $16,500 or less, the inclusion 
amount is the product of the fair market value of the automobile, the 
average business/investment use, and the applicable percentage from the 
table in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) The dollar amount is determined under the following table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          The dollar amount:

    (iv) The applicable percentage is determined under the following 
table:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (e) Inclusions in income of lessees of passenger automobiles leased 
after April 2, 1985, and before January 1, 1987--(1) In general. For any 
passenger automobile that is leased after April 2, 1985, and before 
January 1, 1987, for each taxable year (except the last taxable year) 
during which the taxpayer leases the automobile, the taxpayer must 
include in gross income an inclusion amount determined under 
subparagraphs (2) through (5) of this paragraph (e). Additional 
inclusion amounts when a passenger automobile is not used predominantly 
in a qualified business use during a taxable year are determined under 
paragraph (e)(6) of this section. See paragraph (h)(2) of this section 
for the definition of fair market value.
    (2) Fair market value not greater than $50,000: years one through 
three. For any passenger automobile that has a fair market value not 
greater than $50,000, the inclusion amount for each of the first three 
taxable years during which the automobile is leased is determined as 
follows:
    (i) For the appropriate range of fair market values in the table in 
paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section, select the dollar amount from the 
column for the quarter of the taxable year in which the automobile is 
first used under the lease,
    (ii) Prorate the dollar amount for the number of days of the lease 
term included in the taxable year, and
    (iii) Multiply the prorated dollar amount by the business/investment 
use for the taxable year.
    (iv) Dollar amounts: Years 1-3:

    (4) Fair market value greater than $50,000: years one through six. 
(i) For any passenger automobile that has a fair market value greater 
than $50,000, the inclusion amount for the first six taxable years 
during which the automobile is leased is determined as follows:

[[Page 596]]

    (A) Determine the dollar amount by using the appropriate formula in 
paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section,
    (B) Prorate the dollar amount for the number of days of the lease 
term included in the taxable year, and
    (C) Multiply this dollar amount by the business/investment use for 
the taxable year.
    (ii) The dollar amount is computed as follows:
    (A) If the automobile is first used under the lease in the fourth 
quarter of a taxable year, the dollar amount for each of the first three 
taxable years during which the automobile is leased is the sum of--
    (1) $124, and
    (2) 11 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value 
over $13,200.
    (B) If the automobile is first used under the lease in the third 
quarter of a taxable year, the dollar amount for each of the first three 
taxable years during which the automobile is leased is the sum of--
    (1) $110, and
    (2) 10 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value 
over $13,200.
    (C) If the automobile is first used under the lease in the second 
quarter of a taxable year, the dollar amount for each of the first three 
taxable years during which the automobile is leased is the sum of--
    (1) $100, and
    (2) 9 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value 
over $13,200.
    (D) If the automobile is first used under the lease in the first 
quarter of a taxable year, the dollar amount for each of the first three 
taxable years during which the automobile is leased is the sum of--
    (1) $90, and
    (2) 8 percent of the excess of the automobile's fair market value 
over $13,200.
    (E) For the fourth taxable year during which the automobile is 
leased, the dollar amount is 6 percent of the excess of the automobile's 
fair market value over $18,000.
    (F) For the fifth taxable year during which the automobile is 
leased, the dollar amount is 6 percent of the excess of the automobile's 
fair market value over $22,800.
    (G) For the sixth taxable year during which the automobile is 
leased, the dollar amount is 6 percent of the excess of the automobile's 
fair market value over $27,600.
    (5) Seventh and subsequent taxable years. (i) For any passenger 
automobile that has a fair market value less than or equal to $32,400, 
the inclusion amount for the seventh and subsequent taxable years during 
which the automobile is leased is zero.
    (ii) For any passenger automobile that has a fair market value 
greater than $32,400, the inclusion amount for the seventh and 
subsequent taxable years during which the automobile is leased is 6 
percent of--
    (A) The excess (if any) of the automobile's fair market value, over
    (B) The sum of--
    (1) $13,200 and
    (2) $4,800 multiplied by the number of taxable years in excess of 
three years.
    (6) Additional inclusion amount when less than predominant use in a 
qualified business use. (i) If a passenger automobile, which is leased 
after April 2, 1985, and before January 1, 1987, is not predominantly 
used in a qualified business use during a taxable year, the lessee must 
add to gross income in the first taxable year that the automobile is not 
so used (and only in that year) an inclusion amount determined under 
this paragraph (e)(6). This inclusion amount is in addition to the 
amount required to be included in gross income under paragraph (e) (2), 
(3), (4), and (5) of this section.
    (ii) If the fair market value (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of 
this section) of the automobile is greater than $11,250, the inclusion 
amount is determined by multiplying the average of the business/
investment use (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section) by the 
appropriate dollar amount from the table in paragraph (e)(6)(iii) of 
this section. If the fair market value of the automobile is $11,250 or 
less, the inclusion amount is the product of the fair market value of 
the automobile, the average business/investment use, and the applicable 
percentage from the table in paragraph (e)(6)(iv) of this section.
    (iii) The dollar amount is determined under the following table:

    (f) Inclusions in income of lessees of listed property other than 
passenger automobiles--(1) In general. If listed property other than a 
passenger automobile is not used predominantly in a qualified business 
use in any taxable year in which such property is leased, the lessee 
must add an inclusion amount to gross income in the first taxable year 
in which such property is not so predominantly used (and only in that 
year). This inclusion amount is determined under paragraph (f)(2) of 
this section for property leased after June 18, 1984, and before January 
1, 1987. The inclusion amount is determined under Sec. 1.280F-7(b) for 
property leased after December 31, 1986.
    (2) Inclusion amount for property leased after June 18, 1984, and 
before January 1, 1987. The inclusion amount for property leased after 
June 18, 1984, and before January 1, 1987, is the product of the 
following amounts:
    (i) The fair market value (as defined in paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section) of the property,
    (ii) The average business/investment use (as defined in paragraph 
(h)(3) of this section), and
    (iii) The applicable percentage (as determined under paragraph 
(f)(3) of this section).
    (3) Applicable percentages. The applicable percentages for 3-, 5-, 
and 10-year recovery property are determined according to the following

    (g) Special rules applicable to inclusions in income of lessees. 
This paragraph (g) applies to the inclusions in gross income of lessees 
prescribed under paragraphs (d)(2), (e)(6), or (f) of this section, or 
prescribed under Sec. 1.280F-7(b).
    (1) Lease term commences within 9 months of the end of lessee's 
taxable year. If:
    (i) The lease term commences within 9 months before the close of the 
lessee's taxable year,
    (ii) The property is not predominantly used in a qualified business 
use during that portion of the taxable year, and
    (iii) The lease term continues into the lessee's subsequent taxable 
year, then the inclusion amount is added to gross income in the lessee's 
subsequent taxable year and the amount is determined by taking into 
account the average of the business/investment use for both taxable 
years and the applicable percentage for the taxable year in which the 
lease term begins (or, in the case of a passenger automobile with a fair 
market value greater than $16,500, the appropriate dollar amount for the 
taxable year in which the lease term begins).
    (2) Lease term less than one year. If the lease term is less than 
one year, the amount which must be added to gross income is an amount 
that bears the same ratio to the inclusion amount determined before the 
application of this paragraph (g)(2) as the number of days in the lease 
term bears to 365.
    (3) Maximum inclusion amount. The inclusion amount shall not exceed 
the sum of all deductible amounts in connection with the use of the 
listed property properly allocable to the lessee's taxable year in which 
the inclusion amount must be added to gross income.
    (h) Definitions--(1) Lease term. In determining the term of any 
lease for purposes of this section, the rules of section 168(i)(3)(A) 
shall apply.
    (2) Fair market value. For purposes of this section, the fair market 
value of listed property is such value on the first day of the lease 
term. If the capitalized cost of listed property is specified in the 
lease agreement, the lessee shall treat such amount as the fair market 
value of the property.
    (3) Average business/investment use. For purposes of this section, 
the average business/investment use of any listed property is the 
average of the business/investment use for the first taxable year in 
which the business use percentage is 50 percent or less and all 
preceding taxable years in which such property is leased. See paragraph 
(g)(1) of this section for special rule when lease term commences within 
9 months before the end of the lessee's taxable year.
    (i) Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following 
examples.

    Example 1. On January 1, 1985, A, a calendar year taxpayer, leases 
and places in service a passenger automobile with a fair market value of 
$55,000. The lease is to be for a period of four years. During taxable 
years 1985 and 1986, A uses the automobile exclusively in a trade or 
business. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, A must include in 
gross income in both 1985 and 1986, $2,887.50 (i.e., 
($55,000-$16,500) x 7.5%).

    Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1), and in 
addition, A uses the automobile only 45 percent in a trade or business 
during 1987. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for 1987, A must 
include in gross income $1,299.38 (i.e., 
($55,000-$16,500) x 7.5% x 45%). In addition, under paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section, A must also include in gross income in 1987, $530.85 
(i.e., $650 x 81.67%, average business/investment use).

    Example 3. On August 1, 1985, B, a calendar year taxpayer, leases 
and places in service an item of listed property which is 5-year 
recovery property, with a fair market value of $10,000. The lease is to 
be for a period of 5 years. B's qualified business use of the property 
is 40 percent in 1985, 100 percent in 1986, and 90 percent in 1987. 
Under paragraphs (f)(1) and (g)(1) of this section, before the 
application of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, B must include in gross 
income in 1986, $1,288.00 (i.e., $10,000 x 70% x 18.4%, the product of 
the fair market value, the average business use for both taxable years, 
and the applicable percentage for year one from the table in paragraph 
(f)(3)(iii) of this section).

    Example 4. On October 1, 1985, C, a calendar year taxpayer, leases 
and places in service an item of listed property which is 3-year 
recovery property with a fair market value of $15,000. The lease term is 
6 months (ending March 31, 1986) during which C uses the property 45 
percent in a trade or business, the only business/investment use. Under 
paragraphs (f)(1) and (g) (1) and (2) of this section, before the 
application of paragraph (g)(3) of this section, C must include in gross 
income

[[Page 601]]

in 1986, $100.97 (i.e., $15,000 x 45% x 3% x 182/365, the product of the 
fair market value, the average business use for both taxable years, and 
the applicable percentage for year one from the table in paragraph 
(f)(3)(i) of this section, prorated for the length of the lease term).

    Example 5 On July 15, 1985, A, a calendar year taxpayer, leases and 
places in service a passenger automobile with a fair market value of 
$45,300. The lease is for a period of 5 years, during which A uses the 
automobile exclusively in a trade or business. Under paragraph (e) (2) 
and (3) of this section, for taxable years 1985 through 1989, A must 
include the following amounts in gross income:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     Business           
          Taxable year           Dollar  Proration     use     Inclusion

1989...........................   1,362    365/365       100       1,362
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that A 
uses the automobile only 45 percent in a trade or business during 1987 
through 1990. Under Sec. 1.280F-5T(e)(6), A must include in gross income 
for taxable year 1987, the first taxable year in which the automobile is 
not used predominantly in a trade or business, an additional amount 
based on the average business/investment use for taxable years 1985 
through 1987. For taxable years 1985 through 1989, A must include the 
following amounts in gross income:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     Business

<R05>
Sec. 1.280F-6T  Special rules and definitions (temporary).

    (a) Deductions of employee--(1) In general. Employee use of listed 
property shall not be treated as business/investment use (as defined in 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section) for purposes of determining the amount 
of any credit allowable under section 38 to the employee or the amount 
of any recovery deduction allowable (including any deduction under 
section 179) to the employee unless that use is for the convenience of 
the employer and required as a condition of employment.
    (2) ``Convenience of the employer'' and ``condition of employment'' 
requirements--(i) In general. The terms convenience of the employer and 
condition of employment generally have the same meaning for purposes of 
section 280F as they have for purposes of section 119 (relating to the 
exclusion from gross income for meals or lodging furnished for the 
convenience of the employer).
    (ii) ``Condition of employment.'' In order to satisfy the 
``condition of employment'' requirement, the use of the property must be 
required in order for the employee to perform the duties of his or her 
employment properly. Whether the use of the property is so required 
depends on all the facts and circumstances. Thus, the employer need not 
explicitly require the employee to use the property. Similarly, a mere 
statement by the employer that the use of the property is a condition of 
employment is not sufficient.
    (iii) ``Convenience of employer''. [Reserved]
    (3) Employee use. For purposes of this section, the term employee 
use means any use in connection with the performance of services by the 
employee as an employee.
    (4) Examples. The principles of this paragraph are illustrated in 
the following examples:

    Example 1. A is employed as a courier with W, which provides local 
courier services. A owns and uses a motorcycle to deliver packages to 
downtown offices for W. W does not provide delivery vehicles and 
explicitly requires all of its couriers to own a car or motorcycle for 
use in their employment with the company. A's use of the motorcycle for 
delivery purposes is for the convenience of W and is required as a 
condition of employment.

    Example 2. B is an inspector for X, a construction company with many 
construction sites in the local area. B is required to travel to the 
various construction sites on a regular basis; B uses her automobile to 
make these trips. Although X does not furnish B an automobile, X does 
not explicitly require B

[[Page 602]]

to use here own automobile. However, X reimburses B for any costs she 
incurs in traveling to the various job sites. B's use of here automobile 
in here employment is for the convenience of X and is required as a 
condition of employment.

    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (2), except that X 
makes an automobile available to B who chooses to use her own automobile 
and receive reimbursement. B's use of her own automobile is not for the 
convenience of X and is not required as a condition of employment.

    Example 4. C is a pilot for Y, a small charter airline. Y requires 
its pilots to obtain x hours of flight time annually in addition to the 
number of hours of flight time spent with the airline. Pilots can 
usually obtain these hours by flying with a military reserve unit or by 
flying part-time with another airline. C owns his own airplane. C's use 
of his airplane to obtain the required flight hours is not for the 
convenience of the employer and is not required as a condition of 
employment.

    Example 5. D is employed as an engineer with Z, an engineering 
contracting firm. D occasionally takes work home at night rather than 
working late in the office. D owns and uses a computer which is 
virtually identical to the one she uses at the office to complete her 
work at home. D's use of the computer is not for the convenience of here 
employer and is not required as a condition of employment.

section.
    (2) Means of transportation--(i) In general. Except as otherwise 
provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, property used as a 
means of transportation includes trucks, buses, trains, boats, 
airplanes, motorcycles, and any other vehicles for transporting persons 
or goods.
    (ii) Exception. The term listed property does not include any 
vehicle that is a qualified nonpersonal use vehicle as defined in 
section 274(i) and Sec. 1.274-5T(k).
    (3) Property used for entertainment, etc.--(i) In general. Property 
of a type generally used for purposes of entertainment, recreation, or 
amusement includes property such as photographic, phonographic, 
communication, and video recording equipment.
    (ii) Exception. The term listed property does not include any 
photographic, phonographic, communication, or video recording equipment 
of a taxpayer if the equipment is use either exclusively at the 
taxpayer's regular business establishment or in connection with the 
taxpayer's principal trade or business.
    (iii) Regular business establishment. The regular business 
establishment of an employee is the regular business establishment of 
the employer of the employee. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), a 
portion of a dwelling unit is treated as a regular business 
establishment if the requirements of section 280A(c)(1) are met with 
respect to that portion.
    (4) Other property. [Reserved]
    (5) Exception for computers. The term listed property shall not 
include any computer (including peripheral equipment) used exclusively 
at a regular business establishment. For purposes of the preceding 
sentence, a portion of a dwelling unit shall be treated as a regular 
business establishment if (and only if) the requirements of section 
280A(c)(1) are met with respect to that portion.
    (c) Passenger automobile--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the term passenger automobile means 
any 4-wheeled vehicle which is:
    (i) Manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and

[[Page 603]]

    (3) Exception for certain vehicles. The term passenger automobile

percentage means the percentage of the use of any listed property which 
is qualified business use as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) Qualified business use--(i) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the term qualified business use 
means any use in a trade or business of the taxpayer. The term qualified 
business use does not include use for which a deduction is allowable 
under section 212. Whether the amount of qualified business use exceeds 
50 percent is determinative of whether the investment tax credit and the 
accelerated percentages under section 168 are available for listed 
property (or must be recaptured). See Sec. 1.280F-3T.
    (ii) Exception for certain use by 5-percent owners and related 
persons)--(A) In general. The term qualified business use shall not 
include:
    (1) Leasing property to any 5-percent owner or related person,

services by a 5-percent owner or related person, or
    (3) Use of property provided as compensation for the performance of

this section unless an amount is properly reported by the taxpayer as 
income to such person and, where required, there was withholding under 
chapter 24.

Paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A)(1) of this section shall apply only to the 
extent that the use of the listed property is by an individual who is a 
related party or a 5-percent owner with respect to the owner or lessee 
of the property.
    (B) Special rule for aircraft. Paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this 
section shall not apply with respect to any aircraft if at least 25 
percent of the total use of the aircraft during the taxable year 
consists of qualified business use not described in paragraph 
(d)(2)(ii)(A).
    (C) Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph:
    (1) 5-percent owner. The term 5-percent owner means any person who 
is a 5-percent owner with respect to the taxpayer (as defined in section 
416 (i)(1)(B)(i)).
    (2) Related person. The term related person means any person related 
to the taxpayer (within the meaning of section 267(b)).
    (3) Business/investment use--(i) In general. The term business/
investment use means the total business or investment use of listed 
property that may be taken into account for purposes of computing 
(without regard to section 280F(b)) the percentage of investment tax 
credit or cost recovery deduction for a passenger automobile or other 
listed property for the taxable year. Whether the investment tax credit 
and the accelerated percentages under section 168 (as opposed to use of 
the straight line method of cost recovery) are available with respect to 
listed property or must be recaptured is determined, however, by 
reference to qualified business use (as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section) rather than by reference to business/investment use. 
Whether a particular use of property is a business or investment use 
shall generally be determined under the rules of section 162 or 212.
    (ii) Entertainment use. The use of listed property for 
entertainment, recreation, or amusement purposes shall be treated as 
business use to the extent that expenses (other than interest and 
property tax expenses) attributable to that use are deductible after 
application of section 274.
    (iii) Employee use. See paragraph (a) of this section for 
requirements to be satisfied for employee use of listed property to be 
considered business/investment use of the property.
    (iv) Use of taxpayer's automobile by another person. Any use of the 
taxpayer's automobile by another person shall not be treated, for 
purposes of section 280F, as use in a trade or business under section 
162 unless that use:

[[Page 604]]

    (A) Is directly connected with the business of the taxpayer,
    (B) Is properly reported by the taxpayer as income to the other 
person and, where required, there was withholding under chapter 24, or
    (C) Results in a payment of fair market rent.

For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4)(iv)(C), payment to the owner of 
the automobile in connection with such use is treated as the payment of 
rent.
    (4) Predominantly used in qualified business use--(i) Definition. 
Property is predominantly used in a qualified business use for any 
taxable year if the business use percentage (as defined in paragraph 
(d)(1) of this section) is greater than 50 percent.
    (ii) Special rule for transfers at death. Property does not cease to 
be used predominantly in a qualified business use by reason of a 
transfer at death.
    (iii) Other dispositions of property. [Reserved]
    (5) Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles set 
forth in this paragraph.

    Example 1. E uses a home computer 50 percent of the time to manage 
her investments. The computer is listed property within the meaning of 
section 280F(d)(4). E also uses the computer 40 percent of the time in 
her part-time consumer research business. Because E's business use 
percentage for the computer does not exceed 50 percent, the computer is 
not predominantly used in a qualified business use for the taxable year. 
Her aggregate business/investment use for purposes of determining the 
percent of the total allowable straight line depreciation that she can 
claim is 90 percent.
    Example 2. Assume that E in Example (1) uses the computer 30 percent 
of the time to manage her investments and 60 percent of the time in her 
consumer research business. E's business use percentage exceeds 50 
percent. Her aggregrate business/investment use for purposes of 
determining her allowable investment tax credit and cost recovery 
deductions is 90 percent.
    Example 3. F is the proprietor of a plumbing contracting business. 
F's brother is employed with F's company. As part of his compensation, 
F's brother is allowed to use one of the company automobiles for 
personal use. The use of the company automobiles by F's brother is not a 
qualified business use because F and F's brother are related parties 
within the meaning of section 267(b).
    Example 4. F, in Example (3), allows employees unrelated to him to 
use company automobiles as part of their compensation. F, however, does 
not include the value of these automobiles in the employees' gross 
income and F does not withhold with respect to the use of these 
automobiles. The use of the company automobiles by the employees in this 
case is not business/investment use.
    Example 5. X Corporation owns several automobiles which its 
employees use for business purposes. The employees are also allowed to 
take the automobiles home at night. However, the fair market value of 
the use of the automobile for any personal purpose, e.g., commuting to 
work, is reported by X as income to the employee and is withheld upon by 
X. The use of the automobile by the employee, even for personal 
purposes, is a qualified business use the respect to X.

    (e) Method of allocating use of property--(1) In general. For 
purposes of section 280F, the taxpayer shall allocate the use of any 
listed property that is used for more than one purpose during the 
taxable year to the various uses in the manner prescribed in paragraph 
(e) (2) and (3) of this section.
    (2) Passenger automobiles and other means of transportation. In the 
case of a passenger automobile or any other means of transportation, the 
taxpayer shall allocate the use of the property on the basis of mileage. 
Thus, the percentage of use in a trade or business for the year shall be 
determined by dividing the number of miles the vehicle is driven for 
purposes of that trade or business during the year by the total number 
of miles the vehicle is driven during the year for any purpose.
    (3) Other listed property. In the case of other listed property, the 
taxpayer shall allocate the use of that property on the basis of the 
most appropriate unit of time the property is actually used (rather than 
merely being available for use). For example, the percentage of use of a 
computer in a trade or business for a taxable year is determined by 
dividing the number of hours the computer is used for business purposes 
during the year by the total number of hours the computer is used for 
any purpose during the year.

    (a) Inclusions in income of lessees of passenger automobiles leased 
after December 31, 1986--(1) In general. If a taxpayer leases a 
passenger automobile after December 31, 1986, the taxpayer must include 
in gross income an inclusion amount determined under this paragraph (a), 
for each taxable year during which the taxpayer leases the automobile. 
This paragraph (a) applies only to passenger automobiles for which the 
taxpayer's lease term begins after December 31, 1986. See Secs. 1.280F-
5T(d) and 1.280F-5T(e) for rules on determining inclusion amounts for 
passenger automobiles for which the taxpayer's lease term begins before 
January 1, 1987. See Sec. 1.280F-5T(h)(2) for the definition of fair 
market value.
    (2) Inclusion Amount. For any passenger automobile leased after 
December 31, 1986, the inclusion amount for each taxable year during 
which the automobile is leased is determined as follows:
    (i) For the appropriate range of fair market values in the 
applicable table, select the dollar amount from the column for the 
taxable year in which the automobile is used under the lease (but for 
the last taxable year during any lease that does not begin and end in 
the same taxable year, use the dollar amount for the preceding taxable 
year).
    (ii) Prorate the dollar amount for the number of days of the lease 
term included in the taxable year.
    (iii) Multiply the prorated dollar amount by the business/investment 
use (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(3)(i)) for the taxable year.
    (iv) The following table is the applicable table in the case of a 
passenger automobile leased after December 31, 1986, and before January 
1, 1989:

    (v) The applicable table in the case of a passenger automobile first 
leased after December 31, 1988, will be contained in a revenue ruling or 
revenue procedure published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
    (3) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
this paragraph (a):

    Example. On April 1, 1987, A, a calendar year taxpayer, leases and 
places in service a passenger automobile with a fair market value of 
$31,500. The lease is to be for a period of three years. During taxable 
years 1987 and 1988, A uses the automobile exclusively in a trade or 
business. During 1989 and 1990, A's business/investment use is 45 
percent. The appropriate dollar amounts from the table in paragraph 
(a)(2)(iv) of this section are $260 for 1987 (first taxable year during 
the lease), $568 for 1988 (second taxable year during the lease), $842 
for 1989 (third taxable year during the lease), and $842 for 1990. Since 
1990 is the last taxable year during the lease, the dollar amount for 
the preceding

year (the third year) is used, rather than the dollar amount for the 
fourth year. For taxable years 1987 through 1990, A's inclusion amounts 
are determined as follows:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                          Business

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1987........................................................         $260      275/365          100         $196
1988........................................................          568      366/366          100          568
1989........................................................          842      365/365           45          379
1990........................................................          842       90/365           45           93
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (b) Inclusions in income of lessees of listed property (other than 
passenger automobiles) leased after December 31, 1986--(1) In general. 
If listed property other than a passenger automobile is not used 
predominantly in a qualified business use in any taxable year in which 
such property is leased, the lessee must add an inclusion amount to 
gross income in the first taxable year in which such property is not so 
predominantly used (and only in that year). This year is the first 
taxable year in which the business use percentage (as defined in 
Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(1)) of the property is 50 percent or less. This 
inclusion amount is determined under this paragraph (b) for property for 
which the taxpayer's lease term begins after December 31, 1986 (and 
under Sec. 1.280F-5T(f) for property for which the taxpayer's lease term 
begins before January 1, 1987). See also Sec. 1.280F-5T(g).
    (2) Inclusion amount. The inclusion amount for any listed property 
(other than a passenger automobile) leased after December 31, 1986, is 
the sum of the amounts determined under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of 
this subparagraph (2).
    (i) The amount determined under this subdivision (i) is the product 
of the following amounts:
    (A) The fair market value (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-5T(h)(2)) of 
the property,
    (B) The business/investment use (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-
6T(d)(3)(i)) for the first taxable year in which the business use 
percentage (as defined in Sec. 1.280F-6T(d)(1)) is 50 percent or less, 
and
    (C) The applicable percentage from the following table:

    (3) Example. The following example illustrates the application of 
this paragraph (b):

    Example. On February 1, 1987, B, a calendar year taxpayer, leases 
and places in service a computer with a fair market value of $3,000. The 
lease is to be for a period of two years. B's qualified business use of 
the property, which is the only business/investment use, is 80 percent 
in taxable year 1987, 40 percent in taxable year 1988, and 35 percent in 
taxable year 1989. B must add an inclusion amount to gross income for 
taxable year 1988, the first taxable year in which B does not use the 
computer predominantly for business (i.e., the first taxable year in 
which B's business use percentage is 50 percent or less). Since 1988 is 
the second taxable year during the lease, and since the computer has a 
5-year recovery period under the General and Alternative Depreciation 
Systems, the applicable percentage from the table in subdivision (i) of 
paragraph (b)(2) is -7.2%, and the applicable percentage from the table 
in subdivision (ii) is 10%. B's inclusion amount is $154, which is the 
sum of the amounts determined under subdivisions (i) and (ii) of 
subparagraph (b)(2) of this paragraph. The amount determined under 
subdivision (i) is -$86 [$3,000  x  40%  x  (-7.2%)], and the amount 
determined under subdivision (ii) is $240 [$3,000  x  80%  x  10%].

<R05>
Sec. 1.280H-1T  Limitation on certain amounts paid to employee-owners by personal service corporations electing alternative taxable years (temporary).

    (a) Introduction. This section applies to any taxable year that a 
personal service corporation has a section 444 election in effect (an 
``applicable election year''). For purposes of this section, the term 
personal service corporation has the same meaning given such term in 
Sec. 1.441-4T(d).
    (b) Limitation on certain deductions of personal service 
corporations--(1) In general. If, for any applicable election year, a 
personal service corporation does not satisfy the minimum distribution 
requirement in paragraph (c) of this section, the deduction otherwise 
allowable under chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the 
Code) for applicable amounts, as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section, shall not exceed the maximum deductible amount, as defined in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Carryover of nondeductible amounts. Any amount not allowed as a 
deduction in an applicable election year under paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section shall be allowed as a deduction in the succeeding taxable year.
    (3) Disallowance inapplicable for certain purposes. The disallowance 
of deductions under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not apply for 
purposes of subchapter G of chapter 1 of the Code (relating to 
corporations used to avoid income tax on shareholders) nor for 
determining whether the compensation of employee-owners is reasonable. 
Thus, for example, in determining whether a personal service corporation 
is subject to the accumulated earnings tax imposed by section 531, 
deductions disallowed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section are treated 
as allowed in computing accumulated taxable income.
    (4) Definition of applicable amount--(i) In general. For purposes of 
section 280H and the regulations thereunder, the term applicable amount 
means, with respect to a taxable year, any amount that is otherwise 
deductible by a personal service corporation in such year and includable 
at any time, directly or indirectly, in the gross income of a taxpayer 
that during such year is an employee-owner. Thus, an amount includable 
in the gross income of an employee-owner will be considered an 
applicable amount even though such employee owns no stock of the 
corporation on the date the employee includes the amount in income. See 
Example (1) in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.
    (ii) Special rule for certain indirect payments. For purposes of 
paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, amounts are indirectly includable 
in the gross income of an employee-owner of a personal service 
corporation that has made a section 444 election (an electing personal 
service corporation) if the amount is includable in the gross income 
of--
    (A) The spouse (other than a spouse who is legally separated from 
the partner or shareholder under a decree of divorce or separate 
maintenance) or child (under age 14) of such employee-owner, or
    (B) A corporation more than 50 percent (measured by fair market 
value) of which is owned in the aggregate by employee-owners (and 
individuals related under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section to 
such employee-owners), of the electing personal service corporation, or
    (C) A partnership more than 50 percent of the profits and capital of 
which is owned by employee-owners (and individuals related under 
paragraph

[[Page 611]]

(b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section to such employee-owners) of the electing 
personal service corporation, or
    (D) A trust more than 50 percent of the beneficial ownership of 
which is owned in the aggregate by employee-owners (and individuals 
related under paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section to any such 
employee-owners), of the electing personal service corporation.

For purposes of this paragraph (b)(4)(ii), ownership by any person 
described in this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) shall be treated as ownership by 
the employee-owners of the electing personal service corporation. 
Paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section will not apply if the 
corporation has made a section 444 election to use the same taxable year 
as that of the electing personal service corporation. Similarly, 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section will not apply if the 
partnership has made a section 444 election to use the same taxable year 
as that of the electing personal service corporation. Notwithstanding 
the general effective date provision of paragraph (f) of this section, 
this paragraph (b)(4)(ii) is effective for amounts deductible on or 
after June 1, 1988.
    (iii) Example. The provisions of paragraph (b)(4) of this section 
may be illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. A is an employee of P, an accrual basis personal service 
corporation with a taxable year ending September 30. P makes a section 
444 election for its taxable year beginning October 1, 1987. On October 
1, 1987, A owns no stock of P; However, on March 31, 1988, A acquires 10 
of the 200 outstanding shares of P stock. During the period October 1, 
1987 to March 31, 1988, A earned $40,000 of compensation as an employee 
of P. During the period April 1, 1988 to September 30 1988, A earned 
$60,000 of compensation as an employee-owner of P. If paragraph (b) of 
this section does not apply, P would deduct for its taxable year ended 
September 30, 1988 the $100,000 earned by A during such year. Based upon 
these facts, the $100,000 otherwise deductable amount is considered an 
applicable amount under this section.
    Example 2. I1 and I2, calendar year individuals, are employees of 
PSC1, a personal service corporation that has historically used a 
taxable year ending January 31. I1 and I2 also own all the stock, and 
are employees, of PSC2, a calendar year personal service corporation. 
For its taxable years beginning February 1, 1987, 1988, and 1989, PSC1 
has a section 444 election in effect to use a January 31 taxable year. 
During its taxable years beginning February 1, 1986, 1987, and 1988, 
PSC1 deducted $10,000, $11,000, and $12,000, respectively, that was 
included in PSC2's gross income. Furthermore, of the $12,000 deducted by 
PSC1 for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1988, $7,000 was 
deducted during the period June 1, 1988 to January 31, 1989. Pursuant to 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, the $7,000 deducted by PSC1 on 
or after June 1, 1988, and included in PSC2's gross income is considered 
an applicable amount for PSC1's taxable year beginning February 1, 1988. 
Amounts deducted by PSC1 prior to June 1, 1988, are not subject to 
paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (2), except that for 
its taxable years beginning February 1, 1987, 1988, and 1989, PSC2 has a 
section 444 election in effect to use a January 31 taxable year. Since 
both PSC1 and PSC2 have the same taxable year and both have section 444 
elections in effect, paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section does not 
apply to the $7,000 deducted by PSC1 for its taxable year beginning 
February 1, 1988.

    (c) Minimum distribution requirement--(1) Determination of whether 
requirement satisfied--(i) In general. A personal service corporation 
meets the minimum distribution requirement of this paragraph (c) for an 
applicable election year if, during the deferral period of such taxable 
year, the applicable amounts (determined without regard to paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section) for all employee-owners in the aggregate equal 
or exceed the lesser of--
    (A) The amount determined under the ``preceding year test'' (see 
paragraph (c)(2) of this section), or
    (B) The amount determined under the ``3-year average test'' (see 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section).

The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph 
(c)(1)(i).

    Example. Q, an accrual-basis personal service corporation, makes a 
section 444 election to retain a year ending January 31 for its taxable 
year beginning February 1, 1987. Q has 4 employee-owners, B, C, D, and 
E. For Q's applicable election year beginning February 1, 1987 and 
ending January 31, 1988, B earns $6,000 a month plus a $45,000 bonus on 
January 15, 1988; C earns $5,000 a month plus a $40,000 bonus on January 
15, 1988; D and E each earn $4,500 a month plus a $4,000 bonus on 
January 15, 1988. Q meets the minimum distribution requirement for such 
applicable election year if the applicable amounts during the deferral 
period (i.e., $220,000) equal or exceed the amount determined under the

[[Page 612]]

preceding year test or the 3-year average test.

    (ii) Employee-owner defined. For purposes of section 280H and the 
regulations thereunder, a person is an employee-owner of a corporation 
for a taxable year if--
    (A) On any day of the corporation's taxable year, the person is an 
employee of the corporation or performs personal services for or on 
behalf of the corporation, even if the legal form of that person's 
relationship to the corporation is that of an independent contractor, 
and
    (B) On any day of the corporation's taxable year, the person owns 
any outstanding stock of the corporation.
    (2) Preceding year test--(i) In general. The amount determined under 
the preceding year test is the product of--
    (A) The applicable amounts during the taxable year preceding the 
applicable election year (the ``preceding taxable year''), divided by 
the number of months (but not less than one) in the preceding taxable 
year, multiplied by
    (B) The number of months in the deferral period of the applicable 
election year.
    (ii) Example. The provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section may 
be illustrated by the following example.

    Example. R, a personal service corporation, has historically used a 
taxable year ending January 31. For its taxable year beginning February 
1, 1987, R makes a section 444 election to retain its January 31 taxable 
year. R is an accrual basis taxpayer and has one employee-owner, F. For 
R's taxable year ending January 31, 1987, F earns $5,000 a month plus a 
$40,000 bonus on January 15, 1987. The amount determined under the 
preceding year test for R's applicable election year beginning February 
1, 1987 is $91,667 ($100,000, the applicable amounts during R's taxable 
year ending January 31, 1987, divided by 12, the number of months in R's 
taxable year ending January 31, 1987, multiplied by 11, the number of 
months in R's deferral period for such year).

    (3) 3-year average test--(i) In general. The amount determined under 
the 3-year average test is the applicable percentage multiplied by the 
adjusted taxable income for the deferral period of the applicable 
election year.
    (ii) Applicable percentage. The term applicable percentage means the 
percentage (not in excess of 95 percent) determined by dividing--
    (A) The applicable amounts during the 3 taxable years of the 
corporation (or, if fewer, the taxable years the corporation has been in 
existence) immediately preceding the applicable election year, by
    (B) The adjusted taxable income of such corporation for such 3 
taxable years (or, if fewer, the taxable years of existence).
    (iii) Adjusted taxable income--(A) In general. The term adjusted 
taxable income means taxable income determined without regard to 
applicable amounts.
    (B) Determination of adjusted taxable income for the deferral period 
of the applicable election year. Adjusted taxable income for the 
deferral period of the applicable election year equals the adjusted 
taxable income that would result if the personal service corporation 
filed an income tax return for the deferral period of the applicable 
election year under its normal method of accounting. However, a personal 
service corporation may make a reasonable estimate of such amount.
    (C) NOL carryovers. For purposes of determining adjusted taxable 
income for any period, any NOL carryover shall be reduced by the amount 
of such carryover that is attributable to the deduction of applicable 
amounts. The portion of the NOL carryover attributable to the deduction 
of applicable amounts is the difference between the NOL carryover 
computed with the deduction of such amounts and the NOL carryover 
computed without the deduction of such amounts. For purposes of 
determining the adjusted taxable income for the deferral period, an NOL 
carryover to the applicable election year, reduced as provided in this 
paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C), shall be allowed first against the income of 
the deferral period.
    (D) Examples. The provisons of this paragraph (c)(3)(iii) may be 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. S is a personal service corporation that has historically 
used a taxable year ending January 31. For its taxable year beginning 
February 1, 1987, S makes a section 444 election to retain its taxable 
year ending January 31. S does not satisfy the minimum distribution 
requirement for its first applicable election year, and the applicable 
amounts for that year exceed the maximum

[[Page 613]]

deductible amount by $54,000. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, 
the $54,000 excess is carried over to S's taxable year beginning 
February 1, 1988. Furthermore, if S continues its section 444 election 
for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1988, and desires to use the 
3-year average test provided in this paragraph for such year, pursuant 
to paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section the $54,000 will not be 
allowed to reduce adjusted taxable income for such year. See also 
section 280H(e) regarding the disallowance of net operating loss 
carrybacks to (or from) any taxable year of a corporation personal 
service election under section 444 applies.
    Example 2. T, a personal service corporation with a section 444 
election in effect, is determining whether it satisfies the 3-year 
average test for its second applicable election year. T had a net 
operating loss (NOL) for its first applicable election year of $45,000. 
The NOL resulted from $150,000 of gross income less the sum of $96,000 
of salary, $45,000 of other expenses, and $54,000 of deductible 
applicable amounts. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this 
section, the entire amount of the $45,000 NOL is attributable to 
applicable amounts since the applicable amounts deducted in arriving at 
the NOL (i.e., $54,000) were greater than the NOL (i.e., $45,000). Thus, 
for purposes of computing the adjusted taxable income for the deferral 
period of T's second applicable election year, the NOL carryover to that 
year is $0 ($45,000 NOL less $45,000 amount of NOL attributable to 
applicable amounts).

    (d) Maximum deductible amount--(1) In general. For purposes of this 
section, the term maximum deductible amount means the sum of--
    (i) The applicable amounts during the deferral period of the 
applicable election year, plus
    (ii) An amount equal to the product of--
    (A) The amount determined under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section 
divided by the number of months in the deferral period of the applicable 
election year, multiplied by
    (B) The number of months in the nondeferral period of the applicable 
election year. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term 
nondeferral period means the portion of the applicable election year 
that occurs after the portion of such year constituting the deferral 
period.
    (2) Example. The provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section may 
be illustrated by the following example.

    Example. U, an accrual basis personal service corporation with a 
taxable year ending January 31, makes a section 444 election to retain a 
year ending January 31 for its taxable year beginning February 1, 1987. 
For its applicable election year beginning February 1, 1987, U does not 
satisfy the minimum distribution requirement in paragraph (c) of this 
section. Furthermore, U has 3 employee-owners, G, H, and I. G and H have 
been employee-owners of U for 10 years. Although I has been an employee 
of U for 4 years, I did not become an employee-owner until December 1, 
1987, when I acquired 5 of the 20 outstanding shares of U stock. For U's 
applicable election year beginning February 1, 1987, G earns $5,000 a 
month plus a $40,000 bonus on January 15, 1988, and H and I each earn 
$4,000 a month plus a $32,000 bonus on January 15, 1988. Thus, the total 
of the applicable amounts during the deferral period of the applicable 
election year beginning February 1, 1987 is $143,000. Based on these 
facts, U's deduction for applicable amounts is limited to $156,000, 
determined as follows--$143,000 (applicable amounts during the deferral 
period) plus $13,000 (applicable amounts during the deferral period, 
divided by the number of months in the deferral period, multiplied by 
the number of months in the nondeferral period).

    (e) Special rules and definition--(1) Newly organized personal 
service corporations. A personal service corporation is deemed to 
satisfy the preceding year test and the 3-year average test for the 
first year of the corporation's existence.
    (2) Existing corporations that become personal service corporations. 
If an existing corporation becomes a personal service corporation and 
makes a section 444 election, the determination of whether the 
corporation satisfies the preceding year test and the 3-year average 
test is made by treating the corporation as though it were a personal 
service corporation for each of the 3 years preceding the applicable 
election year.
    (3) Disallowance of NOL carryback. No net operating loss carryback 
shall be allowed to (or from) any applicable election year of a personal 
service corporation.
    (4) Deferral period. For purposes of section 280H and the 
regulations thereunder, the term deferral period has the same meaning as 
under Sec. 1.444-1T(b)(4).
    (5) Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (e) may be 
illustrated by the following examples.

    Example 1. V is a personal service corporation with a taxable year 
ending September

[[Page 614]]

30. V makes a section 444 election for its taxable year beginning 
October 1, 1987, and incurs a net operating loss (NOL) for such year. 
Because an NOL is not allowed to be carried back from an applicable 
election year, V may not carry back the NOL from its first applicable 
election year to reduce its 1985, 1986, or 1987 taxable income.
    Example 2. W, a personal service corporation, commences operations 
on July 1, 1990. Furthermore, for its taxable year beginning July 1, 
1990, W makes a section 444 election to use a year ending September 30. 
Pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, W satisfies the preceding 
year test and the 3-year average test for its first year in existence. 
Thus, W may deduct, without limitation under this section, any 
applicable amounts for its taxable year beginning July 1, 1990.
    Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example (2). For its taxable 
year beginning October 1, 1990, W incurs an NOL and is not a personal 
service corporation. Furthermore, W desires to carry back the NOL to its 
preceding taxable year (a year that was an applicable election year). 
Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, W may not carry back an 
NOL ``to'' its taxable year beginning July 1, and ending September 30, 
1990, because such year was an applicable election year.

    (f) Effective date. The provisions of this section are effective for 
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.

[T.D. 8205, 53 FR 19711, May 27, 1988]

            Taxable Years Beginning Prior to January 1, 1986


<R05>
Sec. 1.274-5A   Substantiation requirements.

    (a) In general. No deduction shall be allowed for any expenditure 
with respect to:
    (1) Traveling away from home (including meals and lodging) 
deductible under section 162 or 212,
    (2) Any activity which is of a type generally considered to 
constitute entertainment, amusement, or recreation, or with respect to a 
facility used in connection with such an activity, including the items 
specified in section 274(e), or
    (3) Gifts defined in section 274, unless the taxpayer substantiates 
such expenditure as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. This 
limitation supersedes with respect to any such expenditure the doctrine 
of Cohan v. Commissioner (C.C.A. 2d 1930) 39 F. 2d 540. The decision 
held that, where the evidence indicated a taxpayer incurred deductible 
travel or entertainment expense but the exact amount could not be 
determined, the court should make a close approximation and not disallow 
the deduction entirely. Section 274(d) contemplates that no deduction 
shall be allowed a taxpayer for such expenditures on the basis of such 
approximations or unsupported testimony of the taxpayer. For purposes of 
this section, the term entertainment means entertainment, amusement, or 
recreation, and use of a facility therefore; and the term expenditure 
includes expenses and items (including items such as losses and 
depreciation).
    (b) Elements of an expenditure--(1) In general. Section 274(d) and 
this section contemplate that no deduction shall be allowed for any 
expenditure for travel, entertainment, or a gift unless the taxpayer 
substantiates the following elements for each such expenditure:
    (i) Amount;
    (ii) Time and place of travel or entertainment (or use of a facility 
with respect to entertainment), or date and description of a gift;
    (iii) Business purpose; and
    (iv) Business relationship to the taxpayer of each person 
entertained, using an entertainment facility or receiving a gift.
    (2) Travel. The elements to be proved with respect to an expenditure 
for travel are:
    (i) Amount. Amount of each separate expenditure for traveling away 
from home, such as cost of transportation or lodging, except that the 
daily cost of the traveler's own breakfast, lunch, and dinner and of 
expenditures incidental to such travel may be aggregated, if set forth 
in reasonable categories, such as for meals, for gasoline and oil, and 
for taxi fares;
    (ii) Time. Dates of departure and return for each trip away from 
home, and number of days away from home spent on business;
    (iii) Place. Destinations or locality of travel, described by name 
of city or town or other similar designation; and
    (iv) Business purpose. Business reason for travel or nature of the 
business benefit derived or expected to be derived as a result of 
travel.

[[Page 615]]

    (3) Entertainment in general. Elements to be proved with respect to 
an expenditure for entertainment are:
    (i) Amount. Amount of each separate expenditure for entertainment, 
except that such incidental items as taxi fares or telephone calls may 
be aggregated on a daily basis;
    (ii) Time. Date of entertainment;
    (iii) Place. Name, if any, address or location, and designation of 
type of entertainment, such as dinner or theater, if such information is 
not apparent from the designation of the place;
    (iv) Business purpose. Business reason for the entertainment or 
nature of business benefit derived or expected to be derived as a result 
of the entertainment and, except in the case of business meals described 
in section 274(e)(1), the nature of any business discussion or activity;
    (v) Business relationship. Occupation or other information relating 
to the person or persons entertained, including name, title, or other 
designation, sufficient to establish business relationship to the 
taxpayer.
    (4) Entertainment directly preceding or following a substantial and 
bona fide business discussion. If a taxpayer claims a deduction for 
entertainment directly preceding or following a substantial and bona 
fide business discussion on the ground that such entertainment was 
associated with the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or business, 
the elements to be proved with respect to such expenditure, in addition 
to those enumerated in subparagraph (3)(i), (ii), (iii), and (v) of this 
paragraph, are:
    (i) Time. Date and duration of business discussion;
    (ii) Place. Place of business discussion;
    (iii) Business purpose. Nature of business discussion, and business 
reason for the entertainment or nature of business benefit derived or 
expected to be derived as the result of the entertainment;
    (iv) Business relationship. Identification of those persons 
entertained who participated in the business discussion.
    (5) Gifts. Elements to be proved with respect to an expenditure for 
a gift are:
    (i) Amount. Cost of the gift to the taxpayer;
    (ii) Time. Date of the gift;
    (iii) Description. Description of the gift;
    (iv) Business purpose. Business reason for the gift or nature of 
business benefit derived or expected to be derived as a result of the 
gift; and
    (v) Business relationship. Occupation or other information relating 
to the recipient of the gift, including name, title, or other 
designation, sufficient to establish business relationship to the 
taxpayer.
    (c) Rules for substantiation--(1) In general. A taxpayer must 
substantiate each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) 
of this section) by adequate records or by sufficient evidence 
corroborating his own statement except as otherwise provided in this 
section. Section 274(d) contemplates that a taxpayer will maintain and 
produce such substantiation as will constitute clear proof of an 
expenditure for travel, entertainment, or gifts referred to in section 
274. A record of the elements of an expenditure made at or near the time 
of the expenditure, supported by sufficient documentary evidence, has a 
high degree of credibility not present with respect to a statement 
prepared subsequent thereto when generally there is a lack of accurate 
recall. Thus, the corroborative evidence required to support a statement 
not made at or near the time of the expenditure must have a high degree 
of probative value to elevate such statement and evidence to the level 
of credibility reflected by a record made at or near the time of the 
expenditure supported by sufficient documentary evidence. The 
substantiation requirements of section 274(d) are designed to encourage 
taxpayers to maintain the records, together with documentary evidence, 
as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. To obtain a deduction 
for an expenditure for travel, entertainment, or gifts, a taxpayer must 
substantiate, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, each 
element of such an expenditure.
    (2) Substantiation by adequate records--(i) In general. To meet the 
``adequate records'' requirements of section 274(d), a taxpayer shall 
maintain an account book, diary, statement

[[Page 616]]

of expense or similar record (as provided in subdivision (ii) of this 
subparagraph) and documentary evidence (as provided in subdivision (iii) 
of this subparagraph) which, in combination, are sufficient to establish 
each element of an expenditure specified in paragraph (b) of this 
section. It is not necessary to record information in an account book, 
diary, statement of expense or similar record which duplicates 
information reflected on a receipt so long as such account book and 
receipt complement each other in an orderly manner.
    (ii) Account book, diary, etc. An account book, diary, statement of 
expense or similar record must be prepared or maintained in such manner 
that each recording of an element of an expenditure is made at or near 
the time of the expenditure.
    (a) Made at or near the time of the expenditure. For purposes of 
this section, the phrase made at or near the time of the expenditure 
means the elements of an expenditure are recorded at a time when, in 
relation to the making of an expenditure, the taxpayer has full present 
knowledge of each element of the expenditure, such as the amount, time, 
place and business purpose of the expenditure and business relationship 
to the taxpayer of any person entertained. An expense account statement 
which is a transcription of an account book, diary, or similar record 
prepared or maintained in accordance with the provisions of this 
subdivision shall be considered a record prepared or maintained in the 
manner prescribed in the preceding sentence if such expense account 
statement is submitted by an employee to his employer or by an 
independent contractor to his client or customer in the regular course 
of good business practice.
    (b) Substantiation of business purpose. In order to constitute an 
adequate record of business purpose within the meaning of section 274(d) 
and this subparagraph, a written statement of business purpose generally 
is required. However, the degree of substantiation necessary to 
establish business purpose will vary depending upon the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Where the business purpose of an expenditure 
is evident from the surrounding facts and circumstances, a written 
explanation of such business purpose will not be required. For example, 
in the case of a salesman calling on customers on an established sales 
route, a written explanation of the business purpose of such travel 
ordinarily will not be required. Similarly, in the case of a business 
meal described in section 274(e)(1), if the business purpose of such 
meal is evident from the business relationship to the taxpayer of the 
persons entertained and other surrounding circumstances, a written 
explanation of such business purpose will not be required.
    (c) Confidential information. If any information relating to the 
elements of an expenditure, such as place, business purpose or business 
relationship, is of a confidential nature, such information need not be 
set forth in the account book, diary, statement of expense or similar 
record, provided such information is recorded at or near the time of the 
expenditure and is elsewhere available to the district director to 
substantiate such element of the expenditure.
    (iii) Documentary evidence. Documentary evidence, such as receipts, 
paid bills, or similar evidence sufficient to support an expenditure 
shall be required for:
    (a) Any expenditure for lodging while traveling away from home, and
    (b) Any other expenditure of $25 or more, except, for transportation 
charges, documentary evidence will not be required if not readily 
available.

Provided, however, that the Commissioner, in his discretion, may 
prescribe rules waiving such requirements in circumstances where he 
determines it is impracticable for such documentary evidence to be 
required. Ordinarily, documentary evidence will be considered adequate 
to support an expenditure if it includes sufficient information to 
establish the amount, date, place, and the essential character of the 
expenditure. For example, a hotel receipt is sufficient to support 
expenditures for business travel if it contains the following: name, 
location, date, and separate amounts for charges such as for lodging, 
meals, and telephone. Similarly, a restaurant receipt is sufficient to 
support an expenditure for a

[[Page 617]]

business meal if it contains the following: name and location of the 
restaurant, the date and amount of the expenditure, and, if a charge is 
made for an item other than meals and beverages, an indication that such 
is the case. A document may be indicative of only one (or part of one) 
element of an expenditure. Thus, a cancelled check, together with a bill 
from the payee, ordinarily would establish the element of cost. In 
contrast, a cancelled check drawn payable to a named payee would not by 
itself support a business expenditure without other evidence showing 
that the check was used for a certain business purpose.
    (iv) Retention of documentary evidence. The Commissioner may, in his 
discretion, prescribe rules under which an employer may dispose of 
documentary evidence submitted to him by employees who are required to, 
and do, make an adequate accounting to the employer (within the meaning 
of paragraph (e)(4) of this section) if the employer maintains adequate 
accounting procedures with respect to such employees (within the meaning 
of paragraph (e)(5) of this section).
    (v) Substantial compliance. If a taxpayer has not fully 
substantiated a particular element of an expenditure, but the taxpayer 
establishes to the satisfaction of the district director that he has 
substantially complied with the adequate records requirements of this 
subparagraph with respect to the expenditure, the taxpayer may be 
permitted to establish such element by evidence which the district 
director shall deem adequate.
    (3) Substantiation by other sufficient evidence. If a taxpayer fails 
to establish to the satisfaction of the district director that he has 
substantially complied with the ``adequate records'' requirements of 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph with respect to an element of an 
expenditure, then, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the 
taxpayer must establish such element:
    (i) By his own statement, whether written or oral, containing 
specific information in detail as to such element; and
    (ii) By other corroborative evidence sufficient to establish such 
element.

If such element is the description of a gift, or the cost, time, place, 
or date of an expenditure, the corroborative evidence shall be direct 
evidence, such as a statement in writing or the oral testimony of 
persons entertained or other witness setting forth detailed information 
about such element, or the documentary evidence described in 
subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If such element is either the 
business relationship to the taxpayer of persons entertained or the 
business purpose of an expenditure, the corroborative evidence may be 
circumstantial evidence.
    (4) Substantiation in exceptional circumstances. If a taxpayer 
establishes that, by reason of the inherent nature of the situation in 
which an expenditure was made:
    (i) He was unable to obtain evidence with respect to an element of 
the expenditure which conforms fully to the ``adequate records'' 
requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph,
    (ii) He is unable to obtain evidence with respect to such element 
which conforms fully to the ``other sufficient evidence'' requirements 
of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, and
    (iii) He has presented other evidence, with respect to such element, 
which possesses the highest degree of probative value possible under the 
circumstances, such other evidence shall be considered to satisfy the 
substantiation requirements of section 274(d) and this paragraph.
    (5) Loss of records due to circumstances beyond control of taxpayer. 
Where the taxpayer establishes that the failure to produce adequate 
records is due to the loss of such records through circumstances beyond 
the taxpayer's control, such as destruction by fire, flood, earthquake, 
or other casualty, the taxpayer shall have a right to substantiate a 
deduction by reasonable reconstruction of his expenditures.
    (6) Special rules--(i) Separate expenditure--(a) In general. For the 
purposes of this section, each separate payment by the taxpayer shall 
ordinarily be considered to constitute a separate expenditure. However, 
concurrent or repetitious expenses of a similar nature occurring during 
the course of a single event shall be considered a single expenditure. 
To illustrate the above

[[Page 618]]

rules, where a taxpayer entertains a business guest at dinner and 
thereafter at the theater, the payment for dinner shall be considered to 
constitute one expenditure and the payment for the tickets for the 
theater shall be considered to constitute a separate expenditure. 
Similarly, if during a day of business travel a taxpayer makes separate 
payments for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, he shall be considered to 
have made three separate expenditures. However, if during entertainment 
at a cocktail lounge the taxpayer pays separately for each serving of 
refreshments, the total amount expended for the refreshments will be 
treated as a single expenditure. A tip may be treated as a separate 
expenditure.
    (b) Aggregation. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the 
account book, diary, statement of expense, or similar record required by 
subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph shall be maintained with respect 
to each separate expenditure and not with respect to aggregate amounts 
for two or more expenditures. Thus, each expenditure for such items as 
lodging and air or rail travel shall be recorded as a separate item and 
not aggregated. However, at the option of the taxpayer, amounts expended 
for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, may be aggregated. A tip or gratuity 
which is related to an underlying expense may be aggregated with such 
expense. For other provisions permitting recording of aggregate amounts 
in an account book, diary, statement of expense or similar record see 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) and (b)(3) of this section (relating to incidental 
costs of travel and entertainment).
    (ii) Allocation of expenditure. For purposes of this section, if a 
taxpayer has established the amount of an expenditure, but is unable to 
establish the portion of such amount which is attributable to each 
person participating in the event giving rise to the expenditure, such 
amount shall ordinarily be allocated to each participant on a pro rata 
basis, if such determination is material. Accordingly, the total number 
of persons for whom a travel or entertainment expenditure is incurred 
must be established in order to compute the portion of the expenditure 
allocable to each such person.
    (iii) Primary use of a facility. Section 274(a) (1)(B) and (2)(C) 
denies a deduction for any expenditure paid or incurred before January 
1, 1979, with respect to a facility, or paid or incurred at any time 
with respect to a club, used in connection with an entertainment 
activity unless the taxpayer establishes that the facility (including a 
club) was used primarily for the furtherance of his trade or business. A 
determination whether a facility before January 1, 1979, or a club at 
any time was used primarily for the futherance of the taxpayer's trade 
or business will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 
In order to establish that a facility was used primarily for the 
furtherance of his trade or business, the taxpayer shall maintain 
records of the use of the facility, the cost of using the facility, 
mileage or its equivalent (if appropriate), and such other information 
as shall tend to establish such primary use. Such records of use shall 
contain:
    (a) For each use of the facility claimed to be in furtherance of the 
taxpayer's trade or business, the elements of an expenditure specified 
in paragraph (b) of this section, and
    (b) For each use of the facility not in furtherance of the 
taxpayer's trade or business, an appropriate description of such use, 
including cost, date, number of persons entertained, nature of 
entertainment and, if applicable, information such as mileage or its 
equivalent. A notation such as ``personal use'' or ``family use'' would, 
in the case of such use, be sufficient to describe the nature of 
entertainment.

If a taxpayer fails to maintain adequate records concerning a facility 
which is likely to serve the personal purposes of the taxpayer, it shall 
be presumed that the use of such facility was primarily personal.
    (iv) Additional information. In a case where it is necessary to 
obtain additional information, either:
    (a) To clarify information contained in records, statements, 
testimony, or documentary evidence submitted by a taxpayer under the 
provisions of paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, or
    (b) To establish the reliability or accuracy of such records, 
statements, testimony, or documentary evidence,

[[Page 619]]

the district director may, notwithstanding any other provision of this 
section, obtain such additional information as he determines necessary 
to properly implement the provisions of section 274 and the regulations 
thereunder by personal interview or otherwise.
    (7) Specific exceptions. Except as otherwise prescribed by the 
Commissioner, substantiation otherwise required by this paragraph is not 
required for:
    (i) Expenses described in section 274 (e)(2) relating to food and 
beverages for employees, section 274(e)(3) relating to expenses treated 
as compensation, section 274(e)(8) relating to items available to the 
public, and section 274(e)(9) relating to entertainment sold to 
customers, and
    (ii) Expenses described in section 274(e)(5) relating to 
recreational, etc., expenses for employees, except that a taxpayer shall 
keep such records or other evidence as shall establish that such 
expenses were for activities (or facilities used in connection 
therewith) primarily for the benefit of employees other than employees 
who are officers, shareholders or other owners (as defined in section 
274(e)(5)), or highly compensated employees.
    (d) Disclosure on returns. The Commissioner may, in his discretion, 
prescribe rules under which any taxpayer claiming a deduction for 
entertainment, gifts, or travel or any other person receiving advances, 
reimbursements, or allowances for such items, shall make disclosure on 
his tax return with respect to such items. The provisions of this 
paragraph shall apply notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (e) of 
this section.
    (e) Reporting and substantiation of expenses of certain employees 
for travel, entertainment, and gifts--(1) In general. The purpose of 
this paragraph is to provide rules for reporting and substantiation of 
certain expenses paid or incurred by taxpayers in connection with the 
performance of services as employees. For purposes of this paragraph, 
the term business expenses means ordinary and necessary expenses for 
travel, entertainment, or gifts which are deductible under section 162, 
and the regulations thereunder, to the extent not disallowed by section 
274(c). Thus, the term business expenses does not include personal, 
living or family expenses disallowed by section 262 or travel expenses 
disallowed by section 274(c), and advances, reimbursements, or 
allowances for such expenditures must be reported as income by the 
employee.
    (2) Reporting of expenses for which the employee is required to make 
an adequate accounting to his employer--(i) Reimbursements equal to 
expenses. For purposes of computing tax liability, an employee need not 
report on his tax return business expenses for travel, transportation, 
entertainment, gifts, and similar purposes, paid or incurred by him 
solely for the benefit of his employer for which he is required to, and 
does, make an adequate accounting to his employer (as defined in 
subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) and which are charged directly or 
indirectly to the employer (for example, through credit cards) or for 
which the employee is paid through advances, reimbursements, or 
otherwise, provided that the total amount of such advances, 
reimbursements, and charges is equal to such expenses.
    (ii) Reimbursements in excess of expenses. In case the total of the 
amounts charged directly or indirectly to the employer or received from 
the employer as advances, reimbursements, or otherwise, exceeds the 
business expenses paid or incurred by the employee and the employee is 
required to, and does, make an adequate accounting to his employer for 
such expenses, the employee must include such excess (including amounts 
received for expenditures not deductible by him) in income.
    (iii) Expense in excess of reimbursements. If an employee incurs 
deductible business expenses on behalf of his employer which exceed the 
total of the amounts charged directly or indirectly to the employer and 
received from the employer as advances, reimbursements, or otherwise, 
and the employee wishes to claim a deduction for such excess, he must:
    (a) Submit a statement as part of his tax return showing all of the 
information required by subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, and,
    (b) Maintain such records and supporting evidence as will 
substantiate

[[Page 620]]

each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this 
section) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (3) Reporting of expenses for which the employee is not required to 
make an adequate accounting to his employer. If the employee is not 
required to make an adequate accounting to his employer for his business 
expenses or, though required, fails to make an adequate accounting for 
such expenses, he must submit, as a part of his tax return, a statement 
showing the following information:
    (i) The total of all amounts received as advances or reimbursements 
from his employer, including amounts charged directly or indirectly to 
the employer through credit cards or otherwise; and
    (ii) The nature of his occupation, the number of days away from home 
on business, and the total amount of business expenses paid or incurred 
by him (including those charged directly or indirectly to the employer 
through credit cards or otherwise) broken down into such categories as 
transportation, meals and lodging while away from home overnight, 
entertainment, gifts, and other business expenses.

In addition, he must maintain such records and supporting evidence as 
will substantiate each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph 
(b) of this section) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
    (4) Definition of an ``adequate accounting'' to the employer. For 
purposes of this paragraph an adequate accounting means the submission 
to the employer of an account book, diary, statement of expense, or 
similar record maintained by the employee in which the information as to 
each element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this 
section) is recorded at or near the time of the expenditure, together 
with supporting documentary evidence, in a manner which conforms to all 
the ``adequate records'' requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section. An adequate accounting requires that the employee account for 
all amounts received from his employer during the taxable year as 
advances, reimbursements, or allowances (including those charged 
directly or indirectly to the employer through credit cards or 
otherwise) for travel, entertainment, and gifts. The methods of 
substantiation allowed under paragraph (c)(4) or (c)(5) of this section 
also will be considered to be an adequate accounting if the employer 
accepts an employee's substantiation and establishes that such 
substantiation meets the requirements of such paragraph (c)(4) or 
(c)(5). For purposes of an adequate accounting the method of 
substantiation allowed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section will not 
be permitted.
    (5) Substantiation of expenditures by certain employees. An employee 
who makes an adequate accounting to his employer within the meaning of 
this paragraph will not again be required to substantiate such expense 
account information except in the following cases:
    (i) An employee whose business expenses exceed the total of amounts 
charged to his employer and amounts received through advances, 
reimbursements or otherwise and who claims a deduction on his return for 
such excess;
    (ii) An employee who is related to his employer within the meaning 
of section 267(b) but for this purpose the percentage referred to in 
section 267(b)(2) shall be 10 percent; and
    (iii) Employees in cases where it is determined that the accounting 
procedures used by the employer for the reporting and substantiation of 
expenses by such employees are not adequate, or where it cannot be 
determined that such procedures are adequate. The district director will 
determine whether the employer's accounting procedures are adequate by 
considering the facts and circumstances of each case, including the use 
of proper internal controls. For example, an employer should require 
that an expense account must be verified and approved by a responsible 
person other than the person incurring such expenses. Accounting 
procedures will be considered inadequate to the extent that the employer 
does not require an adequate accounting from his employees as defined in 
subparagraph (4) of this paragraph, or does not maintain such 
substantiation. To the extent an employer fails to maintain adequate 
accounting procedures he will thereby obligate his employees to 
separately

[[Page 621]]

substantiate their expense account information.
    (f) Substantiation by reimbursement arrangements or per diem, 
mileage, and other traveling allowances. The Commissioner may, in his 
discretion, prescribe rules under which:
    (1) Reimbursement arrangements covering ordinary and necessary 
expenses of traveling away from home (exclusive of transportation 
expenses to and from destination),
    (2) Per diem allowances providing for ordinary and necessary 
expenses of traveling away from home (exclusive of transportation costs 
to and from destination), and
    (3) Mileage allowances providing for ordinary and necessary expenses 
of transportation while traveling away from home, will, if in accordance 
with reasonable business practice, be regarded as equivalent to 
substantiation by adequate records or other sufficient evidence for 
purposes of paragraph (c) of this section of the amount of such 
traveling expenses and as satisfying, with respect to the amount of such 
traveling expenses, the requirements of an adequate accounting to the 
employer for purposes of paragraph (e)(4) of this section. If the total 
travel allowance received exceeds the deductible traveling expenses paid 
or incurred by the employee, such excess must be reported as income on 
the employee's return. See paragraph (h) of this section relating to the 
substantiation of meal expenses while traveling.
    (g) Reporting and substantiation of certain reimbursements of 
persons other than employees--(1) In general. The purpose of this 
paragraph is to provide rules for the reporting and substantiation of 
certain expenses for travel, entertainment, and gifts paid or incurred 
by one person (hereinafter termed ``independent contractor'') in 
connection with services performed for another person other than an 
employer (hereinafter termed ``client or customer'') under a 
reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement with such client or 
customer. For purposes of this paragraph, the term business expenses 
means ordinary and necessary expenses for travel, entertainment, or 
gifts which are deductible under section 162, and the regulations 
thereunder, to the extent not disallowed by section 274(c). Thus, the 
term business expenses does not include personal, living or family 
expenses disallowed by section 262 or travel expenses disallowed by 
section 274(c), and reimbursements for such expenditures must be 
reported as income by the independent contractor. For purposes of this 
paragraph, the term reimbursements means advances, allowances, or 
reimbursements received by an independent contractor for travel, 
entertainment, or gifts, in connection with the performance by him of 
services for his client or customer, under a reimbursement or other 
expense allowance arrangement with his client or customer, and includes 
amounts charged directly or indirectly to the client or customer through 
credit card systems or otherwise. See paragraph (h) of this section 
relating to the substantiation of meal expenses while traveling.
    (2) Substantiation by independent contractors. An independent 
contractor shall substantiate, with respect to his reimbursements, each 
element of an expenditure (described in paragraph (b) of this section) 
in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section; 
and, to the extent he does not so substantiate, he shall include such 
reimbursements in income. An independent contractor shall so 
substantiate a reimbursement for entertainment regardless of whether he 
accounts (within the meaning of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) for 
such entertainment.
    (3) Accounting to a client or customer under section 274(e)(4)(B). 
Section 274(e)(4)(B) provides that section 274(a) (relating to 
disallowance of expenses for entertainment) shall not apply to 
expenditures for entertainment for which an independent contractor has 
been reimbursed if the independent contractor accounts to his client or 
customer to the extent provided by section 274(d). For purposes of 
section 274(e)(4)(B), an independent contractor shall be considered to 
account to his client or customer for an expense paid or incurred under 
a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement

[[Page 622]]

with his client or customer if, with respect to such expense for 
entertainment, he submits to his client or customer adequate records or 
other sufficient evidence conforming to the requirements of paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (4) Substantiation by client or customer. A client or customer shall 
not be required to substantiate, in accordance with the requirements of 
paragraph (c) of this section, reimbursements to an independent 
contractor for travel and gifts, or for entertainment unless the 
independent contractor has accounted to him (within the meaning of 
section 274(e)(4)(B) and subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) for such 
entertainment. If an independent contractor has so accounted to a client 
or customer for entertainment, the client or customer shall substantiate 
each element of the expenditure (as described in paragraph (b) of this 
section) in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (h) Authority for an optional method of computing meal expenses 
while traveling. The Commissioner may establish a method under which a 
taxpayer may elect to use a specified amount or amounts for meals while 
traveling in lieu of substantiating the actual cost of meals. The 
taxpayer would not be relieved of substantiating the actual cost of 
other travel expenses as well as the time, place, and business purpose 
of the travel. See paragraph (b)(2) and (c) of this section.
    (i) Effective date--(1) In general. Section 274(d) and this section 
apply with respect to taxable years ending after December 31, 1962, but 
only with respect to period after that date.
    (2) Certain meal expenses. Paragraph (h) of this section is 
effective for expenses paid or incurred after December 31, 1982.

          Terminal Railroad Corporations and Their Shareholders


<R05>
Sec. 1.281-1  In general.

    Section 281 provides special rules for the computation of the 
taxable incomes of a terminal railroad corporation and its shareholders 
when the terminal railroad corporation, as a result of taking related 
terminal income into account, reduces a charge which was made or which 
would be made for related terminal services furnished to a railroad 
corporation. Section 281 and paragraphs (a) and (b) of Sec. 1.281-2 
provide that the ``reduced amount'' described in paragraph (c) of 
Sec. 1.281-2 is not includable in gross income of the terminal railroad 
corporation, is not treated as a dividend or other distribution to its 
railroad shareholders, and is not treated as an amount paid -or incurred 
by the railroad shareholders to the terminal railroad corporation. 
Section 281 and paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.281-2 provide that no 
deduction otherwise allowable to a terminal railroad corporation shall 
be disallowed as a result of the ``reduced amount'' described in 
paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.281-2. Section 1.281-3 defines the terms 
terminal railroad corporation, related terminal income, related terminal 
services, agreement, and railroad corporation. Section 1.281-4 describes 
the effective dates and special rules for application of section 281 to 
taxable years ending before October 23, 1962.

[T.D. 7356, 40 FR 23732, June 2, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 1.281-2   Effect of section 281 upon the computation of taxable income.

    (a) Computation of taxable income of terminal railroad 
corporations--(1) Income not considered received or accrued. A terminal 
railroad corporation (as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.281-3) shall 
not be considered to have received or accrued the ``reduced amount'' 
described in paragraph (c) of this section in the computation of its 
taxable income. Thus, income is not to be considered accrued or actually 
or constructively received by a terminal railroad corporation where, in 
the manner described in paragraph (c) of this section, (i) a charge 
which would be made to

[[Page 623]]

any railroad corporation for related terminal services is not made, or 
(ii) a portion of any liability payable by any railroad corporation with 
respect to related terminal services is discharged.
    (2) Deduction not disallowed. In the computation of the taxable 
income of a terminal railroad corporation, a deduction relating to a 
``reduced amount'', described in paragraph (c) of this section, which is 
otherwise allowable to it under chapter 1 of the Code (without regard to 
sec. 277) shall not be disallowed by reason of section 281. Thus, 
deductions for expenses attributable to services rendered to a 
shareholder are not to be disallowed to a terminal railroad corporation 
merely because, in the manner described in paragraph (c) of this 
section, (i) a charge which would be made to any railroad corporation 
for related terminal services is not made, or (ii) a portion of any 
liability payable by any railroad corporation with respect to related 
terminal services is discharged. To the extent that section 281 applies 
to a deduction relating to a ``reduced amount'', such deduction shall 
not be disallowed under section 277.
    (b) Computation of taxable income of shareholders--(1) Income not 
considered received or accrued. A shareholder of a terminal railroad 
corporation shall not be considered to have received or accrued any 
``reduced amount'' (described in paragraph (c) of this section) in the 
computation of the shareholder's taxable income. Thus a dividend is not 
to be considered actually or constructively received by a shareholder of 
a terminal railroad corporation merely because, in the manner described 
in paragraph (c) of this section, (i) a charge which would be made to 
the shareholder or any other railroad corporation for related terminal 
services is not made, or (ii) a portion of any liability payable by it 
or any other railroad corporation with respect to related terminal 
services is discharged.
    (2) Expenses not considered paid or incurred. In the computation of 
the taxable income of a shareholder of a terminal railroad corporation, 
the shareholder shall not be considered to have paid or incurred any 
``reduced amount'' (described in paragraph (c) of this section). Thus, a 
shareholder of the terminal railroad corporation may not deduct as an 
expense for related terminal services (as defined in paragraph (c) of 
Sec. 1.281-3) an amount in excess of the net cost to it of such 
services.
    (c) Amounts to which section 281 applies--(1) Reduced amount. For 
purposes of this section, the term reduced amount means, subject to the 
limitation of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the amount by which:
    (i) A charge which would be made by a terminal railroad corporation 
for its taxable year for related terminal services provided to a 
railroad corporation; or
    (ii) A liability of a railroad corporation, resulting from a charge 
made by a terminal railroad corporation for its taxable year, with 
respect to related terminal services provided by the terminal railroad 
corporation, is reduced by reason of the terminal railroad corporation's 
taking into account, pursuant to an agreement (as defined in paragraph 
(d) of Sec. 1.281-3), related terminal income (as defined in paragraph 
(b) of Sec. 1.281-3) received or accrued (without regard to section 281) 
during such taxable year.
    (2) Charge which would be made. For purposes of this section, a 
``charge which would be made'' by a terminal railroad corporation is the 
amount that would be charged to any railroad corporation for related 
terminal services provided if the terminal railroad corporation made the 
charge without taking related terminal income into account.
    (3) Reduction resulting from related terminal income. For purposes 
of subparagraph (1) of this section, a charge or a liability is reduced 
by taking related terminal income into account to the extent that:
    (i) Related terminal income is received or accrued (without regard 
to section 281) by the terminal railroad corporation for its taxable 
year in which the charge or liability is reduced; and
    (ii) The charge or liability in question would have been larger than 
it is had such income not been received or accrued (without regard to 
section 281).

The reduction must be made (directly or indirectly) on the books of the 
terminal railroad corporation, and in fact,

[[Page 624]]

for the same taxable year for which the charge would be made or for 
which the liability is incurred. The reduction of the charge or 
liability must be taken into account by the terminal railroad 
corporation in ascertaining the income, profit, or loss for such taxable 
year for the purpose of reports to shareholders and the Interstate 
Commerce Commission, and for credit purposes.
    (4) Limitation. To the extent that a reduced amount (as described in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section but without regard to the limitation 
under this subparagraph) would operate either to create or to increase a 
net operating loss for the terminal railroad corporation, this section 
shall not apply. Therefore, if a portion of a liability is discharged 
(in the manner described in this paragraph) and the discharged portion 
of the liability exceeds an amount equal to the terminal railroad 
corporation's gross income minus the deductions allowed by chapter 1 of 
the Code (computed with regard to the modifications specified in section 
172(d) but without regard to section 281 and this section), then section 
281 and this section shall not apply to such excess. The limitation 
described in this subparagraph shall apply only to taxable years of 
terminal railroad corporations ending after October 23, 1962.
    (d) Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by 
the following examples. In these examples, references to ``before the 
application of section 281'', ``after the application of section 281'', 
``taxable income'', and ``allowable deductions'' take no account of 
section 277, which may apply to deductions to which section 281 does not 
apply.

    Example 1--(i) Facts. The T Company is a terminal railroad 
corporation which charges its three equal shareholders, the X, Y, and Z 
railroad corporations, a rental calculated monthly on a wheelage or user 
basis for the use of its services and facilities. The T Company and each 
of its shareholders report income on the calendar year basis. A written 
lease agreement to which all of the shareholders were parties was 
entered into in 1947. The agreement provides that at the end of each 
year the liabilities of each of the shareholders resulting from charges 
for rental obligations with respect to related terminal services shall 
be reduced by the shareholder's one-third share of the net income from 
each source of revenue that produced income (computed before reduction 
for Federal income taxes). For the calendar year 1973, the T Company's 
charges to its shareholders include the following charges for related 
terminal services: $35,000 to the X Company, $25,000 to the Y Company, 
and $20,000 to the Z Company. Thus, prior to reduction, total 
shareholder liabilities to the T Company for related terminal services 
are $80,000 at the end of 1973. The T Company's net income from all 
sources (before reduction of liabilities pursuant to the 1947 agreement 
and before reduction for Federal income taxes) and its taxable income, 
before the application of section 281, for 1973 are $36,000 determined 
as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                 Income 
                 Source                     Gross    Allowable     (or  
                                           income   deductions    loss) 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Related terminal services performed:                                    
    For shareholders....................   $80,000     $65,000   $15,000
    For nonshareholders.................    46,000      37,000     9,000
                                         -------------------------------
  Related terminal income...............   126,000     102,000    24,000
  Nonrelated terminal income............    30,000      18,000    12,000
                                         -------------------------------
      Total.............................   156,000     120,000    36,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The liability of each shareholder is, pursuant to the agreement, 
discharged in part by the T Company crediting $12,000 against the rental 
due from each shareholder for a total discharge of liabilities of 
$36,000 (the net income from all sources), resulting in net shareholder 
liabilities owing to the T Company at the end of 1973 of $44,000 
($80,000 less $36,000): $23,000 from the X Company, $13,000 from the Y 
Company, and $8,000 from the Z Company.
    (ii) Effect on terminal railroad corporation. The reduced amount to 
which this section applies is $24,000 (related terminal income of $9,000 
from nonshareholders and $15,000 from shareholders). Thus, to the extent 
of $24,000, the T Company is not considered to have received or accrued 
income from the discharged liabilities of $36,000. Similarly, to the 
extent of the same $24,000, the T Company is not disallowed deductions 
for expenses merely by reason of the discharge. The T Company's taxable 
income for 1973 after application of section 281 is $12,000, computed as 
follows:

Gross income ($156,000 less $24,000).........................   $132,000
Less allowable deductions....................................    120,000
                                                              ----------
    Taxable income...........................................     12,000
                                                                        

    (iii) Effect on shareholders--The reduced amount of $24,000 shall 
not be deemed to constitute either a dividend to the shareholders

[[Page 625]]

of the T Company or an expense paid or incurred by them. Thus, under the 
facts described, neither the X Company, the Y Company, nor the Z Company 
shall be considered to have received or accrued a dividend of $8,000, or 
to have paid or incurred an expense of $8,000. Assuming the X Company's 
taxable income for 1973 before the application of section 281 would have 
been $43,200, computed in the following manner, its taxable income for 
1973 after the application of section 281 is $50,000, determined as 
follows:

    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the 
charges to each of the shareholders for related terminal services for 
1973 were as follows: $35,000 to the X Company, $40,000 to the Y 
Company, and $5,000 to the Z Company. Assume further that the Z Company, 
prior to the reduction in liabilities at the end of 1973, owed the T 
Company an additional $4,000 resulting from charges for 1972 for related 
terminal services and $6,000 resulting from the purchase of equipment. 
Since only $21,000 (X Company $8,000, Y Company $8,000, Z Company 
$5,000) of the liabilities which were discharged resulted from charges 
made for 1973 for related terminal services, the reduced amount to which 
this section applies is $21,000 (instead of $24,000 as in Example (1)). 
Thus, the T Company's taxable income for 1973 would be $15,000 ($36,000 
less $21,000 reduced amount) and the amount which shall be considered 
not to have been received or accrued as a dividend nor paid or incurred 
as an expense of each shareholder is $8,000 for the X Company, $8,000 
for the Y Company, and $5,000 for the Z Company.
    Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that the 
allowable deductions with respect to nonrelated terminal activities were 
$39,000 instead of $18,000. The T Company's net income from all sources 
(before reduction for Federal income taxes) and its taxable income, 
before the application of section 281, is therefore $15,000, determined 
as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          Gross     Allowable    Income 
                Source                    income   deductions  (or loss)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Related terminal income...............   $126,000    $102,000    $24,000
Nonrelated terminal income............     30,000      39,000    (9,000)
                                       ---------------------------------
    Total.............................    156,000     141,000     15,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The liability of each shareholder is nevertheless discharged in part, 
pursuant to the agreement, by the T Company crediting $8,000 against the 
rental due from each shareholder for a total discharge of liabilities of 
$24,000 (the net income from each source of revenue that produced 
income). Assume further that none of the modifications specified in 
section 172(d) apply. If the limitation under paragraph (c)(4) of this 
section were not applied, the reduced amount for the purposes of this 
section would be $24,000, and the operation of this section would result 
in a net operating loss of $9,000, since the allowable deductions of 
$141,000 would exceed the gross income of $132,000 ($156,000 less 
discharged liabilities of $24,000) by that amount. Because of the 
limitation under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, however, $9,000 is 
not included in the reduced amount to which this section applies. 
Accordingly, the reduced amount is $15,000 (instead of $24,000 as in 
Example (1)). Thus, the T Company's taxable income for 1973 would be 
zero ($15,000 less the $15,000 reduced amount), and the amount which 
each shareholder shall be considered not to have received or accrued as 
a dividend nor paid or incurred as an expense is $5,000.
    Example 4. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that 
under the agreement income from the terminal parking lot would not 
reduce the shareholders' liabilities. Assume further that such income 
amounted to $3,000 of the total related terminal income of $24,000 for 
the taxable year 1973. The liability of each shareholder therefore is 
discharged by crediting $11,000 against its rental due for a total 
discharge of liabilities of $33,000. The reduced amount to which this 
section applies is $21,000 ($24,000 less $3,000) since only to the 
extent of $21,000 would there have been no such reduction under the 
agreement if there were no related terminal income.
    Example 5. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that, 
pursuant to the agreement, the A Company, a nonshareholder railroad 
corporation, is to have its liabilities resulting from charges for 
rental obligations reduced equally with each of the shareholders. Assume 
further that the T Company's

[[Page 626]]

charges to the A Company for the calendar year 1973 included $15,000 for 
related terminal services and that the liability of each shareholder and 
the A Company is discharged in part pursuant to the agreement by the T 
Company crediting $9,000 against the rental due from each. The reduced 
amount to which this section applies is $24,000. Thus, the T Company's 
taxable income for 1973 is $12,000, and each shareholder shall not be 
considered to have received or accrued as a dividend nor paid or 
incurred as an expense $6,000 ($24,000/ $36,000  x  $9,000) merely 
because of the discharge of its own liability. Similarly, each 
shareholder shall not be considered to have received or accrued as a 
dividend nor paid or incurred as an expense $2,000 (1/3  x  ($24,000/
$36,000  x  $9,000)) merely because of the discharge of the liability of 
the A Company. Section 281 does not apply to the determination of the 
tax consequences of the transaction to the A Company. Similarly, the 
section does not apply to the determination of the tax consequences to 
the shareholders resulting from that portion of the discharge of the 
liability of the A Company which is attributable to the application of 
income which is not related terminal income ($3,000). Hence, such 
consequences shall be determined under the sections of the Internal 
Revenue Code which govern in the absence of section 281.
    Example 6. (i) Facts. The TR Company is a terminal railroad 
corporation with three equal shareholders, the M, N, and O Railroad 
Corporations. The TR Company and each of its shareholders report income 
on the calendar year basis. Pursuant to a written agreement entered into 
in 1947 to which all shareholders were parties, the TR Company makes one 
annual charge to each of the three shareholders at the end of each year 
for the difference between the cost of operations, allocated on a 
wheelage or user basis for the use of its services and facilities 
provided to the shareholder during the year, and one-third of its net 
income from all other sources (computed before reduction for Federal 
income taxes). The TR Company's taxable income, before the application 
of section 281, for 1973 is $21,000 determined as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          Gross     Allowable    Income 
                Source                    income   deductions  (or loss)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Related terminal services performed:                                    
    For shareholders..................    $65,000     $65,000          0
    For nonshareholders...............     46,000      37,000     $9,000
                                       ---------------------------------
Related terminal income...............    111,000     102,000      9,000
Nonrelated terminal income from                                         
 nonshareholders......................     30,000      18,000     12,000
                                       ---------------------------------
    Total.............................    141,000     120,000     21,000
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the calendar year 1973, the TR company's charges to its shareholders 
are $23,000 ($30,000 less $7,000) to the M company, $13,000 ($20,000 
less $7,000) to the N company, and $8,000 ($15,000 less $7,000) to the O 
company for a total of $44,000 for related terminal services.
    (ii) Effect on terminal railroad corporation. The reduced amount to 
which this section applies is $9,000. The TR company is not considered 
to have received or accrued income of $9,000 (related terminal income) 
merely because the charge of $21,000 (net income from all sources other 
than shareholders) was not made. Similarly, to the extent of $9,000, the 
TR company is not disallowed deductions for expenses merely because the 
full cost of services was not charged. The TR company's taxable income 
for 1973 after application of section 281, is $12,000, computed as 
follows:

Gross income ($141,000 less $9,000 charges not made).........   $132,000
Less allowable deductions....................................    120,000
                                                              ----------
  Taxable income.............................................     12,000
                                                                        

    (iii) Effect on shareholders. Neither the M company, the N company, 
nor the O company shall be considered to have received or accrued a 
dividend of $3,000 nor to have paid or incurred an expense of $3,000 
merely by reason of the reduced charges. Thus, assuming the M company's 
taxable income for 1973 before the application of section 281 would have 
been $47,450, computed in the following manner, its taxable income for 
1973 after the application of section 281 is $50,000, determined as 
follows:

[T.D. 7356, 40 FR 23733, June 2, 1975]


<R05>
Sec. 1.281-3   Definitions.

    (a) Terminal railroad corporation. The term terminal railroad 
corporation means a corporation which, in the taxable year, meets all of 
the following conditions:
    (1) The corporation and each of its shareholders must be domestic 
corporations. Thus, all of the shareholders of the corporation, as well 
as the corporation itself, must be corporations which were organized or 
created in the United States, including only the States and the District 
of Columbia, or under the law of the United States or of any State or 
territory.
    (2) All of the shareholders must be railroad corporations which are 
subject to Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act. Thus, if any 
shareholder of the corporation, regardless of the class or percentage of 
stock owned, is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate 
Commerce Commission under part I of that Act, the corporation cannot 
qualify as a terminal railroad corporation.
    (3) The corporation must not be a member of an affiliated group of 
corporations (as defined in section 1504), other than as a common parent 
corporation. For this purpose it is immaterial whether or not the 
affiliated group has ever made a consolidated income tax return. Thus, 
if the X railroad corporation owns 80 percent of all of the outstanding 
stock of the Y railroad corporation, the X railroad corporation may 
qualify, but the Y railroad corporation cannot qualify, as a terminal 
railroad corporation.
    (4) The primary business of the corporation must be that of 
providing to domestic railroad corporations subject to Part I of the 
Interstate Commerce Act and to the shippers and passengers of such 
railroad corporations one or more of the following facilities or 
services: (i) Railroad terminal facilities, (ii) railroad switching 
facilities, (iii) railroad terminal services, or (iv) railroad switching 
services. The designated facilities and services include the furnishing 
of terminal trackage, the operation of stockyards or a union passenger 
or freight station, and the operation of railroad bridges and ferries. 
The providing of the designated facilities includes the leasing of those 
facilities. A corporation shall be considered as having established that 
its primary business is that of providing the designated facilities and 
services if more than 50 percent of its gross income (computed without 
regard to section 281, and excluding dividends and gains and losses from 
the disposition of capital assets or property described in section 
1231(b)) for the taxable year is derived from those sources. The fact 
that income from a service or facility is included within the definition 
of related terminal income is immaterial for purposes of determining 
whether that service or facility is one which is designated in this 
subparagraph. Thus, although income from the operation of a commuter 
railroad line may be related terminal income, a corporation whose 
primary business is the operation of that facility is not a terminal 
railroad corporation, since its primary business is not the providing of 
the designated facilities or services.
    (5) A substantial part of the services rendered by the corporation 
for the taxable year must be rendered to one or more of its 
shareholders. For purposes of this requirement, providing the use of 
facilities shall be considered the rendering of services.
    (6) Each shareholder of the corporation must compute its taxable 
income on the basis of a taxable year which either begins or ends on the 
same day as the taxable year of the corporation.
    (b) Related terminal income--(1) In general. Related terminal income 
is, generally, the type of income normally earned from the operation of 
a railroad terminal. The term related terminal income means the taxable 
income (computed without regard to sections 172, 277, or 281) which the 
terminal railroad corporation derives for the taxable year from the 
sources enumerated in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Related terminal 
income must be derived from

[[Page 628]]

direct provision of the specified facilities or services by the terminal 
corporation itself. Thus, income consisting of rent from a lease of a 
terminal facility by a terminal corporation to a railroad user would 
qualify; but dividends from a corporation in which the terminal 
corporation owned stock and which provided such facilities or services 
to others would not qualify. The term does not include gain or loss 
derived from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of capital assets 
or section 1231 assets, whether or not section 1245 or section 1250 
applies to part or all of that gain. For example, the term does not 
apply to gain from the sale of a terminal building or terminal 
equipment. All direct and indirect expenses and other deductible items 
attributable to related terminal services or facilities shall be 
deducted in determining related terminal income. Attribution shall be 
determined in accordance with customary railroad accounting practices 
accepted by the Interstate Commerce Commission, except that interest 
paid with respect to the indebtedness of a terminal railroad corporation 
shall be deducted from related terminal income to the extent that the 
proceeds from the indebtedness were directly or indirectly applied to 
facilities or activities producing such income. The district director 
may either accept the use of the taxpayer's method of determining the 
application of the proceeds of all indebtedness of such corporation or 
prescribe the use of another method which, under all the facts and 
circumstances, appears to reflect more accurately the probable 
application of such proceeds.
    (2) Sources of related terminal income. The term related terminal 
income includes only income derived from one or more of the following 
sources:
    (i) From services or facilities of a character ordinarily and 
regularly provided by terminal railroad corporations for railroad 
corporations or for the employees, passengers, or shippers of railroad 
corporations. Whether the services or facilities are of a character 
ordinarily and regularly provided by terminal railroad corporations is 
to be determined by accepted industry practice. The fact that 
nonterminal businesses may also provide such services or facilities is 
immaterial. However, there must be a direct relationship between the 
service or facility provided and the operation of the terminal, 
including the operation of its trackage and switching facilities. Thus, 
the term related terminal income includes income derived from operating 
or leasing switching facilities and terminal facilities, such as income 
from charges to railroad corporations for the use of a union passenger 
or freight station. Also included for this purpose is income derived 
from charges to railroad shippers, including express companies and 
freight forwarders, for the use of sheds or warehouses, even though not 
directly intended for railroad use. The term includes income derived 
from leasing or operating restaurants, drugstores, barbershops, 
newsstands, ticket agencies, banking facilities, car rental facilities, 
or other similar facilities for passengers, in waiting rooms or along 
passenger concourses. Similarly, the term includes income derived from 
operating or leasing passenger parking facilities, and from renting 
taxicab space, located on or adjacent to the terminal premises. Although 
the term does include income derived from the operation of a small hotel 
operated primarily for and usually occupied primarily by the employees 
of the railroad corporations, it does not include income derived from 
the operation of a hotel for passengers or other persons.
    (ii) From any railroad corporation for services or facilities 
provided by the terminal railroad corporation in connection with 
railroad operations. A service or a facility is provided in connection 
with railroad operations if it is of a character ordinarily and 
regularly availed of by railroad corporations. For purposes of this 
subdivision, the income must be derived from railroad corporations. 
Thus, in addition to the income derived from sources described in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the term related terminal income 
includes income derived from switching facilities or leasing to any 
railroad corporation, or operating for the benefit of such corporation, 
a beltline or bypass railroad leading to or from the terminal premises. 
Also included are income derived from the rental of office space 
(whether or not services are provided

[[Page 629]]

to the occupants) in the terminal building to any railroad corporation 
for that corporation's administrative or operating divisions, and income 
derived from tolls charged to any railroad corporation for the use of a 
railroad bridge or ferry.
    (iii) From the use by persons other than railroad corporations of a 
portion of a facility, or of a service, which is used primarily for 
railroad purposes. A facility or service is used primarily for railroad 
purposes if the predominant reason for its continued operation or 
provision is the furnishing of facilities or services described in 
either subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph. The determination 
required by this subdivision is to be made independently for each 
separate facility or service. Two substantial portions of a single 
structure may be considered separate facilities, depending upon the 
respective uses made of each. Moreover, any substantial addition, 
constructed after October 23, 1962, to a facility shall be considered a 
separate facility.

The term related terminal income includes income produced by operating a 
commuter service or by renting tracks and facilities for a commuter 
service to an independent operator. The term also includes the sale or 
rental of advertising space at a terminal facility. If the conditions 
described in this subdivision are satisfied, the term related terminal 
income may include income which has no connection with the operation of 
the terminal. Thus, if a terminal railroad corporation operates a 
railroad bridge primarily to provide railroad corporations a means of 
crossing a river and the lower level of the bridge contains a roadway 
for similar use by automobiles, the term includes income derived from 
the tolls charged to the automobiles for the use of the bridge roadway. 
However, upon the discontinuance of operations of the railroad level of 
the bridge, the term would cease to include the automobile tolls. If 
excess steam from a steam plant operated primarily to supply steam to 
the terminal is sold to another business in the neighborhood, the term 
would include the income derived from such sale. However, because an oil 
or gas well or a mine constitutes a separate facility, the term related 
terminal income does not include income derived in any form from a 
deposit of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral located on property 
owned or leased by the terminal railroad corporation.

Similarly, while the term includes income derived from the rental of a 
small number of offices located in the terminal building (whether or not 
the lessees are railroad corporations), it does not include income 
derived from the leasing or operation, for the use of the general 
public, of a large number of offices or a large number of rooms for 
lodging, whether or not the space is physically part of the same 
structure as the terminal. Moreover, the term does not include income 
derived from the rental of offices to the general public in an addition 
to the terminal building constructed after October 23, 1962, unless the 
addition is primarily used for railroad purposes and the offices rented 
to the general public do not constitute a separate facility in the 
addition. Whether or not income from the addition is determined to be 
related terminal income, the income from the small number of offices 
which were included in the terminal building before the addition was 
constructed shall continue to be related terminal income.
    (iv) From the United States in payment for facilities or services in 
connection with mail handling. The income must be derived directly from 
the U.S. Government, or any agency thereof (including for this purpose 
the U.S. Postal Service), through the receipt of payments for mail-
handling facilities or services. Thus, the term would include income 
derived from the rental of space for a post office for use by the 
general public on the terminal premises or from the sorting of mail in a 
railroad box car.
    (3) Illustration. The provisions of this paragraph may be 
illustrated by the following example:

    Example. For its calendar year 1973, the R Company, a terminal 
railroad corporation, has taxable income of $36,000, before the 
application of section 281 and taking no account of section 277, 
determined as follows:

Gross income:

    (c) Related terminal services. The term related terminal services 
means only the services or the use of facilities, provided by the 
terminal railroad corporation, which are taken into account in computing 
related terminal income. Thus, the term includes the providing of 
terminal and switching services, the furnishing of terminal and 
switching facilities including the furnishing of terminal trackage, and 
the operation of bridges and ferries for railroad purposes. For example, 
upon the facts of the example in the preceding paragraph, the charges 
for related terminal services are $126,000, determined as follows:

Switching charges...........................................     $50,000
Express companies...........................................       2,000
Commuter line...............................................       4,000
U.S. mail handling..........................................       4,000
Railroad bridge tolls.......................................       3,000
Station and train charges...................................      47,000
Terminal parking lot........................................       4,000
Rent from:                                                              
  Passenger facilities......................................       8,000
  Offices...................................................       4,000
                                                             -----------
    Total...................................................     126,000
                                                                  

    (d) Agreement. As used in section 281 and Sec. 1.281-2 the term 
agreement means a written contract, entered into before the beginning of 
the terminal railroad corporation's taxable year in question, to which 
all shareholders of the terminal railroad corporation are parties. The 
fact that other railroad corporations or persons are also parties will 
not disqualify an agreement. Section 281 applies only if, and to the 
extent that, the reduction of the liability or charge that would be 
made, as described in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.281-2, results from the 
agreement. Thus, where the other conditions of the statute are met, 
section 281 applies if a written agreement, to which all of the 
shareholders were parties and which was entered into prior to the 
beginning of the terminal railroad corporation's taxable year, provides 
that the net revenues of the terminal railroad corporation are

[[Page 631]]

to be applied as a reduction of what would otherwise be the charge for 
the taxable year for related terminal services provided to the 
shareholders. Similarly, section 281 applies, where its other 
requirements are fulfilled, if the agreement provides that the net 
revenues are to be credited against rental obligations resulting from 
related terminal services furnished to shareholders. However, section 
281 does not apply where the agreement provides that the net revenues 
are to be divided among the shareholders and distributed to them in cash 
or held subject to their unconditional right of withdrawal instead of 
being applied to the computation of charges, or in reduction of 
liabilities incurred, for related terminal services.
    (e) Railroad corporation. For purposes of section 281, Sec. 1.281-2, 
and this section, the term railroad corporation means any corporation 
(regardless of whether it is a shareholder of the terminal railroad 
corporation) that is engaged as a common carrier in the furnishing or 
sale of transportation by railroad, or is a lessor of railroad equipment 
or facilities. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a corporation is 
a lessor of railroad equipment or facilities only if (1) it is subject 
to part I of the Interstate Commerce Act, (2) substantially all of its 
railroad properties have been leased to a railroad corporation or 
corporations, (3) each lease is for a term of more than 20 years, and 
(4) 80 percent or more of its gross income for the taxable year is 
derived for such leases.

Sec. 1.281-4   Taxable years affected.

    (a) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, 
the provisions of section 281 and Secs. 1.281-2 and 1.281-3 shall apply 
to all taxable years to which either the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 
or the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 apply.
    (b) Taxable years ending before October 23, 1962. (1)(i) In the case 
of a taxable year of a terminal railroad corporation ending before 
October 23, 1962, section 281 (a) shall apply only to the extent that 
the terminal railroad corporation (a) computed its taxable income on its 
return for such taxable year as if the ``reduced amount'', described in 
paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.281-2, were not received or accrued, and (b) did 
not decrease its otherwise allowable deductions for such taxable year on 
account of that ``reduced amount''. Similarly, in the case of a taxable 
year of a shareholder of a terminal railroad corporation ending before 
October 23, 1962, section 281(b) shall apply only to the extent that 
such shareholder computed its taxable income on its return for such 
taxable year as if the shareholder had neither received or accrued as a 
dividend nor paid or incurred as an expense the ``reduced amount'' 
described in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.281-2. Such return must have been 
filed on or before the due date (including the period of any extension 
of time) for filing the return for the applicable taxable year. The fact 
that an amended return or claim for refund or credit of overpayment was 
subsequently filed, or a deficiency subsequently assessed, based upon a 
computation of taxable income which is inconsistent with the manner in 
which the taxable income was computed on the timely filed return, is 
immaterial.
    (ii) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the 
following examples:

    Example 1. The G Company is a terminal railroad corporation which in 
1960 reduced the liabilities resulting from charges to its shareholders, 
pursuant to a 1947 written agreement, by its income from nonshareholder 
sources. For the calendar year 1960, the G Company's related terminal 
income was $24,000, of which $3,000 is attributable to income from the 
United States in payment for facilities and services in connection with 
mail handling. Although the shareholders' liabilities were reduced by 
$24,000 as a result of taking related terminal income earned during the 
taxable year into account, on its timely filed 1960 income tax return 
the G Company treated the $3,000 of liabilities which were reduced on 
account of income from mail handling as gross income received or accrued 
during the year. Assuming that the provisions of Sec. 1.281-2 otherwise 
apply, their application to the determination of the 1960 tax liability 
of the G Company shall not extend to the entire ``reduced amount'' of 
$24,000, but shall be limited to $21,000 of that amount.
    Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example (1), and the 
following additional facts. The G Company had three shareholders in 
1960, and an equal discharge of liability of $8,000 resulted for each of 
them on account of

[[Page 632]]

related terminal income. Each shareholder treated, on its timely filed 
1960 income tax return, $1,000 of its liabilities, which were so reduced 
and were attributable to income from the United States in payment for 
facilities and services in connection with mail handling, as if it had 
received $1,000 from the G Company as a dividend and paid that $1,000 to 
the G Company for services. Each shareholder treated the remaining 
$7,000 of its liabilities which were so reduced as if the liabilities 
which were reduced had never been incurred. Assuming that the provisions 
of Sec. 1.281-2 otherwise apply, each shareholder shall not be 
considered to have received or accrued as a dividend, nor to have paid 
or incurred as an expense $7,000 (instead of $8,000).

    (2) For any taxable year of a terminal railroad corporation ending 
before October 23, 1962, a claim for refund or credit of overpayment of 
income tax based upon section 281 may be filed, even though such refund 
or credit of overpayment was otherwise barred by operation of any law or 
rule of law on October 23, 1962, subject to the conditions set forth in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) through (v) of this section.
    (i) The claim for refund or credit of overpayment must not have been 
barred by a closing agreement (under either section 3760 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1954), or by a compromise (under section 3761 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1939 or section 7122 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954);
    (ii) The claim for refund or credit of overpayment shall be allowed 
only to the extent that the overpayment of income tax results from the 
recomputation of the terminal railroad corporation's taxable income in 
the manner described in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.281-2;
    (iii) The claim for refund or credit of the overpayment must have 
been filed prior to October 23, 1963;
    (iv) The claim for refund or credit of overpayment shall be allowed 
only to the extent that the manner in which the terminal railroad 
corporation's taxable income is recomputed is the manner in which the 
terminal railroad corporation's taxable income was computed on its 
timely filed income tax return for such taxable year; and
    (v) Each railroad corporation which was a shareholder of the 
terminal railroad corporation during such taxable year must consent in 
writing to the assessment, within such period as may be agreed upon with 
the district director, of any deficiency for any year (even though 
assessment of the deficiency would otherwise be prevented by the 
operation of any law or rule of law at the time of filing the consent) 
to the extent that:
    (A) The deficiency is attributable to the recomputation of the 
shareholder's taxable income in the manner described in paragraph (b) of 
Sec. 1.281-2, and
    (B) The deficiency results from the shareholder's allocable portion 
of the ``reduced amount'' (described in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.281-2) 
which gives rise to the refund or credit granted to the terminal 
railroad corporation under this subparagraph.
