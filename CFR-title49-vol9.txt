                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 2006), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 2001, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, or 1986-2000, published in 11 separate 
volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 2001, a ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    Properly approved incorporations by reference in this volume are 
listed in the Finding Aids at the end of this volume.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed in 
the Finding Aids of this volume as an approved incorporation by 
reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation 
containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find 
the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington DC 
20408, or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, 
and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

Sec. 1200.1  Financial statements released by carriers.

    Carriers desiring to do so may prepare and publish financial 
statements in reports to stockholders and others, except in reports to 
this Board, based on generally accepted accounting principles for which 
there is authoritative support, provided that any variance from this 
Board's prescribed accounting rules contained in such statements is 
clearly disclosed in footnotes to the statements.

[32 FR 20123, Dec. 20, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 1200.2  Adoption of generally accepted accounting principles issued by 

the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

    (a) Accounting Series Circulars. Following the release of a 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards by the FASB, and provided 
that the Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis, and Administration 
of the Board considers such standards appropriate for the Board's 
accounting regulations, the Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis, 
and Administration shall issue an Accounting Series Circular (ASC) 
requiring carriers under the Board's jurisdiction to follow the new 
standards in their accounts and reports filed with the Board. The Office 
shall also specify in the ASC the proper accounting procedures that the 
carriers shall follow.
    (b) Carriers' and Interested Parties' Comments on the ASC. The ASC 
issued by the Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis, and 
Administration will remain effective until revoked by the Office of 
Economics, Environmental Analysis, and Administration. After an ASC is 
issued, the Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis, and 
Administration shall allow carriers and interested parties 45 days 
following the service date of the ASC during which the respondents may 
submit to the Office their comments and reasons either supporting or 
opposing the ASC.
    (c) Formal Adoption of the New Accounting Standards. After 
considering the comments submitted in response to the ASC, and based on 
the proposal of the Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis, and 
Administration, the Board will decide whether or not to adopt the new 
accounting standards specified in the ASC by revising the Uniform 
Systems of Accounts, (49 CFR 1201 through 1210).
    (d) Accounting Standards Not Appropriate for Board's Use. The Office 
of Economics, Environmental Analysis, and Administration may determine 
that a new FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards is not 
appropriate for use by carriers under the Board's jurisdiction. In such 
instances, the Office shall issue an ASC to advise the carriers that the 
new standards shall not be used in their reports filed with the Board. 
The carriers and interested parties shall be allowed 45 days following 
the ASC's service date to submit comments to the Board. The Board will 
then determine whether or not to revise the Uniform Systems of Accounts 
to conform to the new accounting standards.

                    List of Instructions and Accounts


<R03>
REGULATIONS PRESCRIBED--Table of Contents

<R05>


    (i) Regulations prescribed. Carriers by railroad subject to 
provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and not independently operated 
as electric lines, and each lessor of such a carrier, shall comply with 
regulations in this part as presented hereinafter.
    (ii) Definitions.
    1. Abandonment means the withdrawal from transportation service of a 
branch line or other track segment or facility, representing a permanent 
reduction in plant.
    2. Accounts means the accounts prescribed in this system of 
accounts.
    3. Actually issued as applied to funded debt securities or capital 
stock issued or assumed by the company, means those which have been sold 
to bona fide purchasers or holders for a valuable consideration 
(including those issued in exchange for other securities or other 
property) and such purchasers or holders secured them free from control 
by the carriers. Also securities issued as dividends on stock.
    4. Actually outstanding as applied to funded debt securities or 
capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier means those which have 
been actually issued and are neither retired and canceled nor reacquired 
and held by or for the accounting company.
    5. (a) Affiliated companies means companies or persons that 
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries control, or 
are controlled by, or are under common control with, the accounting 
carrier.
    (b) Control (including the terms controlling, controlled by, and 
under common

[[Page 12]]

control with) means the possession directly or indirectly, of the power 
to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a 
company, whether such power is exercised through one or more 
intermediary companies, or alone, or in conjunction with, or pursuant to 
an agreement, and whether such power is established through a majority 
of minority ownership or voting of securities, common directors, 
officers or stockholders, voting trusts, holding trusts, associated 
companies, contract or any other direct or indirect means.
    6. Amortization means the gradual extinguishment of an amount in an 
account by distributing such amount over a fixed period dependent on the 
requirements of regulatory bodies, over the life of the asset or 
liability to which it applies, or over the period during which it is 
anticipated the benefit will be realized.
    7. Carrier as used herein and when not otherwise indicated in the 
context means any carrier to which this system of accounts is 
applicable.
    8. Consolidation means the formation of a new company. See 
instruction 2-15.
    9. Board means the Surface Transportation Board.
    10. Compensating balance means the portion of any demand deposit (or 
any time deposit or certificate of deposit) maintained by a carrier (or 
by any person on behalf of the carrier) which constitutes support for 
existing borrowing arrangements of the carrier with a lending 
institution. Such arrangements include both outstanding borrowings and 
the assurance of future credit availability. (The compensating balance 
requirement should be adjusted by the amount of float unless such 
adjustment would cause the compensating balance to be greater than the 
cash balance per carrier's books.) The float adjustment is made by 
subtracting the float from the compensating balance requirement if the 
collected bank ledger balance exceeds the cash balance per carrier's 
books or by adding the float to the compensating balance requirement if 
the collected bank ledger balance is less than the cash balance per 
carrier's books.
    (a) Float means deposits and withdrawals in transit which constitute 
a difference between the collected bank ledger balance and the cash 
balance per carrier's books.
    11. Cost center refers to an organizational subdivision for which 
cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate 
costs such as a terminal, yard, or track segment. A cost center may 
correspond to a given area of responsibility for which costs are 
presently accumulated for planning and control. A cost center is the 
smallest segment of activity or area of responsibility for which costs 
are accumulated and directly traceable.
    12. Cost of renewal means the cost of additional material applied 
(other than the value assigned second-hand parts remaining in the 
rebuilt unit) plus the cost of labor used in the rebuilding process, 
exclusive of the portion applicable to dismantling and repair of old 
parts reused.
    13. Cost of removal means cost of demolishing, dismantling, tearing 
down or otherwise removing property.
    14. Debt issue cost means all costs in connection with the issuance 
and sale of evidences of debt, such as fees for drafting mortgages and 
trust deeds; fees for issuing or recording evidences of debt; cost of 
engraving and printing bonds and certificates of indebtedness; fees paid 
trustees, specific costs of obtaining governmental authority; fees for 
legal services; fees and commissions paid underwriters, brokers and 
salespeople for marketing such evidences for debt; fees and costs of 
listing on exchanges; and other like costs.
    15. Discount as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock 
issued or assumed by the carrier, means the excess of the par or face 
value of the securities plus interest or dividends accrued at the date 
of the sale over the cash value of the consideration received from their 
sale.
    16. Equity security encompasses any instrument representing 
ownership shares (e.g., common, preferred and other capital stock), or 
the right to acquire (e.g., warrants, rights, and call options) or 
dispose of (e.g., put options) ownership shares in an enterprise at 
fixed or determinable prices. The term does not encompass preferred 
stock that by its terms either must be redeemed by the issuing 
enterprise or is

[[Page 13]]

redeemable at the option of the investor, nor does it include treasury 
stock or convertible bonds.
    (a) Marketable, as applied to an equity security, means an equity 
security as to which sales prices or bid and ask prices are currently 
available on a national securities exchange (i.e., those registered with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission) or in the over-the-counter 
market. In the over-the-counter market, an equity security shall be 
considered marketable when a quotation is publicly reported by the 
National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotations System 
or by the National Quotations Bureau, Inc. (provided, in the latter 
case, that quotations are available from at least three dealers). Equity 
securities traded in foreign markets shall be considered marketable when 
such markets are of a breadth and scope comparable to those referred to 
above. This definition is not met by restricted stock (securities for 
which sale is restricted by a governmental or contractual requirement 
except where such requirement terminates within one year or where the 
holder has the power to cause the requirement to be met within one 
year). Any portion of the stock which can reasonably be expected to 
qualify for sale within one year, such as may be the case under Rule 144 
or similar rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is not 
considered restricted.
    (b) Market value refers to the aggregate of the market price of a 
single share or unit times the number of shares or units of each 
marketable equity security in the portfolio. When an equity has taken 
positions involving short sales, sales of calls, and purchases of puts 
for marketable equity securities and the same securities are included in 
the portfolio, those contracts shall be taken into consideration in the 
determination of market value of the marketable equity securities.
    (c) Cost, as applied to a marketable equity security, refers to the 
original cost unless a new cost basis has been assigned based on 
recognition of an impairment of value that was deemed other than 
temporary or as the result of a transfer between current and noncurrent 
classifications. In such cases, the new cost basis assigned shall be 
considered cost.
    17. (a) Income taxes means taxes based on income determined under 
provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code and foreign, state 
and other taxes (including franchise taxes) based on income.
    (b) Income tax expense means the amount of income taxes (whether or 
not currently payable or refundable) allocable to a period in the 
determination of net income.
    (c) Pretax accounting income means income or loss for a period, 
exclusive of related income tax expense.
    (d) Taxable income means the excess of revenues over deductions or 
the excess of deductions over revenue to be reported for income tax 
purposes for a period.
    (e) Timing differences means differences between the periods in 
which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they 
enter into the determination of pretax accounting income. Timing 
differences originate in one period and reverse or turn around in one or 
more subsequent periods. Some timing differences reduce income taxes 
that would otherwise be payable currently; others increase income taxes 
that would otherwise be payable currently.
    (f) Permanent differences means differences between taxable income 
and pretax accounting income arising from transactions that, under 
applicable tax laws and regulations, will not be offset by corresponding 
differences or turn around in other periods.
    (g) Tax effects means differentials in income taxes of a period 
attributable to (1) revenue or expense transactions which enter into the 
determination of pretax accounting income in one period and into the 
determination of taxable income in another period, (2) deductions or 
credits that may be carried backward or forward for income tax purposes 
and (3) adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to other 
stockholders' equity accounts which enter into the determination of 
taxable income in a period but which do not enter into the determination 
of pretax accounting income of that period. A permanent difference does 
not result in

[[Page 14]]

a tax effect as that term is used in this definition.
    (h) Deferred taxes means tax effects which are deferred for 
allocation to income tax expense of future periods.
    (i) Interperiod tax allocation means the process of apportioning 
income taxes among periods.
    (j) Tax allocation within a period means the process of apportioning 
income tax expenses applicable to a given period between income before 
extraordinary items and extraordinary items, and of associating the 
income tax effects of adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to 
other stockholders' equity accounts with these items.
    18. (a) Investor means a business entity that holds an investment in 
voting stock of another company.
    (b) Investee means a corporation that issued voting stock held by an 
investor.
    (c) Corporate joint venture is a company owned and operated as a 
separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the 
members of the group. Joint facilities for purposes of this system of 
accounts are not considered corporate joint ventures.
    (d) Dividends when applied to distributions received from investees 
unless otherwise specified, means dividends received or receivable in 
cash, other assets, or another class of stock and does not include stock 
dividends or stock splits.
    (e) Earnings or losses of an investee and financial position of an 
investee refer to net income (or net loss) and financial position of an 
investee determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles.
    (f) Undistributed earnings of an investee means net income less 
dividends declared whether received or not.
    (g) Date of acquisition is the date on which the investor assumes 
the rights of ownership. Ordinarily, this is the date assets are 
received and other assets are given or securities issued.
    19. Joint facility means any owned or leased carrier operating 
property occupied or operated jointly by the carrier and one or more 
other carriers, under an arrangement whereby the cost and income are 
apportioned to the parties to the joint agreement. Portions of a 
structure or other property used exclusively by each of two or more 
carriers are not joint facilities.
    20. Ledger value of an account means the undepreciated or 
unamortized cost of acquisition of the item to the carrier, recorded in 
the general ledger. In case the cost of any item of property is not 
shown separately in the ledger, the ledger value of that item shall be 
its proportionate share of the value of the entire group in which the 
particular property is included.
    21. Merger means the acquisition of one company by another. See 
instruction 2-15.
    22. Minor items of property means the associated parts or items of 
which units of property are composed.
    23. Net railway operating income: Operating revenue remaining after 
deducting operating expenses, income taxes on ordinary income, and the 
provision for deferred income taxes. Also, in arriving at NROI, deduct 
the Income from Lease of Road and Equipment and add the Rent for Leased 
Road and Equipment, formerly accounts 509 and 542, respectively.
    24. Net salvage value means salvage value of property retired less 
the cost of removal.
    25. Nominally issued as applied to funded debt securities or capital 
stock issued or assumed by the carrier, means those which have been 
signed, certified by trustees, or otherwise executed, and placed with 
the proper officer for sale and delivery, or pledged, or otherwise 
placed in some special fund of the accounting company, but which have 
not been sold or issued directly to the trustees of such fund in 
accordance with contractual requirements.
    26. Nominally outstanding as applied to funded debt securities or 
capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier, means those which, after 
being actually issued, have been reacquired by or for the accounting 
company under such circumstances which require them to be considered as 
held alive and not retired and canceled.
    27. Premium as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock 
issued or assumed by the carrier, means the excess of the cash value of 
the consideration received from their sale over the sum of their par 
(stated value of no par

[[Page 15]]

stock) or face value and interest or dividends accrued at the date of 
sale.
    28. Programmed track replacements are costs incurred as part of a 
track replacement program or planned expenditures. Programmed track 
replacements are generally performed by relatively large work gangs 
which, on the basis of programmed and authorized work orders, use heavy 
mechanized equipment to replace rail, ties and other track material. For 
guidance on what not to capitalize, see the notes to the text of 
Accounts 8, 9 and 11.
    29. Property retired means units of property which have been 
removed, sold, abandoned, destroyed, or which for any cause have been 
permanently withdrawn from service; also minor items of property not 
replaced.
    30. Rail Transportation Property. Rail transportation property is 
all property and other assets, irrespective of ownership, that comprise 
the entire operating unit devoted to rail transportation service. This 
definition comprises the following accounts:

701 Cash
703 Special deposits
704 Loans and notes receivable
705 Accounts receivable--interline and other balances
706 Accounts receivable--customers
707 Accounts receivable--other
708.5 Receivable with affiliated companies
709 Accrued accounts receivable
710 Working funds
711 Prepayments
712 Material and supplies
713 Other current assets
714 Deferred income tax charges
731 Road and equipment property
732 Improvements on leased property

    31. Salvage value means the amount received from the sale of 
operating property retired less any expenses in connection with the sale 
or in preparing the property for sale. If the property is retained for 
reuse, the salvage value shall be recorded in account 712, Materials and 
Supplies, or other appropriate account at an amount not to exceed its 
recorded cost (actual or average), or current market value, whichever is 
lower.
    32. Segment of a business refers to a component of an entity whose 
activities represent a separate major line of business or class of 
customer. A segment may be in the form of a subsidiary, a division, or a 
department, and in some cases a joint venture or other non-subsidiary 
investee, provided that its assets, results of operations, and 
activities can be clearly distinguished, physically and operationally 
and for financial reporting purposes, from the other assets, results of 
operations, and activities of the entity. The fact that the results of 
operations of the segment being sold or abandoned cannot be separately 
identified strongly suggests that the transaction should not be 
classified as a disposal of a segment of business.
    (a) Measurement date means the date on which the management having 
authority to approve the action commits itself to a formal plan to 
dispose of a segment of the business, whether by abandonment or sale. 
The measurement date for disposals requiring Commission approval shall 
be the service date of the Order authorizing the disposal.
    (b) Disposal date refers to the date of closing the sale, if the 
disposal is by sale or the date that operations cease if the disposal is 
by abandonment.
    33. Service life means the period between the date when operating 
property is placed in service and the date of its retirement.
    34. Service value means the ledger value of operating property less 
its salvage value (see definition 17).
    35. Track maintenance is material and labor costs of routine track 
repairs such as sporadic tie replacement, repair of broken rails, 
tightening track bolts and track spikes. A more complete list of 
maintenance items are included in notes to the text of Accounts 8, 9 and 
11.
    36. Work equipment means equipment which can be coupled in a train 
for movement over the carrier's tracks, and which is used in the 
carrier's work service. See equipment listing for account 57, Work 
equipment.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    1-1 Classification of carriers. (a) For purposes of accounting and 
reporting, carriers are grouped into the following three classes:
    Class I: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $250 
million or more after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula 
shown in Note A.
    Class II: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of less 
than $250 million but in excess of $20 million after applying the 
railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.
    Class III: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $20 
million or less after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula 
shown in Note A.
    (b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by 
annual carrier operating revenues after the railroad revenue deflator 
adjustment. Families of railroads operating within the United States as 
a single, integrated rail system will be treated as a single carrier for 
classification purposes. Upward and downward reclassification will be 
effected as of January 1 in the year immediately following the third 
consecutive year of revenue qualification.
    (2) If a Class II or Class III carrier's classification is changed 
based on three years' adjusted revenues the carrier shall complete and 
file the Classification Index Survey Form with the Board by March 31 of 
the year following the end of the period to which it relates.
    (3) Newly organized carriers shall be classified on the basis of 
their annual carrier operating revenues after railroad revenue deflator 
adjustment for the latest period of operation. If actual data are not 
available, new carriers shall be classified on the basis of their 
carrier operating revenues known and estimated for a year (after 
railroad revenue deflator adjustment).
    (4) When a business combination occurs, such as a merger, 
reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be 
reclassified effective January 1 of the next calendar year on the basis 
of the combined revenue for the year when the combination occurred 
(after railroad revenue deflator adjustment).
    (5) In unusual circumstances, such as partial liquidation and 
curtailment or elimination of contracted services, where regulations 
will unduly burden the carrier, the carrier may request the Board for an 
exception to the regulations. This request shall be in writing 
specifying the conditions justifying an exception.
    (c) Class I carriers shall keep all of the accounts of this system 
which are applicable to their operations. Class II and III carriers are 
not required to maintain the accounts of this system.
    (d) All switching and terminal companies, regardless of their 
operating revenues will be designated Class III carriers.
    (e) Unless provided for otherwise, all electric railway carriers, 
regardless of operating revenues, will be designated Class III carriers.

    Note A: The railroad revenue deflator formula is based on the 
Railroad Freight Price Index developed by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. The formula is as follows:

Current Year's Revenues x (1991 Average Index/Current Year's Average 
Index)
    Note B: See related regulations 49 CFR 1241.15 Railroad 
classification survey form.

[57 FR 27185, June 18, 1992; 57 FR 31754, July 17, 1992; 66 FR 56245, 
Nov. 7, 2001; 67 FR 57533, Sept. 11, 2002]

    1-2 Classification of accounts. (a) Accounts are prescribed to cover 
cost of property used in transportation operations and operations 
incidental thereto and for revenues, expenses, taxes, rents, and other 
items of income for such operations. Separate accounts are prescribed 
for investment in property not used in transportation operations and for 
other investments and income therefrom; for unusual and infrequent 
items; for operations and disposal of discontinued segments; for 
extraordinary items and accounting changes; and for assets, liabilities 
and capital includable in the balance sheet statement. Retained earnings 
accounts form the connecting link between the income account and the 
equity section of the balance sheet. They are provided to record the 
transfer of net income or loss for the year; certain capital 
transactions; and, when authorized by the Board, other items.
    (b) The cost of property, and the revenues, expenses, taxes and 
rents for miscellaneous operations involving the

[[Page 17]]

use of such facilities as hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, storage 
warehouses, power plants, cold storage plants, etc., shall not be 
included in the accounts prescribed for transportation operations unless 
the operation of the facilities is conducted by the railway companies in 
connection with furnishing transportation services. Likewise, the cost 
of property, the revenues, expenses, taxes, and rents arising from the 
operation of stockyards shall not be included in accounts prescribed for 
transportation operations unless operation of the facilities is 
conducted in connection with transportation of livestock. It is not 
intended that cost of property and income arising from incidental public 
stockyards service rendered by stockyards primarily devoted to 
transportation services shall be excluded from transportation operation 
accounts.
    (c) Joint facility accounts are provided for the joint users of 
tracks, bridges, yards, wharves, stations, and other facilities in which 
to record items in settlement for use of such facilities. When the 
compensation for the use of facilities is a fixed amount or is based 
upon a charge per passenger, ton, car or other unit, the amount shall be 
fairly apportioned by the operating company among the joint facility 
operating expense and income accounts. The creditor shall show the 
distribution of these charges upon its bills, and such distribution 
shall be adhered to by the debtor. Train service in connection with the 
line haul of traffic, including that operated under a joint arrangement 
for the benefit of two or more carriers, is not considered a joint 
facility operation.
    (d)(1) Extraordinary Items. All items of profit and loss recognized 
during the year are includable in ordinary income unless evidence 
clearly supports their classification as extraordinary items.
    Extraordinary items are characterized by both their unusual nature 
and infrequent occurrence taking into account the environment in which 
the firm operates; they must also meet the materiality standard.
    Unusual means the event or transaction must possess a high degree of 
abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally 
related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity.
    Infrequent occurrence means the event or transaction shall be of a 
type not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future.
    (2) Unusual or Infrequent Items. Material events unusual in nature 
or infrequent in occurrence but not both, thus not meeting both criteria 
for classification as extraordinary, shall be includable in the accounts 
provided as separate components of income/expense from continuing 
operations.
    (3) Discontinued Operations. The results of continuing operations 
shall be reported separately from discontinued operations and any gain 
or loss resulting from disposal of a segment of a business (see 
definition 23(a)) shall be reported in conjunction with the related 
results of discontinued operations and not as an extraordinary item. The 
disposal of a segment of a business shall be distinguished from other 
disposals of assets incident to the evolution of the entity's business, 
such as the disposal of part of a line of business, the shifting of 
production or marketing activities for a particular line of business 
from one location to another, the phasing out of a product line or class 
of service, and other changes occasioned by technological improvements. 
If a loss is expected from the proposed sale or abandonment of a 
segment, the estimated loss shall be provided for at the measurement 
date (see definition 23(b)). If a gain is expected, it shall be 
recognized when realized, which ordinarily is the disposal date (see 
definition 23(c)).
    (4) Prior period adjustments. Only the following two items of profit 
and loss shall be accounted for and reported as prior period adjustments 
and excluded from the determination of net income for the current 
period:
    (1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior 
period, and
    (2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits 
of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased 
subsidiaries.
    With the exception of the two items just mentioned, all items of 
profit and loss recognized during a period shall be

[[Page 18]]

included in the determination of net income for that period.
    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules is needed or obtain an 
interpretation from its public accountant or the Board.
    (5) Accounting Changes. Errors in financial statements result from 
mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting 
principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the 
financial statements were prepared. In contrast, a change in an 
accounting estimate results from new information or subsequent 
developments and from better insight or judgment. Correction of an error 
should be accomplished through a prior period adjustment [See 
Instruction 1-2(d)(4)]. Changes in an accounting estimate should be 
accounted for in the period of change (and future period if the change 
affects both)(See Instruction 1-7). A change in an accounting principle 
or accounting entity should be referred to this Board for approval. The 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should ordinarily 
be reflected in the account provided for in determining net income.
    (6) Materiality. As a general standard an item shall be considered 
material when it exceeds 10 percent of annual income (loss) before 
extraordinary items. An item may also be considered in relation to the 
trend of annual earnings before extraordinary items or other appropriate 
criteria. Items shall be considered individually and not in the 
aggregate in determining materiality. However, the effects of a series 
of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable 
event or plan of action shall be aggregated to determine materiality.
    (7) Board Approval and Accountant's Letter. Items shall be included 
in the accounts provided for extraordinary items, unusual or infrequent 
items, discontinued operations, prior period adjustments and cumulative 
effect of changes in accounting principles only upon approval of the 
Board. If the carrier retains the service of an independent accountant, 
a request for using these accounts shall be accompanied by a letter from 
the independent accountant approving or otherwise commenting on the 
request.
    Note: The carrier may refer to generally accepted accounting 
principles for further guidance in applying paragraph (d) above.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977 as amended at 43 FR 37455, Aug. 23, 1978; 52 
FR 4321, 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-3 Records. (a) Each carrier shall keep its books of account, and 
all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in 
such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full 
information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be 
supported by such detailed information as will permit ready 
identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant 
thereto.
    (b) All expenditures including the expense accounts of officers and 
employees shall be supported by vouchers, payrolls, receipted bills, 
canceled checks, receipts for petty cash payments, or other evidences of 
the expenditures incurred.
    (c) The books referred to herein include not only books of accounts 
in a limited technical sense but all other records such as minute books, 
stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which will be 
useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.
    (d) No carrier shall destroy any books, records, memoranda, etc., 
which support entries to its accounts unless destruction is permitted by 
the regulations governing preservation of records, Part 1220 of this 
chapter.
    (e) In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary 
accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts may be kept, provided the 
integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
    (f) Cost detail shall be maintained by cost centers for purposes of 
cost assignments effective 1-1-79. This provides for cost control and 
cost planning at any designated area of responsibility. These cost 
centers shall be similarly defined as the railroads' existing 
responsibility centers. Cost center information shall therefore be kept 
at the same level of detail presently collected, categorized, and 
maintained in railroad internal managerial accounting systems. This 
detailed information shall not be reported to the Board on an ongoing 
basis. However, the carrier shall keep

[[Page 19]]

the detailed information to provide a ready analysis and verification of 
the costs collected by cost center.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987; 61 
FR 9113, Mar. 7, 1996]

    1-4 Accounting period. (a) Each carrier shall keep its books on a 
monthly basis so that known transactions, as nearly as may be 
ascertained, shall be entered in the accounts not later than 60 days 
after the last day of the period for which the accounts are stated, 
except that the time within which the final entries for the year ending 
December 31 shall be made may be extended to such date in the following 
March as shall not interfere with the preparation and filing of annual 
report.
    (b) A trial balance of the general ledger accounts shall be prepared 
at the close of each month setting out the account number, title, and 
amount of each ledger account. (Mechanical, electronic or automatic data 
processing printout documentation producing the equivalent of manually 
prepared trial balances shall identify balances by account numbers.) At 
the end of the calendar year, the revenue, expense, and other income 
accounts shall be closed into retained earnings account, and the balance 
sheet account balances shall be brought forward to the general ledger 
for the succeeding year.
    (c) No changes shall be made in the accounts for periods covered by 
quarterly and annual reports that have been filed with the Board unless 
the changes have first been authorized by the Board.
    1-5 Accrual method of accounting. The accounting for operating 
revenues, operating expenses, income and other items each month and year 
shall be, as nearly as practicable, upon the basis of accruals 
consistently applied. Any change in practice of accounting for accruals 
or any unusual accruals involving material amounts shall be reported 
promptly to the Board.

    1-6 Charges to be just and reasonable. All charges to the accounts 
prescribed in this system of accounts for carrier property, operating 
revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, and other carrier 
expenses, shall be just, reasonable and not exceed amounts necessary to 
the honest and efficient operation and management of carrier business. 
Payments shall not exceed the fair market value of goods and services 
acquired in an arm's length transaction. Any payments in excess of such 
just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 551, 
Miscellaneous income charges.
    1-7 Changes in accounting estimates. Changes in accounting estimate 
arising during the current year which are applicable to prior years 
shall be included in the same account which would have been charged or 
credited if the item had been taken up or the adjustment made in the 
year to which it pertained. [See Instruction 1-2(d)(5) for Accounting 
Changes].

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-8 Accounting for computer systems and word processing costs. (a) 
Capitalized costs for computer systems and word processing equipment 
shall be charged to property account 59, when such costs are not 
dedicated to a particular function (See Account 59). Related 
depreciation expenses for capitalized costs shall be charged to account 
62-23-00, Depreciation, Other Equipment.
    (b) Repair and maintenance costs related to computer systems and 
word processing equipment shall be charged to function 46 of the Other 
equipment subactivity by appropriate natural expense (labor, material, 
purchased services, other). Repairs performed by an outside company 
shall be charged to operating expense account 39-23-46.
    (c) Operating costs related to computer systems and word processing 
equipment shall be charged to function 87, Management services and data 
and word processing, when the equipment benefits more than one activity. 
When the equipment benefits one activity only, such operating costs 
shall be charged to the activity/function benefited.

[52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-9 Transactions with affiliated companies. (a) The records and 
supporting data of all transactions with affiliated companies shall be 
maintained in a separate file. The types of transactions referred to in 
this paragraph are for management services or any other type

[[Page 20]]

of services rendered, sale or use of facilities or any other type of 
assets or property. The file shall be maintained so as to enable the 
carrier, upon a Board request, to furnish accurate information with 
supporting documentation about particular transactions within 15 days of 
the request. We do not intend the file to include data relating to 
ordinary carrier operations (e.g. lawful tariff charges or interchange 
of equipment).
    (b) Each bill rendered by an affiliated company shall state 
specifically the basis used for determining charges, unless the file 
contains the information to support the specific basis for charges.
    (c) Punched cards, magnetic tapes, discs, or other machine-sensible 
devices used for recording, consolidating, and summarizing accounting 
transactions and records with a carrier's electronic or automatic data 
processing system may constitute a file within the meaning of this 
instruction.
    (d) The carrier shall record, as the cost of assets or services 
received from an affiliated supplier, the invoice price (plus any 
incidental costs related to those transactions) in those cases where the 
invoice price can be determined from a prevailing price list of the 
affiliated supplier available to the general public in the normal course 
of business. If no such price list exists, the charges shall be recorded 
at the lower of their cost to the originating affiliated supplier (less 
all applicable valuation reserves in case of asset sales, or their 
estimated fair market value determined on the basis of a representative 
study of similar competitive and arm's-length or bargained transaction. 
Any difference between actual transaction price and the above, as well 
as charges that are not transportation related, shall be considered of a 
financing nature and shall be recorded, accordingly, as nonoperating 
charges or credits. (See instruction 1-6.)
    (e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as restraining the 
carrier from subdividing accounts (see instruction I-3(e)) for the 
purpose of recording separately transactions with affiliated companies.
    (f) Carriers reporting information on a consolidated or combined 
basis in railroad Annual Report Form R-1 shall maintain a file with 
appropriate records and supporting data. This shall include work sheets 
showing revenues, expenses, earnings, investment in assets and 
accumulated depreciation for all affiliated railroads and rail-related 
affiliated companies. The work sheets shall also disclose any 
eliminations. Carriers shall also disclose the methodology used to 
support segregation of rail-related or other items as appropriate. 
Further, a file shall be maintained to support and reconcile entity 
sales, transfers and reclassifications as well as taxes deducted from 
gains or losses.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 53 FR 46620, Nov. 18, 1988]

    1-10 Accounting for income taxes. (a) The interperiod tax allocation 
method of accounting shall be applied where material timing differences 
(see definition 17(e)) occur between pretax accounting income and 
taxable income. Carriers may elect, as provided by the Revenue Act of 
1971, to account for the investment tax credit by either the flow 
through method or the deferred method of accounting. See paragraphs (d) 
and (e) below. All income taxes (Federal, state and other) currently 
accruable for income tax return purposes shall be charged to account 
556, Income taxes on ordinary income, and account 590, Income Taxes on 
Extraordinary Items, as applicable.
    (b) Under the interperiod tax allocation method of accounting the 
tax effect of timing differences (see definition 17) originating in the 
current accounting period are allocated to income tax expense of future 
periods when the timing differences reverse. Similar timing differences 
originating and reversing in the current accounting period should be 
combined into groups and the current tax rates applied to determine the 
tax effect of each group. A carrier shall not apply other than current 
tax rates in determining the tax effect of reversing differences except 
upon approval of the Board. When determining the amount

[[Page 21]]

of deferred taxes, rather than computing state and other taxes 
individually by jurisdiction, the Federal income tax rate may be 
increased by a percent equivalent to the effect of taxes imposed by the 
jurisdictions. In classifying a deferred charge or credit as current or 
noncurrent a carrier shall follow the classification criteria used for 
the related asset or liability which caused the timing difference. A 
deferred charge or credit that is not related to an asset or liability 
because (a) there is no associated asset or liability or (b) reduction 
of an associated asset or liability will not cause the timing difference 
to reverse shall be classified based on the expected reversal date of 
the specific timing difference. Such classification disregards any 
additional timing differences that may arise and is based on the 
criteria used for classifying other assets and liabilities.
    (c) The future tax benefits of loss carryforwards shall normally be 
recognized in the year in which such loss is applied to reduce taxes. 
Only in those unusual instances when realization is assured beyond any 
reasonable doubt should the future tax benefits of loss carryforwards be 
recognized in the year of loss. The tax effects of any realizable loss 
carrybacks shall be recognized in the determination of net income (loss) 
of the loss periods; appropriate adjustments of existing net deferred 
tax credits may also be necessary in the loss period.
    (d) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by 
the flow through method shall credit account 556 Income taxes on 
ordinary income, or account 590, Income taxes on extraordinary items, as 
applicable, and charge account 760, Federal income taxes accrued, with 
the amount of investment tax credit utilized in the current accounting 
period. When the flow through method is followed for the investment tax 
credit, account 557, Provision for Deferred Taxes, shall reflect the 
difference between the tax payable (after recognition of allowable 
investment tax credit) based on taxable income and tax expense (with 
full recognition of investment tax credit that would be allowable based 
on accounting income) based on accounting income.
    (e) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by 
the deferred method shall concurrently with making the entries 
prescribed in (d) above charge account 557, Provision for deferred 
taxes, or account 591, Provision for deferred taxes--extraordinary item, 
as applicable, and shall credit account 786, Accumulated deferred income 
tax credits, with the investment tax credit utilized as a reduction of 
the current year's tax liability but deferred for accounting purposes. 
The investment tax credit so deferred shall be amortized by credits to 
account 557, Provision for deferred taxes.

    Note A: Any change in practice of accounting for the investment tax 
credit shall be reported promptly to the Board. Carriers desiring to 
clear deferred investment tax credits because of a change from the 
deferral method to the flow though method shall submit the proposed 
journal entry to the Board for consideration and advice.
    Note B: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the accounting rules for income 
taxes is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant 
or the Board.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 47 FR 12350, Mar. 23, 1982; 52 
FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987; 67 FR 57533, Sept. 11, 2002]

    1-11 Items in texts of accounts. The items appearing in the texts of 
the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly 
indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The items are 
intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an 
item in the text of a primary account warrants the inclusion of the item 
in the account mentioned only when the whole text also indicates 
inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one 
primary account. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by 
the entire text of each primary account.
    1-12 Distribution of pay and expenses of employees. (a) The pay and 
expenses of officers or employees regularly assigned to specific duties 
who perform incidental services of a different nature

[[Page 22]]

involving small expense may be included in the appropriate expense 
accounts for the duties to which such officers or employees are 
regularly assigned.
    (b) When it is necessary to apportion the pay of officers and 
employees among various accounts, the carrier shall apportion the pay on 
the basis of the directly assignable pay to the various accounts.

    1-13 Payroll related expenses. (a) Fringe benefits (account series 
12-00-00) distributed to the activities using one of the following 
techniques (in order of preference):
    (1) Apply appropriate factors to the total of the fringe expense 
account, in such a way as to distribute an equitable proportion of cost 
to each activity. These factors shall be developed to take into account 
variables such as the following:
    (i) The effect of seniority on the expense. For example, profit 
sharing or pensions may be available to only certain categories of 
employees, which may be more predominant in one activity than another.
    (ii) The effect of the type of work performed. For example, 
workmen's compensation expense may vary for each category of employees 
because of the rate charged or the claims experience of the category.
    (iii) Any other variable which may have an appreciable effect on the 
equity of the apportionment.
    (2) Distribute the amount in the same proportion as the pay charged 
to each activity in account series 11-00-00 (salaries and wages).
    (3) Distribute the amounts using any other equitable basis which the 
carrier can substantiate.
    (b) All carriers shall be prepared to describe the basis of 
apportionment used to distribute expenses included in this instruction.
    (c) Any carrier which finds it impracticable to distribute expenses 
as required by this instruction should furnish the Board with full 
particulars of the conditions which prevent the proper distribution. 
Upon receipt of such information carrier will be advised of the 
procedure to be followed.

    1-14 Submission of questions. To maintain uniformity of accounting, 
carriers shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Board 
for consideration and decision.

or municipal government transfers cash or other assets to a railroad, 
the transaction shall be accounted for in accordance with the provisions 
set forth hereunder.
    (a) The following forms of government transfers shall be included in 
account 502, Railway Operating Revenues--Transfers from Government 
Authorities for Current Operations when received:
    (1) Payments as reimbursement for operating losses sustained on a

    (b) Government transfers relating to the acquisition, addition to, 
or improvement of depreciable operating property shall be included in 
account 783, Deferred Revenues--Transfers from Government Authorities 
when received. Account 783 shall be periodically charged, and account 
503, Railway Operating Revenues--Amortization of Deferred Transfers from 
Government Authorities shall be credited with amounts equal to the 
depreciation costs of the assets to which they apply.
    (c) Government transfers in the form of, or designated for the 
purchase of nondepreciable operating property shall be included in 
account 796, Other Capital Surplus in the manner described in the text 
of that account.
    (d)(1) Transfers from the Federal Government to Amtrak and ConRail 
relating to the acquisitions, addition to, or improvement of depreciable

accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) The provisions of this section do not apply to the following 
forms of government transfers:
    (1) Government contributions in connection with construction 
projects in which government agencies and railroads participate. 
Transfers of this type shall be accounted for in accordance with the 
provisions of instruction 2-17. Paragraph (b) of that instruction lists 
applicable construction projects.
    (2) Government payment for specific services rendered by the carrier 
in transporting property or persons by rail line other than services

    1-16 Business entertainment expenses. (a) Business entertainment 
expenses are to be accounted for as operating expenses when incurred in 
conjunction with sales or marketing related activities. Sales or 
marketing related activities are those that emphasize a carrier's 
ability to provide efficient, timely and competitive service. These 
activities include outlays designed to promote new business as well as 
outlays incurred in maintaining existing business. The entertainment 
expenditures must be reasonable in relation to the business conducted 
and the business purpose for the entertainment must be adequately 
supported. Examples of this type of activity include the following:
    (1) Salespersons' salaries and travel expenses, advertising, 
promotional and educational material;
    (2) The conduct of shipper symposiums, conferences, meetings and 
traffic related functions;
    (3) The use of direct mail solicitations and the publication and 
distribution of routing guides and service directories;
    (4) Incidental promotional materials such as road atlases, 
calendars, pens, scratchpads, and other materials of nominal value;
    (5) The conduct of business oriented lunches and dinners, public 
affairs programming, conferences and customer service calls;
    (6) Sponsoring sales promotion functions, involving a number of 
customers or potential customers.

It must be noted that an activity listed above is not to be 
automatically accounted for as an operating expense. A carrier must be 
able to justify that an activity was primarily sales or marketing 
related.
    (b) Business entertainment expenses are to be accounted for as non-
operating expenses when they cannot be shown to be related to the sales 
or marketing activity. These are expenses that are primarily related to 
recreation or to the convenience and comfort of the individuals rather 
than to the transaction of business. Examples of this type of activity 
include the following:
    (1) Recreational or resort entertainment, including but not limited 
to, fishing, hunting, tennis, golfing, skiing or other sporting or 
recreational trips or outings;
    (2) Expense paid transportation in any carrier owned, leased or 
furnished vehicles, planes, helicopters, boats, yachts, or other 
methods;
    (3) Expense paid lodging in any carrier owned, leased or furnished 
motels, hotels, apartments, condominiums, lodges, rooms and other places 
of overnight accommodation;
    (4) Paid admission to any sporting, cultural, educational, 
recreational, or entertaining occurrence or event;

[[Page 24]]

    (5) Gifts such as athletic equipment, food or liquor, beverages of 
all types, smoking materials, clothing and personal accessories;
    (6) The furnishing of lunches, dinners, appetizers or beverages 
where there is no true business purpose;
    (7) Social occasions such as holiday parties.

It must be noted that an activity listed above is not to be 
automatically accounted for as a non-operating expense. If a carrier can 
justify that the activity was primarily sales or marketing related, it 
may be accounted for as an operating expense.

    Note: The examples listed above are not inclusive, but are intended 
as a guide to give carriers an indication of what will or will not be 
permitted to be recovered through the rate structure. In all instances 
the burden of proof will fall on the carrier involved.

    1-17 Disclosure guideline. In addition to the accounting policies 
presented in these regulations, all disclosures relating to APB Opinions 
and FASB Statements adopted by the Board are required.

[52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]
    1-18 Distribution of expenses for material, tools, fuel, lubricants, 
purchased services and general. (a) These expenses shall be assigned 
directly to activities based on usage whenever possible.
    (b) When it is necessary to apportion these expenses to two or more 
activities they shall be equitably apportioned only to the activities in 
which they are actually used or to the activities they support.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPERTY ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    2-1 Items to be charged. (a) To the road and equipment property 
accounts shall be charged the cost of purchasing land, the cost of 
purchasing and constructing buildings, facilities and equipment, and the 
cost of additions and betterments to property, Cost means the amount of 
cash disbursed, or the fair value of other assets distributed, or the 
present value of amounts to be paid. Where the fair market value of 
resources given up (assets, services or items of stockholder's equity) 
is not clearly determinable, the cost may be determined by the fair 
market value of the resources acquired. The carrier shall be prepared to 
furnish the Board with the particulars of its method of determining cash 
value when the consideration is other than monetary. The amount of 
liabilities incurred with suppliers in the normal course of business, 
which are due in customary trade terms not exceeding approximately one 
year, shall be recorded at the maturity value. Acquisition date is the 
date title passes to the carrier.
    (b) The cost of road and equipment purchased under a plan involving 
other deferred payments (debt or capital lease) shall be recorded at the 
discounted present value of the payment, net of executory costs such as 
insurance, maintenance, and taxes. The interest rate used to discount 
the payments should be the prevailing market rate for similar debt 
instruments of issues with similar credit ratings. In any event, the 
rate used for valuation purposes will normally be at least equal to the 
rate at which the carrier can obtain financing of a similar nature from 
other sources at the date of the transaction (the carrier's incremental 
borrowing rate). In the case of a capital lease, when it is practical to 
ascertain the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and that rate is 
less than the carrier's incremental borrowing rate, the carrier should 
use the implicit rate. Acquisition date for a capital lease is the date 
the lease agreement is signed. If the property covered by the lease has 
yet to be constructed or has not been acquired by the lessor at the date 
the lease agreement or commitment is signed, the acquisition date shall 
be the date the property under construction is completed or the date the 
property not yet acquired is acquired by the lessor. (See Instruction 2-
20.)
    (c) Where actually incurred, interest cost is to be added to the 
cost of road and equipment deemed qualifying assets during the period of 
time required to get them ready for their intended use (acquisition 
period). Qualifying assets

[[Page 25]]

are those that are (1) either constructed or otherwise produced for a 
carrier's own use (including assets constructed or produced for the 
carrier by others for which deposits or progress payments have been 
made) or (2) assets intended for sale or lease that are constructed or 
otherwise produced as discrete projects. The amount of interest to be 
capitalized for qualifying assets shall be based upon the average amount 
of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the acquisition period 
at the rate used on specific new borrowings associated with the 
qualifying asset. If average accumulated expenditures for the asset 
exceed the amount of specific new borrowings associated with the asset, 
the rate to be applied to such excess shall be a weighted average of the 
rates applicable to other borrowings of the enterprise. The total amount 
of interest cost capitalized in an accounting period shall not exceed 
the total amount of interest cost incurred by the enterprise during that 
period.
    (d) Suitable records shall be maintained showing expenditures during 
the year for original road and equipment and road extensions; for merger 
and purchase of existing lines and reorganizations; for additions and 
betterments; and credits for property retirement.
    (e) When the carrier exchanges road and equipment for other road and 
equipment with no other consideration involved, the road and equipment 
received shall be recorded at the ledger value of the road and equipment 
relinquished. Where the carrier receives a monetary consideration in the 
exchange, the carrier shall recognize gain on the exchange to the extent 
that the consideration received exceeds a proportionate share of the 
recorded cost of the road and equipment surrendered. The portion of the 
cost applicable to the realized amount shall be based on the ratio of 
the monetary consideration to the total consideration received (monetary 
consideration plus the estimate fair value of the road and equipment 
received) or, if more clearly evident, the fair value of the road and 
equipment transferred. Where the carrier pays a monetary consideration 
in the exchange, it shall not recognize any gain on the transaction but 
shall record the road and equipment received at the amount of the 
monetary consideration paid plus the recorded costs of the road and 
equipment surrendered. If a loss is indicated by the terms of an 
exchange transaction, the carrier shall recognize the entire loss on the 
exchange. Immaterial gains and losses on these exchanges shall be 
included in account 519, Miscellaneous Income, or 551, Miscellaneous 
Income Charges, as appropriate. Material amounts shall be recorded in 
accordance with Instruction 1-2(d).

[52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-2 Minimum rule applicable to additions to property. An exception 
to the rule in Instruction 2-1 is that when the cost of acquisition of 
units of road property and of additions to existing units of road 
property (other than land and tracks) is less than $5,000, such costs 
may be charged to operating expenses. This amount (rounded to the 
nearest $100) will be adjusted by the June Producer Price Index for all 
commodities when an aggregate adjustment is $500 or more. The revision 
will be published in the Federal Register and be effective as of January 
1 of the following year. The carrier shall not parcel expenditures under 
a general plan bringing the accounting for such expenditures within this 
minimum rule. An amount of less than the current minimum capitalization 
level, for the railroad as a whole or for individual property accounts 
may be adopted for purposes of this rule provided the carrier first 
notifies the Board of the amount it proposes to adopt and thereafter 
makes no change in the amount unless authorized by the Board. An amount 
adopted shall be adhered to in reporting property changes for valuation 
purposes.

[55 FR 42016, Oct. 17, 1990]

    2-3 Land. (a) Accounts are provided for the cost of land used in 
transportation operations and also for land used in other than 
transportation operations. When land is retired from transportation 
operations but is retained by the carrier the original cost (estimated, 
if not known) shall be transferred to the account prescribed

[[Page 26]]

for property used in other than transportation operations. It is not 
contemplated that irregular parcels of land acquired in connection with 
acquisition of right-of-way which have no value as commercial property 
shall be thus transferred, either for the purpose of making right-of-way 
boundaries run more or less regular or for the purpose of eliminating 
from transportation property account the cost of unoccupied lands 
between tracks in yards and terminals. When any land, the cost of which 
is included in the accounts, is sold or otherwise retired, the ledger 
value shall be credited to the appropriate property investment account. 
The profit or loss from sale or loss from retirement or land shall be 
included in the accounts prescribed for such amounts.
    (b) [Reserved]

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-4 Structures. Accounts are provided for the cost of several 
classes of buildings and facilities, including fixtures permanently 
attached to and made a part thereof. When a building or other structure 
is used or held primarily for transportation operations and is an 
integral part of the carrier's transportation plant, but a part thereof 
is used or held for commercial purposes such as for rental to others or 
for use in other than transportation operations by the carrier, the 
entire cost of the building or other structure is includable in the 
accounts for transportation property. When a building or other structure 
is used or held primarily for commercial purposes or for use in other 
than transportation operations by the carrier, the entire cost of the 
building or structure is includable in account 737, Property used in 
other than carrier operations. Reclassification of property from its 
primary classification as transportation or other than transportation 
property, as the case may be, to the other classification is not 
required where changes in use are of a temporary nature or for a short 
period of time. The accounting for costs of maintenance, taxes, other 
operating costs, and for revenues and rentals shall be consistent with 
the classification of the building or other structure.
    2-5 Equipment. Accounts are provided for several classes of 
equipment, such as locomotives, passenger-train cars, freight-train 
cars, highway revenue equipment, work equipment, floating equipment, and 
the necessary appurtenance, furniture, and fixtures first to equip for 
service, including the cost of inspection, setting up, and trying out, 
and transportation over foreign lines; also the cost of additions and 
betterments, such as improved appliances, parts, or appurtenances. When 
retired equipment is held without being torn down, the estimated value 
of the salvage therefrom shall be included in account 741, Other assets, 
until the salvage is recovered, except that the estimated scrap value of 
retired equipment held for sale in the ordinary course of business, and 
on which sale and realization of the proceeds within one year is 
assured, is includable in account 713, Other current assets.
    2-6 Components of construction cost. The cost of constructing 
property includable in the property accounts shall include the direct 
and other costs as described hereunder.
    (a) Cost of labor. This includes the amount paid for labor expended 
by the carrier's own employees, including the cost of labor expended for 
preliminary work, such as sinking test holes or making soundings for 
tunnels, grading, buildings, and other structures; and cost of labor 
expended in laying and taking up tracks for temporary use in 
construction, except the cost of labor expended on tracks provided for 
the protection of traffic during the progress of addition and betterment 
work. The cost of labor shall also include the accounting company's 
expenditures for associated fringe benefits, such as vacation and 
holiday pay, health and welfare group insurance, pensions and retirement 
plans, payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. Office expenses and 
traveling and other personal expenses of employees, when borne by the 
carrier, shall be considered a part of the cost of the labor, as shall 
also the cost of fidelity bonds and employer's liability insurance 
premiums. When officers or employees are especially assigned to 
construction work their pay and their traveling and incidental expenses 
while thus engaged

[[Page 27]]

shall be included in the cost of the work. No charge shall be made 
against road and equipment accounts for the pay of officers and 
employees who merely render services incidentally in connection with 
extensions, additions, or betterments, although traveling and incidental 
expenses incurred by such officers and employees solely on account of 
such work shall be included in the account to which the cost of the work 
is chargeable.
    (b) Cost of materials and supplies. This includes the purchase price 
of materials and supplies, including small tools, at the point of free 
delivery plus the cost of inspection and loading assumed by the carrier; 
a suitable proportion of store expenses; also sales and excise taxes on 
materials and supplies except as otherwise provided in the text of 
account 712, Material and supplies. In calculating the cost of materials 
used, proper allowance shall be made for the value of unused portions 
and of cuttings, turnings, borings, etc.; for the value of the material 
recovered from temporary tracks, scaffolding, cofferdams, and other 
temporary structures used in construction; and for the value of small 
tools recovered and used for other purposes.
    (c) Cost of work-train service. This includes amounts paid to others 
for rent and maintenance of equipment used; cost of labor of enginemen, 
trainmen, and enginehousemen, including wages of engine crews and train 
crews held in readiness for such service; and cost of fuel and other 
supplies consumed in connection with the operation of work trains. It 
shall also include the cost of maintaining the carrier's own equipment 
used in construction service. Amounts representing constructive rent or 
return upon the investment in owned equipment shall not be included as a 
part of the cost of work-train service.
    (d) Cost of special machine service. This includes the cost of labor 
expended and of materials and supplies consumed in maintaining and 
operating power shovels, scrapers, rail unloaders, ballast unloaders, 
pile drivers, dredges, ditchers, weed burners, and other labor-saving 
machines; also rents paid for use of such machines.
    (e) Cost of transportation. This includes the amounts paid to other 
companies or individuals for the transportation of men, materials and 
supplies, special machine outfits, appliances, and tools in connection 
with construction. Freight charges paid foreign lines for the 
transportation of construction material to the carrier's line shall be 
included, so far as practicable, as a part of the cost of the material.
    (f) Cost of contract work. This includes amounts paid for work 
performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, and 
costs incident to the award of the contract.
    (g) Cost of protection from casualties. This includes expenditures 
for protection against fire, such as payments for discovery or 
extinguishment of fires, cost of detecting and prosecuting incendiaries, 
witness fees in relation thereto, amounts paid to municipal corporations 
and other for fire protection, and other analogous items of expenditure 
incurred directly in connection with construction work.
    (h) Cost of injuries and damages. This includes expenditures on 
account of injuries to persons or damage to property when incurred 
directly as a result of construction projects, and shall be included in 
the cost of the work in connection with which the injury or damage 
occurs. It also includes that portion of premiums paid for insuring 
property applicable to the period prior to the completion or coming into 
service of the property insured. Insurance recovered on account of 
compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction shall 
be credited to the accounts to which such compensation is charged, and 
insurance recovered on account of damages to property incident to 
construction shall be credited to the accounts chargeable with the 
expenditures necessary for restoring the damaged property. The cost of 
injuries and damages incident to the removal of old structures, or parts 
thereof, shall be charged to operating expenses, except that such costs 
in connection with the removal of old structures which are incumberances 
on newly acquired lands shall be included in accounts 2, Land for 
transportation purposes, or 3, Grading, as appropriate.

[[Page 28]]

    (i) Cost of privileges. This includes compensation for temporary 
privileges, such as the use of public property or streets, in connection 
with the construction of the property of the carrier.
    (j) Material excavated. The cost of disposing of material excavated 
in connection with construction shall be considered as a part of the 
cost of work, except that when such material is used for filling, the 
cost of removal and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the 
work in connection with which the removal occurs and the work in 
connection with which the material is used.
    (k) Interest cost. [See Instruction 2-1(c)].

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-7 Additions to and retirements of property--General. (a) In 
accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of road and 
equipment property (excluding land) used in transportation operations, 
such property changes shall be considered as consisting of: (1) Units of 
property, and (2) other than units of property as prescribed in 
Instruction 2-19. Track property changes will be distinguished by units 
of property as approved by the Commission.
    (b) The cost of removal of retired property, both depreciable and 
other than depreciable, when borne by the carrier, shall be charged, as 
appropriate, to account 11-13-39, Personnel--Salaries and Wages--Way and 
Structures--Other--Dismantling retired property, or 11-23-39. 
Personnel--Salaries and Wages--Equipment--Other Equipment--Dismantling 
retired property, and other appropriate accounts (including 
subactivities 11 and 12). \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The references to solely related freight operating expense 
activity/subactivity numbers and titles used throughout the system are 
for convenience and brevity. Refer to the specific account texts to 
determine the appropriate solely related passenger and/or common expense 
activity/subactivity numbers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) An equitable proportion of a balance in property accounts 76, 
Interest During Construction, and 80, Other elements of investment, 
applicable to retired property shall be cleared from these accounts 
concurrently with the retirement accounting. Unless provided for 
otherwise, interest costs shall be capitalized in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
    (d) When retired property is held and not removed, the estimated 
value of the salvage therefrom shall be included in account 741, Other 
assets, until the salvage is recovered, except that the estimated scrap 
value of retired property held for sale in the ordinary course of 
business, and on which sale and realization of the proceeds within one 
year is assured, is includible in account 713, Other current assets.
    (e) The accounting for track additions and retirements (with and 
without replacement) shall be guided by Instruction 2-10.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 10920, Feb. 5, 1981; 48 
FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983; 49 FR 2254, Jan. 19, 1984; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 
1987]

    2-8 Additions to and retirements of units of property. (a) When a 
unit of road or equipment property is added to the plant, the cost 
thereof shall be included in the appropriate primary account. When a 
unit of property is retired, with or without replacement, the cost 
thereof shall be written out of the property account at time of 
retirement.
    (b) When a unit of road or equipment property (or a minor item not 
replaced) classified as depreciable and included in the accounts 
prescribed for depreciable property is retired the service value shall 
be charged to account 735, Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment 
property.
    (c) When road property (other than a minor item constituting 
repairs) classified as other than depreciable property is retired, the 
cost thereof shall be cleared from the property account and the service 
value shall be charged to account 61-13-99, General--Other Expenses--Way 
and Structures--Other--Other. When the retirement requires Board 
approval, the carrier shall clear the cost from the property account 
upon the effective date of the abandonment. Subactivities 11 and 12 also 
apply.
    (d) When property included in the depreciable accounts but excluded 
from the depreciation base is retired, the

[[Page 29]]

service value (including engineering expenditures assignable to retired 
property but not included in the depreciation base) shall be charged to 
operating expense.
    2-9 Additions and retirements of other than units of property. (a) 
When an item of road or equipment property, other than a complete unit, 
is added to the plant and the addition is not a replacement, the cost 
thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as an addition of a 
complete unit of property, subject to the minimum rule applicable to 
road property (see Instruction 2-2). When an item of property other than 
a complete unit (minor item) is replaced, independent of the complete 
unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be treated as 
maintenance and charged to operating expenses. If the replacement 
constitutes an improvement then the cost of replacement should be 
accounted for as a rebuilding expenditure under Instruction 2-12.
    (b) When second-hand property acquired is in such physical condition 
that it is necessary to rehabilitate the property to bring it up to the 
standard required by the carrier, the cost of such rehabilitation shall 
be included in the appropriate account for the property.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 55 FR 42016, Oct. 17, 1990]

    2-10 Additions to and retirements of track.
    (a) When track or its components are added to the plant, the cost 
shall be included in the track primary account. When track components 
are replaced as part of a track replacement program, the replacement 
cost shall be accounted for as an addition to the track property 
account. The cost of track components which are retired with or without 
replacement shall be written out of the track property account at the 
time of retirement.
    (b) When track is retired the service value (ledger value less net 
salvage) shall be charged to account 735, Accumulated depreciation; Road 
and equipment property.
    (c) All repairs of tracks shall be accounted for as operating 
expenses.
    (d) Track investment written out of the accounts shall be at 
original cost or estimated standard or average cost for that density 
category. Material to be reused shall be put in an investment pool at 
unrecovered cost and, when reused, included in the appropriate density 
category at the average cost of the investment pool.

[48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983]

    2-11 Expenses in connection with additions and betterments. The cost 
of removing old material from equipment and from buildings, bridges, 
wharves, tracks, and other fixed improvements, shall be charged to the 
appropriate operating expense accounts. Such charges shall include the 
cost of removing old foundations and filling old excavations, and 
restoring condition of grounds after addition and betterment work; and 
maintaining or protecting traffic during the progress of addition and 
betterment work, including the cost of constructing, maintaining, and 
removing temporary tracks required for maintaining traffic during the 
progress of the work.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977. Redesignated at 48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983]

    2-12 Units of property rebuilt or converted--(a) Rebuilding 
expenditures. Carriers shall be governed by the following provisions 
when determining and accounting for depreciable road and equipment 
property rebuilding expenditures:
    (1) Rebuilding expenditures are those cost actually incurred which 
substantially extend the service life or substantially increase the 
utility of depreciable road and equipment property. The rebuilding 
expenditures shall be material in nature relative to the current 
replacement cost of a similar new unit of road or equipment property. 
Expenses resulting from delayed maintenance and repairs shall not be 
considered in determining materiality.
    (2) The phrase extend the service life means to extend the life of a 
property unit past its estimated service life.
    (3) The term increased utility means that the road or equipment 
property has become more useful, more efficient, more durable, or has 
greater capacity.

[[Page 30]]

    (4) Rebuilt or converted road or equipment property shall be 
accounted for as an addition to the appropriate property accounts, with 
the old units accounted for as retired from service. The charge to the 
appropriate property accounts shall be composed of (i) the cost 
(estimated if necessary) less a fair allowance for depreciation, or 
salvage value, whichever is lower, of the parts reused, (ii) the cost of 
labor expended in rebuilding or in the conversion process, (iii) the 
cost of additional materials applied, and (iv) any other expenses 
incurred directly with the rebuilding or conversion. In no case shall 
the total amount charged to the property accounts for these units exceed 
the current replacement costs of similar new units that would be used 
for the same purpose. When a unit of road property or equipment is 
transferred from one class of service to another, with or without 
physical conversion, the unit shall be accounted for as retired from its 
original account and be recorded in a primary investment account 
appropriate to its new class of service.
    (5) If it is necessary to repair the secondhand or reused parts 
remaining in a rebuilt unit, the repair cost may be added to the value 
assigned parts in determining the related cost to be capitalized. 
Associated dismantling costs shall be included in operating expenses.
    (b) Repair expenses. Expenses pertaining to road and equipment 
property, which represent normal or delayed repairs and maintenance, 
shall be expensed in the year incurred.
    (c) File and Storage. Carriers shall keep records of each rebuilding 
program readily available. These records shall be provided to 
representatives of the Board when requested. The retention period shall

and amended at 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-13 Changes in line of road and relocation of yard tracks.
    (a) When changes are made in a line of road for the purpose of 
reducing curves or grades, or to eliminate bridges, tunnels, tracks in 
the installation of a centralized traffic control system, or other 
physical features, the part of the line so changed shall be considered 
property retired and its ledger value credited to the property accounts. 
The new line of road, including land, grading, ballast, track elements, 
and other transportation facilities serving the road shall be considered 
an addition and the cost charged to the property accounts. The cost of 
track changes which do not involve change in the existing roadbed shall 
be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be 
dismantled in the process, but the resulting track extensions or 
reductions shall be accounted for as additions or retirements as 
appropriate.
    (b) The cost of shifting or rearranging tracks within a yard shall 
be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be 
dismantled in the process, but resulting increases or decreases in 
grading, ballast, or track length shall be accounted for as additions or 
retirements, as appropriate. Where tracks in whole or in part within a 
yard are determined to be no longer permanently used, the ledger value 
of such tracks shall be eliminated from the property account. If yard 
tracks and facilities are constructed in another location to take the 
place of tracks retired, such tracks and facilities shall be accounted 
for as additions and the cost thereof shall be included in the property 
account.

[48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983]

    2-14 Track connections. (a) When the accounting carrier bears the 
construction cost of a connecting track situated on the property of 
another carrier, but acquires the salvage rights to the track, the cost 
of the track construction shall be charged to account 731, Road and 
equipment property.
    (b) When carriers (1) share the cost of constructing a connecting 
track of which a portion is situated on each carrier's right-of-way, and 
(2) own and obtain the salvage rights to the track segment located on 
their respective properties, the construction cost borne by each carrier 
shall be charged to account 731, Road and equipment property.
    (c) The cost of constructing a track connection on the right-of-way 
of another carrier which acquires the ownership of and salvage rights to 
the track,

[[Page 31]]

shall be charged by the carrier bearing such cost to accounts 37-11-00, 
Purchased service--Joint facility--Debit--Way and Structures--Running, 
or 37-12-00, Purchased services--Joint facility--Debit--Way and 
Structures--Switching. The owner carrier shall charge the amount of the 
construction cost to account 731, Road and equipment--property, with 
contra credit to accounts 38-11-00, Purchases services--Joint facility--
Credit--Way and Structures--Running, or 38-12-00, Purchases services--
Joint facility--Credit--Way and Structures--Switching. Material amounts 
for such costs shall be referred to the Board for consideration and 
decision.
    (d) The cost of constructing a side track under a deposit refund 
agreement shall be charged to account 731, Road and equipment property. 
The deposit shall be credited to account 782, Other liabilities. Deposit 
amounts refunded during the agreement period shall be charged to account 
782, Other liabilities. Upon termination of the agreement, the amount of 
any unrefunded deposit shall be credited to the applicable primary 
property accounts on an equitable basis.
    2-15 Merger, consolidation, and purchase of a railway operating 
entity or system. (a) When a railway or portion thereof constituting an 
operating unit or system is acquired by merger or consolidation in a 
pooling of interests or by purchase the cost of acquisition represented 
by cash, capital stock or other securities issued or assumed, 
liabilities assumed, and other consideration, shall be recorded in the 
accounts in the manner stated hereunder. Separate instructions are 
provided for a merger of subsidiaries.
    (b) Pooling of interests:
    (1) When the acquisition results from a merger or consolidation 
constituting a pooling of interests, in which all or substantially all 
of the equity interest in predecessor companies continue, as such, in a 
surviving company or a new company created for the purpose, the road and 
equipment, the other assets, and the liabilities of the predecessor 
companies, together with the balances in the accumulated amortization 
and depreciation accounts and the retained earnings accounts shall be 
recorded in the appropriate balance sheet accounts at the amounts shown 
in the accounts of predecessor companies, adjusted as may be necessary 
to conform with the accounting rules of the Board. Such adjustments 
shall be included in retained earnings or the other accounts that would 
have been appropriate had the adjustments been made in the books of 
account of the predecessor company.
    (2) When the total par or the stated value of no par capital stock 
issued or outstanding pursuant to the pooling of interests is more than 
the aggregate amount of the capital stock of the separate companies 
before such pooling of interests, the excess shall be charged to account 
795, Other capital, if unrestricted capital is available for such 
purpose; otherwise, the excess shall be charged to retained earnings.
    (3) When the total par or stated value of no par capital stock 
issued or outstanding pursuant to the pooling of interests is less than 
aggregate amount of the capital stock of the separate companies before 
such pooling of interests, the difference for reduction in capital stock 
shall be credited to account 795, Other capital.
    (c) Purchase:
    (1) When the acquisition results from a purchase (except from 
subsidiaries controlled through ownership of the majority share of 
voting stock) including mergers or consolidations other than pooling of 
interests, the amount includible in account 731, Road and equipment 
property, shall be the cost at the date of acquisition to the purchaser 
of the transportation property acquired. The cost assigned the property, 
as well as other assets acquired, shall be the amount of the cost 
consideration given. Where property and other assets are acquired for 
other than cash, including liabilities assumed and shares of stock 
issued, cost shall be determined by either the fair value of the 
consideration given or the fair value of the assets acquired, whichever 
is more clearly evident. In addition to any liabilities assumed, 
provision shall be made for such estimated liabilities as may be 
necessary.
    (2) When the costs of individual units or classes of transportation 
property are not specified in the agreement, the

[[Page 32]]

cost assigned such property shall be apportioned among the appropriate 
primary accounts using the percentage relationship between the fair 
values for each class of property acquired and the total of such values.
    (d) Merger of subsidiaries:
    The acquisition and merger of property of subsidiaries controlled 
through ownership of the majority shares of voting stock is to be 
accounted for as a pooling of interests or as a purchase depending on 
the circumstances in each case. Where control was initially acquired 
through issuance of capital stock to stockholders of the subsidiary the 
rule applicable to pooling of interests ordinarily is applicable. Where 
control was initially acquired through purchase of stock the rule 
applicable to purchase of property may be appropriate even though the 
shares were purchased gradually from time to time over a period of 
years, in which event recognition of retained earnings since date of 
acquisition assignable to such shares may be proper. The journal entry 
pertaining to acquisition of property of subsidiaries shall be submitted 
to the Board for consideration based on the principles herein and 
procedures for which there is authoritative support, and the accounting 
for the merger shall become final only after approval by the Board.
    2-16 Reorganization of railway. (a) When a railway reorganization or 
receivership has been consummated, the assets acquired, liabilities 
assumed, and the capital stock or other securities issued or assumed, 
and other consideration, shall be recorded in the accounts in the manner 
stated hereunder. An adjustment of capitalization resulting in 
modification and reformation of classes of securities pursuant to 
voluntary action of the holders of securities but not resulting in a 
formal reorganization following a bankruptcy or other receivership 
proceedings (sometimes called a quasi-reorganization) is not covered by 
this instruction 2-16. Reduction of capital stock and other 
contributions to capital by stockholders shall be recorded in accordance 
with the instructions in the text of account 795, Other capital.
    (b) The amounts includable in primary road and equipment property 
accounts shall be recorded at cost as shown in the predecessor 
companies' accounts except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this instruction 2-16. The remaining assets and the liabilities 
of the predecessor companies, adjusted as necessary to conform with the 
accounting rules of the Board, together with the balances in the 
accumulated amortization and depreciation accounts, shall be recorded in 
the appropriate balance sheet accounts.
    (c) When the amount recorded for assets acquired is more than the 
par or stated value of no par capital stock issued and other 
consideration paid, including liabilities assumed, the difference shall 
be applied to such extent as necessary and is available to provide first 
for any deficiency in past accrued depreciation on property classified 
as depreciable; and, second, for any estimated loss from retirement of a 
branch line, segment of track or other important facility indicated by 
supporting records to be imminent. The remaining amount of the 
difference, if any, shall be applied proportionately to reduce the 
amounts includable in the property accounts in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this instruction 2-16, based on the percentage relationship 
between such difference and the aggregate cost of the property shown in 
the predecessor companies' accounts.
    (d) When the amount applicable to the assets acquired is less than 
the par or stated value of no par capital stock issued and other 
consideration paid, including liabilities assumed, the accounting shall 
be referred to the Board for consideration and decision.
    2-17 Construction projects in which governmental agencies, 
individuals, or others, and the carrier participate. (a) The amount 
includible in the property account for construction projects in which 
the carrier and governmental agencies, individuals, or others 
participate shall be (1) the payment made by the carrier for its share 
of the cost of construction plus (2) the recorded cost (estimated if 
unknown) of property relinquished as a direct result of the arrangement 
and retired from service less the value of salvage recovered

[[Page 33]]

therefrom by the carrier and less depreciation accrued on depreciable 
property, which is part of the carrier's cost of the project. The amount 
so includable in the property account shall be distributed equitably 
among the primary accounts applicable to railway property constructed. 
This amount shall first be applied to railway facilities includable in 
accounts other than 4, Other right-of-way expenditures, or 39, Public 
improvements--Construction, then any remaining balance shall be included 
in account 4 or 39, as appropriate. In no case shall the amount included 
in the primary accounts for the railway facilities acquired exceed the 
actual cost of constructing such facilities. The property account shall 
not include any cost or value for facilities or land contributed or paid 
for by governmental agencies, individuals or others. Property acquired 
as a specific contribution to capital by stockholders does not come 
under this rule. (See text of account 795, Other capital.)
    (b) Construction projects as used in this section means widening of 
highways, construction of spillways, drainage canals, farm and other 
private passes, pipelines, drains or other facilities across the right-
of-way; construction of overhead highway bridges, and railroad bridges 
over public highways and across streams, which provide a railroad use in 
the operation of trains and a public use in the uninterrupted passage of 
highway and river traffic; installation of warning signals to protect 
highway traffic; and industrial side tracks. Also, reconstruction and 
relocation of tracks and appurtenant facilities such as occur in 
connection with carrying out flood control, reclamation, and other 
public improvement projects where it becomes necessary to abandon part 
of the line of railroad and relocate the tracks.
    2-18 Leased property improvements and retirements. The cost to 
lessee of structures, facilities, additions and betterments on leased 
property and for retirement of property the cost of which is included in 
account 732 Improvements on leased property, shall be accounted for in 
conformity with the principles in the instructions for property owned. 
When lessor's property is retired and replaced and lessee is not 
obligated to reimburse the lessor for the retired property other than 
through the replacement, the lessee shall (1) charge the cost of the 
replacement to account 732, Improvements on leased property, (2) 
discontinue accruing depreciation for lessor's retired property, and (3) 
when recording final settlement with the lessor, consider jointly the 
amount accrued in account 772, Accrued liability; Leased property, for 
lessor's retired property and the respective amounts for the replacement 
included in accounts 732, Improvements on leased property, and 733, 
Accumulated depreciation; Improvements on leased property. When lessee 
is obligated to reimburse the lessor currently or at the termination of 
the lease for property retired other than through replacement, the 
lessee shall include the amount of the obligation in the appropriate 
liability account. The lessee shall furnish the lessor such information 
as is required to enable the lessor to perform necessary accounting. The 
accounting by the lessee and the lessor shall be consistent with 
contractual arrangements.

    2-20 Accounting for leases. (a) Leases shall be accounted for as 
capital leases whenever the lease meets one or more of the following 
four criteria:
    (1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by 
the end of the lease term,
    (2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option,
    (3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated 
economic life of the property, and,
    (4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the 
minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair value of 
the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease less any 
related investment tax credit retained by the lessor.
    (b) If the lease does not meet any of the four criteria, the lease 
shall be classified and accounted for as an operating lease.
    (c) When accounting for capital leases the lessee shall record the 
asset and the related obligation. The amount recorded as the asset and 
the obligation shall be the present value at the beginning of the lease 
term of the minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that 
portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, 
maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor. However, if that amount 
exceeds the fair value of the leased property, the amount recorded as 
the asset and the obligation shall be the fair value. The lessee shall 
compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its 
incremental borrowing rate unless (1) it is practicable to learn the 
implicit rate computed by the lessor and (2) the implicit rate computed 
by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If 
both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit 
rate.

[[Page 37]]

    (d) Leased assets that meet the criteria for classification as a 
capital lease shall be subject to depreciation over their useful lives 
in the same manner as assets owned. If the capital lease meets the 
criteria of either Instruction 2-20(a)(1) or 2-20(a)(2), the asset shall 
be amortized in a manner consistent with the lessee's normal 
depreciation policy for owned assets. If the lease does not meet either 
of these two criteria, the asset shall be amortized in a manner 
consistent with the lessee's normal depreciation policy except that the 
period of amortization shall be the lease term.
    (e) The accounting accorded the lease shall be subject to the same 
considerations as other obligations in classifying them with current and 
noncurrent liabilities in the classified balance sheet. Leases that meet 
the criteria requiring capitalization shall be recorded in those 
accounts that provide for carrier operating property or property used in 
other than carrier operations, as appropriate. The accounts shall 
segregate the amounts pertaining to capital leases.
    (f) If the lease qualifies as an operating lease it should be 
accounted for by charging the rent to expense over the lease term. The 
rental expense should be recognized on a straight line basis over the 
lease term unless another method is more representative of the use and 
the benefits derived.
    (g) The criteria specified in paragraph (a) should be applied to all 
leases regardless of the relationship between the lessor and the lessee 
unless it is clear that the terms of the lease transaction have been 
significantly affected by their relationship. In this situation, the 
accounting should be modified to recognize economic substance rather 
than legal form.
    (h) In the case of subsidiary companies or companies under common 
control whose principal business activity is leasing property or 
facilities to the carrier, the carrier is encouraged to request special 
authority to file consolidated or combined financial statements. If the 
carrier does not wish to file consolidated or combined financial 
statements, capitalization of the lease will be required if the lease 
meets the criteria that would require capitalization.
    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules for lease accounting is 
needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the 
Board.

    (a) The accounting for freight train car repair costs shall agree 
with the applicable instructions and texts of accounts in 49 CFR Part 
1201 relating to the equipment repair process (see Note A).
    (b) Railroads may assign either actual costs, standard costs, or a 
combination of both to the accounting process. Standard costs, if used, 
shall recognize the differences in performing repairs on various types 
of equipment, and the differences related to specific repair facilites. 
Standard costs shall be based on adequate operational data which are 
reviewed at least annually. The resulting variances (price, efficiency, 
capacity, etc.) shall be reasonably allocated back to the car types to 
derive the amounts reported in Form R-1.
    (c) Railroads shall report repair costs by the freight train car 
types shown in Schedule 415 of Form R-1. In assigning repair costs, 
railroads may use either one of the following methodologies:

                     Level I: Job Order Cost System

    Railroads may use a job order cost system for assigning repair costs 
to the car types for freight train cars. Under this methodology, 
railroads shall directly match direct labor and materials with the 
specific unit of equipment that was repaired. Actual costs, standard 
costs, or a combination of both may be used as stated above.

             Level II: Alternative Repair Costs Methodology

    Railroads not using the job order cost system shall report freight 
train car repair costs by using the methodology described below:

    (1) The repair costs relating to heavy, program, or project repairs 
of freight train cars shall be directly assigned to the car types 
repaired by using actual

[[Page 38]]

or standard costs. A heavy repair is defined as a repair that is 
relatively so material in cost, repair time, or physical damage that 
management's involvement in the determination of the repair to be made 
is necessary and relatively greater than usual. Program or project 
repairs are those repairs which are performed under a predetermined plan 
where estimates costs, time periods, and car types to be repaired are 
identified.
    (2) The repair costs relating to light and running repairs of system 
cars shall be allocated to the car types by using the Association of 
American Railroads' Car Repair Billing System (CRBS) as the process for 
distributing light and running repairs. The CRBS will be the tracking 
system for recording the number of repairs, the car types and types of 
repairs. Then by applying the CRBS standard costs to the particular 
repairs, standard costs relationships by car type can be developed and 
used to distribute actual light and running repair cost pools to the car 
types.
    (3) Railroads shall match repair costs billed by and paid to foreign 
roads with the car types that were repaired. Foreign billings for light 
and running repairs are usually conducted through CRBS, and therefore, 
the car types can be identified. For heavy off-line repairs, car type 
identification is possible because system management is generally 
involved with the authorization of such heavy repairs and car 
identification numbers are generally included in the billing process.
    (4) Repair costs relating to foreign freight train cars shall also 
be reported by car types. However, a separate breakdown between foreign 
and system repair costs is not required for Board reporting purpose. Car 
type identification for light and running repairs to foreign cars can be 
obtained from CRBS tapes. The cost of heavy repairs to foreign cars 
should be accumulated by car types. The resulting expense credits from 
foreign railroads should be assigned to the car types to which they 
relate.
    (5) Railroads shall match any resulting expense credits with the car 
types to which they relate. This can occur, for example, when a railroad 
is charged with the repair costs of system cars, but the responsibility 
of the repair ultimately rests with and is paid by a foreign road.
    (d) Railroads shall submit to the Board any repair cost by car type 
methodology which does not agree with item (c) above. The Board shall 
review the methodology and determine if it is acceptable for reporting 
purposes.
    (e) Railroads may submit justification and supporting documents 
requesting waiver from provisions required by this instruction. This 
provision is intended to provide relief for those smaller Class I 
railroads that might be unduly burdened by the cost of developing and 
maintaining the required system. Waivers shall be directed to the 
Board's Accounting and Valuation Board.
    (f) Equipment repair cost records, including the allocation methods 
used, shall be maintained and made available to the Board upon request.

showing its property as it exists on such date or dates as may be fixed 
by the Board.

specific area depicted.
    (e) All maps shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
mapping practices.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    4-1 Method. (a) There shall be charged monthly to operating expenses 
or other appropriate accounts and credited to account 735, Accumulated 
depreciation; Road and equipment property, during the service life of 
depreciable road and equipment property, includable in accounts classed 
as depreciable, amounts which will approximate the loss in service value 
not restored by current repairs or covered by insurance. The charges for 
accruing depreciation currently shall be computed in conformity with the 
group plan by applying to the cost of property such percentage rates as 
will distribute the service value by the straight-line method in equal 
annual charges to operating expenses or other accounts during the 
estimated life of the property. In the case of track accounts 8, 9 and 
11, service value shall reflect net salvage value. For road property, 
the cost shall be original cost or estimated original cost, as used in 
the valuation records, adjusted to current date. If a carrier submits 
proof that the actual cost of depreciable property is substantially 
different from cost figures in the valuation records, the carrier may, 
with the approval of the Board, use such cost figures as the 
depreciation base.
    (b) The term group plan means the plan under which depreciation 
charges are accrued upon the basis of the cost of depreciable property 
includable in accounts classed as depreciable using the service lives of 
the individual depreciable units in the accounts and properly weighing 
to determine the composite annual rate of depreciation.

[[Page 41]]

    (c) For the purpose of the group plan of depreciation accounting, 
the following primary accounts are classed as depreciable accounts:

Road accounts:
    3. Grading.
    4. Other right-of-way expenditures.
    5. Tunnels and subways.
    6. Bridges, trestles and culverts.
    7. Elevated structures.
    8. Ties.
    9. Rails and other track material.
    11. Ballast.
    13. Fences, snowsheds, and signs.
    16. Station and office buildings.
    17. Roadway buildings.
    18. Water stations.
    19. Fuel stations.
    20. Shops and enginehouses.
    22. Storage warehouses.
    23. Wharves and docks.
    24. Coal and ore wharves.
    25. TOFC/COFC terminals.
    26. Communication systems.
    27. Signals and interlockers.
    29. Power plants.
    31. Power transmission systems.
    35. Miscellaneous structures.
    37. Roadway machines.
    39. Public improvements-construction.
    44. Shop machinery.
    45. Power plant machinery.
Equipment accounts:
    52. Locomotives.
    53. Freight-train cars.
    54. Passenger-train cars.
    55. Highway revenue equipment.
    56. Floating equipment.
    57. Work equipment.
    58. Miscellaneous equipment.
    59. Computer systems and word processing equipment.

    (d) When abandonment of a branch line or other important segment of 
the track structure or other part of the plant for which depreciation 
charges are not includable in the accounts as foreseeable within a 
reasonable period of time due to exhaustion of traffic, obsolescence or 
other causes, application may be made to the Board for authority to 
record a suitable provision in anticipation of a probable loss.

FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987]

    4-2 Rates of depreciation. (a) A separate composite annual 
percentage rate for each depreciable property account, or a subgroup in 
that account, shall be used in computing annual depreciation expenses 
and accumulated depreciation. The composite rates shall be based on the 
results of a depreciation study performed by each railroad. A 
depreciation study shall, in general, contain the following components:
    (i) Actuarial or semiactuarial methods for determining service lives 
for road and equipment properties;
    (ii) Salvage value calculations for road and equipment properties;
    (iii) Accumulated depreciation for each account or subaccount as 
appropriate;
    (iv) Other factors and related calculations involving the 
depreciation process; and
    (v) A commentary on any adjustments and judgmental factors used in 
the study.
    (b) Railroads shall submit to the Board for review and approval a 
report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every 
three years for equipment property, and every six years for road 
property. Railroads can, however, submit depreciation studies prior to 
its scheduled year, in which case a new cycle will begin.
    (c) In computing monthly depreciation charges, the annual percentage 
rates shall be applied to the depreciation base as of the first of each 
month and the results shall be divided by twelve.
    (d) Class II railroads are exempt from the three-year and six-year 
cyclical reviews, but shall submit depreciation studies when requested 
by the Board. Class III railroads are not required to submit 
depreciation studies.
    (e) A separate track depreciation rate shall apply to each primary 
property account in each track density category as provided in 
Instruction 4-3(d). Track depreciation rates shall be developed by 
estimating the average life based on an acceptable depreciation 
methodology, consistently applied, including as an option the units of 
production method based on gross ton-miles per mile of track.

FR 7184, Feb. 18, 1983; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    4-3 Depreciation records to be kept. (a) The carrier shall maintain 
for each class of property in convenient and accessible form engineering 
and other

[[Page 42]]

data bearing on prospective service lives.
    (b) The carrier also shall keep such records of depreciable property 
and property retirements as will reflect the service life of each class 
of property which has been retired, or will permit the determination of 
service life indications by past experience of useful life tenure of 
comparable property, turnover, or other appropriate methods; also such 
records as will reflect the percentage of value of the salvage for 
property retired from each class of depreciable property.
    (c) For purposes of analysis the carrier shall maintain subsidiary 
records in which the accumulated depreciation account is broken down 
into component parts corresponding to each primary account to show the 
current credits and debits and the balance for each account. Such 
detailed information shall be reported annually to this Board. For 
balance sheet purposes, the accumulated depreciation account shall be 
treated as a single composite account for depreciable property.
    (d) Carriers shall be prepared to justify all track depreciation 
rates by keeping appropriate data on the service lives and salvage 
values of track components which went into the life and net salvage 
computation of each primary account in each density category.
    (e) The investment and related accumulated depreciation for accounts 
3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 39 must be maintained by distinct traffic density 
categories. Each line segment shall be identified on January 1 of each 
year as belonging to one of the following traffic density classes, based 
on the average traffic density in the preceding three years:

                                 Density

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Class                             Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
     I  Lines carrying at least 20 million gross ton-miles per mile on
         an annual basis and not designated as belonging to Density
         Class III.
    II  Lines carrying less than 20 million gross ton-miles per mile on
         an annual basis and not designated as belonging to Density
         Class III.
   III  Lines identified as potentially subject to abandonment pursuant
         to Section 10904 of the Interstate Commerce Act.
    IV  Yard and way switching tracks.
     V  Electronic yards.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Note A: For purposes of designating line segments as belonging to 
one of the density classes, the carrier shall consider all traffic 
carried over the segment whether in the carrier's trains or in the 
trains of other carriers (estimated if not known).
    Note B: When a carrier operates systems of parallel tracks on a 
single roadbed, the density associated with the related segment of a 
rail route shall be the aggregate gross ton-miles on all individual 
tracks.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 20210, Apr. 3, 1981; 48 
FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    4-4 Leased property--depreciation. (a) The carrier shall include in 
operating expenses charges for depreciation on road property and 
equipment used but not owned, the rent for which is includable in the 
lease rental accounts, and shall maintain the same records of service 
lives, salvage values, etc., as provided for owned road property and 
equipment. The excess of the total compensation paid over the amount 
chargeable for depreciation shall be included in the rent account. If 
settlement between the carrier and the lessor is not currently made, the 
amount of the depreciation accrued during the period of the lease shall 
be credited by the carrier to account 772. Accrued liability; Leased 
property. The necessary adjustments of the difference between the 
balance thus accrued in that account and the actual amount of settlement 
shall be made appropriately through accounts 519, Miscellaneous income, 
or 551, Miscellaneous income charges, at the time settlement for 
depreciation on the property is made with the lessor.
    (b) The carrier shall not include in the depreciation account in 
operating expenses any charges for depreciation of equipment used but 
not owned when the rents therefor are not included in the lease rental 
accounts but shall include such charges in the appropriate other rent 
expense accounts.
    4-5 Jointly used property--depreciation. The owning carrier shall 
include in the depreciation accounts in operating expenses the charges 
for depreciation on units of depreciable property jointly used with one 
or more other carriers. The owning carrier shall credit and each using 
carrier shall charge the appropriate joint facility accounts in 
operating expenses with the amounts billed by the owning carrier

[[Page 43]]

against each using carrier for its proportion of the service loss on 
property retired from service whether billed currently as depreciation 
or when retirements occur as the loss in service value. The using 
carriers shall be required to account for depreciation or retirement of 
units of road property jointly used but not owned to the extent of their 
contract liability. The same principle shall apply to terminal companies 
and their nonowner tenants in accounting for depreciation accruals or 
retirement charges recorded in the accounts of the terminal companies.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INCOME AND BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    5-1 Current assets. (a) In the group of accounts designated as 
current assets shall be included cash, those assets which are readily 
convertible into cash or are held for current use in operations, current 
claims against others and amounts accruing to the carrier which are 
subject to settlement in the ordinary course of business within one 
year. There shall not be included in this group of accounts any amount 
the collection of which is not reasonably assured within one year 
because of the known financial conditions of the debtor or otherwise. 
Such items shall be included in account 741, Other assets, at an amount 
not in excess of a reasonable estimate of realizable value. Items of 
current character but of doubtful value shall be written down or written 
off by charge to account 63-61-00, General--Uncollectible accounts--
General and administrative, or account 553, Uncollectible accounts, as 
appropriate. Adjustment of these items of doubtful value shall be made 
by direct reduction of the asset account in which such items are carried 
or by provision in account 709.5, Allowance for uncollectible accounts, 
for the estimated uncollectible amount.
    (b) The carrier shall transfer the estimated realizable value of 
obsolete material to account 741, Other assets, equitably distribute the 
loss due to obsolescence among the accounts ordinarily chargeable for 
such classes of material, and concurrently credit account 712, Material 
and Supplies.
    5-2 Recorded value of securities owned. (a)(1) The investment in 
securities other than those issued or assumed by the accounting company 
shall be recorded in these accounts at cost, but excluding amounts paid 
for accrued interest and accrued dividends.
    (2) Accounts 702, Temporary Cash Investments, 721, Investments in 
Affiliated Companies, and 722, Other Investments, shall be maintained in 
such a manner as to reflect the marketable equity securities' portion 
(see definition 26) and other securities or investments.
    (3) For the purpose of determining net ledger value, the marketable 
equity securities in account 702 shall be considered the current 
portfolio and the marketable equity securities in accounts 721 and 722 
(combined) shall be considered the noncurrent portfolio. The net ledger 
value of each portfolio shall be the lower of its aggregate cost or 
market value. (See definition 26.) The amount by which aggregate cost 
exceeds market value shall be accounted for as the valuation allowance. 
Account 702, Temporary Cash Investments, shall be subdivided to include 
the valuation allowance for the marketable equity securities included 
therein. Account 724, Allowance for Net Unrealized Loss on Noncurrent 
Marketable Equity Securities--Cr., is the valuation allowance for the 
marketable equity securities recorded in account 721, Investments in 
Affiliated Companies, and 722, Other Investments. Marketable equity 
securities accounted for by the equity method shall not be combined with 
other marketable equity securities when determining aggregate cost and 
market value.
    (4) Realized gains and losses (the difference between net proceeds 
from sale and cost) shall be included in the determination of net income 
of the period in which they occur. Changes in the valuation allowance 
for marketable equity securities included in account 702 shall be 
charged to account 551, Miscellaneous Income Charges, or credited to 
account 519, Miscellaneous Income, as appropriate, with a contra entry 
to the valuation allowance contained within account 702. Changes in the 
valuation allowance for marketable equity securities included in 
accounts 721 and 722 shall be recorded in equity account

[[Page 44]]

798.1, Net Unrealized Loss on Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, 
with a contra entry to valuation account 724.
    (5) If there is a change in the classification of a marketable 
equity security between current and noncurrent, the security shall be 
transferred at the lower of its cost or market value at date of 
transfer. If market value is less than cost, the market value shall 
become the new cost basis, and the difference shall be accounted for as 
if it were a realized loss and included in the determination of net 
income.
    (6) The accounting company shall write down the ledger value of any 
securities to the extent of impairment in their value or write off 
entirely if there is no reasonable prospect of realizing any value 
therefrom. For long term investments in marketable equity securities, 
when the decline in market value below cost is judged to be other than 
temporary, the cost basis of the individual security shall be writen 
down to a new cost basis. The amount of the write-down shall be 
accounted for as realized loss by a charge to account 551, Other Income 
Charges, and a credit to account 723, Reserve for Adjustment of 
Investment in Securities. The new cost basis shall not be changed for 
subsequent recoveries in value.
    (b)(1) For financial statement purposes the carrier shall follow the 
principles of equity accounting for (1) all investments in corporate 
joint ventures (see definition 21(c)), and (2) all investments in voting 
stock of affiliated companies giving the carrier the ability to 
significantly influence the operating and financial policies of an 
investee (see definition 21(b)). For purposes of this instruction an 
investment of 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an 
investee will indicate the ability to exercise significant influence 
over an investee in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
    (2) Since the equity method is not to be effected by entries in the 
books of accounts but is to apply only in financial reports to the 
Board, the carrier shall establish worksheet or memorandum accounts. 
Three basic worksheet or memorandum accounts are needed:
    (i) An investment account to include (1) equity in the undistributed 
earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition (see 
definition 21(g)); (2) accumulated amortization of the difference 
between cost and net assets at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below); 
and other adjustments for disposition or writedown of investments.
    (ii) An income account to include (1) the investor's share of the 
investee's undistributed profits or losses for each reporting period 
subsequent to acquisition of the investment except that in the year of 
acquisition such amount shall be determined from the date of 
acquisition; (2) amortization for the reporting period of the difference 
between cost and net assets at date of acquisition. This account shall 
be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum account 
discussed in paragraph (iii) below.
    (iii) A retained earnings account to include (1) equity in the 
undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of 
acquisition; (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost 
and net assets acquired at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below).
    (iv) Other memorandum accounts will be needed for such adjustments 
as gains and losses on disposition of investments, recognition of 
impairments in value, the investor's share of extraordinary and prior 
period adjustments reported in the investee's financial statements (see 
instruction 1-2(d)), and provision for deferred taxes where it is 
reasonable to assume that undistributed earnings of an investee will be 
transferred to the investor in a taxable distribution. These memorandum 
accounts shall be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum 
account discussed in paragraph (iii) above.
    (3) The carrier shall retain the following information for each 
investee in support of the worksheet or memorandum accounts:
    (i) Original cost of investment.
    (ii) Equity in net assets of investee at date of acquisition.
    (iii) Allocation of difference between cost and equity in net 
assets, namely, to specific assets of investee or to goodwill.

[[Page 45]]

    (iv) Accumulated amortization of difference between cost and equity 
in net assets.
    (v) Unamortized balance of difference between cost and equity in net 
assets.
    (vi) Equity in undistributed earnings/losses for each year since 
date of acquisition.
    (vii) Dividends received since date of acquisition if determinable.
    (viii) Proceeds from sale of investments.
    (4) Any difference between the investor's cost and its share of the 
net assets of the investee at date of acquisition shall be allocated to 
specific assets of the investee to the extent the difference is 
attributable to them. When the difference is allocated to depreciable or 
amortizable assets, depreciation and amortization (through the 
investment and income memorandum accounts) should absorb the difference 
over the remaining life of the related assets. If the difference is not 
related to specific accounts, it should be considered goodwill and 
amortized over a reasonable period not to exceed 40 years. For 
investments made prior to November 1, 1970, amortization of goodwill is 
not required in the absence of evidence that the goodwill has a limited 
term of existence.
    (5) The financial statements of the investee that are used for 
equity accounting should be timely. If the accounting year of the 
investee differs from that of the investor then the most recent 
available financial statements may be used. The lag in reporting should 
be consistent from period to period.
    (6) Material profits or losses on transactions between the investor 
and investee shall be eliminated until realized by either company as if 
the two were consolidated.
    (7) A transaction of the investee of a capital nature that affects 
the investor's share of the investee's stockholder's equity should be 
reported in the financial statements as if the two were consolidated.
    (8) The investor shall deduct any dividends applicable to 
outstanding cumulative preferred stock whether or not declared, and any 
other dividends declared when computing its share of undistributed 
earnings or losses.
    (9) The investor shall suspend application of the equity method when 
the investment (including the investment memorandum account) together 
with any net advances made to the investee is reduced to zero. 
Additional losses shall not be provided for unless the investor has 
guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to 
provide further financial support for the investee. If the investee 
subsequently reports net income the investor shall resume applying the 
equity method at such time as its share of that net income equals the 
share of net losses not recognized during the period of suspension.
    (10) When the investor's voting stock interest falls below the level 
of ownership described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the 
investment no longer qualifies for the equity method. Should dividends 
received on the investment in subsequent periods exceed the investor's 
share of earnings for such periods, the investment memorandum and income 
memorandum accounts shall be reduced by the excess amount.
    (11) When the level of ownership of an investment increases to that 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the equity method 
shall be applied. The memorandum accounts for the investment, income 
(for current year's equity in undistributed earnings less amoritzation), 
and retained earnings (for prior years' equity in undistributed earnings 
less amortization) shall be adjusted retroactively on a step-by-step 
basis determining the equity in net assets at date of acquisition, 
amortization adjustment, and equity in undistributed earnings or losses 
at each level of ownership. Where small purchases are made over a period 
of time and then a purhase is made which qualifies the investment for 
the equity method, the date of latest purchase may be used as date of 
acquisition.
    (12) Information having significance with respect to the investor's 
ownership in investees shall be disclosed in notes to financial 
statements of annual reports filed with the Board in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
    (c) When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a 
discount

[[Page 46]]

(i.e., when total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, commissions, 
etc., is less than par), such discounts may be amortized over the 
remaining life of the securities through periodic debits to the account 
in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with entries 
recording interest accruals) and credits to the same account in which 
interest income is credited. No debits shall be made in respect to 
discounts upon securities held as investments or in special funds if 
there is reason to believe that such securities will be disposed of by 
redemption or otherwise at less than par or will not be paid at date of 
maturity. When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a 
premium (i.e., when the total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, 
commissions, etc., is in excess of par), such premium may be amortized 
over the remaining life of the securities through periodic credits to 
the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident 
with entries recording interest accruals) and debits to the same 
accounts in which the interest income is recorded.
    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules for equity accounting is 
needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the 
Board.
    5-3 Discounts, expenses, and premiums on debt. (a) Ledger accounts 
shall be provided to cover the discounts, expenses, and premiums on the 
sale or resale of each subclass of funded debt and of receivers' and 
trustees' securities issued for the benefit of or assumed by the 
company. (For explanation of subclass see account 765, Funded debt 
unmatured.) The net debit balances remaining in the ledger accounts for 
discount and premium shall be included in account 770.1, Unamortized 
debt discount, and the net credit balances in account 770.2, Unamortized 
premium on debt. Debt expense shall be included in account 743, Other 
deferred debits.
    (b) Each fiscal period there shall be charged to account 548, 
Amortization of discount on funded debt, a proportion on a consistent 
basis of each of the debit balances in the discount and premium accounts 
and correspondingly there shall be credited to income account 517, 
Release of premiums on funding debt, a similar proportion of each of the 
credit balances in these accounts. Related debt expense shall also be 
charged to account 548 on a proportional and consistent basis. The 
amounts for the respective debit balances for discount and expenses 
applicable to a particular issue of obligations may be charged directly 
to account 548 at time of issue when the aggregate of such amounts does 
not appreciably affect the accounts. The method of apportioning debt 
discount, issue costs, and premium to accounts 517 and 548 shall be the 
interest method, where the effective interest rate on the date of 
issuance is applied to the carrying value (debt, less related discount, 
and issue cost, plus related premium of each specific issue to the 
beginning of any given period.) However, other methods of amortization 
may be used if the results obtained are not materially different from 
those which would result from the interest method.
    (c) When any funded debt which has been actually issued to bona fide 
holders for value is reacquired by the accounting company, that 
proportion of the balance remaining in accounts containing discount, 
expense and premium on funded debt for the subclass of the security 
reacquired applicable to the portion reacquired shall be credited or 
charged thereto, as appropriate, and concurrently charged or credited to 
account 519, Miscellaneous income, account 551, Miscellaneous income 
charges; or to account 570, Extraordinary items, as appropriate, in 
accordance with the text of these accounts. Such proportion shall be 
based upon the ratio of the par value of the security reacquired to the 
par value of all the securities of the subclass actually outstanding 
immediately before such reacquirement. Gains and losses from 
extinguishment of debt (excluding debt maturing serially) which is 
acquired to satisfy sinking fund requirements, shall not be recorded as 
extraordinary items regardless of amount, but shall be included in 
accounts 519 and 551, as appropriate. Such gains and losses shall be 
separately disclosed in reports to this Board.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987]


[[Page 47]]


    5-4 Discount, premium, and assessment on capital stock. (a) Separate 
ledger accounts shall be provided for each subclass of capital stock 
issued or assumed by the accounting company to cover discount suffered 
and premium realized at the time of sale of capital stock. General 
levies or assessments against stockholders shall be credited to the 
appropriate ledger accounts for the subclass of capital stock against 
which the levy or assessment is made.
    (b) The total of net debit balance in these ledger accounts shall be 
included in account 793, Discount on capital stock, and the total of net 
credit balances in account 794, Premiums and assessments on capital 
stock.
    (c) Discount on each subclass of capital stock may be offset or 
reduced by charges to account 794, Premiums and assessments on capital 
stock, to the extent that net gains from premiums or assessments have 
been included therein or to account 795, Other capital, to the extent 
that net gains from reacquisition and resale or retirement of capital 
stock applicable to such subclass have been included therein. Any 
remaining discount may be amortized by charge to account 616. Other 
debits to retained earnings, or may be retained and carried in account 
793, Discount on capital stock, until the stock to which the discount 
applies is retired.
    (d) In case the accounting company is permitted and elects with the 
approval of the Board, to distribute all or any part of the net balance 
of other paid-in capital to its stockholders, the amount thus 
distributed shall be charged to account 795, Other capital.
    (e) When capital stock is reacquired, either by purchase or 
donation, and is retired or cancelled, account 791, Capital stock, shall 
be charged with the par value, stated value of no par stock, or if no 
par stock without stated value, the proportionate amount at which the 
particular class of stock is included in account 791. Any excess of 
reacquisition cost over the recorded value of the stock shall be charged 
to account 795, Other capital, to the extent of the accumulated net 
gains included in this account applicable to reacquisition and resale or 
retirement of such subclass. Any remaining excess reacquisition cost 
shall be charged to account 616, Other debits to retained earnings. Any 
excess of recorded value over reaquisition cost shall be credited to 
account 795, Other capital.
    (f) When capital stock is reacquired, either by purchase or 
donation, and is not retired or cancelled, nor properly includable in 
sinking or other funds, the reacquisition cost shall be charged to 
account 798.5, Treasury stock.
    (g) When treasury stock is resold, account 798.5, Treasury stock, 
shall be credited with the cost paid for it. Gains shall be credited to 
account 795, `Other capital.' Losses shall be charged to account 795, 
Other capital, to the extent that previous net gains from sales or 
retirements of the same class of stock are included therein; otherwise, 
to account 616, Other debits to retained earnings.
    5-5 Joint liabilities. The accounting company shall state as a 
liability in its balance sheet the difference between the total par 
value of securities jointly or severally issued by it and others and the 
portion of such liability which, under the joint arrangement, it is 
expected will be liquidated by the other party or parties to the joint 
arrangement. The amount of the jointly or severally issued securities 
expected to be liquidated by the other party or parties shall be shown 
as a contingent liability in accordance with instruction 5-6 pertaining 
to contingent assets and liabilities.
    5-6 Contingencies. (a) The proper accounting treatment for 
contingencies depends upon whether the contingency is: Probable: the 
event or events are likely to occur; Reasonably possible: the chance of 
occurrence of the future event or events is more than remote, but less 
than likely; or Remote: the chance of occurrence of the future event or 
events is slight.
    (b) Loss contingencies must be accrued when they are probable and 
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Where they are only 
reasonably possible, only footnote disclosure is required. Where they 
are remote, footnote disclosure is not required, but is permitted.
    (c) Gain contingencies usually are not reflected in the accounts 
since to do so might be to recognize revenue

[[Page 48]]

prior to its realization. Adequate disclosure shall be made of 
contingencies that might result in gain, but care shall be exercised to 
avoid misleading implications as to the likelihood of realization.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4326, Feb. 11, 1987]

    5-7 Long-term obligations. Commitments under unconditional purchase 
obligations associated with suppliers' financing arrangements and future 
payments on long-term borrowings and redeemable stock shall be disclosed 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Such 
disclosures shall not preclude accounting recognition if the substance 
of a financing arrangement is the acquisition of an asset or incurrence 
of a liability.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLEARING ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    6-1 Items to be charged. In recognition of the fact that certain 
expenditures incident to the construction and the operation of property 
are not chargeable directly to any particular property investment or 
expense account, clearing accounts have been provided for the purpose of 
securing an equitable distribution of such items to the proper primary 
accounts.
    6-2 Material and stationery store expenses. (a) To clearing accounts 
called Material store expenses and Stationery store expenses shall be 
charged expenses in connection with purchasing, handling and storing 
material and stationery in and distributing it from the company's 
storehouses. Including the pay of officers and employees in the 
purchasing and store departments and their traveling, office, and other 
expenses; also expenses, including wages, fuel, and supplies, of 
operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to the service 
of switching at material storehouses. (Expenses of incidental switching 
at material yards by locomotives in regular switching service shall be 
charged to the appropriate transportation accounts.) The pay and 
expenses of men employed in purchasing or inspecting a single class of 
material, such as ties, shall be added as store expenses to the cost of 
that particular material.
    (b) The total amount of storehouse expenses charged to these 
accounts shall be distributed among the accounts to which material and 
stationery has been charged, in proportion to the amounts charged to 
each account for the items issued, except that the amount representing 
the purchasing department expenses shall be apportioned on the value of 
the items issued which were purchased by that department. To avoid 
monthly fluctuations in the ratio of store expenses to the value of 
material and statonery purchased or issued, carriers may make a monthly 
apportionment on the basis of fair percentage rates, provided the store 
expense accounts are adjusted and closed out at the end of each year.
    6-3 Shop expenses. (a) To a clearing account entitled Shop expenses 
shall be charged items of expense at shops, enginehouses, repair tracks, 
and other places where mechanical work is performed, not assignable 
directly to specific accounts. Such expenses shall be apportioned among 
the various accounts affected. The basis of distribution shall be the 
relative proportion which the total amount of charges to Shop expenses 
bears to the total of the directly distributed labor. To avoid monthly 
fluctuations in the ratio of shop expenses to the total of distributed 
labor, carriers are permitted to make the monthly apportionment on the 
basis of a percentage of the distributed labor, provided the shop 
expense account is adjusted and closed out at the end of the year.
    (b) The expenses assignable to this account shall include the pay of 
foremen (who exercise supervision over all departments), their clerks, 
and other employees engaged in general work in and about shops, cost of 
heat, light and power; cost of small tools and supplies and water and 
power purchased; also cost of removal of snow and ice from transfer 
tables and shop yards, and other incidental shop expenses. To this 
account shall be charged expenses, including wages, fuel and supplies, 
of operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to 
switching service at shops (the expenses of incidental

[[Page 49]]

switching at shops by locomotives in transportation switching service 
shall be charged to appropriate transportation accounts).
    6-4 Gravel and sand pits and quarries. (a) When a gravel or sand pit 
or quarry is opened for operations likely to extend over a long period, 
an account shall be set up designated, Operations of gravel pit at ----
----------, or Operations of quarry at --------, as the case may be. To 
this account shall be charged cost of the land in excess of its 
estimated value after the gravel, sand, or stone has been removed 
(credit to the property account in which the cost of the land is 
included); payments for right to enter upon and remove ballast from land 
not owned by the carrier; cost of sinking test holes; and costs 
preparatory to opening the pit or quarry. To this account shall be 
charged also the cost, in excess of the estimated salvage value, of 
rails and fastenings, ties, other material and labor used in 
constructing tracks to and in the gravel pit or quarry (the estimated 
salvage being carried in an appropriate suspense account); cost of labor 
and train service employed in producing, quarrying, and loading ballast, 
including the cost of operation, repairs, and depreciation of power 
shovels and other machines and machinery; pay and expenses of watchmen; 
cost of explosives and hand tools, and miscellaneous expenses; and cost 
of installing, operating and maintaining signals and interlockers at 
gravel pits.
    (b) Credit to the clearing account shall be made each month to cover 
the cost of ballast material produced during the month. The cost of 
production shall include the expenses directly assignable to the monthly 
output plus a proportion of the expenses not directly assignable, such 
as cost of land, tracks, machinery, and interlockers. This latter amount 
shall be computed upon the basis of the ratio which the monthly output 
bears to the total estimated yardage to be taken from the pit. When any 
portion of the product of such pits or quarries is sold, the cost 
thereof shall be credited to this clearing account and any related 
profit shall be credited to account 110, Incidental.
    6-5 Power plant operations. (a) The accounting for the expenses of 
maintaining and operating an electric, steam, or other power plant (both 
building and machinery) shall be determined by the purpose for which the 
power produced is used. When a power plant is intended and used for 
producing power solely for the carrier's own operations and the cost of 
operating the plant is chargeable to clearing account Shop expenses, or 
to any one specific account for operating expenses, the expenses of 
maintenance shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance accounts, 
and the cost of operation to the account appropriate according to the 
use of the power.
    (b) When the power from such a plant is properly chargeable to more 
than one account, the expenses of maintaining and operating the plant 
shall be included in clearing account designated Power plant operations. 
The expense of maintenance shall be cleared from that account to the 
appropriate maintenance accounts. The expenses of operation shall be 
apportioned to the appropriate accounts upon the basis of quantity of 
power used for the various purposes.
    (c) When a part of the power produced by a power plant is sold and 
the remainder is used in the carrier's own operations, the cost of 
maintaining and operating the plant shall be charged to a clearing 
account. The expense of maintenance shall be cleared from that account 
to the appropriate maintenance accounts. The proportion of the expenses 
of operation assignable to the power sold, on the basis of ratio of 
quantity of power sold to total quantity of power produced, shall be 
credited to this clearing account and any related profit shall be 
credited to account 110, Incidental. The remainder of the cost of 
operation shall be distributed to the appropriate expense accounts for 
the carrier's own operations.
    (d) When power plants are intended and used solely for furnishing 
power to others, their investment cost shall be included in account 737, 
Property used in other than carrier operations, and the revenues and 
operating expenses shall be included in the accounts provided for 
operations of such property.

[[Page 50]]

    (e) The accounting for the maintenance of transmission systems and 
distribution systems shall be in accordance with instructions pertaining 
to power plant operations.

is converted, by filling, into an earth embankment, the ledger value of 
the structure, or of the portion thereof filled, shall be credited to 
this account. In case the bridge or trestle is used in lieu of a 
temporary trestle for the purpose of filling, the estimated cost of such 
temporary trestle shall be charged to account 3, ``Grading.'' The ledger 
value of the structure or portion thereof, filled, less the value of the 
salvage and the estimated cost of trestle charged to account 3 shall be 
charged to account 735, ``Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment 
property.''
    Note B: The cost of bridges to carry the carrier's tracks over 
undergrade crossings, including the necessary piers and abutments to 
sustain them, shall be included in this account.
7 Elevated structures.

is applicable to structures other than earthwork, which are for the 
purpose of elevating tracks above the grade of streets, and which are 
not properly classifiable as bridges or trestles.
    Note: The cost of stations and other structures built on elevated 
structures shall be accounted for according to the class of the 
structure and not in this account.
8 Ties.
    (a) This account shall include the cost of cross, switch, bridge and 
other track ties used in the construction of tracks for the movement or 
storage of locomotives and cars (including tracks in shop, fuel station, 
supply yard areas, etc.), and the cost of additional ties subsequently 
laid in such tracks. This account should also include the cost of labor 
for unloading, distributing and placing ties in tracks.
    (b) The cost of handling ties in general supply and storage yards 
shall be included as store expenses.
    Note: The cost of ties used in the construction of car floats shall 
be included in the cost of such floating equipment, and the cost of ties 
used in the construction of temporary tracks, such as gravel-pit and 
quarry tracks, shall be included in the appropriate clearing accounts.
    Note: Respacing crossties is to be considered maintenance and 
expense.

General Expenditures--Table of Contents

<R05>


70 General expenditures.
    The primary accounts of this general account are designed to include 
expenditures made in connection with the acquisition and construction of 
original road and equipment, and with extension, additions, and 
betterments to road and equipment property, when such expenditures 
cannot properly be included in any of the foregoing accounts as a part 
of the cost of any specific work. When assignable, such expenditures 
shall be included in the cost of the property for which the expenditures 
occurred.
76 Interest during construction.
    (a) When any bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness are 
sold, or any interest-bearing debt is incurred for acquisition and 
construction of original road and equipment, extensions, additions, and 
betterments, the interest accruing on the part of the debt representing 
the cost of property chargeable to road and equipment accounts (less 
interest, if any, allowed by depositaries on unexpended balances) after 
such funds become available for use and before the receipt or the 
completion or coming into service of the property so acquired shall be 
charged to this account.
    (b) When such securities are sold at a premium, the proportion of 
such premium assignable to the time between the date of the actual 
issuance of the securities and the time when the property acquired or 
the improvement made becomes available for service shall be credited to 
this account.
    (c) This account shall also include such proportion of the discount 
and expense on funded debt issued for the acquisition of original road, 
original equipment, road extensions, additions, and betterments, as is 
equitably assignable to the period between the date of the actual 
issuance of securities and the time when the property acquired or the 
improvement made become available for the service for which it is 
intended. The proportion of discount and expense thus chargeable shall 
be determined by the ratio between the period prior to the completion or 
coming into service of the facilities or improvements acquired and the 
period of the entire life of the securities issued.

    Note A: Interest on bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness 
accruing before the proceeds from the sale of the securities become 
available for use shall not be included in this account, nor shall there 
be included any interest accruing after the property with respect to 
which the proceeds are expended is received or becomes available for use 
in connection with commercial service.
    Note B: If securities issued or assumed by the carrier are 
subsequently sold or exchanged by or for the carrier, the excess of the 
par value and accrued interest of the securities over the actual money 
value of the consideration received shall be deemed a discount. In no 
case (except as provided in the third paragraph of this account) shall 
discount be included as part of the cost of items included in the 
accounts prescribed in this classification.
    Note C: Whenever interest, premium, or discount assignable to the 
construction period is incurred in connection with an expenditure 
covered by some specific road and equipment account or accounts, such 
interest, premium, or discount shall be charged directly to the specific 
accounts to which it

[[Page 66]]

is related. Unless provided for otherwise, interest costs shall be 
capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Note D: This account shall not include interest during the 
construction period on the carrier's own funds expended in connection 
with the acquisition or construction of original road and equipment, 
extensions, additions, and betterments.

Other Property Accounts--Table of Contents

<R05>


80 Other elements of investment.
    (a) This account shall include amounts resulting from adjustment of 
the primary property accounts to conform with cost of property in 
valuation records. The amount in this account shall be cleared on a 
consistent basis as property is retired from service or otherwise in 
accordance with the rules in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
account. Any material amount in this account assignable to property 
previously retired from service shall be cleared immediately.
    (b) When property is retired from service, an equitable portion of 
the balance in this account assignable to such property shall be cleared 
when the retirement entry is made. The amount so cleared, when a debit, 
shall be charged to account 551, Miscellaneous income charges, or, when 
a credit, shall be recorded in account 519, Miscellaneous income. The 
exception to this general rule with respect to a credit balance 
assignable to property retired is that when property classified as 
depreciable is retired from service and the balance in the accumulated 
depreciation account for the property is materially deficient, because 
of sudden retirement or other unusual cause, the portion of a credit 
balance cleared for the retirement, equal to the deficiency, shall be 
applied to reduce the amount of loss otherwise chargeable to the 
accumulated depreciation account.
    (c) A carrier may apply to the Board for authority to clear the 
entire balance from this account immediately or amortize the balance 
over a short period of time by appropriate inclusion in account 616, 
Other debits to retained earnings, or account 606 Other credits to 
retained earnings. Any amount so authorized or directed by the Board to 
be cleared and written off to retained income shall be in lieu of 
amounts includible in accounts indicated in paragraph (b).
    (d) Other plans for clearance, disposition, or classification of a 
balance in this account in conformity with sound accounting principles 
may be submitted to the Board with suitable details for consideration. 
This includes application for disposition of a balance in this account 
attributable to reduction of capitalization in a reorganization. An 
accounting procedure so applied for shall become effective only after 
Board approval. Each carrier shall maintain a record of items initially 
included in and cleared later from this account and the basis used in 
computing such items.
    Note: The amounts attributable to past mergers, consolidations and 
purchases of property included in this account shall be merged with the 
adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this text.
90 Construction in progress.
    This account shall include expenditures incurred by the carrier in 
the process of constructing road and equipment with its own forces or 
under contract during the period prior to the time property is placed in 
transportation operations, including cost of materials and supplies 
located at point of use and of necessary land acquired for such 
projects. When a project is completed or when a segment of a large 
project is completed and placed in service, the cost of the completed 
project or the completed segment thereof shall be transferred to the 
appropriate road and equipment primary accounts. Separate subaccounts 
may be maintained for road, equipment, or other classes of expenditures. 
Expenditures for relatively unimportant projects may be included 
directly in primary accounts.

\1\ Each operating expense account has a six-digit code divided into three two-digit groups. The first two-digit group denotes the natural expense [see control column], the second group
  denotes the activity/subactivity for freight, passenger or common service [see Table F]; and the third group signifies applicable function assignment [see Tables B, C, D & E].
\2\ The account numbers shown on this matrix are for freight only. The account numbers for passenger and common are derived by applying the natural expense code (first two digits) to the
  activity codes shown in Table F. Natural expenses are used only in the same activities as shown for freight.
\3\ Expenses shall be reported by applicable functions [see account text].

Specialized Services Operations Subactivity--(XX-34-XX)
    (4) Specialized Services Operations subactivity of the 
Transportation activity refers to operating services which are 
specialized in nature and in cost characteristics, including all of 
those so designated by the Board. The purpose of segregating the cost of 
such services is primarily to preclude distortion of general costs 
applicable to the Train Operations and Yard Operations subactivities. 
Secondarily, further breakout of the costs of operating individual 
specialized services can be provided in less detail than the full range 
of natural expense accounts, in reports used for recurring cost analysis 
purposes pertaining to each type of specialized service.
    The designated specialized services operations are as follows:
    (a) TOFC/COFC Operations refers to the function of operating rail-
to-ground or water and ground or water-to-rail transfer facilities for 
handling trailers or containers, including related storage; and the 
highway movement of trailers or containers within a terminal area for

dedicated yard serving the facility, or switching within the dedicated 
supporting terminal facility when performed by yard crews. They also do 
not include costs appropriate to the Way and Structures, Equipment, or 
General and Administrative activities.
    Floating operations should be classified by line and terminal 
operations. The distribution should be made based on the nature of the 
operation and not the facility or equipment. When the service occurs 
between distinct terminals, the operation should be considered a line 
operation. When the service is conducted within a general terminal or 
harbor area, the operation should be considered a terminal operation.
    (c) Coal Terminal Operations and Ore Terminal Operations refers to 
operations of rail-to-water or water-to-rail transloading facilities for

    Carrier staff, administrative, or clerical operations related to 
operating or transportation department general administration should not 
be charged to this subactivity. The Administrative Support Operations 
subactivity may be performed at local stations, regional offices, or 
even at the general offices; however, the location of the operation 
performance does not affect its nature. The operations included in this 
subactivity should reasonably correlate to the quantity of shipments or 
to the quantity of carloadings.
General and Administrative Activity--(XX-60-XX)
    (D) General and Administrative activity refers to the providing of 
overall administration or other general support for carrier operations. 
It comprehends only that portion of general and administrative

charged, as they accrue, to the appropriate accounts.
712 Material and supplies.
    (a) This account shall include the balances representing the cost of

allowance shall be made for any purchase discounts allowed. The cost

their net realizable value.
    (d) Material and supplies shall be credited to this account and

system, provided that such system is consistently applied and is based 
on the cost of such material and supplies.
    (e) An inventory of material and supplies shall be taken during each 
calendar year and the necessary adjustments to bring this account into 
harmony with the actual inventory balances shall be made in the accounts 
of the year in which the inventories are taken. In effecting this 
adjustment, determined differences in accounting for important classes 
of material shall be equitably assigned among the accounts to which the 
classes of material are ordinarily chargeable. Other differences shall 
be equitably apportioned among the primary accounts to which material 
has been charged since the last inventory. (Also see instruction 5-
1(b).)
    Note: Balances representing the cost of unapplied construction 
material and supplies located at the point of use, which have been 
purchased for projected new roads and extensions, or for new railroad

includes:
    1. Controlled companies, including companies solely controlled by 
the accounting company, and also companies jointly controlled by the 
accounting company and others under a joint arrangement.
    2. Controlling companies, including both companies solely 
controlling the accounting company, and companies which jointly control 
the accounting company under a joint arrangement.
    3. Companies controlled by controlled companies.
    4. Companies controlled by controlling companies.

By control (also see definition 5(a)) is meant the ability to determine 
the action of a corporation. For the purposes of this account, the 
following are to be considered forms of control:
    (a) Right through title to securities issued or assumed to exercise 
the major part of the voting power in the controlled corporation.
    (b) Right through agreement or source other than title to 
securities, to name the majority of the board of directors, managers, or 
trustees of the controlled corporation.
    (c) Right to foreclose a first lien upon all or a major part in 
value of the tangible property of the controlled corporation.
    (d) Right to secure control because of advances made for 
construction of the operating property of the controlled corporation.
    (e) Right to control only in a specific respect the action of the 
controlled corporation.

A leasehold interest in the property of a corporation is not considered 
a form of control over the lessor corporation.
    Sole control is that which rests in one corporation.
    Joint control is that which rests in two or more corporations and 
which is held under a joint arrangement.
    Note C: The value of securities borrowed by the accounting company 
and pledged shall not be included in this account. A memorandum record

of security for funded debt or short-term loans shall be included in 
accounts 715, ``Sinking funds,'' 716, ``Capital funds,'' or 717, ``Other

issued; and (2) certificates or other evidences of funded debt issued 
and actually outstanding, being those not held by the company, its

    (c) The amounts included herein shall be further divided so as to 
show the amount of each class of funded debt, as follows:

earned.

for by the other subdivisions of this account, also notes, unsecured 
certificates of indebtedness, debenture bond, plain bonds, real estate 
mortgages executed or assumed and other similar obligations maturing 
more than one year from date of issue, but excluding liabilities for 
assessments for public improvements and those evidenced by conditional

accounts 782, ``Other liabilities,'' and 766, ``Equipment obligations,'' 
respectively.
    (5) Receipts outstanding for funded debt. Receipts for payments on 
account of funded debt. When certificates are issued for such payments, 
the par value

[[Page 121]]

shall be included in the account covering the class of funded debt for 
which the certificates are issued.
    (d) Each of the above classes shall also be divided into subclasses 
according to differences in mortgage or other lien or security therefor, 
rate of interest, interest dates, or date of maturity. Parts of any 
issue agreeing in other characteristics but maturing serially may be 
treated as of the same subclass.
    (e) Records shall be maintained in such manner as to show (1) 
securities the issuance or assumption of which has been authorized by 
the Board under provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, and similar 
securities issued or assumed prior to the effective date of such

account shall be adjusted through the expense accounts so as to reflect 
the probable liability at the close of each accounting period for claims

clearance of balances in accrued liability subaccounts which were 
originally established by authority of the Board.

liability included in this account shall be transferred to account 759, 
``Accrued accounts payable.''

    This account shall include the amount of matured and unpaid interest 
(for which no provision has been made for current settlement) on all

account 503 concurrently credited with any remaining associated amounts. 
(See instruction 1-15.)

Transportation Act (90 Stat. 131) or section 402(c)(1)(A) of the 3R Act 
(87 Stat. 985) or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.
    Railroad means a common carrier by railroad, as defined in section 
1(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 1(3)).
    3R Act means the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, Pub. L. 
93-236, 87 Stat. 985, as amended.
    4R Act means the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act 
of 1976, Pub. L. 94-210, 90 Stat. 31.
    XX, when used in place of digits in a six-digit account number, 
means that all accounts containing the remaining four-digits are 
included. Example: 11-21-XX refers to all salary and wage accounts for 
locomotives because 11 designates salaries and wages and 21 designates 
locomotives. Thus, 11-21-XX includes all of the following accounts: 11-
21-01; 11-21-40; 11-21-48; 11-21-39; and 11-21-99. Similarly, XX-31-67 
means all accounts containing 31 (train operations) and 67 (locomotive 
fuel).

910 Purpose and scope.
    Section 205(e)(1)(A) of the 3R Act directs the office to issue 
regulations which will permit the collection and publication by the 
Consolidated Rail Corp. (ConRail), or by profitable railroads of 
information necessary to determine accurately the revenues attributable, 
avoidable costs, and service units of light-density lines scheduled for 
abandonment. This accurate information is intended to facilitate the 
determination of the revenues and avoidable costs in abandonment 
proceedings and in potential offers of subsidy. This information is 
intended to be compatible with the Regional Subsidy Standards, for those 
lines which were not conveyed to ConRail under the final system plan and 
with the National Subsidy Standards (49 CFR Part 1152, Subpart D), for 
all other lines. The purpose of the Branch Line Accounting System 
regulations is to specify an accounting system for the collection and 
publication of this information.

FR 57533, Sept. 11, 2002]
920 Collection of data.
    (a) Lines for which data collection is required. The railroad shall 
collect data on all branch lines which meet the criteria listed in 
paragraphs 1 through 4 below. The data to be collected are specified in 
section 920(b).
    (1) Branch lines in categories (1), (2), and (3) on the System 
Diagram Map include, respectively, lines for which a carrier intends to 
file an abandonment application within three years, lines which the 
carrier has under study and are potentially subject to abandonment, and 
lines for which an abandonment application is pending before the Board. 
The collection of data on such lines shall commence on the first day of 
the month after the line has been designated in one of the categories 
and will continue so long as the branch line is retained in one of these 
categories. The assignment and apportionment

[[Page 140]]

methodology set forth in Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy 
Standards), shall be applied.
    (2) For branch lines operated under an order directing service, 
under section 304(d)(3) of the 3R Act, data shall be collected from the 
effective date of the order until the order is withdrawn.
    (3) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation 
agreement under section 1a(6)(a) of the IC Act, data shall be collected 
from the effective date of the agreement until the termination of the 
agreement. The assignment and apportionment methodology set forth in 
Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.
    (4) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation 
agreement under section 304 of the 3R Act, data collection shall 
commence on the effective date of the agreement and shall continue until 
the termination date of the agreement.
    (b) Data to be collected. The data collected shall include the items 
of revenue, expense, and service units which are specified in 49 CFR 
1152, as described in the account texts listed in section 950. The 
format for presentation of these data is specified in section 940.

FR 57533, Sept. 11, 2002]
930 Publication of data.
    (a) General. The railroad shall file on or before June 30 of each 
calendar year the certification included in these regulations as 
Appendix I. The railroad shall include a description of each branch line 
using the format set forth in Appendix I of these regulations. The 
description of each branch line requires the same data as that submitted 
under 49 CFR 1152.11. This section prescribes the branch line 
information required in conjunction with the system diagram maps 
specifying the line's designation, states and counties traversed, 
delineation of mileposts, and location of agency and terminal stations.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Access to records. The records, accounts, working papers, and 
other documents reflecting the revenues, cost, and service unit data of 
each branch line for which the railroad must maintain data shall be made 
available for inspection and examination by the Board and, for lines 
situated within its State, by the designated State agency at a time and 
place mutually agreeable to the parties. The railroad shall also 
reproduce such records for the designated State agency, provided the 
agency pays the reasonable cost thereof.
    (d) Waivers and modifications. The STB's Office of Economics, 
Environmental Analysis, and Administration may, with respect to 
individual requests, upon good cause shown, waive or modify any 
requirement of this section not required by law.

account shall also include the revenue from the detention of trailers 
and containers used in TOFC/COFC service, incident to loading and 
unloading, upon the basis of tariff rates.
    Note: This account shall be maintained so as to reflect separately 
(1) revenue from detention of cars, and (2) revenue from detention of 
trailers and containers used in TOFC/COFC service.
    110 Incidental. This account is designed to show the amounts which 
the carrier becomes entitled to receive from services rendered 
incidentally with rail-line and water-line transportation; for the use 
of facilities of which the expenses for operation and maintenance are 
not separable from railway expenses and from incidental sources not 
provided for elsewhere. Among the items included in this account are 
revenues derived from (1) hotels and restaurants, (2) operations 
conducted at stations and on trains by individual or companies other 
than railway companies, (3) storage, (4) the sale of electric power, (5) 
renting property operated and maintained in connection with the property 
used in the carrier's transportation operations and from railway 
operations not provided for elsewhere.
    121 Joint facility, credit. This account shall include the carrier's 
proportion of revenue collected by others in connection with the 
operation of joint tracks, yards, terminals, and other facilities, 
including revenue from hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, sale of 
power, and other miscellaneous operations.

    Note A: The purpose of this account is to show the amounts of 
revenue from the operation of joint tracks, yards, terminals and other 
facilities operated by other companies, which under existing contracts 
or agreements are credited by the operating company to the tenant 
companies which participate therein. The bill rendered by any creditor 
company against a debtor company for the latter's proportion of the 
expense of maintenance and operation of joint facilities, which includes 
also a credit covering a proportion of the revenue to be paid over, 
shall show the distribution of the credit for such proportion of the 
revenue separately from the distribution of the expense of operation.
    Note B: No credits shall be made to this account representing 
amounts creditable by the operating company to primary accounts 101-103, 
105, and 110.
    122 Joint facility, debit. This account shall include that 
proportion of revenue from the operation of joint tracks, yards, 
terminals, and other facilities, which is creditable to other companies, 
including revenue from hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, sale of 
power, and other miscellaneous operations.

    Note A: The purpose of this account is to show the amount of revenue 
from operation of a terminal company or other carrier which, under the 
terms of existing contracts or agreements covering the joint use of 
tracks, yards, and other facilities, is credited to other carriers that 
participate in the benefits from such joint use. The bill rendered by a 
creditor company against a debtor company for the latter's proportion of 
expense of maintaining and operating joint facilities, which includes a 
credit covering the debtor company's proportion of the revenues from 
operation of such joint facilities, shall indicate separately the proper 
distribution of both the revenues and the expenses included in the bill, 
and such distribution shall be adhered to the debtor.
    Note B: No debits shall be made to this account representing amounts 
creditable by the operating company to primary accounts 101-103, 105, 
and 110.

                          List of Instructions


<R05>
Sec. 1242.00  Separation of common operating expenses.

    (a) Commencing with annual reports for the year 1978 or for any 
portion thereof until further order, all class I railroad companies 
including class I switching and terminal companies subject to section 20 
of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended shall separate operating 
expenses common to both freight service and passenger service in 
accordance with the regulation in this part.
    (b) The carrier shall maintain records supporting its common 
operating expense apportionments to freight and passenger services. The 
carrier shall report common expense apportionments to the Board as 
required.

43 FR 7637, Feb. 24, 1978, as amended at 67 FR 57534, Sept. 11, 2002]

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 1242.01  Expenses solely related to freight service and passenger service.

    The Uniform System of Accounts for Railroad Companies (49 CFR part 
1201) requires that carriers assign directly to freight service or to 
passenger service, including allied services, the expenses, taxes, and 
purchased services incurred solely for the benefit of either freight or 
passenger service.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.02  Common expenses.

    The Uniform System of Accounts also requires that carriers assign to 
common expense accounts the remaining expenses, taxes and purchased 
services which are not solely related to either freight or passenger 
service. The

[[Page 173]]

following instructions govern the separation of common expense accounts 
between freight and passenger services.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.03  Made by accounting divisions.

    The separation shall be made by accounting divisions, where such 
divisions are maintained, and the aggregate of the accounting divisions 
reported for the quarter and for the year.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.04  Special tests.

    When the separation of common expense accounts between freight and 
passenger services is based upon special tests or service unit factors, 
such tests shall be made at sufficiently frequent intervals to represent 
actual operating conditions. The service unit factors used are those of 
the reporting period.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.05  Operating expense account number notation.

    (a) The operating expense account numbers consist of a six-digit 
coding structure divided into three two-digit groups. The first two-
digit group denotes natural expenses; the second group denotes 
activities/subactivities for freight, passenger or common service; and 
the third group signifies applicable function assignment.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03MR91.050

    (b) For reporting purposes, four natural expense categories are 
utilized. The categories are: salaries and wages (account 11-XX-XX); 
material, tools, supplies, fuels and lubricants (account 21-XX-XX); 
purchased services (accounts 31-XX-XX to 41-XX-XX, inclusive); and 
general (accounts 61-XX-XX to 65-XX-XX, inclusive, 51-XX-XX, 52-XX-XX, 
53-XX-XX and 12-XX-XX).
    (c) The symbol ``XX'' in the first two-digit group is used 
throughout the separation instructions to denote more than one natural 
expense associated with the same activity/subactivity-function account 
structure. For reporting purposes, the natural expense account numbers 
represented by ``XX'' include:

11--Salaries and wages;
21--Materials, tools, supplies, fuels, and lubricants;
30 or 41--Purchased services:
    30--Summation of certain purchased service accounts;
    41--Other purchased services;
61--General.

    (d) The ``30'' natural expense designation indicates a summation of 
specific purchased service accounts that are reported in total rather 
than individually. The specific accounts under the way and structures 
activity except for administration functions include 39-1X-XX, repairs 
billed by others, Dr.; 40-1X-XX, repairs billed to others, cr.; and 41-
1X-XX, other purchased services. For the equipment activity excluding 
administration functions, the ``30'' designation denotes the summation 
of 39-2X-XX and 41-2X-XX.
    (e) The ``41'' natural expense designation (other purchased 
services) is the purchased service category of the ``XX'' code for the 
following:
    (1) Way and structures activity administration--function accounts,
    (2) Equipment activity administration--function accounts,
    (3) Transportation activity expense accounts, and
    (4) General and administration activity expense accounts.
    (f) The ``61'' general natural expense designation is applicable to 
all accounts with the ``XX'' symbol except transportation, train and 
yards accounts (XX-(33/43/53)-XX).
    (g) The natural expense account number ``50'' is used throughout the 
separation instructions to indicate the summation of accounts 52-XX-XX, 
Other casualties, and 53-XX-XX, Insurance, that are reported as one 
item, ``Casualties and Insurance,'' (50-XX-XX).
    (h) The number ``98'' in the function account group (last two 
digits) is used in the separation rules to designate the summation of a 
natural expense consisting of more than one functional assignment that 
is reported as one item. This includes Repairs Billed to Others, Cr.--
Equipment (40-2X-XX). For example, the locomotive subactivity contains 
accounts 40-(21/24/26)-40, 40-(21/24/26)-41, and 40-(21/24/26)-48 which 
are treated as 40-(21/24/26)-98.

<R05>
Sec. 1242.06  Instructions for separation.

    (a) Certain instructions for separating common expense accounts 
(dependent accounts) between freight and passenger services base the 
allocation on the proportional freight/passenger separation of other 
common expense accounts (independent accounts). The dependent account is 
frequently identified by an ``XX'' symbol in the natural expense 
position (first two digits) with corresponding independent accounts also 
identified by the ``XX'' natural expense symbol. Unless otherwise 
stated, the applicable natural expense associated with ``XX'' symbol 
shall be the same for both the dependent and independent accounts.
    (b) To illustrate, Sec. 1242.10 provides instructions for 
separating common Way and Structures, Administration--Track accounts 
(dependent accounts) designated by XX-19-02. The separation is based on 
certain other common Way and Structures accounts including Roadway--
Running, XX-17-10, and Roadway--Switching, XX-18-10.
    (c) As Sec. 1242.05 states, the ``XX'' symbol denotes the following 
natural expenses for Way and Structures administration functions:

11--Salaries and wages,
21--Materials, tools, supplies, fuels, and lubricants,
41--Other purchased services, and
61--General.


These natural expenses shall be individually applied to the separation 
rules in Sec. 1242.10. In each case, the independent accounts providing 
the basis for freight/passenger separation of the dependent account 
shall have the same natural expense designation. For example, the basis 
of separating account 11-19-02, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, 
Administration--Track, would be based on certain independent accounts 
including 11-17/18-10, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, Running/
Switching, Repair and Maintenance, Roadway.

accounting division, separate the common expenses on the basis of the 
directly assigned expenses in this account for the particular accounting 
division. If the sum of the direct freight and the direct passenger 
expenses does not aggregate 50 percent of the total charges for an 
accounting division, the common expenses shall be separated on the basis 
of special test. If common expenses exist in an accounting division but 
the direct expenses are applicable to only one service, i.e., freight or 
passenger, and even though the direct charges are over 50 percent of the 
total charges, the common expenses shall be separated on the basis of a 
special test. If the accounting is performed on a system basis rather 
than by accounting division, follow the intent of the above 
instructions.

<R05>
Sec. 1244.1  Definitions.

    (a) Railroad--an individual railroad or terminal company subject to 
the Interstate Commerce Act and every receiver, trustee, executor, 
administrator or assignee of any such railroad. If a railroad and its 
railroad subsidiaries report to the Board on a consolidated basis, they 
would collectively be considered as a railroad.
    (b) A railroad subsidiary--a railroad owned or controlled by another 
railroad.
    (c) A waybill, which may be referred to by other names such as mine 
tickets, is the document or instrument prepared from the bill of lading 
contract or shipper's instructions as to the disposition of the freight, 
and used by the railroad(s) involved as the authority to move the 
shipment and as the basis for determining the freight charges and 
interline settlements.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.2  Applicability.

    (a) Effective July 1, 1981 and thereafter, unless otherwise ordered, 
each railroad as defined in Sec. 1244.1 above is required to file 
waybill sample information for all line-haul revenue waybills terminated 
on its lines if it terminates at least 4,500 revenue carloads in

[[Page 185]]

any of the three preceding years, or if it terminates at least 5% of the 
revenue carloads terminating in any state in any of the three preceding 
years. A railroad required to file waybill sample information under this 
section shall herein be referred to as subject railroad.
    (b) Waybill terminations shall include all line-haul revenue 
movements terminating for waybilling purposes on the subject railroad's 
line whether the lading is destined for the terminating station as 
denoted on the waybill or the shipment is being rebilled or forwarded to 
the ultimate destination by another railroad or another mode of 
transportation (e.g., lake cargo, inbound transit, or other rebilled 
movements).
    (c) Each subject railroad shall also file the required waybill 
sample information for all of its railroad subsidiaries.
    (d) Each subject railroad shall also file the required waybill 
sample information for any other railroad for which it performs revenue 
billing and/or interline settlements under special agreement.
    (e) The surviving corporate entity of railroads (subject to the 
Interstate Commerce Act) who have merged or reorganized shall be 
required to report waybill sample information if its predecessor 
railroad or any of its predecessor railroads were required to report 
under this section.
    (f) In order to determine the number of carloads terminated in each 
state, railroads not otherwise submitting waybill information must 
report annually the number of carloads terminated by state for the last 
calendar year. These reports shall be submitted by March 1 of the year 
following the report year.
    (g) Transition. This final rule will apply to all subject waybills 
which are in the subject railroad's audit month of July 1981 and all 
audit months thereafter. The former rule will continue to apply to all 
subject waybills for the prior audit months up to and including June 
1981.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.3  Reporting contract shipment waybills and Canadian and Mexican 

international waybills.

    (a) All railroads shall identify (flag) contract shipment waybills.
    (b) The revenue associated with contract shipments may be encrypted 
(masked) to safeguard the confidentiality of the contract rates.
    (1) Upon written request, the Board will provide a masking procedure 
for a railroad's use or will mask the contract revenues when the Waybill 
Sample is filed with the Board.
    (2) When a railroad intends to use its own proprietary masking 
procedure, those procedures, and any changes in those procedures, must 
be approved by the Board thirty (30) days prior to their use.
    (3) All railroads that use a proprietary masking procedure, and 
intend to continue to use the same procedure, must certify, by letter to 
the Board, prior to January 31 each year, that the contract revenue 
masking procedures are unchanged.
    (4) All correspondence and certifications concerning masking 
procedures should be addressed to: Director, Office of Economics, 
Environmental Analysis, and Administration, Surface Transportation 
Board, Washington, DC 20423-0001, ATTN: WAYBILL COORDINATOR.
    (c) Railroads moving traffic on the U.S. rail system to the Canadian 
or Mexican border shall include a representative sample of such 
international export traffic in the Waybill Sample.
    (d) Railroads shall identify (flag) such movements as international 
traffic in the waybill records.
    (e) Railroads may report information on the complete rail routing or 
report only information related to the U.S. portion of the movement.
    (f) Railroads may mask revenue divisions associated with cross-
border traffic following the masking procedures set forth in paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section.

[65 FR 37711, June 16, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 53735, Oct. 24, 2001]


<R05>
Sec. 1244.4  Sampling of waybills.

    (a) Subject railroads shall file waybill sample information in one 
of the

[[Page 186]]

following two ways. (1) Authenticated copies of a sample of audited 
revenue waybills--the manual system (Sec. 1244.3(b)). (2) A computer 
tape containing specified information from a sample of waybills--the 
computerized system (Sec. 1244.3(c)).
    (b) The Manual System. (1) The sample of subject waybills shall be 
as follows:
    (i) All waybills with less than 6 carloads per waybill whose serial 
numbers are 1 or end in 01,
    (ii) All waybills with 6 to 25 carloads per waybill whose serial 
numbers end in 1; and,
    (iii) All waybills with 26 or more carloads per waybill whose serial 
numbers end in 1 or 7.
    (2) The expected sampling rates for the manual system are as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Expected
                Numbers of carloads on waybill                   sample
                                                                  rate
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 to 5........................................................    1/100
6 to 25.......................................................     1/10
26 and over...................................................      1/5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Upon giving the subject roads 60 days notice, the Board may 
require random serial number endings in lieu of the respective endings 
shown in Sec. 1244.3(b). These random serial number endings would have 
the expected sample rates shown in Sec. 1244.3(b)(2).
    (4) If the subject waybills have no waybill numbers or serial 
numbers, or have seriously flawed waybill or serial numbers, then the 
subject railroad should serialize those documents in blocks of 1,000 or 
blocks of multiples of 1,000 (e.g., 1, 2, . . . 1,000; 1, 2, . . .) and 
use these constructed serial numbers for selection purposes.
    (c) The Computerized System. (1) The tape shall be required to 
conform to the standards and format specified in Statement No. 81-1, 
Procedure for Sampling Waybill Records by Computer, issued by the 
Surface Transportation Board, which may be revised from time to time.
    (2) The sampling rates for the computerized system are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  Sample
                  Number of carloads on waybill                    rate
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 to 2..........................................................    1/40
3 to 15.........................................................    1/12
16 to 60........................................................     1/4
61 to 100.......................................................     1/3
101 and over....................................................     1/2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Controls and Annual Counts. (1) Each subject railroad shall 
maintain a control procedure to ensure complete and accurate reporting 
for the waybill sampling. All pertinent waybill data shall be included 
on hard copy waybill submissions including inbound references for 
transit waybills. All such pertinent waybill data shall be legible.
    (2) All subject railroads shall maintain a record of the number of 
line-haul revenue carloads that terminated on their line in a calendar 
year and shall furnish this number when requested by the Board.
    (3) All subject railroads using the manual system of reporting shall 
furnish the Board, in accordance with instructions on the Transmittal 
Form OPAD-2, the total counts of line-haul revenue waybills terminated 
in each reporting period for the following three categories:
    (i) Waybills, with less than six carloads per waybill,
    (ii) Waybills with 6 to 25 carloads per waybill, and
    (iii) Waybills with 26 or more carloads per waybill.
    (4) All subject railroads on the computerized system of reporting 
shall furnish the Board the control counts and tape specification 
information as required by the Statement No. 81-1.
    (5) Certification by a responsible officer of the subject railroad 
as to the completeness and accuracy of sample shall be made once a year 
in accordance with the instructions on the Transmittal Forms OPAD-1 or 
OPAD-2.

<R05>
Sec. 1244.5  Date of filing.

    (a) The reporting period for which subject railroads submit waybill 
sample information shall be the audit (accounting) month except as 
specified below:

[[Page 187]]

    (1) Subject railroads using the computerized system may submit 
waybill sample information quarterly as specified in Statement 81-1.
    (2) Subject railroad using the manual system may submit waybill 
sample information quarterly if it submits fewer than 1,000 waybills per 
year.
    (b) Waybill sample information shall be forwarded no later than 60 
days from the end of the reporting period to the Board.
    (c) When the submitted waybill sample information is returned to the 
submitting railroad for correction, that railroad shall resubmit 
corrected data to the Board promptly but no later than 60 days after its 
receipt.
    (d) Transmittal Forms. (1) Subject railroads using the manual system 
of reporting shall complete the Transmittal Form OPAD-2, to accompany 
each waybill sample submission.

<R05>
Sec. 1244.6  Retention of files.

    (a) Subject railroads which submit waybill sample data by the 
computerized system instead of the manual system shall retain the 
underlying hard copy waybills or facsimilies capable of producing 
legible copies, which shall be complete including inbound references for 
transit waybills, for a minimum period of four years.
    (b) This file of retained waybills shall be maintained in such a 
manner that the railroads on the computerized system may readily 
retrieve waybill copies using the waybill identifier code as shown on 
the submitted computerized waybill record.

[46 FR 26784, May 15, 1981. Redesignated at 65 FR 37711, June 16, 2000]


<R05>
Sec. 1244.7  Special studies.

    (a) Although routine submission of hard copy waybills is eliminated 
when a railroad reports under the computerized system, the Board may 
order that railroad to submit hard copies of the underlying waybills for 
special studies.
    (b) The Board may order the subject railroads to supply additional 
data for submitted waybill copies or records for special studies.

<R05>
Sec. 1244.9  Procedures for the release of waybill data.

    (a) General. The procedures for the release of waybill data identify 
five classes of users of the STB Waybill Sample, define the waybill 
information or data that each class of users may obtain, and set forth 
the applicable requirements for the data's release. They also formalize 
notice and protest procedures for the possible release of waybill data 
to other users to protect against the inappropriate release of 
confidential data. The Director of the Office of Economics, 
Environmental Analysis, and Administration shall be responsible for 
releasing waybill data in accordance with these procedures.
    (b) Class of user, available data, and applicable release 
requirements--(1) Railroads. Each requesting railroad may obtain any 
waybill record from the STB Waybill Sample covering traffic that 
originated, terminated, or was bridged by that railroad. The railroad 
shall not have access to waybill data pertaining to traffic in which it 
did not participate. Also, it must meet all STB and legal requirements 
concerning release of shipper information in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
11910(a).
    (2) Federal agencies. Each requesting Federal agency (including 
quasi-governmental agencies) may obtain any waybill record from the STB 
Waybill Sample subject to the following requirements:
    (i) The Federal agency shall make the information contained in the 
STB

[[Page 188]]

Waybill Sample available only to its employees or those contractors 
working on the particular project or study requiring the waybill data.
    (ii) The Federal agency will ensure that railroads and shippers are 
afforded the same privilege and protection against disclosure of the 
waybill data as the Board provides.
    (iii) The Federal agency will not release any data to the public 
unless the data elements are aggregated to contain at least three 
shippers and to prevent identification of an individual railroad.
    (iv) The Federal agency will refer any requests for waybill data and 
accompanying documentation to the STB for processing and will so inform 
the requesting party of such referral to the Board.
    (v) The Federal agency must sign an agreement annually with the 
Board agreeing to these restrictions.
    (3) States. Each requesting State may obtain any waybill record 
pertaining to traffic that was originated, terminated, interchanged in, 
or that passed through its State subject to the same requirements 
imposed on federal agencies under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of 
this section.
    (4) Transportation practitioners, consulting firms, and law firms--
specific proceedings. Transportation practitioners, consulting firms and 
law firms may use data from the STB Waybill Sample in preparing verified 
statements to be submitted in formal proceedings before the STB and/or 
State Boards (Board) subject to the following requirements:
    (i) The STB Waybill Sample is the only single source of the data or 
obtaining the data from other sources is burdensome or costly, and the 
data is relevant to issues pendng before the Board.
    (ii) The requestor submits to the STB a written waybill request that 
complies with Sec. 1244.8(e).
    (iii) All waybill data must be returned to the STB, and the firm 
must not keep any copies.
    (iv) A transportation practitioner, consulting firm, or law firm 
must submit any evidence drawn from the STB Waybill Sample to the Board 
only unless the evidence is aggregated to the level of at least three 
shippers and will prevent the identification of an individual railroad. 
Nonaggregated evidence submitted to the Board will be made part of the 
public record only if the Board finds that it does not reveal 
competitively sensitive data. However, evidence found to be sensitive 
may be provided to counsel or other independent representatives for 
other parties subject to the usual and customary protective order issued 
by the Board or appropriate authorized official.
    (v) For each Board proceeding, a firm must sign a confidentiality 
agreement with the STB agreeing to the above restrictions before any 
data will be released. This agreement will permit use of the released 
data for a period of one year from the date the agreement is signed by 
the user. If the data is required for an additional period of time 
because a proceeding is still pending before the Board, the firm must 
sign a new confidentiality agreement covering the data needed for each 
additional year the proceeding is opened.
    (5) Public use. Nonconfidential waybill data may be obtained from 
the ``Public Use Waybill File''. Reports produced from the Public Use 
Waybill File may be used, published, or released. The Public Use Waybill 
File contains the following nonconfidential items:

the data; describe the type of waybill data requested; and state the 
purpose for which the data is requested. The notice shall include a 
statement that parties seeking information concerning the filing of 
objections should refer to Ex Parte No. 385 (Sub-No. 2), 49 CFR 1224.8, 
or contact the Surface Transportation Board's Office of Economics, 
Environmental Analysis, and Administration.
    (3) Objections to release. (i) Objections to release of the 
confidential waybill data must be filed by the railroad and/or shipper 
no later than 14 calendar days from publication of the notice in the 
Federal Register.
    (ii) An original and 3 copies of each objection shall be filed with 
the Director, Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis, and 
Administration, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423.
    (iii) The objection shall identify the parties seeking the 
confidential waybill data, reiterate the purpose for which the data is 
sought, and state all grounds for objection to full or partial 
disclosure of the requested data.
    (4) Board determination. (i) The Director of the Office of 
Economics, Environmental Analysis, and Administration will consider all 
objections in determining whether to release the requested waybill data. 
Each railroad or shipper who filed objections will be sent written 
notice of the Director's decision not less than 14 calendar days prior 
to the disclosure date.
    (ii) The Board reserves the right to deny the release of waybill 
data although no objections may be filed.
    (iii) Appeals must be filed with the Chairman within 10 days of the 
date of the Director's decision. Responses to appeals must be filed 
within 10 days thereafter (49 CFR 1011.7(b)(1)). The filing of an appeal 
will automatically stay the effect of the Director's decision.
    (e) Content of waybill requests. (1) All requestors under paragraphs 
(b)(4) and (c) of this section shall include the following information:
    (i) A complete and detailed explanation of the purpose for which the

[[Page 190]]

    (ii) A description of the specific waybill data or fields actually 
required (including pertinent geographic areas).
    (iii) A detailed justification as to why the specified waybill data 
are needed.
    (2) An original and 2 copies of the waybill request shall be filed 
with the Director, Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis, and 
Administration, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423.
    (f) Aggregation of confidential shipper data.
    (1) Any shipper data obtained from the Waybill Sample shall not be 
publicly released unless the data are aggregated to include at least 
three shippers.
    (2) To aggregate the waybill data to the level of three shippers, 
the three-FSAC Rule shall be used. Under this rule, there must be at 
least three different freight stations as identified by the Freight 
Station Accounting Code (FSAC) on one railroad or there must be at least 
two more FSAC's than there are railroads present in the waybill data 
being aggregated.
    (3) The three-FSAC Rule shall apply to every number and calculation 
publicly released.
    (4) The Director of OTA will consider requests to apply an 
alternative aggregation method provided the requestor establishes that a 
particular project necessitates an alternative approach and that 
approach effectively protects the identity of individual shippers.
    (g) Complaint procedures. (1) Complaints for alleged breaches of 
confidentiality or misuse of confidential waybill data must include the 
following:
    (i) Identification of all known parties involved in the alleged 
violation.
    (ii) The approximate date(s) of the alleged violations.

    (iv) A description of any resulting harm to the complainant.
    (2) Prior to filing a complaint, a complainant, upon written 
request, may obtain a copy of the incoming waybill request and the 
applicable confidentiality agreement. This request must identify the 
party involved, give the approximate date the data was released, briefly 
describe the alleged violation, and substantiate the need for this 
information for purposes of filing a complaint.
    (3) An original and three (3) copies of the complaint shall be filed 
with the Director, Office of Economics, Environmental Analysis, and 
Administration, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423. A 
copy of the complaint shall also be served on the alleged violator(s).
    (4) An answer must be filed within 20 days after service of the 
complaint.
    (5) All parties will be notified in writing of the Director's 
decision. If the Director determines that a violation has occurred, the 
offending parties will be denied access to the waybill sample for a 
period of time commensurate with the nature of the violation.
    (6) Appeals to the Director's determination shall be filed in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section.
    (h) Munitions shipments. All waybill requests for munition data at 
the 3-digit Standard Transportation Commodity Code (STCC) level or 
greater will be forwarded by the STB to the Department of Defense's 
Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC). The STB will not release 
this type of information without MTMC's consent.

<R05>
Sec. 1245.1  Rules governing classification of employees, service, and compensation.

    The rules governing the classification of railroad employees and 
reports of their service and compensation outlined in Sec. Sec. 1245.3 
and 1245.4 are required, and all Class I railroads within the scope of 
Section 11145 of the Interstate Commerce Act shall be governed by such 
rules in the preparation and submission of their annual and other 
periodic reports to the Surface Transportation Board in accordance with 
the forms adopted for such returns (Sec. 1245.2); and also with respect 
to any other matters covered by these rules.

[47 FR 53867, Nov. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1245.2  Reports of railroad employees, service and compensation.

    Beginning with the reporting period commencing January 1, 1983, and 
quarterly thereafter until further ordered, each Class I railroad is 
required to file a Quarterly Report of Railroad Employees, Service, and 
Compensation, (Form QRSC). In addition, such carriers shall also file an 
Annual Report of Railroad Employees, Service, and Compensation, (Form 
ARSC) for each calendar year. Both reports shall be filed with the 
Bureau of Accounts, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423. 
The quarterly report shall be filed within thirty days after the end of 
each calendar quarter. The annual report shall be filed within forty 
five days after the end of the reporting year.

[47 FR 53867, Nov. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1245.3  Employees; definition, service hours, and compensation.

    (a) Definition of ``employees''. The word employees, as used in this 
part, is intended to include every person in the service of the 
reporting carrier subject to its continuing authority to supervise and 
direct the manner of rendition of his service. Persons engaged to render 
only specifically defined service and not subject to the continuing 
authority of the carrier to supervise and control their acts, such as 
customhouse brokers, lawyers retained only for specific cases and not 
under general or continuing retainer, etc., are not employees in the 
meaning of the term used in this part.
    (b) Counting employees. Since the number of employees fluctuates, 
carriers are required to classify and count all of their employees at 
twelve different times each year.
    (c) Joint employees. Each person jointly employed shall, if carried 
on the payrolls of the several joint employers, be counted by each 
employer and represented in its return of number of employees by a 
fraction based on the number of employers reporting him; if a person, 
for example, is reportable by three employers, each should include him 
in its number of employees as one-third of an employee. When the entire 
compensation of a joint employee is shown on the payroll of a single 
joint employer and is paid to the employee by that employer such 
employee should, for the purpose of returns, be treated as if employed 
solely by such employer.
    (d) Service hours. (1) The number of hours on duty, or held for 
duty, and the number of hours paid for are to be ascertained and 
recorded for every class of employee. For enginemen and trainmen, the 
actual number of miles run and miles paid for but not run are to be 
recorded, as well as the number of hours on duty and the number of hours 
paid for. (The service time of all classes of employees shall be 
recorded in hours instead of days or hours as heretofore.)
    (2) Whenever an employee works at more than one occupation, or in 
more than one class of service, both the number of hours worked and the 
compensation paid, should be separated and reported under the proper 
Reporting Divisions.
    (3) If an employee is paid a day's wage for a smaller number of 
hours than constitutes a day's work, the number of hours paid for as 
well as the actual number of hours the employee is on duty should be 
ascertained and recorded. Time allowed for meals, part holidays, 
holidays, absences on leave, vacations, etc., should be excluded from 
time actually worked, but if such

[[Page 192]]

time is paid for it should be appropriately reported as ``Time paid for 
but not worked'' on Form A or as a ``constructive allowance'' on Form B. 
These requirements apply to enginemen and trainmen paid on the basis of 
trips or of miles run, and to employees paid at piece rates, as well as 
to employees paid on hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other time 
basis. Service hours for officers and employees who do not receive 
payment for overtime should be reported as the number of hours in each 
month at 8 hours per day contemplated for the position.
    (e) Compensation. The compensation of employees as defined in the 
rules in this part is to be stated in such manner and detail as the 
forms adopted for periodical returns require.


<R05>
Sec. 1245.4  Forms required to be used.

    (a) The report of information to the Surface Transportation Board on 
railroad employees, service and compensation includes two forms. Form A 
relates to employees other than train and engine service employees. Form 
B relates to train and engine service employees.
    (b) With general reference to the statement of the compensation of 
employees in Forms A and B, it should be understood that the total 
compensation received by the employees in each Reporting Division, as 
well as the amount of work they perform, should be shown properly 
distributed under the prescribed column heads as indicated by the forms. 
It should be noted that if the work of an employee varies during a 
report period, his time and compensation should be apportioned 
accordingly. Amounts reported should be gross compensation paid.

    Illustrations. (a) In the course of a month, an employee works as a 
Machinist, and as such earns $200 and he works also as a Gang Foreman 
and earns $130. The pay received by him in the occupation of Machinist 
with corresponding time should be included in returns for Division 61, 
``Machinists'', and his other pay and time as indicated should be 
included in returns for Division 53, ``Gang Foremen and Gang Leaders''. 
(b) When an employee works at two or more of the occupations of 
engineer, fireman, conductor, and brakeman, his time and compensation 
should be assigned in accordance with the facts. For example, in a 
certain month an employee earns as a Through Freight Engineer $110, as a 
Local or Way Freight Engineer $140, as a Yard Engineer $100, and as a 
Local or Way Freight Fireman $75. The time and the compensation of this 
employee should be correspondingly distributed among Reporting Divisions 
122, 123, 124, and 127 as they are respectively applicable, without 
regard to the predominance of the time worked or the amount earned by 
him in one occupation.

    (c) As elsewhere indicated, the statement of the number of employees 
in the service of a company with respect to Reporting Divisions depends 
upon the allocation of the individual employees as of the day of count.
    (d) The Reporting Divisions shown in Forms A and B following will 
also be used in connection with the employees' schedule in the annual 
reports of railroads of classes I and II to the Board. Railroads of 
class III and lessor companies shall report only the information 
required in the annual report forms prescribed for such companies.

Sec. 1280.1  Purpose.

    To set forth those provisions of the Surface Transportation Board 
Security Regulations to the extent that they affect the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.2  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Surface Transportation Board to act in 
accordance with Executive Order 12356, dated April 6, 1982, in matters 
relating to national security information.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.3  Authority to classify.

    The Board does not have authority of its own to classify any of its 
internally generated documents. The only documents handled by the Board 
which are classified as confidential, secret, or top secret are those 
generated by Executive Branch Agencies with original classification 
authority.

[[Page 212]]


<R05>
Sec. 1280.4  Responsibility for handling of classified documents.

    (a) Responsible Official. Primary responsibility for the handling of 
classified documents shall rest with the Assistant to the Director of 
the Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance, who is also Emergency 
Coordinator for the Board. All documents bearing the terms ``Top 
Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential'' shall be delivered to the 
Emergency Coordinator or his/her alternate immediately upon receipt. The 
alternate is also an Assistant to the Director of the Office of 
Compliance and Consumer Assistance as set forth in Sec. 1280.4(b) of 
the rules. All potential recipients of such documents shall be advised 
of the name of the Emergency Coordinator. In the event that the 
Emergency Coordinator or his/her alternate is not available to receive 
such documents, they shall be turned over to the Associate Director, 
Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance, and secured, unopened, in 
the combination safe located in Room 5325 of the headquarters building 
until the Emergency Coordinator or alternate is available. All material 
not immediately deliverable to either the Emergency Coordinator, 
alternate, or the Associate Director, Office of Compliance and Consumer 
Assistance, shall be delivered at the earliest opportunity. Under no 
circumstances shall classified material that cannot be delivered to the 
Emergency Coordinator be stored other than in the designated safe in 
Room 5325 of the STB headquarters building.
    (b) The alternate to the Emergency Coordinator for the receipt and 
handling of documents mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section, shall 
be the other Assistant to the Director, Office of Compliance and 
Consumer Assistance.
    (c) Any person whose position requires access to classified 
information must execute Form SF <greek-i>189.
    (d) Any contracts with media representatives by personnel with 
access to classified material and involving such material will be 
cleared through the Emergency Coordinator and more than one person shall 
be present during any briefing or interview.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.5  Safeguarding of classified material.

    (a) Reproduction of classified material shall take place only when 
absolutely necessary, and in accordance with section 2001.46 of the 
Directive. Should copies be made, they are subject to the same controls 
as the original document. Records showing the number and distribution of 
copies shall be maintained by the Emergency Coordinator and the log 
stored with the original documents.
    (b) Any suspected or actual unauthorized disclosures of classified 
information shall be reported to the Emergency Coordinator or Alternate. 
An immediate investigation will be undertaken by the Emergency 
Coordinator or Alternate to establish all facts surrounding the 
disclosure. The Emergency Coordinator or Alternate shall ascertain the 
nature of the information disclosed and the extent to which it has been 
disseminated and will maintain records of disclosures as evaluated and 
investigated.
    (c) Any suspected or actual unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information will be reported as soon as possible to the Department of 
Justice and the Information Security Oversight Office.
    (d) Any unauthorized disclosure of classified information or any 
failure to cooperate with the investigation of unauthorized disclosures 
by an employee shall be cause for appropriate disciplinary or other 
remedial action as provided in the Board's Canons of Conduct, 49 CFR 
1000.735-31.

[49 FR 7832, Mar. 2, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 38998, Sept. 22, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1280.6  Storage of classified documents.

    All classified documents shall be stored in the safe located in Room 
5325 of the STB headquarters building. In those instances where the 
Emergency Coordinator is not available to receive classified documents, 
they may be stored, unopened, in the safe located in Room 5325.

[[Page 213]]


<R05>
Sec. 1280.7  Education of employees.

    All employees who have been granted a security clearance and who 
have occasion to handle classified materials shall be advised of the 
procedures outlined in 49 CFR part 1280. They shall also be required to 
review Executive Order 12356 and appropriate directives of the 
Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO). This shall be achieved by 
a memorandum to all affected employees at the time these procedures are 
implemented, and by appropriate instructions to new employees receiving 
security clearances in the future.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.8  Requests for mandatory review.

    Because the Board does not itself generate classified documents, any 
requests made for mandatory review shall be coordinated by the Emergency 
Coordinator with appropriate officials of the Department or Agency 
responsible for issuance of the document involved.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 721(a) and 11101(f).

    Source: 61 FR 35140, July 5, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.1  Scope; definitions.

    (a) The provisions of this part address the requirements imposed on 
rail carriers by 49 U.S.C. 11101(b), 11101(c), 11101(d) and 11101(f).
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of 
this part apply to any common carriage transportation or service 
provided by a rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface 
Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 10501.
    (c) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation 
or service provided by a rail carrier under a contract authorized under 
49 U.S.C. 10709 or former 49 U.S.C. 10713 (repealed effective January 1, 
1996).
    (d) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation 
or service provided by a rail carrier to the extent that such 
transportation or service is exempted from rate notice and disclosure 
requirements pursuant to an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502 or 
former 49 U.S.C. 10505 (repealed effective January 1, 1996).
    (e) For the purposes of this part, ``service terms'' means all 
classifications, rules, and practices that affect the rates, charges, or 
level of service for rail transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.2  Disclosure requirement for existing rates.

    (a) A rail carrier must disclose to any person, upon formal request, 
the specific rate(s) requested (or the basis for calculating the 
specific rate(s)), as well as all charges and service terms that may be 
applicable to transportation covered by the rate(s). For purposes of 
Sec. 1300.4(a)(1) of this part, a formal request under this part is one 
that clearly notifies the railroad that the requester seeks not only 
immediate information but also notification of any future increases in 
the rate(s) involved or changes in pertinent service terms.
    (b) The information provided by a rail carrier under this section 
must be provided immediately. (It is expected that the response will be 
sent within hours, or at least by the next business day, in most 
situations.) Such information may be provided either in written or 
electronic form as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot 
agree, such information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) 
form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it 
is to be provided in writing.
    (c) A rail carrier may, at its option, require that all requests 
submitted under this section be in written or electronic form, although 
the carrier may permit oral requests.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.3  Response to request for establishment of a new rate.

    Where a shipper or a prospective shipper or person acting on behalf 
of a shipper or a prospective shipper requests that the carrier 
establish a rate in the absence of an existing rate for particular 
transportation, the carrier must promptly establish and provide to the 
requester a rate and applicable service terms. The information may be 
provided either in written or electronic form, as agreed to by the 
parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided 
in electronic (non-passive) form where both parties have the requisite 
capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing. The response

[[Page 215]]

should be provided as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 
business days from receipt of the request. If a carrier determines that 
additional information is required from the requester before a rate or 
term can be established, the carrier must so notify the requester as 
soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days after receipt of 
the request. Once the additional information is received, the carrier 
must set the rate and related service terms, and relay them to the 
requester, as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business 
days from the receipt of the additional information. (However, the 
parties may agree to a different time period, in which case these time 
periods would not apply.) A rail carrier may, at its option, require 
that requests submitted under this section be in written or electronic 
form, although the carrier may permit oral requests.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.4  Notice requirement.

    (a) A rail carrier may not increase any rates or charges, or change 
any service terms (except for changes that are equivalent to rate 
reductions), unless 20 days have expired after written or electronic 
notice has been provided to all persons who, within the previous 12 
months:
    (1) Have formally requested under Sec. Sec. 1300.2 or 1300.3 of 
this part the affected rates or service terms; or
    (2) Have made arrangements with the carrier for a future shipment 
that would be subject to the increased rates or changed service terms.
    (b) The notice required by this section may be in written or 
electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot 
agree, the information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) 
form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it 
is to be provided in writing.
    (c) For purposes of this section, a mailed notice is deemed 
``provided'' on the date such notice is postmarked.
    (d) The notice required by this section must clearly identify the 
increases in rates or charges or the changes in service terms.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.5  Additional publication requirement for agricultural products and 

fertilizer.

    (a) With respect to transportation of agricultural products 
(including grain, as defined in 7 U.S.C. 75, and all products thereof) 
and fertilizer, a rail carrier shall publish, make available, and retain 
for public inspection its currently effective rates, schedules of rates, 
charges, and other service terms, and any scheduled changes to such 
rates, charges, and service terms. This requirement is in addition to 
the requirements imposed by Sec. Sec. 1300.2, 1300.3, and 1300.4 of 
this part.
    (b) The information published under this section must include an 
accurate description of the services offered to the public; must provide 
the specific applicable rates (or the basis for calculating the specific 
applicable rates), charges, and service terms; and must be arranged in a 
way that allows for the determination of the exact rate, charges, and 
service terms applicable to any given shipment (or to any given group of 
shipments). Increases, reductions and other changes must be symbolized 
or highlighted in some way to facilitate ready identification of the 
changes, the nature of those changes and their effective dates.
    (c) A rail carrier must make the information available at offices 
where it normally keeps rate information. Access to the information at 
such offices must be provided to any person, without charge, during 
normal business hours.
    (d) A rail carrier must also make the required publications 
available to all persons (hereinafter referred to as subscribers) who 
have subscribed to a publication service operated either by the rail 
carrier itself or by an agent acting at the rail carrier's direction. 
Such publications may be made available either in printed or in 
electronic form as agreed to by the parties. Any scheduled changes must 
be published in a manner that provides timely notice to subscribers. A 
rail carrier may impose reasonable charges for such publications. 
Publications may be limited to the specific information requested by the 
subscriber, and charges for such limited publications should be set 
accordingly.

    (a) The provisions of this part address the tariff requirements 
imposed by 49 U.S.C. 13702 on motor carriers and freight forwarders for 
the transportation of household goods, and the notice requirements with 
which such carriers must comply in order to be entitled to enforce the 
provisions of their tariffs against individuals whose shipments are 
subject to such tariffs.
    (b) The provisions of this part apply to all movements of household 
goods defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and to those 
movements of household goods defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
that are not provided under contracts entered into pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 
14101(b) or former 49 U.S.C. 10702 (repealed January 1, 1996).
    (c) For the purposes of this part, the term household goods means 
personal effects and property used or to be used in a dwelling, when a 
part of the equipment or supply of such dwelling, and similar property 
if the transportation of such effects or property is:
    (1) Arranged and paid for by the householder, including 
transportation of property from a factory or store when the property is 
purchased by the householder with intent to use in his or her dwelling; 
or
    (2) Arranged and paid for by another party.
    (d) For the purposes of this part service terms means all 
classifications, rules, regulations and practices that affect the rates, 
charges, or level of service for movements of household goods.


<R05>
Sec. 1310.2  Requirement to maintain tariffs.

    (a) Except when providing transportation for charitable purposes 
without charge, carriers subject to the Board's jurisdiction under 
Chapter 135 of Title 49 of the United States Code may provide 
transportation or service for movements of household goods only if the 
rates, and related rules and practices, for such transportation or 
service are contained in a published tariff that is in effect under this 
section. The carrier may not charge or receive a different compensation 
for the transportation or service than the rate specified in the tariff, 
whether by returning a part of that rate to a person, by giving a person 
a privilege, by allowing the use of a facility that affects the value of 
that transportation or service, or through another device. Tariffs shall 
be published in the English language and rates shall be stated in money 
of the United States.
    (b) Tariffs maintained pursuant to this part must be available for 
inspection by the Board, and must be provided to the Board promptly and 
free of charge, upon request, by mail or other delivery service.
    (c) A carrier that maintains a tariff pursuant to this part may not 
enforce the provisions of the tariff unless the carrier has given notice 
that the tariff is available for inspection in its bill of lading or by 
other actual notice to individuals whose shipments are subject to the 
tariff, as provided in Sec. 1310.4 of this part.
    (d) The Board may invalidate a tariff prepared by or on behalf of a 
carrier under this part if that tariff violates 49 U.S.C. 13702 or the 
regulations contained in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1310.3  Contents of tariffs.

    (a) Tariffs prepared under this part must include an accurate 
description of the services offered to the public; must provide the 
specific applicable rates, charges and service terms; and must be

[[Page 219]]

arranged in a way that allows for the determination of the exact rate, 
charges and service terms applicable to any given shipment. Increases, 
reductions and other changes must be symbolized or highlighted in some 
way to facilitate ready identification of the changes and their 
effective dates.
    (b) All information necessary to determine applicable rates, charges 
and service terms for a given shipment need not be contained in a single 
tariff, but if multiple tariffs are used to convey that information, the 
tariff containing the rates must make specific reference to all other 
tariffs required to determine applicable rates, charges and service 
terms. The carrier(s) party to the rate(s) must participate in all of 
the tariffs so linked and all such tariffs must be made available to 
shippers upon reasonable request.


<R05>
Sec. 1310.4  Incorporation of tariff provisions by reference.

    (a) Carriers that maintain tariffs pursuant to this part may 
incorporate the terms of such tariffs by reference (i.e., without 
stating their full text) into the bill of lading or other document 
embodying the contract of carriage for the transportation of household 
goods, provided that:
    (1) The bill of lading or other document must contain a conspicuous 
notice that the contract of carriage incorporates the terms of the 
carrier's tariffs; the carrier must give notice that its tariffs are 
available for inspection in its bill of lading or by other actual notice 
to individuals whose shipments are subject to such tariffs; and the 
carrier must make the full text of incorporated terms readily available 
for inspection by the shipper, free of charge, upon request. If such 
terms cannot be made available immediately, they must be made available 
promptly and free of charge by mail or other delivery service.
    (2) If the incorporated terms include any of the terms set forth in 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the notice on 
the bill of lading or other document must indicate that such terms are 
included; the shipper must be provided with a brief summary of the 
principal features of such terms on or with the document; and the 
shipper must be able to obtain a more complete explanation of such terms 
upon request.
    (i) Limits on the carrier's liability for loss, damage, or delay of 
goods, including fragile or valuable goods.
    (ii) Claim restrictions, including time periods within which 
shippers or consignees must file a claim or bring an action against the 
carrier for its acts or omissions or those of its agents.
    (iii) Rights of the carrier to impose monetary penalties on shippers 
or consignees, increase the price of the transportation, or change any 
terms of the contract.
    (b) A carrier may not claim the benefit as against a shipper or 
consignee of, and a shipper or consignee shall not be bound by, any 
tariff term that is incorporated by reference under this section unless 
the carrier has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) The disclosure requirements established by this section preempt 
any State requirements on the same subject, for tariff terms that are 
incorporated by reference into the bill of lading or other document 
embodying the contract of carriage for the transportation of household 
goods.


<R05>
Sec. 1310.5  Availability of tariffs at carrier offices.

    (a) Each carrier shall maintain, at its principal office, a complete 
set of its effective tariffs and those to which it is a party.

its other business offices, upon request. Carriers shall provide 
information regarding all locations where tariffs may be viewed.
    (c) At all points where tariffs are maintained, they shall be made 
available for inspection by any person during the carrier's normal 
business hours. The tariffs shall be accessible and readable. The 
carrier shall also display, in a conspicuous place in those locations, a 
notice, in large print, which contains a statement that the tariffs are 
available for public inspection.
    (d) At all other carrier business offices, the carrier shall display 
a notice advising the public of the location of the nearest available 
tariff. The notice

[[Page 220]]

shall be in large print and posted in a conspicuous place. In addition, 
the carrier shall, upon request, make its tariffs available at that 
location as soon as possible but not later than within 20 days, or 
provide the sought information orally if satisfactory to the requestor.
    (e) Any publication referred to in a tariff must be maintained with 
that tariff.
    (f) If any tariff maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section has not been used for a substantial length of time, the 
availability of that tariff, including its reissues, may be discontinued 
at that office until such time as it is again requested. It shall then 
be made available within 20 days.


<R05>
Sec. 1310.6  Furnishing copies of tariff publications.

    (a) Copies of tariffs, specific tariff provisions or tariff 
subscriptions shall be provided upon request to any interested person.
    (b) Except for providing to shippers the full text of tariff terms 
incorporated by reference into the bill of lading or other document 
embodying the contract of carriage for the transportation of household 
goods, as described in Sec. 1310.4(a)(1), carriers may assess charges 
for furnishing copies of tariff publications to interested persons. If a

[62 FR 19058, Apr. 18, 1997, as amended at 64 FR 5195, Feb. 3, 1999]


<R05>
Sec. 1312.2  Requirement to publish and file a tariff.

    (a) Requirement for tariff. Except when providing transportation for 
charitable purposes without charge, or when providing transportation or 
service described in Sec. 1312.1(b), carriers subject to the Board's 
jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. Chapter 135 may provide transportation or 
service described in Sec. 1312.1(a) only if the rates, and related 
rules and practices, for such transportation or service are contained in 
a published tariff that is on file with the Board and in effect under 
this part.
    (b) Adherence to tariff. The carrier may not charge or receive a 
different compensation for the transportation or service than the rate 
specified in the tariff, whether by returning a part of that rate to a 
person, giving a person a privilege, allowing the use of a facility that 
affects the value of that transportation or service, or another device. 
The carrier shall keep such tariffs available for public inspection and 
shall make such tariffs available to subscribers as required in this 
part.
    (c) Other information. Provisions for information purposes only may 
be included in a tariff, provided they are clearly identified as such. 
Such provisions may include rates and service terms covering 
transportation not subject to regulation by the Board, and advertising 
and promotional material.
    (d) Effect of filing. The tender of a tariff and its receipt and 
acceptance by the Board do not relieve a carrier of liability for 
violations of the Act, other laws, the Board's regulations, or any 
decision of the Board or a court, or have any effect on the rights of 
persons

[[Page 222]]

to file complaints for substantive violations of the Act or the Board's 
regulations.
    (e) Tariff relief. Relief from the provisions of this part may be 
sought. Requests for such relief shall be submitted in duplicate and 
accompanied by the appropriate fee (see 49 CFR part 1002). Packages 
containing applications for relief shall be prominently marked ``SPECIAL 
TARIFF AUTHORITY APPLICATION.'' The application shall cite all pertinent 
tariff matter and shall provide complete information regarding 
applicant's justification, purpose and manner of relief sought.
    (f) Invalidation of tariffs. Tariffs that violate section 13702 of 
the Act, or a regulation of the Board carrying out that section, may be 
invalidated by the Board. When a tariff is invalidated, the party that 
filed it will be furnished a written explanation of the reasons for such 
action. Tariffs issued in lieu of invalidated tariffs shall so state.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.3  Tariff contents and standards; Essential criteria.

    (a) Contents. Tariffs filed with the Board must include an accurate 
description of the services offered to the public; must provide the 
specific applicable rates (or the basis for calculating the specific 
applicable rates) and service terms; and must be arranged in a way that 
allows for the determination of the exact rate(s) and service terms 
applicable to any given shipment (or to any given group of shipments).
    (b) Use of multiple tariffs. All information necessary to determine 
applicable rates and service terms for a given shipment need not be 
contained in a single tariff, but if multiple tariffs are used to convey 
that information, the tariff containing the rates must make specific 
reference (by STB tariff designation) to all other tariffs required to 
determine applicable rates and service terms, and the carrier(s) party 
to the rates must participate in all of the tariffs so linked.
    (c) Clarity. Tariff information must be presented in a way that 
facilitates the determination of the prices and services offered, and 
the related service terms. Ambiguous terms and complex methods of 
presentation shall not be used.
    (d) Explanations. Reference marks and abbreviations, other than 
commonly used abbreviations, shall be explained either in the item in 
which they are used or in a separate item.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.4  Filing of tariffs.

    (a) Filing requirements. (1) Tariffs shall be filed in English with 
rates explicitly stated in U.S. dollars and cents. Two copies of each 
tariff publication shall be filed with the Board. Packages containing 
tariff filings should be prominently marked ``TARIFF FILING'' and 
addressed to: Section of Tariffs, Surface Transportation Board, 1925 K 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20423-0001.
    (2) A tariff filing must be accompanied by an authorized document of 
transmittal identifying each publication filed, and by the appropriate 
filing fee (see 49 CFR part 1002). Acknowledgment of Board receipt of a 
tariff filing can be obtained by enclosing a duplicate transmittal 
letter and a postage-paid, self-addressed return envelope. Each 
transmittal letter shall clearly indicate in the upper left-hand corner 
thereof:
    (i) The assigned alpha code of the issuing carrier or agent;
    (ii) The number of pages transmitted;
    (iii) The filing fee enclosed, the account number to be billed, or 
the credit card to be charged;
    (iv) The transmittal number if the filer utilizes transmittal 
numbers; and
    (v) If the filing fee is charged to a credit card, the credit card 
number and expiration date, and an authorized signature.
    (b) Paper size. Tariffs shall be printed on paper not larger than 
8\1/2\x11 inches.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.5  Amendments to tariffs.

    (a) Manner of making changes. An amendment is a change in, addition 
to, or cancellation of part of a tariff. Supplements are the tariff 
publications used to amend bound tariffs, and new or revised pages are 
the tariff publications normally used to amend looseleaf tariffs, 
although looseleaf tariffs can also be amended by supplements. Tariffs 
can also be canceled by new or reissued tariffs (see Sec. 1312.7).

[[Page 223]]

    (b) Supplements. Supplements issued to amend a tariff shall be 
consecutively numbered. Each new supplement shall identify any 
supplement(s) that it cancels, and any supplement(s) that are still in 
effect. A tariff amendment published in a supplement may be carried 
forward to later supplements if it is identified as reissued without 
change from the supplement in which it was originally published.
    (c) Looseleaf pages. Looseleaf pages to an original tariff shall be 
designated as ``Original'' (e.g., Original Title Page, Original Page 1, 
Original Page 2, etc.). Looseleaf pages issued to amend the tariff shall 
bear consecutive revision numbers and shall cancel the prior version(s) 
of the same page (e.g., 1st Revised Page 1 Cancels Original Page 1, 2nd 
Revised Page 1 Cancels 1st Revised Page 1, etc.). Additional original 
pages may also be issued to amend a tariff, by adding new numbered pages 
after the last numbered page, or by adding existing numbered pages with 
alphabetic suffixes (e.g., a page designated as Original Page 2-A could 
be added between pages 2 and 3, etc.). Each looseleaf tariff shall 
include a Check Sheet, a Correction Number Check Sheet, or some other 
method of determining the looseleaf pages issued to amend such tariff.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.6  Advance notice required.

    (a) Notice requirement. Unless otherwise specifically authorized by 
the Board, tariffs must be filed with the Board on not less than the 
notice shown in paragraph (b) of this section. Notice means the number 
of days the publication is on file with the Board prior to its effective 
date(s). The date the publication is received by the Board counts as the 
first day of notice.
    (b) Length of notice. A tariff may not become effective earlier 
than:
    (1) Thirty days after filing for all collectively established tariff 
matter.
    (2) Seven workdays after filing for independently established 
increased tariff matter.
    (3) Upon filing for independently established new tariff matter, 
independently established reduced tariff matter, the addition or 
restoration of a carrier's participation in a tariff, a correction to 
the list of participating carriers in a tariff (other than the 
cancellation of a carrier's participation), an extension of the 
expiration date of tariff matter, or a postponement of the effective 
date of proposed tariff matter.
    (c) Receipt of tariffs by the Board. The Board will receive tariff 
filings between the hours of 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time on 
workdays. Tariff filings delivered to the Board on other than a workday, 
or after 5:00 P.M. on a workday, will be considered as received the next 
workday.
    (d) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    Increased means any tariff change that results in higher charges to 
the payer of freight charges or reduced service at the same rate;
    New means an initial rate or other provision for a new service;
    Reduced means any tariff change that results in lower charges to the 
payer of freight charges or expanded service at the same rate; and
    Workdays means all days except Saturdays, Sundays and all Federal 
holidays observed in the District of Columbia.

<R05>
Sec. 1312.7  STB tariff designation.

    (a) Format. Every tariff shall show an authorized tariff designation

tariff; and
    (3)(i) The tariff number (selected by the carrier or agent) to 
distinguish that tariff from all other tariffs filed by the same issuing 
carrier or agent. Tariff numbers shall not exceed 5 numerical digits and 
may be followed by not more than 2 letter suffixes. Examples of tariff 
numbers are:

STB XXXX 100
STB XX 8000-A
STB XXXX 12345-AB

    (ii) Suffixes may be used only to designate reissues of tariffs. As 
an example, a reissue of tariff 1000 could be designated 1000-A, a 
reissue of tariff 1000-A could be designated 1000-B, etc.
    (b) Alpha codes. Alpha codes are assigned to carriers and tariff 
agents by

[[Page 224]]

pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section has not been used for a 
substantial

[[Page 225]]

length of time, the posting of that tariff, including its reissues, may 
be discontinued at that station until such time as a request is made to 
have it reposted. It shall then be reposted within 20 days.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.13  Furnishing copies of tariff publications.

    (a) Definitions. Subscriber, as used in this section, means any 
person (other than carrier participants in a tariff) that is voluntarily 
furnished, or that requests that it be furnished, one or more copies of 
a particular tariff with or without subsequent amendments or reissues of 
that tariff.
    (b) Sending new publications to subscribers. (1) The publishing 
carrier or agent shall send each newly-issued tariff, supplement, or 
loose-leaf page as requested to each subscriber by first class mail, or 
other means requested in writing by the subscriber.
    (2) Newly-issued tariffs, supplements, or loose-leaf pages shall be 
sent to each subscriber not later than the time the copies for official 
filing are sent to the Board.
    (3) Carriers or agents may, if acceptable to a subscriber, furnish 
only specific portions of original tariffs and amendments affecting 
those portions.
    (c) Certification. The letter of transmittal accompanying the copies 
filed with the Board shall contain the following certification:

    I certify that compliance with 49 CFR 1312.13 has been made.

    (d) Charges. (1) If any charge is made, the charge for copies of 
tariff publications sent to subscribers shall be reasonable, and 
identical for the same publications.
    (2) No charge may be made (even for the cost of sending the 
publication) for any publication that is invalidated by the Board.
    (e) Notice of invalidation. If a publication is invalidated, the 
subscribers shall be notified.
    (f) Alternative subscription services. The service described in this 
section must be available to any subscriber requesting it; however, the 
requirement to offer such service does not preclude the offering of 
different services to subscribers requesting those services.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.14  Powers of attorney and concurrences.

    (a) Authorization. Rates and services of a carrier must be filed in 
a tariff issued in that carrier's name unless they are filed:
    (1) In an agent's tariff when the carrier has executed a power of 
attorney authorizing that individual or entity to serve as its tariff 
agent; or
    (2) In a tariff of another carrier through issuance of a concurrence 
to the latter carrier authorizing the first carrier's participation in 
joint rates and through routes.
    (b) Disclosure of authorization. If two or more carriers execute 
powers of attorney to the same agent, it is not necessary for those 
carriers to exchange concurrences to participate in joint rates in that 
agent's tariffs. Powers of attorney and concurrences are not to be filed 
with the Board, but shall be provided to any person on request.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.15  Change of carrier or agent.

    (a) Change in carrier. When a carrier's name is lawfully changed, or 
a fiduciary assumes possession and control of a carrier's property, all 
affected tariffs must be amended to reflect the change. The amendments 
required by this paragraph shall be filed promptly and, if possible, 
prior to their effective date, but in no case later than 60 days 
thereafter. Regardless of the date the tariff is actually filed, the 
effective date for an amendment required by this paragraph is the date 
the event occurs.
    (b) Change of agent. When a new agent is appointed to take over an 
agency, or when an alternate agent assumes the duties of the principal 
agent, each of the superseded agent's effective tariffs shall 
immediately be amended to reflect the change, bearing an effective date 
the same as the date of the transfer. In the case of a new agent, this 
may only occur after one or more of the participating carriers issues a 
power of attorney to the new agent, and revokes the previous power of 
attorney. At the same time, all affected tariffs will be amended to 
reflect the new powers of attorney, and all carriers who have not issued 
them must be canceled from the tariff.

Sec. 1312.16  Substitution of service.

    If a water or motor carrier (hereafter referred to as Carrier A) 
desires to have the option of substituting the services of a carrier of 
a different transportation mode (hereafter referred to as Carrier B) for 
part of its movement of a shipment, it may do so if:
    (a) The shipment moves on the bill of lading that would be used if 
Carrier A were performing the service;
    (b) Carrier A assumes the responsibility for the lading while it is 
in the possession of Carrier B; and
    (c) Movement of the lading has been made prior to, or will be made 
subsequent to, the service performed by Carrier B.

<R05>
Sec. 1313.1  Scope; definition of terms.

    (a) This part addresses the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10709 that 
require rail carriers to file with the Board a summary of each contract 
for the transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as 
defined in 7 U.S.C. 75 and products thereof) and that allow complaints 
to be filed with the Board regarding such contracts.
    (b) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation 
that is exempted from the Board's contract regulation pursuant to an 
exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502 or former 49 U.S.C. 10505 
(repealed effective January 1, 1996).
    (c) For purposes of this part, the term contract means an agreement, 
including any amendment thereto, entered into by one or more rail 
carriers and one or more purchasers of rail services to provide 
specified transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as 
defined in 7 U.S.C. 75 and products thereof) under specified rates and 
conditions. The term amendment includes contract modifications agreed to 
by the parties.
    (d) An amended contract is treated as a new contract under this 
part. Remedies are revived and review is again available, upon 
complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 1313.2  Contract summary filing requirement.

    (a) Rail carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface 
Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 10501 must promptly file with the 
Board a summary of each contract entered into for the transportation of 
agricultural products.
    (b) Contract summaries not in compliance with this part may be 
rejected by the Board. If a contract summary is rejected, it will be 
considered as not filed, and the carrier must promptly file a corrected 
contract summary to replace the rejected summary.


<R05>
Sec. 1313.3  Board review; contract disapproval.

    (a) Board review. (1) No later than 30 days after a contract summary 
is filed, the Board may, on complaint, begin a proceeding to review such 
contract on the grounds described in Sec. 1313.9.
    (2) If the Board begins a proceeding, it shall determine, within 30 
days after the proceeding is commenced, whether the contract is in 
violation of 49 U.S.C. 10709.
    (b) Contract disapproval. If the Board finds that the contract is in 
violation of 49 U.S.C. 10709, it will:
    (1) Disapprove the contract; or
    (2) Where the Board finds unreasonable discrimination, in accordance 
with 49 U.S.C. 10709(g)(2)(B)(i), order the contracting carrier(s) to 
provide to the complainant(s) rates and service

[[Page 227]]

substantially similar to those contained in the contract at issue, with 
such differences in terms and conditions as are justified by the 
evidence.
    (c) Applicable rates/charges if a contract is disapproved. If the 
Board disapproves a contract (or contract amendment), the appropriate 
non-contract rates/charges (or the contract provisions otherwise in 
effect) will be applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1313.4  Filing procedures and formats for contract summaries.

    (a) Filing of Summaries. (1) Two copies of each contract summary, 
containing the applicable information specified in Sec. Sec. 1313.6, 
1313.7, or 1313.8, as appropriate, must be filed with the Board as soon 
as possible, but no longer than 7 days after the date of the contract 
(or contract amendment).
    (2) The outside envelope or wrapper containing one or more contract 
summaries must be prominently marked ``Rail Contract Summary'' and 
addressed to: Tariffs Branch, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, 
DC 20423.
    (3) A transmittal letter identifying the submitted publication(s), 
and the name and telephone number of a contact person, must accompany 
each filing of one or more contract summaries. Each transmittal letter 
shall clearly indicate in the upper left-hand corner thereof:
    (i) The assigned alpha code of the filing carrier;
    (ii) The number of summaries transmitted;
    (iii) The filing fee enclosed, the account number to be billed, or 
the credit card to be charged;
    (iv) The transmittal number if the filer utilizes transmittal 
numbers; and
    (v) If the filing fee is charged to a credit card, the information 
must include the credit card number and expiration date, and an 
authorized signature.
    (b) Contract summary title page. The title page of each contract 
summary must contain only the following information:
    (1) In the upper right corner, the contract summary number (see 
paragraph (c) of this section), followed by the amendment number if an 
amended contract summary.
    (2) In the center of the page, the filing carrier's name, followed 
by the words ``CONTRACT SUMMARY'' or ``AMENDED CONTRACT SUMMARY'', as 
applicable, in large print.
    (3) Date of contract and its effective date.
    (4) In the center lower portion, the individual submitting the 
filing, and the name of the individual(s) for service of complaints (if 
not the same individual). If not otherwise noted, a complainant may rely 
on service to the individual submitting the filing.
    (c) Contract summary numbering system. (1) The contract summary 
identification number must include the word ``STB,'' the standard 
carrier alphabetic code for the filing railroad (limited to four 
letters), the letter ``C,'' and a sequential number, with each separated 
by a hyphen. The following is an example: the 357th contract summary 
filed by the Conrail would have the following identification number: 
``STB-CR-C-357.''
    (2) At its option, the carrier may issue contract summaries with 
nonconsecutive numbers if it assigns blocks of numbers for specific 
uses. An index to the blocks of reserved numbers shall be filed with the 
Board.
    (d) Format requirements for contract summary information. (1) The 
contract summary must enumerate and have each item required in 
Sec. Sec. 1313.6, 1313.7 or 1313.8 of this part, as applicable, 
completed. When the item does not pertain to the contract, the term 
``Not Applicable'' (``NA'') shall be used.
    (2) Changes in prior contract summaries must be underscored and must 
be followed by the words ``addition,'' ``deletion,'' ``extension,'' 
``cancellation,'' or other appropriate descriptive phrase in 
parentheses. If the change to the contract is only in confidential 
matter, a statement to that effect must be made in the amended contract 
summary and must indicate the particular feature to which the change 
applies (i.e., rate, special feature, etc.). If ``not applicable'' is 
permitted in the original summary under Sec. Sec. 1313.6 through 1313.8 
of this part, the amended summary may use ``not applicable''

[[Page 228]]

with a notation that a change pertained only to confidential data.
    (3) Amended contract summaries may not substitute phrases such as 
``not applicable'' or ``no change'' where disclosure was required in the 
original contact summary (such as in the commodity description); amended 
contract summaries must set forth all required non-confidential terms in 
the contract, whether amended or not.


<R05>

obligations to the complainant under 49 U.S.C. 11101;
    (2) By a port on the ground that such port individually will be 
harmed because the contract will result in unreasonable discrimination 
against such port; and

shipper individually will be harmed because:
    (i) The rail carrier has unreasonably discriminated by refusing to 
enter into a contract with such shipper for rates and services for the 
transportation of the same type of commodity under similar conditions to 
the contract at issue, and that such shipper was ready, willing, and 
able to enter into such a contract at a time essentially contemporaneous 
with the period during which the contract at issue was offered; or
    (ii) The contract constitutes a destructive competitive practice.
    (b) Unreasonable discrimination, for purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i)

    (3) Agreements between carriers and shippers for informal discovery 
are permitted under these rules.
    (c) Confidentiality. If confidential contract data are filed with 
the Board in a pleading, the party filing these data should submit them 
as a separate package, clearly marked on the outside ``Confidential 
Material Subject to Protective Order.'' The order in paragraph (d) of 
this section applies to the parties specified in the order who receive 
confidential information through proceedings before the Board or through 
informal discovery.
    (d) Protective order. Petitioner and carriers, and their duly 
authorized agents, shall limit to the contract complaint proceeding the 
use of contract information or other confidential commercial information 
which may be revealed in the contract, the complaint, reply, or in any 
other pleading relating to the contract. This restriction shall be a 
condition to release of any contract term to a petitioner/complainant 
and shall operate similarly on a carrier

[[Page 232]]

in possession of confidential information which may be contained in a 
complaint, petition for discovery, or request for informal disclosure. 
Any information pertaining to parties to the contract or subject to the 
contract (including consignors, consignees and carriers), or pertaining 
to the terms of the contract, or relating to the petitioner's/
complainant's confidential commercial information, must be kept 
confidential. Neither the information nor the existence of the 
information shall be disclosed to third parties, except for: consultants 
or agents who agree, in writing, to be bound by this regulation; 
information which is publicly available; information which, after 
receipt, becomes publicly available through no fault of the party 
seeking to disclose the information after it has become publicly 
available, or is acquired from a third party free of any restriction as

    (b) The bureaus are required to maintain detailed minutes of all 
meetings where immunized matters are discussed. The bureaus will be 
subject to withdrawal of their immunity for serious continuing 
violations of Board standards, and individual tariff publications will 
be subject to rejection, suspension, or investigation for improprieties 
in the rate bureau process.
    (c) Absent Board approval, no other changes may be made in any 
approved agreement.
    (d) For the purposes of the statute, the following definitions shall 
apply:
    (1) A general increase is a proposed general adjustment of 
substantially all the rates published in a rate bureau's tariff(s).
    (2) A broad change in tariff structure modifies in a relatively non-
uniform fashion the relationship between most rates published in a rate 
bureau's tariff, and applies to a large area, either nationally or 
regionally.
    (3) An innovative fare will be determined on a case-by-case basis; 
the Board will, on request, issue opinions on whether particular rate 
proposals may be regarded as innovative. Two examples of an innovative 
fare are:
    (i) A fare for unlimited passenger travel; and
    (ii) An experimental fare providing for transportation at the 
passenger's option over the line of one or more carriers.
    (4) A promotional fare generally has three characteristics:
    (i) Limited duration;
    (ii) Attractive price or level of service quality; and
    (iii) Some added feature in addition to those normally offered.

    (a) Any person who violates any provision of 49 U.S.C. chapter 449 
(except sections 44902, 44903(d), 44907(a)-(d)(1)(A), 44907(d)(1)(C)-
(f), 44908, and 44909), or a regulation prescribed or order issued under 
any of those provisions, is subject to a civil penalty of not more than 
the amount specified for each violation in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
46301, in conformity with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation 
Adjustment Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. 2461 (note), as amended.
    (b) The authority of the Administrator, under 49 U.S.C. 46301 to 
propose a civil penalty for a violation of that chapter, or a rule, 
regulation, or order issued thereunder, and the ability to refer cases 
to the United States Attorney General, or the delegate of the Attorney 
General, for prosecution of civil penalty actions proposed by the 
Administrator, involving an amount in controversy in excess of $ 50,000, 
an in rem action, or suit for injunctive relief, or for collection of an 
assessed civil penalty, is delegated to the Chief Counsel and the Deputy 
Chief Counsel for Civil Enforcement.
    (c) The Administrator may compromise any civil penalty, proposed in 
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46301, involving an amount in controversy in 
excess of $ 50,000, an in rem action, or suit for injunctive relief, 
prior to referral of the civil penalty action to the United States 
Attorney General, or the delegate of the Attorney General, for 
prosecution.
    (1) The Administrator, through the Chief Counsel or the Deputy Chief 
Counsel for Civil Enforcement, will send a civil penalty letter to the 
person charged with a violation of 49 U.S.C. chapter 449 (except 
sections 44902, 44903(d), 44907(a)-(d)(1)(A), 44907(d)(1)(C)-(f), 44908, 
and 44909), or a regulation prescribed or order issued under any of 
those provisions. The civil penalty letter contains a statement of the 
charges; the applicable law, rule, regulation, or order; the amount of 
civil penalty that the Administrator will accept in full settlement of 
the action or an offer to compromise the civil penalty.
    (2) Not later than 30 days after receipt of the civil penalty 
letter, the person charged with a violation may present any material or 
information in answer to the charges to the agency attorney, either 
orally or in writing, that may explain, mitigate, or deny the violation 
or that may show extenuating circumstances. The Administrator will 
consider any material or information submitted in accordance with this 
paragraph (c) to determine whether the person is subject to a civil 
penalty or to determine the amount for which the Administrator will 
compromise the action.
    (3) If the person charged with the violation offers to compromise 
for a specific amount, that person must send a certified check or money 
order for that amount to the agency, made payable to the Transportation 
Security Administration. The Chief Counsel or the Deputy Chief Counsel 
for Civil Enforcement may accept the certified check or money order or 
may refuse and return the certified check or money order.
    (4) If the offer to compromise is accepted by the Administrator, the 
agency will send a letter to the person

[[Page 244]]

charged with the violation stating that the certified check or money 
order is accepted in full settlement of the civil penalty action.
    (5) If the parties cannot agree to compromise the civil penalty 
action or the offer to compromise is rejected and the certified check or 
money order submitted in compromise is returned, the Administrator may 
refer the civil penalty action to the United States Attorney General, or 
the delegate of the Attorney General, to begin proceedings in a United 
States district court, pursuant to the authority in 49 U.S.C. 46305 to 
prosecute and collect the civil penalty.

<R05>
Sec. 1503.16  Civil penalties: Civil penalties involving an amount in controversy not exceeding $50,000.

    (a) General. The following penalties apply to persons who violate 
chapter 449, as specified in subsection (1), of Title 49 of the United 
States Code:
    (1) Any person who violates any provision of 49 U.S.C. chapter 449 
(except sections 44902, 44903(d), 44907(a)-(d)(1)(A), 44907(d)(1)(C)-
(f), 44908, and 44909), or a regulation prescribed or order issued under 
any of those provisions is subject to a civil penalty of not more than 
the amount specified in the chapter or section for each violation in 
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46301, in conformity with the Federal Civil 
Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. 2461 (note), as 
amended.
    (2)-(3) [Reserved]
    (b) Orders assessing civil penalty. An order assessing civil penalty 
may be issued for a violation described in paragraph (a) of this 
section, or as otherwise provided by statute, after notice and 
opportunity for a hearing. A person charged with a violation may be 
subject to an order assessing civil penalty in the following 
circumstances:
    (1) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person 
charged with a violation submits or agrees to submit a civil penalty for 
a violation.
    (2) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person 
charged with a violation does not request a hearing under paragraph 
(e)(2)(ii) of this section within 15 days after receipt of a final 
notice of proposed civil penalty.
    (3) Unless an appeal is filed in a timely manner, an initial 
decision or order of an administrative law judge will be considered an 
order assessing civil penalty if an administrative law judge finds that 
an alleged violation occurred and determines that a civil penalty, in an 
amount found appropriate by the administrative law judge, is warranted.
    (4) For penalties issued under Sec. 1503.16(a)(1), unless a 
petition for review is filed with a U.S. court of appeals in a timely 
manner, a final decision and order of the Administrator will be 
considered an order assessing civil penalty if the TSA decision maker 
finds that an alleged violation occurred and a civil penalty is 
warranted.
    (c) Delegation of authority. The authority of the Administrator, 
under 49 U.S.C. 46301 to initiate and assess civil penalties for a 
violation under chapter 449, or a rule, regulation, or order issued 
thereunder, is delegated to the Deputy Chief Counsel for Civil 
Enforcement. The authority of the Administrator to refer cases to the 
Attorney General of the United States, or the delegate of the Attorney 
General, for the collection of civil penalties, is delegated to the 
Chief Counsel and the Deputy Chief Counsel for Civil Enforcement.
    (d) Notice of proposed civil penalty. A civil penalty action is 
initiated by sending a notice of proposed civil penalty to the person 
charged with a violation of 49 U.S.C. chapter 449 (except sections 
44902, 44903(d), 44907(a)-(d)(1)(A), 44907(d)(1)(C)-(f), 44908, and 
44909), or a regulation prescribed or order issued under any of those 
provisions. A notice of proposed civil penalty will be sent to the 
individual charged with a violation or to the president of the 
corporation or company charged with a violation. In response to a notice 
of proposed civil penalty, a corporation or company may designate in 
writing another person to receive documents in that civil penalty 
action. The notice of proposed civil penalty contains a statement of the 
charges and the amount of the proposed civil penalty. Not later than 30

[[Page 245]]

days after receipt of the notice of proposed civil penalty, the person 
charged with a violation must--
    (1) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-
upon amount, in which case either an order assessing civil penalty or 
compromise order must be issued in that amount;
    (2) Submit to the agency attorney one of the following:
    (i) Written information, including documents and witness statements, 
demonstrating that a violation of the regulations did not occur or that 
a penalty or the amount of the penalty is not warranted by the 
circumstances;
    (ii) A written request to reduce the proposed civil penalty, the 
amount of reduction, and the reasons and any documents supporting a 
reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including records indicating a 
financial inability to pay or records showing that payment of the 
proposed civil penalty would prevent the person from continuing in 
business;
    (iii) A written request for an informal conference to discuss the 
matter with the agency attorney and to submit relevant information or 
documents; or
    (3) Request a hearing in which case a complaint will be filed with 
the Enforcement Docket Clerk.
    (e) Final notice of proposed civil penalty. A final notice of 
proposed civil penalty may be issued after participation in informal 
procedures provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or failure to 
respond in a timely manner to a notice of proposed civil penalty. A 
final notice of proposed civil penalty will be sent to the individual 
charged with a violation, to the president of the corporation or company 
charged with a violation, or a person previously designated in writing 
by the individual, corporation, or company to receive documents in that 
civil penalty action. If not previously done in response to a notice of 
proposed civil penalty, a corporation or company may designate in 
writing another person to receive documents in that civil penalty 
action. The final notice of proposed civil penalty contains a statement 
of the charges and the amount of the proposed civil penalty and, as a 
result of information submitted to the agency attorney during informal 
procedures, may modify an allegation or a proposed civil penalty 
contained in a notice of proposed civil penalty.
    (1) A final notice of proposed civil penalty may be issued--
    (i) If the person charged with a violation fails to respond to the 
notice of proposed civil penalty within 30 days after receipt of that 
notice; or
    (ii) If the parties participated in any informal procedures under 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section and the parties have not agreed to 
compromise the action or the agency attorney has not agreed to withdraw 
the notice of proposed civil penalty.
    (2) Not later than 15 days after receipt of the final notice of 
proposed civil penalty, the person charged with a violation must do one 
of the following--
    (i) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-
upon amount, in which case either an order assessing civil penalty or a 
compromise order will be issued in that amount; or
    (ii) Request a hearing in which case a complaint will be filed with 
the Enforcement Docket Clerk.
    (f) Request for a hearing. Any person charged with a violation may 
request a hearing, pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) or paragraph (e)(2)(ii) 
of this section, to be conducted in accordance with the procedures in 
subpart G of this part. A person requesting a hearing must file a 
written request for a hearing with the Enforcement Docket Clerk (U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration, 
Office of the Chief Counsel, TSA-2, Attention: Enforcement Docket Clerk, 
601 South 12th Street, Arlington, VA 22202-4220) and must mail a copy of 
the request to the agency attorney. The person requesting the hearing 
must date and sign the request, and must include his or her current 
address. The request for hearing must be typewritten or legibly written.
    (g) Hearing. If the person charged with a violation requests a 
hearing pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) or paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this 
section, the original complaint will be filed with the Enforcement 
Docket Clerk and a

[[Page 246]]

copy will be sent to the person requesting the hearing. The procedural 
rules in subpart G of this part apply to the hearing and any appeal. At 
the close of the hearing, the administrative law judge will issue, 
either orally on the record or in writing, an initial decision, 
including the reasons for the decision, that contains findings or 
conclusions on the allegations contained, and the civil penalty sought, 
in the complaint.
    (h) Appeal. Either party may appeal the administrative law judge's 
initial decision to the TSA decision maker pursuant to the procedures in 
subpart G of this part. If a party files a notice of appeal pursuant to 
Sec. 1503.233, the effectiveness of the initial decision is stayed 
until a final decision and order of the Administrator have been entered 
on the record. The TSA decision maker will review the record and issue a 
final decision and order of the Administrator that affirms, modifies, or 
reverses the initial decision. The TSA decision maker may assess a civil 
penalty but will not assess a civil penalty in an amount greater than 
that sought in the complaint.
    (i) Payment. A person must pay a civil penalty by sending, to the 
agency, a certified check or money order made payable to the 
Transportation Security Administration.
    (j) Collection of civil penalties. If a person does not pay a civil 
penalty imposed by an order assessing civil penalty or a compromise 
order within 60 days after service of the order, the Administrator may 
refer the order to the United States Attorney General, or the delegate 
of the Attorney General, to begin proceedings to collect the civil 
penalty. The action will be brought in a United States district court, 
pursuant to the authority in 49 U.S.C. 46305.
    (k) Exhaustion of administrative remedies. For violations of 49 
U.S.C. chapter 449 (except sections 44902, 44903(d), 44907(a)-(d)(1)(A), 
44907(d)(1)(C)-(f), 44908, and 44909), or a regulation prescribed or 
order issued under any of those provisions, a party may only petition 
for review of a final decision and order of the Administrator to the 
courts of appeals of the United States or the United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia pursuant to section 49 U.S.C. 
46110. Neither an initial decision or order issued by an administrative 
law judge that has not been appealed to the TSA decision maker, nor an 
order compromising a civil penalty action constitutes a final order of 
the Administrator for the purposes of judicial appellate review under 49 
U.S.C. 46110.
    (l) Compromise. The TSA may compromise any civil penalty action 
initiated in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46301, involving an amount in 
controversy not exceeding $ 50,000, or any civil penalty action 
initiated in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46301 at any time before 
referring the action to the United States Attorney for collection.
    (1) An agency attorney may compromise any civil penalty action where 
a person charged with a violation agrees to pay a civil penalty and the 
TSA agrees to make no finding of violation. Pursuant to such agreement, 
a compromise order will be issued, stating:
    (i) The person agrees to pay a civil penalty;
    (ii) The TSA makes no finding of a violation; and
    (iii) The compromise order will not be used as evidence of a prior 
violation in any subsequent civil penalty proceeding.
    (2) An agency attorney may compromise the amount of any civil 
penalty proposed in a notice, assessed in an order, or imposed in a 
compromise order.

    This section may be used, at the agency's discretion, in enforcement 
actions involving individuals presenting dangerous or deadly weapons for 
screening at airports or in checked baggage where the amount of the 
proposed civil penalty is less than $5,000. In these cases, Sec. Sec. 
1503.16(a), 1503.16(c), and 1503.16 (f) through (l) are used, as well as 
paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section:
    (a) Delegation of authority. The authority of the Administrator, 
under 49 U.S.C. 46301, to initiate civil penalty actions in accordance 
with TSA policies and procedures promulgated pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 46301 
et seq. and 49 CFR part 1540, is delegated to each Federal Security 
Director for the purpose of issuing notices of violation in cases 
involving violations of 49 U.S.C. chapter 449, or a regulation 
prescribed or order issued under any of those provisions.
    (b) Notice of violation. A civil penalty action is initiated by 
sending a notice of violation to the person charged with the violation. 
The notice of violation contains a statement of the charges and the 
amount of the proposed civil penalty. Not later than 30 days after 
receipt of the notice of violation, the person charged with a violation 
must:
    (1) Submit the amount of the proposed civil penalty or an agreed-
upon amount, in which case either an order assessing a civil penalty or 
a compromise order will be issued in that amount; or
    (2) Submit to the agency attorney identified in the material 
accompanying the notice any of the following:
    (i) Written information, including documents and witness statements, 
demonstrating that a violation of the regulations did not occur or that 
a penalty or the penalty amount is not warranted by the circumstances; 
or
    (ii) A written request to reduce the proposed civil penalty, the 
amount of reduction, and the reasons and any documents supporting a 
reduction of the proposed civil penalty, including records indicating a 
financial inability to pay or records showing that payment of the 
proposed civil penalty would prevent the person from continuing in 
business; or
    (iii) A written request for an informal conference to discuss the 
matter with an agency attorney and submit relevant information or 
documents; or
    (3) Request a hearing in which case a complaint will be filed with 
the Enforcement Docket Clerk.
    (c) Final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order. A 
final notice of violation and civil penalty assessment order (``final 
notice and order'') may be issued after participation in any informal 
proceedings as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or after 
failure of the respondent to respond in a timely manner to a notice of 
violation. A final notice and order will be sent to the individual 
charged with

[[Page 248]]

a violation. The final notice and order will contain a statement of the 
charges and the amount of the proposed civil penalty and, as a result of 
information submitted to the agency attorney during any informal 
procedures, may reflect a modified allegation or proposed civil penalty. 
A final notice and order may be issued--
    (1) If the person charged with a violation fails to respond to the 
notice of violation within 30 days after receipt of that notice; or
    (2) If the parties participated in any informal procedures under 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the parties have not agreed to 
compromise the action or the agency attorney has not agreed to withdraw 
the notice of violation.
    (d) Order assessing civil penalty. An order assessing civil penalty 
may be issued after notice and opportunity for a hearing. A person 
charged with a violation may be subject to an order assessing civil 
penalty in the following circumstances:
    (1) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person 
charged with a violation submits, or agrees to submit, the amount of 
civil penalty proposed in the notice of violation.
    (2) An order assessing civil penalty may be issued if a person 
charged with a violation submits, or agrees to submit, an agreed-upon 
amount of civil penalty that is not reflected in either the notice of 
violation or the final notice and order.
    (3) The final notice and order becomes (and contains a statement so 
indicating) an order assessing a civil penalty when the person charged 
with a violation submits the amount of the proposed civil penalty that 
is reflected in the final notice and order.

may file a motion to dismiss a request for a hearing instead of filing a 
complaint. If the motion to dismiss is not granted, the agency attorney 
must file the complaint and must serve a copy of the complaint on each 
party not later than 20 days after service of the administrative law 
judge's ruling or order on the motion to dismiss. If the motion to 
dismiss is granted and the proceedings are terminated without a hearing, 
the respondent may file an appeal pursuant to Sec. 1503.233. If 
required by the decision on appeal, the agency attorney must file a 
complaint and must serve a copy of the complaint on each party not later 
than 20 days after service of the decision on appeal.
    (ii) Motion to dismiss a complaint. A respondent may file a motion 
to dismiss a complaint instead of filing an answer. If the motion to 
dismiss is not granted, the respondent must file an answer and must 
serve a copy of the answer on each party not later than 20 days after 
service of the administrative law judge's ruling or order on the motion 
to dismiss. If the motion to dismiss is granted and the proceedings are 
terminated without a hearing, the agency attorney may file an appeal 
pursuant to Sec. 1503.233. If required by the decision on appeal, the 
respondent must file an answer and must serve a copy of the answer on 
each party not later than 10 days after service of the decision on 
appeal.
    (3) Motion for more definite statement. A party may file a motion 
for more definite statement of any pleading that requires a response 
under this subpart. A party must set forth, in detail, the indefinite or 
uncertain allegations contained in a complaint or response to any 
pleading and must submit the details that the party believes would make 
the allegation or response definite and certain.
    (i) Complaint. A respondent may file a motion requesting a more 
definite statement of the allegations contained in the complaint instead 
of filing an answer. If the administrative law judge grants the motion, 
the agency attorney must supply a more definite statement

[[Page 256]]

not later than 15 days after service of the ruling granting the motion. 
If the agency attorney fails to supply a more definite statement, the 
administrative law judge must strike the allegations in the complaint to 
which the motion is directed. If the administrative law judge denies the 
motion, the respondent must file an answer and must serve a copy of the 
answer on each party not later than 20 days after service of the order 
of denial.
    (ii) Answer. An agency attorney may file a motion requesting a more 
definite statement if an answer fails to respond clearly to the 
allegations in the complaint. If the administrative law judge grants the 
motion, the respondent must supply a more definite statement not later 
than 15 days after service of the ruling on the motion. If the 
respondent fails to supply a more definite statement, the administrative 
law judge must strike those statements in the answer to which the motion 
is directed. The respondent's failure to supply a more definite 
statement may be deemed an admission of unanswered allegations in the 
complaint.
    (4) Motion to strike. Any party may make a motion to strike any 
insufficient allegation or defense, or any redundant, immaterial, or 
irrelevant matter in a pleading. A party must file a motion to strike 
before a response is required under this subpart or, if a response is 
not required, not later than 10 days after service of the pleading.
    (5) Motion for decision. A party may make a motion for decision, 
regarding all or any part of the proceedings, at any time before the 
administrative law judge has issued an initial decision in the 
proceedings. The administrative law judge must grant a party's motion 
for decision if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, 
admissions, matters that the administrative law judge has officially 
noticed, or evidence introduced during the hearing show that there is no 
genuine issue of material fact and that the party making the motion is 
entitled to a decision as a matter of law. The party making the motion 
for decision has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of 
material fact.
    (6) Motion for disqualification. A party may file the motion at any 
time after the administrative law judge has been assigned to the 
proceedings but must make the motion before the administrative law judge 
files an initial decision in the proceedings.
    (i) Motion and supporting affidavit. A party must state the grounds 
for disqualification, including, but not limited to, personal bias, 
pecuniary interest, or other factors showing disqualification, in the 
motion for disqualification. A party must submit an affidavit with the 
motion for disqualification that sets forth, in detail, the matters 
alleged to constitute grounds for disqualification.
    (ii) Answer. A party must respond to the motion for disqualification 
not later than 5 days after service of the motion for disqualification.
    (iii) Decision on motion for disqualification. The administrative 
law judge must render a decision on the motion for disqualification not 
later than 20 days after the motion has been filed. If the 
administrative law judge finds that the motion for disqualification and 
supporting affidavit show a basis for disqualification, the 
administrative law judge must withdraw from the proceedings immediately. 
If the administrative law judge finds that disqualification is not 
warranted, the administrative law judge must deny the motion and state 
the grounds for the denial on the record. If the administrative law 
judge fails to rule on a party's motion for disqualification within 20 
days after the motion has been filed, the motion is deemed granted.
    (iv) Appeal. A party may appeal the administrative law judge's 
denial of the motion for disqualification in accordance with Sec. 
1503.219(b).


<R05>
Sec. 1503.219  Interlocutory appeals.

    (a) General. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, a party may 
not appeal a ruling or decision of the administrative law judge to the 
TSA decision maker until the initial decision has been entered on the 
record. A decision or order of the TSA decision maker on the 
interlocutory appeal does not constitute a final order of the 
Administrator for the purposes of judicial appellate review under 49 
U.S.C. 46110.

[[Page 257]]

    (b) Interlocutory appeal for cause. If a party files a written 
request for an interlocutory appeal for cause with the administrative 
law judge, or orally requests an interlocutory appeal for cause, the 
proceedings are stayed until the administrative law judge issues a 
decision on the request. If the administrative law judge grants the 
request, the proceedings are stayed until the TSA decision maker issues 
a decision on the interlocutory appeal. The administrative law judge 
must grant an interlocutory appeal for cause if a party shows that delay 
of the appeal would be detrimental to the public interest or would 
result in undue prejudice to any party.
    (c) Interlocutory appeals of right. If a party notifies the 
administrative law judge of an interlocutory appeal of right, the 
proceedings are stayed until the TSA decision maker issues a decision on 
the interlocutory appeal. A party may file an interlocutory appeal, 
without the consent of the administrative law judge, before an initial 
decision has been entered in the case of:
    (1) A ruling or order by the administrative law judge barring a 
person from the proceedings.
    (2) Failure of the administrative law judge to dismiss the 
proceedings in accordance with Sec. 1503.215.
    (3) A ruling or order by the administrative law judge in violation 
of Sec. 1503.205(b).
    (4) A ruling or order by the administrative law judge regarding 
public access to a particular docket or documents.
    (d) Procedure. Not later than 10 days after the administrative law 
judge's decision forming the basis of an interlocutory appeal of right 
or not later than 10 days after the administrative law judge's decision 
granting an interlocutory appeal for cause, a party must file a notice 
of interlocutory appeal, with supporting documents, and the party must 
serve a copy of the notice and supporting documents on each party. Not 
later than 10 days after service of the appeal brief, a party must file 
a reply brief, if any, and the party must serve a copy of the reply 
brief on each party. The TSA decision maker must render a decision on 
the interlocutory appeal, on the record and as a part of the decision in 
the proceedings, within a reasonable time after receipt of the 
interlocutory appeal.
    (e) Frivolous appeals. The TSA decision maker may reject frivolous, 
repetitive, or dilatory appeals, and may issue an order precluding one 
or more parties from making further interlocutory appeals in a 
proceeding in which there have been frivolous, repetitive, or dilatory 
interlocutory appeals.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.220  Discovery.

    (a) Initiation of discovery. Any party may initiate discovery 
described in this section, without the consent or approval of the 
administrative law judge, at any time after a complaint has been filed 
in the proceedings.
    (b) Methods of discovery. The following methods of discovery are 
permitted under this section: depositions on oral examination or written 
questions of any person; written interrogatories directed to a party; 
requests for production of documents or tangible items to any person; 
and requests for admission by a party. A party is not required to file 
written discovery requests and responses with the administrative law 
judge or the Enforcement Docket Clerk. In the event of a discovery 
dispute, a party must attach a copy of these documents in support of a 
motion made under this section.
    (c) Service on the agency. A party must serve each discovery request 
directed to the agency or any agency employee on the agency attorney of 
record.
    (d) Time for response to discovery requests. Unless otherwise 
directed by this subpart or agreed by the parties, a party must respond 
to a request for discovery, including filing objections to a request for 
discovery, not later than 30 days after service of the request.
    (e) Scope of discovery. Subject to the limits on discovery set forth 
in paragraph (f) of this section, a party may discover any matter that 
is not privileged and that is relevant to the subject matter of the 
proceeding. A party may discover information that relates to the claim 
or defense of any party including the existence, description, nature, 
custody, condition, and location

[[Page 258]]

of any document or other tangible item and the identity and location of 
any person having knowledge of discoverable matter. A party may discover 
facts known, or opinions held, by an expert who any other party expects 
to call to testify at the hearing. A party may not object to a discovery 
request on the basis that the information sought would not be admissible 
at the hearing if the information sought during discovery is reasonably 
calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
    (f) Limiting discovery. The administrative law judge must limit the 
frequency and extent of discovery permitted by this section if a party 
shows that--
    (1) The information requested is cumulative or repetitious;
    (2) The information requested can be obtained from another less 
burdensome and more convenient source;
    (3) The party requesting the information has had ample opportunity 
to obtain the information through other discovery methods permitted 
under this section; or
    (4) The method or scope of discovery requested by the party is 
unduly burdensome or expensive.
    (g) Confidential orders. A party or person who has received a 
discovery request for information that is related to a trade secret, 
confidential or sensitive material, competitive or commercial 
information, proprietary data, or information on research and 
development, may file a motion for a confidential order with the 
administrative law judge and must serve a copy of the motion for a 
confidential order on each party.
    (1) The party or person making the motion must show that the 
confidential order is necessary to protect the information from 
disclosure to the public.
    (2) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested 
material is not necessary to decide the case, the administrative law 
judge must preclude any inquiry into the matter by any party.
    (3) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested 
material may be disclosed during discovery, the administrative law judge 
may order that the material may be discovered and disclosed under 
limited conditions or may be used only under certain terms and 
conditions.
    (4) If the administrative law judge determines that the requested 
material is necessary to decide the case and that a confidential order 
is warranted, the administrative law judge must provide:
    (i) An opportunity for review of the document by the parties off the 
record;
    (ii) Procedures for excluding the information from the record; and
    (iii) Order that the parties must not disclose the information in 
any manner and the parties must not use the information in any other 
proceeding.
    (h) Protective orders. A party or a person who has received a 
request for discovery may file a motion for protective order and must 
serve a copy of the motion for protective order on each party. The party 
or person making the motion must show that the protective order is 
necessary to protect the party or the person from annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. As part of the 
protective order, the administrative law judge may:
    (1) Deny the discovery request;
    (2) Order that discovery be conducted only on specified terms and 
conditions, including a designation of the time or place for discovery 
or a determination of the method of discovery; or
    (3) Limit the scope of discovery or preclude any inquiry into 
certain matters during discovery.
    (i) Duty to supplement or amend responses. A party who has responded 
to a discovery request has a duty to supplement or amend the response, 
as soon as the information is known, as follows:
    (1) A party must supplement or amend any response to a question 
requesting the identity and location of any person having knowledge of 
discoverable matters.
    (2) A party must supplement or amend any response to a question 
requesting the identity of each person who will be called to testify at 
the hearing as an expert witness and the subject matter and substance of 
that witness' testimony.
    (3) A party must supplement or amend any response that was incorrect 
when made or any response that was

[[Page 259]]

correct when made but is no longer correct, accurate, or complete.
    (j) Depositions. The following rules apply to depositions taken 
pursuant to this section:
    (1) Form. A deposition must be taken on the record and reduced to 
writing. The person being deposed must sign the deposition unless the 
parties agree to waive the requirement of a signature.
    (2) Administration of oaths. Within the United States, or a 
territory or possession subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, a party must take a deposition before a person authorized to 
administer oaths by the laws of the United States or authorized by the 
law of the place where the examination is held. In foreign countries, a 
party will take a deposition in any manner allowed by the Federal Rules 
of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C. App.).
    (3) Notice of deposition. A party must serve a notice of deposition, 
stating the time and place of the deposition and the name and address of 
each person to be examined, on the person to be deposed, on the 
administrative law judge, on the Enforcement Docket Clerk, and on each 
party not later than 7 days before the deposition. A party may serve a 
notice of deposition less than 7 days before the deposition only with 
consent of the administrative law judge. If a subpoena duces tecum is to 
be served on the person to be examined, the party must attach a copy of 
the subpoena duces tecum that describes the materials to be produced at 
the deposition to the notice of deposition.
    (4) Use of depositions. A party may use any part or all of a 
deposition at a hearing authorized under this subpart only upon a 
showing of good cause. The deposition may be used against any party who 
was present or represented at the deposition or who had reasonable 
notice of the deposition.
    (k) Interrogatories. A party, the party's attorney, or the party's 
representative may sign the party's responses to interrogatories. A 
party must answer each interrogatory separately and completely in 
writing. If a party objects to an interrogatory, the party must state 
the objection and the reasons for the objection. An opposing party may 
use any part or all of a party's responses to interrogatories at a 
hearing authorized under this subpart to the extent that the response is 
relevant, material, and not repetitious.
    (1) A party must not serve more than 30 interrogatories to each 
other party. Each subpart of an interrogatory will be counted as a 
separate interrogatory.
    (2) Before serving additional interrogatories on a party, a party 
must file a motion for leave to serve additional interrogatories on a 
party with the administrative law judge and must serve a copy on each 
party before serving additional interrogatories on a party. The 
administrative law judge may grant the motion only if the party shows 
good cause for the party's failure to inquire about the information 
previously and that the information cannot reasonably be obtained using 
less burdensome discovery methods or be obtained from other sources.
    (l) Requests for admission. A party may serve a written request for 
admission of the truth of any matter within the scope of discovery under 
this section or the authenticity of any document described in the 
request. A party must set forth each request for admission separately. A 
party must serve copies of documents referenced in the request for 
admission unless the documents have been provided or are reasonably 
available for inspection and copying.
    (1) Time. A party's failure to respond to a request for admission, 
in writing and signed by the attorney or the party, not later than 30 
days after service of the request, is deemed an admission of the truth 
of the statement or statements contained in the request for admission. 
The administrative law judge may determine that a failure to respond to 
a request for admission is not deemed an admission of the truth if a 
party shows that the failure was due to circumstances beyond the control 
of the party or the party's attorney.
    (2) Response. A party may object to a request for admission and must 
state the reasons for objection. A party may specifically deny the truth 
of the matter or describe the reasons why the party is unable to 
truthfully deny or admit the matter. If a party is unable to deny or 
admit the truth of the matter, the party must show that the party has 
made reasonable inquiry into

[[Page 260]]

the matter or that the information known to, or readily obtainable by, 
the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny the 
matter. A party may admit or deny any part of the request for admission. 
If the administrative law judge determines that a response does not 
comply with the requirements of this rule or that the response is 
insufficient, the matter is deemed admitted.
    (3) Effect of admission. Any matter admitted or deemed admitted 
under this section is conclusively established for the purpose of the 
hearing and appeal.
    (m) Motion to compel discovery. A party may make a motion to compel 
discovery if a person refuses to answer a question during a deposition, 
a party fails or refuses to answer an interrogatory, if a person gives 
an evasive or incomplete answer during a deposition or when responding 
to an interrogatory, or a party fails or refuses to produce documents or 
tangible items. During a deposition, the proponent of a question may 
complete the deposition or may adjourn the examination before making a 
motion to compel if a person refuses to answer.
    (n) Failure to comply with a discovery order or order to compel. If 
a party fails to comply with a discovery order or an order to compel, 
the administrative law judge, limited to the extent of the party's 
failure to comply with the discovery order or motion to compel, may:
    (1) Strike that portion of a party's pleadings;
    (2) Preclude prehearing or discovery motions by that party;
    (3) Preclude admission of that portion of a party's evidence at the 
hearing; or
    (4) Preclude that portion of the testimony of that party's witnesses 
at the hearing.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.221  Notice of hearing.

    (a) Notice. The administrative law judge must give each party at 
least 60 days notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing. 
With the consent of the administrative law judge, the parties may agree 
to hold the hearing on an earlier date than the date specified in the 
notice of hearing.
    (b) Date, time, and location of the hearing. The administrative law 
judge to whom the proceedings have been assigned must set a reasonable 
date, time, and location for the hearing. The administrative law judge 
must consider the need for discovery and any joint procedural or 
discovery schedule submitted by the parties when determining the hearing 
date. The administrative law judge must give due regard to the 
convenience of the parties, the location where the majority of the 
witnesses reside or work, and whether the location is served by a 
scheduled air carrier.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.222  Evidence.

    (a) General. A party is entitled to present the party's case or 
defense by oral, documentary, or demonstrative evidence, to submit 
rebuttal evidence, and to conduct any cross-examination that may be 
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
    (b) Admissibility. A party may introduce any oral, documentary, or 
demonstrative evidence in support of the party's case or defense. The 
administrative law judge must admit any oral, documentary, or 
demonstrative evidence introduced by a party but must exclude 
irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.
    (c) Hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings 
governed by this subpart. The fact that evidence submitted by a party is 
hearsay goes only to the weight of the evidence and does not affect its 
admissibility.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.223  Standard of proof.

    The administrative law judge may issue an initial decision or may 
rule in a party's favor only if the decision or ruling is supported by, 
and in accordance with, the reliable, probative, and substantial 
evidence contained in the record. In order to prevail, the party with 
the burden of proof must prove the party's case or defense by a 
preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.224  Burden of proof.

    (a) Except in the case of an affirmative defense, the burden of

of a motion, request, or order has the burden of proof.
    (c) A party who has asserted an affirmative defense has the burden 
of proving the affirmative defense.


<R05>

    A party whose evidence has been excluded by a ruling of the 
administrative law judge may offer the evidence for the record on 
appeal.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.226  Public disclosure of evidence.

    This section applies to information other than Sensitive Security 
Information (SSI). All release of SSI is governed by Sec. 1503.230.
    (a) The administrative law judge may order that any other 
information contained in the record be withheld from public disclosure. 
Any person may object to disclosure of information in the record by 
filing a written motion to withhold specific information with the 
administrative law judge and serving a copy of the motion on each party. 
The party must state the specific grounds for nondisclosure in the 
motion.
    (b) The administrative law judge must grant the motion to withhold 
information in the record if, based on the motion and any response to 
the motion, the administrative law judge determines that disclosure 
would be detrimental to transportation safety, disclosure would not be 
in the public interest, or that the information is not otherwise 
required to be made available to the public.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.227  Expert or opinion witnesses.

    An employee of the agency may not be called as an expert or opinion 
witness, for any party other than the TSA, in any proceeding governed by 
this subpart. An employee of a respondent may not be called by an agency 
attorney as an expert or opinion witness for the TSA in any proceeding 
governed by this subpart to which the respondent is a party.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.228  Subpoenas.

    (a) Request for subpoena. A party may obtain a subpoena to compel 
the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing or to require the 
production of documents or tangible items from the administrative law 
judge who is assigned to the case, or, if no administrative law judge is 
assigned or the assigned law judge is unavailable, from the chief 
administrative law judge. The party must complete the subpoena, stating 
the title of the action and the date and time for the witness' 
attendance or production of documents or items. The party who obtained 
the subpoena must serve the subpoena on the witness.
    (b) Motion to quash or modify the subpoena. A party, or any person 
upon whom a subpoena has been served, may file a motion to quash or 
modify the subpoena at or before the time specified in the subpoena for 
compliance. The applicant must describe, in detail, the basis for the 
application to quash or modify the subpoena including, but not limited 
to, a statement that the testimony, document, or tangible evidence is 
not relevant to the proceeding, that the subpoena is not reasonably 
tailored to the scope of the proceeding, or that the subpoena is 
unreasonable and oppressive. A motion to quash or modify the subpoena 
will stay the effect of the subpoena pending a decision by the 
administrative law judge on the motion.
    (c) Enforcement of subpoena. Upon a showing that a person has failed 
or refused to comply with a subpoena, a party may apply to the local 
Federal district court to seek judicial enforcement of the subpoena in 
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 46104.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.229  Witness fees.

    (a) General. Unless otherwise authorized by the administrative law 
judge, the party who applies for a subpoena to compel the attendance of 
a witness at a deposition or hearing, or the party at whose request a 
witness appears at a deposition or hearing, must pay the witness fees 
described in this section.
    (b) Amount. Except for an employee of the agency who appears at the 
direction of the agency, a witness who appears at a deposition or 
hearing is entitled to the same fees and mileage expenses as are paid to 
a witness in a court of the United States in comparable circumstances.

[[Page 262]]


<R05>
Sec. 1503.230  Record.

    (a) Exclusive record. The request for hearing, complaint, answer, 
transcript of all testimony in the hearing, all exhibits received into 
evidence, and all motions, applications, requests, and rulings will 
constitute the exclusive record for decision of the proceedings and the 
basis for the issuance of any orders in the proceeding.
    (b) Examination and copying of record--(1) Generally. Any person 
interested in reviewing or obtaining a copy of a record may do so only 
by submitting a FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. 552 and 49 CFR part 7. 
Portions of the record may be exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA.

<R05>
Sec. 1503.231  Argument before the administrative law judge.

    (a) Arguments during the hearing. During the hearing, the 
administrative law judge must give the parties a reasonable opportunity 
to present arguments on the record supporting or opposing motions, 
objections, and rulings if the parties request an opportunity for 
argument. The administrative law judge may request written arguments 
during the hearing if the administrative law judge finds that submission 
of written arguments would be reasonable.
    (b) Final oral argument. At the conclusion of the hearing and before 
the administrative law judge issues an initial decision in the 
proceedings, the parties are entitled to submit oral proposed findings 
of fact and conclusions of law, exceptions to rulings of the 
administrative law judge, and supporting arguments for the findings, 
conclusions, or exceptions. At the conclusion of the hearing, a party 
may waive final oral argument.
    (c) Posthearing briefs. The administrative law judge may request 
written posthearing briefs before the administrative law judge issues an 
initial decision in the proceedings. If a party files a written 
posthearing brief, the party must include proposed findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, exceptions to rulings of the administrative law 
judge, and supporting arguments for the findings, conclusions, or 
exceptions. The administrative law judge must give the parties a 
reasonable opportunity, not more than 30 days after receipt of the 
transcript, to prepare and submit the briefs.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.232  Initial decision.

    (a) Contents. The administrative law judge must issue an initial 
decision at the conclusion of the hearing. In each oral or written 
decision, the administrative law judge must include findings of fact and 
conclusions of law, and the grounds supporting those findings and 
conclusions, upon all material issues of fact, the credibility of 
witnesses, the applicable law, any exercise of the administrative law 
judge's discretion, the amount of any civil penalty found appropriate by 
the administrative law judge, and a discussion of the basis for any 
order issued in the proceedings. The administrative law judge is not 
required to provide a written explanation for rulings on objections, 
procedural motions, and other matters not directly relevant to the 
substance of the initial decision. If the administrative law judge 
refers to any previous unreported or unpublished initial decision, the 
administrative law judge must make copies of that initial decision 
available to all parties and the TSA decision maker.
    (b) Oral decision. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this 
section, at the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative law judge 
must issue the initial decision and order orally on the record.

[[Page 263]]

    (c) Written decision. The administrative law judge may issue a 
written initial decision not later than 30 days after the conclusion of 
the hearing or submission of the last post-hearing brief if the 
administrative law judge finds that issuing a written initial decision 
is reasonable. The administrative law judge must serve a copy of any 
written initial decision on each party.
    (d) Order assessing civil penalty. Unless appealed pursuant to Sec. 
1503.233, the initial decision issued by the administrative law judge 
will be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the 
administrative law judge finds that an alleged violation occurred and 
determines that a civil penalty, in an amount found appropriate by the 
administrative law judge, is warranted.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.233  Appeal from initial decision.

    (a) Notice of appeal. A party may appeal the initial decision, and 
any decision not previously appealed pursuant to Sec. 1503.219, by 
filing a notice of appeal with the Enforcement Docket Clerk. A party 
must file the notice of appeal with the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security, Transportation Security Administration, Office of the Chief 
Counsel, TSA-2, Attention: Enforcement Docket Clerk, 601 South 12th 
Street, Arlington, VA 22202-4220. A party must file the notice of appeal 
not later than 10 days after entry of the oral initial decision on the 
record or service of the written initial decision on the parties and 
must serve a copy of the notice of appeal on each party.
    (b) Issues on appeal. A party may appeal only the following issues:
    (1) Whether each finding of fact is supported by a preponderance of 
reliable, probative, and substantial evidence;
    (2) Whether each conclusion of law is made in accordance with 
applicable law, precedent, and public policy; and
    (3) Whether the administrative law judge committed any prejudicial 
errors during the hearing that support the appeal.
    (c) Perfecting an appeal. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a 
party must perfect an appeal, not later than 50 days after entry of the 
oral initial decision on the record or service of the written initial 
decision on the party, by filing an appeal brief with the Enforcement 
Docket Clerk.
    (1) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may 
agree to extend the time for perfecting the appeal with the consent of 
the TSA decision maker. If the TSA decision maker grants an extension of 
time to perfect the appeal, the Enforcement Docket Clerk will serve a 
letter confirming the extension of time on each party.
    (2) Written motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an 
extension of time for perfecting an appeal, a party desiring an 
extension of time may file a written motion for an extension with the 
Enforcement Docket Clerk and must serve a copy of the motion on each 
party. The TSA decision maker may grant an extension if good cause for 
the extension is shown in the motion.
    (d) Appeal briefs. A party must file the appeal brief with the TSA 
Enforcement Docket Clerk and must serve a copy of the appeal brief on 
each party.
    (1) A party must set forth, in detail, the party's specific 
objections to the initial decision or rulings in the appeal brief. A 
party also must set forth, in detail, the basis for the appeal, the 
reasons supporting the appeal, and the relief requested in the appeal. 
If the party relies on evidence contained in the record for the appeal, 
the party must specifically refer to the pertinent evidence contained in 
the transcript in the appeal brief.
    (2) The TSA decision maker may dismiss an appeal, on the TSA 
decision maker's own initiative or upon motion of any other party, where 
a party has filed a notice of appeal but fails to perfect the appeal by 
timely filing an appeal brief.
    (e) Reply brief. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, any party 
may file a reply brief not later than 35 days after the appeal brief has 
been served on that party. The party filing the reply brief must serve a 
copy of the reply brief on each party. If the party relies on evidence 
contained in the record for the reply, the party must specifically refer 
to the pertinent evidence contained in the transcript in the reply 
brief.
    (1) Extension of time by agreement of the parties. The parties may 
agree to

[[Page 264]]

extend the time for filing a reply brief with the consent of the TSA 
decision maker. If the TSA decision maker grants an extension of time to 
file the reply brief, the Enforcement Docket Clerk will serve a letter 
confirming the extension of time on each party.
    (2) Written motion for extension. If the parties do not agree to an 
extension of time for filing a reply brief, a party desiring an 
extension of time may file a written motion for an extension and will 
serve a copy of the motion on each party. The TSA decision maker may 
grant an extension if good cause for the extension is shown in the 
motion.
    (f) Other briefs. The TSA decision maker may allow any person to 
submit an amicus curiae brief in an appeal of an initial decision. A 
party may not file more than one appeal brief or reply brief. A party 
may petition the TSA decision maker, in writing, for leave to file an 
additional brief and must serve a copy of the petition on each party. 
The party may not file the additional brief with the petition. The TSA 
decision maker may grant leave to file an additional brief if the party 
demonstrates good cause for allowing additional argument on the appeal. 
The TSA decision maker will allow a reasonable time for the party to 
file the additional brief.
    (g) Number of copies. A party must file the original appeal brief or 
the original reply brief, and two copies of the brief, with the 
Enforcement Docket Clerk.
    (h) Oral argument. The TSA decision maker has sole discretion to 
permit oral argument on the appeal. On the TSA decision maker's own 
initiative or upon written motion by any party, the TSA decision maker 
may find that oral argument will contribute substantially to the 
development of the issues on appeal and may grant the parties an 
opportunity for oral argument.
    (i) Waiver of objections on appeal. If a party fails to object to 
any alleged error regarding the proceedings in an appeal or a reply 
brief, the party waives any objection to the alleged error. The TSA 
decision maker is not required to consider any objection in an appeal 
brief or any argument in the reply brief if a party's objection is based 
on evidence contained on the record and the party does not specifically 
refer to the pertinent evidence from the record in the brief.
    (j) The TSA decision maker's decision on appeal. The TSA decision 
maker will review the briefs on appeal and the oral argument, if any, to 
determine if the administrative law judge committed prejudicial error in 
the proceedings or that the initial decision should be affirmed, 
modified, or reversed. The TSA decision maker may affirm, modify, or 
reverse the initial decision, make any necessary findings, or may remand 
the case for any proceedings that the TSA decision maker determines may 
be necessary.
    (1) The TSA decision maker may raise any issue, on the TSA decision 
maker's own initiative, that is required for proper disposition of the 
proceedings. The TSA decision maker will give the parties a reasonable 
opportunity to submit arguments on the new issues before making a 
decision on appeal. If an issue raised by the TSA decision maker 
requires the consideration of additional testimony or evidence, the TSA 
decision maker will remand the case to the administrative law judge for 
further proceedings and an initial decision related to that issue. If an 
issue raised by the TSA decision maker is solely an issue of law or the 
issue was addressed at the hearing but was not raised by a party in the 
briefs on appeal, a remand of the case to the administrative law judge 
for further proceedings is not required but may be provided in the 
discretion of the TSA decision maker.
    (2) The TSA decision maker will issue the final decision and order 
of the Administrator on appeal in writing and will serve a copy of the 
decision and order on each party. Unless a petition for review is filed 
pursuant to Sec. 1503.235, a final decision and order of the 
Administrator will be considered an order assessing civil penalty if the 
TSA decision maker finds that an alleged violation occurred and a civil 
penalty is warranted.
    (3) A final decision and order of the Administrator after appeal is 
precedent in any other civil penalty action. Any issue, finding or 
conclusion, order, ruling, or initial decision of an administrative law 
judge that has not been appealed to the TSA decision maker is

[[Page 265]]

not precedent in any other civil penalty action.
    (4) The TSA decision maker will determine whether the decision and 
order of the TSA decision maker, with the administrative law judge's 
initial decision or order attached, may be released to the public, 
either in whole or in redacted form. In making this determination, the 
TSA decision maker will consider whether disclosure of any of the 
information in the decision and order would be detrimental to 
transportation safety, would not be in the public interest, or should 
not otherwise be required to be made available to the public.

    (a) General. Any party may petition the TSA decision maker to 
reconsider or modify a final decision and order issued by the TSA 
decision maker on appeal from an initial decision. A party must file a 
petition to reconsider or modify not later than 30 days after service of 
the TSA decision maker's final decision and order on appeal and must 
serve a copy of the petition on each party. The TSA decision maker will 
not reconsider or modify an initial decision and order issued by an 
administrative law judge that has not been appealed by any party to the 
TSA decision maker and filed with the Enforcement Docket Clerk.
    (b) Form and number of copies. A party must file a petition to 
reconsider or modify, in writing. The party must file the original 
petition with the Enforcement Docket Clerk and must serve a copy of the 
petition on each party.
    (c) Contents. A party must state briefly and specifically the 
alleged errors in the final decision and order on appeal, the relief 
sought by the party, and the grounds that support, the petition to 
reconsider or modify.
    (1) If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on allegations 
regarding the consequences of the TSA decision maker's decision, the 
party must describe these allegations and must describe, and support, 
the basis for the allegations.
    (2) If the petition is based, in whole or in part, on new material 
not previously raised in the proceedings, the party must set forth the 
new material and include affidavits of prospective witnesses and 
authenticated documents that would be introduced in support of the new 
material. The party must explain, in detail, why the new material was 
not discovered through due diligence prior to the hearing.
    (d) Repetitious and frivolous petitions. The TSA decision maker will 
not consider repetitious or frivolous petitions. The TSA decision maker 
may summarily dismiss repetitious or frivolous petitions to reconsider 
or modify.
    (e) Reply petitions. Any other party may reply to a petition to 
reconsider or modify, not later than 10 days after service of the 
petition on that party, by filing a reply with the Enforcement Docket 
Clerk. A party must serve a copy of the reply on each party.
    (f) Effect of filing petition. Unless otherwise ordered by the TSA 
decision maker, filing of a petition pursuant to this section will stay 
the effective date of the TSA decision maker's final decision and order 
on appeal.
    (g) The TSA decision maker's decision on petition. The TSA decision 
maker has sole discretion to grant or deny a petition to reconsider or 
modify. The TSA decision maker will grant or deny a petition to 
reconsider or modify within a reasonable time after receipt of the 
petition or receipt of the reply petition, if any. The TSA decision 
maker may affirm, modify, or reverse the final decision and order on 
appeal, or may remand the case for any proceedings that the TSA decision 
maker determines may be necessary.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.235  Judicial review of a final order.

    A person may seek judicial review of a final order of the 
Administrator as provided in 49 U.S.C. 46110. A party seeking judicial 
review of a final order must file a petition for review not later than 
60 days after the final order has been served on the party.

<R04>
          Subpart H_Civil Monetary Penalty Inflation Adjustment


<R05>
Sec. 1503.301  Scope and purpose.

    (a) This subpart provides a mechanism for the regular adjustment for 
inflation of civil monetary penalties in conformity with the Federal 
Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C. 2461 (note), 
as amended, in order to maintain the deterrent effect of civil monetary 
penalties and to promote compliance with the law. This subpart also sets 
out the current adjusted maximum civil monetary penalties or range of 
minimum and maximum civil monetary penalties for each statutory civil 
penalty subject to the TSA's jurisdiction.
    (b) Each adjustment to the maximum civil monetary penalty or the 
range of minimum and maximum civil monetary penalties, as applicable, 
made in accordance with this subpart applies prospectively from the date 
it becomes effective to actions initiated under this part, 
notwithstanding references to a specific maximum civil monetary penalty 
or range of minimum and maximum civil monetary penalties contained 
elsewhere in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.303  Definitions.

    The following definitions apply to this subpart:
    Civil monetary penalty means any penalty, fine, or other sanction 
that:
    (1) Is for a specific monetary amount as provided by Federal law or 
has a maximum amount provided by Federal law;
    (2) Is assessed or enforced by the TSA pursuant to Federal law; and
    (3) Is assessed or enforced pursuant to an administrative proceeding 
or a civil action in the Federal courts.
    Consumer Price Index means the Consumer Price Index for all urban 
consumers published by the Department of Labor.


<R05>
Sec. 1503.305  Cost of living adjustments of civil monetary penalties.

    (a) Adjustment determination. Except for the limitation to the 
initial adjustment to statutory maximum civil monetary penalties or 
range of minimum and maximum civil monetary penalties set forth in 
paragraph (c) of this section, the inflation adjustment under this 
subpart is determined by increasing the maximum civil monetary penalty 
or range of minimum and maximum civil monetary penalty for each civil 
monetary penalty by the cost-of-living adjustment. Any increase 
determined under this paragraph (a) is rounded to the nearest:
    (1) Multiple of $10 in the case of penalties less than or equal to 
$100;
    (2) Multiple of $100 in the case of penalties greater than $100 but 
less than or equal to $1,000;
    (3) Multiple of $1,000 in the case of penalties greater than $1,000 
but less than or equal to $10,000;
    (4) Multiple of $5,000 in the case of penalties greater than $10,000 
but less than or equal to $100,000;
    (5) Multiple of $10,000 in the case of penalties greater than 
$100,000 but less than or equal to $200,000; and
    (6) Multiple of $25,000 in the case of penalties greater than 
$200,000.
    (b) Definition. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the 
term cost-of-living adjustment means the percentage (if any) for each 
civil monetary penalty by which the Consumer Price Index for the month 
of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the 
Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which 
the amount of such civil monetary penalty was last set or adjusted 
pursuant to law.
    (c) Limitation on initial adjustment. The initial adjustment of 
maximum civil penalty or range of minimum and maximum civil monetary 
penalties made pursuant to this subpart does not exceed 10 percent of 
the statutory maximum civil penalty before an adjustment under this 
subpart is made. This limitation applies only to the initial adjustment, 
effective on January 21, 1997.
    (d) Inflation adjustment. Minimum and maximum civil monetary 
penalties within the jurisdiction of the TSA are adjusted for inflation 
as follows:

PART 1507_PRIVACY ACT-EXEMPTIONS--Table of Contents

<R05>


Sec.
1507.1 Scope.
1507.3 Exemptions.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 114(l)(1), 40113, 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) and (k).

    Source: 69 FR 35537, June 25, 2004, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1507.1  Scope.

    This part implements provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) 
that permit TSA to exempt any system of records within the agency from 
certain requirements of the Act. The procedures governing access to, and 
correction of, records in a TSA system of records are set forth in 6 CFR 
part 5, subpart B.


<R05>
Sec. 1507.3  Exemptions.

    The following TSA systems of records are exempt from certain 
provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j), (k), 
or both, as set forth in this section. During the course of normal 
agency functions, exempt materials from one system of records may become 
part of one or more other systems of records. To the extent that any 
portion of system of records becomes part of another Privacy Act system 
of records, TSA hereby claims the same exemptions as were claimed in the 
original primary system of which they are a part and claims any 
additional exemptions in accordance with this part.
    (a) Transportation Security Enforcement Record System (DHS/TSA 001). 
The Transportation Security Enforcement Record System (TSERS) (DHS/TSA 
001) enables TSA to maintain a system of records related to the 
screening of passengers and property and they may be used to identify, 
review, analyze, investigate, and prosecute violations or potential 
violations of criminal statutes and transportation security laws. 
Pursuant to exemptions (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, 
DHS/TSA 001 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(3), 
(e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular 
subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because 
release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of an 
investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory 
violation to the existence of the investigation and reveal investigative 
interest on the part of TSA, as well as the recipient agency. Disclosure 
of the accounting would therefore present a serious impediment to 
transportation security, law enforcement efforts, and efforts to 
preserve national security. Disclosure of the accounting would also 
permit the individual who is the subject of a record to impede the 
investigation and avoid detection or apprehension, which undermines the 
entire system.

[[Page 268]]

    (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to the 
records contained in this system of records could inform the subject of 
an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or 
regulatory violation to the existence of the investigation and reveal 
investigative interest on the part of TSA, as well as the recipient 
agency. Access to the records would permit the individual who is the 
subject of a record to impede the investigation and avoid detection or 
apprehension. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing 
investigations and law enforcement activities, and impose an impossible 
administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously 
reinvestigated. The information contained in the system may also include 
properly classified information, the release of which would pose a 
threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, 
permitting access and amendment to such information also could disclose 
sensitive security information, which could be detrimental to 
transportation security.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) 
because in the course of investigations into potential violations of 
transportation security laws, the accuracy of information obtained or 
introduced occasionally may be unclear or the information may not be 
strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the 
interests of effective enforcement of transportation security laws, it 
is appropriate to retain all information that may aid in establishing 
patterns of unlawful activity.
    (4) From subsection (e)(3) (Privacy Act Statement) because 
disclosing the authority, purpose, routine uses, and potential 
consequences of not providing information could reveal the investigative 
interests of TSA, as well as the nature and scope of an investigation, 
the disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency 
regulations or statutes.
    (5) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), 
and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access 
provisions of subsection (d).
    (b) Transportation Workers Employment Investigations System (DHS/TSA 
002). The Transportation Workers Employment Investigations System (TWEI) 
(DHS/TSA 002) enables TSA to facilitate the performance of background 
checks on employees of transportation operators and others who are 
issued credentials or clearances by transportation operators, other than 
TSA employees. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy 
Act, DHS/TSA 002 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), 
(e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular 
subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because 
release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative 
interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record 
pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore 
present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of 
the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record 
would learn of third-agency investigate interests and thereby avoid 
detection or apprehension.
    (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the 
records contained in this system could reveal investigate techniques and 
procedures in the transportation workers employment investigation 
process, as well as the nature and scope of the employment 
investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to 
circumvent agency regulations or statutes and obtain access to sensitive 
information and restricted areas in the transportation industry. The 
information contained in the system might include properly classified 
information, the release of which would pose a threat to national 
defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and 
amendment to such information could reveal sensitive security 
information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), the disclosure of 
which could be detrimental to the security of transportation.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), 
because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during 
the course of an employment investigation may occasionally contain 
information that is

[[Page 269]]

not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific employment 
investigation. In the interests of administering an effective and 
comprehensive transportation worker employment investigation program, it 
is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that 
may aid in that process.
    (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), 
and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access 
provisions of subsection (d).
    (c) Personnel Background Investigation File System (DHS/TSA 004). 
The Personnel Background Investigation File System (PBIFS) (DHS/TSA 004) 
enables TSA to maintain investigative and background material used to 
make suitability and eligibility determinations regarding current and 
former TSA employees, applicants for TSA employment, and TSA contract 
employees. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, 
the Personnel Background Investigation File System is exempt from 5 
U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) (Accounting of Disclosures) and (d) (Access to 
Records). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified 
because this system contains investigatory material compiled solely for 
determining suitability, eligibility, and qualifications for Federal 
civilian employment. To the extent that the disclosure of material would 
reveal any classified material or the identity of a source who furnished 
information to the Government under an express promise that the identity 
of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 
1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be 
held in confidence, the applicability of exemption (k)(5) will be 
required to honor promises of confidentiality should the data subject 
request access to or amendment of the record, or access to the 
accounting of disclosures of the record. Exemption (k)(1) will be 
required to protect any classified information that may be in this 
system.
    (d) Internal Investigation Record System (DHS/TSA 005). The Internal 
Investigation Record System (IIRS) (DHS/TSA 005) contains records of 
internal investigations for all modes of transportation for which TSA 
has security-related duties. This system covers information regarding 
investigations of allegations or appearances of misconduct of current or 
former TSA employees or contractors and provides support for any adverse 
action that may occur as a result of the findings of the investigation. 
It is being modified to cover investigations of security-related 
incidents and reviews of TSA programs and operations. Pursuant to 
exemptions (j)(2), (k)(1), and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 005 is 
exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4)(G), (H), 
and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are 
justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because 
release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative 
interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record 
pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could, 
therefore, present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on 
the part of the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject 
of a record would learn of third-agency investigative interests and 
thereby avoid detection or apprehension, as well as to TSA investigative 
efforts.
    (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to the 
records contained in this system could reveal investigative techniques 
and procedures of the investigators, as well as the nature and scope of 
the investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to 
circumvent agency regulations or statutes. The information contained in 
the system might include properly classified information, the release of 
which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In 
addition, permitting access and amendment to such records could reveal 
sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), 
the disclosure of which could be detrimental to the security of 
transportation.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) 
because third agency records obtained or made available to TSA during 
the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that 
is not strictly

[[Page 270]]

relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of 
administering an effective and comprehensive investigation program, it 
is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain all such information that 
may aid in that process.
    (4) From subsection (e)(3) (Privacy Act Statement) because 
disclosing the authority, purpose, routine uses, and potential 
consequences of not providing information could reveal the targets of 
interests of the investigating office, as well as the nature and scope 
of an investigation, the disclosure of which could enable individuals to 
circumvent agency regulations or statutes.
    (5) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), 
and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access 
provisions of subsection (d).
    (e) Correspondence and Matters Tracking Records (DHS/TSA 006). The 
Correspondence and Matters Tracking Records (CMTR) (DHS/TSA 006) system 
allows TSA to manage, track, retrieve, and respond to incoming 
correspondence, inquiries, claims and other matters presented to TSA for 
disposition, and to monitor the assignment, disposition and status of 
such matters. This system covers information coming into TSA from 
individuals as well as information recorded by TSA employees in the 
performance of their duties. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of 
the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 006 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), 
(e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular 
subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because 
release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative 
interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record 
pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore 
present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of 
the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record 
would lean of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid 
detection or apprehension.
    (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the 
records contained in this system could reveal investigative interest on 
the part of TSA or other agency and the nature of that interest, the 
disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency 
regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might 
include properly classified information, the release of which would pose 
a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, 
permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal 
sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), 
the disclosure of which could be detrimental to transportation security.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and necessity of Information), 
because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during 
the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that 
is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In 
the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive 
investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain 
all such information that may aid in that process.
    (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), 
and (f) (Agency rules), because this system is exempt from the access 
provisions of subsection (d).
    (f) Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Records (DHS/TSA 007). 
The Freedom of Information and Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) Records System 
(DHS/TSA 007) system enables TSA to maintain records that will assist in 
processing access requests and administrative appeals under FOIA and 
access and amendments requests and appeals under the PA; participate in 
associated litigation; and assist TSA in carrying out any other 
responsibilities under FOIA/PA. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) 
of the Privacy Act, Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Records are 
exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), 
and (f). Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for 
the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because 
release of

[[Page 271]]

the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative interest on the 
part of the recipient agency that obtained the record pursuant to a 
routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore present a 
serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of the 
recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record would 
learn of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid 
detection or apprehension.
    (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the 
records contained in this system could reveal investigative interest on 
the part of TSA or other agency and the nature of that interest, the 
disclosure of which could enable individuals to circumvent agency 
regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might 
include properly classified information, the release of which would pose 
a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, 
permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal 
sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), 
the disclosure of which would be detrimental to transportation security.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and necessity of Information), 
because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during 
the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that 
is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In 
the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive 
investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain 
all such information that may aid in that process.
    (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), 
and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access 
provisions of subsection (d).
    (g) General Legal Records System (DHS/TSA 009). The General Legal 
Records (GLR) System (DHS/TSA 009) enables TSA to maintain records that 
will assist attorneys to perform their functions within the office of 
Chief Counsel, to include providing legal advice, responding to claims 
filed by employees and others, and assisting in litigation and in the 
settlement of claims. Pursuant to exemptions (k)(1) and (k)(2) of the 
Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 009 is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), 
(e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). Exemptions from the particular 
subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures), because 
release of the accounting of disclosures could reveal investigative 
interest on the part of the recipient agency that obtained the record 
pursuant to a routine use. Disclosure of the accounting could therefore 
present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts on the part of 
the recipient agency, as the individual who is the subject of a record 
would learn of third-agency investigative interests and thereby avoid 
detection or apprehension.
    (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records), because access to the 
records contained in this system could reveal investigative interest on 
the part of TSA or other agency and the nature of that interest, the 
disclosure of which would enable individuals to circumvent agency 
regulations or statutes. The information contained in the system might 
include properly classified information, the release of which would pose 
a threat to national defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, 
permitting access and amendment to such information could reveal 
sensitive security information protected pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114(s), 
the disclosure of which could be detrimental to transportation security.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), 
because third-agency records obtained or made available to TSA during 
the course of an investigation may occasionally contain information that 
is not strictly relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In 
the interests of administering an effective and comprehensive 
investigation program, it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to retain 
all such information that may aid in that process.
    (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), 
and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access 
provisions of subsections (d).

[[Page 272]]

    (h) Federal Flight Deck Officer Records System (DHS/TSA 013). The 
Federal Flight Deck Officer Record System (FFDORS) (DHS/TSA 013) enables 
TSA to maintain a system of records documenting the application, 
selection, training, and requalification of pilots deputized by TSA to 
perform the duties of a Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO). Pursuant to 
exemptions (k)(1), (k)(2), and (k)(6) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 013 is 
exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), and (e)(1). Exemptions from the 
particular subsections are justified for the following reasons:
    (1) From (c)(3) (Accounting of Certain Disclosures) and (d) (Access 
to Records), because access to the accounting of disclosures in this 
system could reveal the identity of a confidential source that provided 
information during the background check process. Without the ability to 
protect the identity of a confidential source, the agency's ability to 
gather pertinent information about candidates for the program may be 
limited. In addition, the system might contain information that is 
properly classified, the release of which would pose a threat to 
national security and/or foreign policy, or information the disclosure 
of which could be detrimental to the security of transportation pursuant 
to 49 U.S.C. 114(s). Finally, the agency must be able to protect against 
access to testing or examination material as release of this material 
could compromise the effectiveness of the testing and examination 
procedure itself. The examination material contained in this system is 
so similar in form and content to the examination material used in the 
selection process for TSA security screeners, or potential selection 
processes that TSA may utilize in the future, that release of the 
material would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the testing or 
examination process of those TSA employees.
    (2) From (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information), because 
information obtained or made available to TSA from other agencies and 
other sources during the evaluation of an individual's suitability for 
an FFDO position may occasionally include information that is not 
strictly relevant or necessary to the specific determination regarding 
that individual. In the interests of effective program administration, 
it is appropriate and necessary for TSA to collect all such information 
that may aid in the FFDO selection process.
    (i) Registered Traveler Operations Files (DHS/TSA 015). The purpose 
of this system is to pre-screen and positively identify volunteer 
travelers using advanced identification technologies and conduct a 
security threat assessment to ensure that the volunteer does not pose a 
security threat. This system may expedite the pre-boarding process for 
the traveler and improve the allocation of TSA's security resources on 
individuals who may pose a security threat. Pursuant to exemptions 
(k)(1) and (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 015 is exempt from 5 
U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f). 
Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because 
release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of 
heightened security concerns relating to an actual or potential 
criminal, civil, or regulatory violation to the existence of an 
investigative interest on the part of the Department of Homeland 
Security or another Federal law enforcement or other recipient agency. 
Disclosure of the accounting would therefore present a serious 
impediment to transportation security law enforcement efforts and 
efforts to preserve national security. Disclosure of the accounting 
would also permit the individual who is the subject of a record to 
impede the program suitability determination, which undermines the 
entire system.
    (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to some 
of the records contained in this system of records could permit the 
individual who is the subject of a record to impede the program 
suitability determination. Amendment of the records would interfere with 
ongoing security assessment investigations and program suitability 
determinations and impose an impossible administrative burden by 
requiring such investigations to be continuously reinvestigated. The 
information contained in the system may also include classified 
information, the

[[Page 273]]

release of which would pose a threat to national defense and/or foreign 
policy. In addition, permitting access and amendment to such information 
also could disclose sensitive security information protected pursuant to 
49 U.S.C. 114(s) and 49 CFR part 1520, the disclosure of which could be 
detrimental to transportation security.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) 
because in the course of screening applicants for program suitability, 
TSA must be able to review information from a variety of sources. What 
information is relevant and necessary may not always be apparent until 
after the evaluation is completed. In the interests of transportation 
security, it is appropriate to include a broad range of information that 
may aid in determining an applicant's suitability for the Registered 
Traveler program.
    (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I) (Agency Requirements), 
and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access 
and amendment provisions of subsection (d).
    (j) Transportation Security Intelligence Service (TSIS) Operations 
Files. Transportation Security Intelligence Service Operations Files 
(TSIS) (DHS/TSA 011) enables TSA to maintain a system of records related 
to intelligence gathering activities used to identify, review, analyze, 
investigate, and prevent violations or potential violations of 
transportation security laws. This system also contains records relating 
to determinations about individuals' qualifications, eligibility, or 
suitability for access to classified information. Pursuant to exemptions 
(j)(2), (k)(1), (k)(2), and (k)(5) of the Privacy Act, DHS/TSA 011 is 
exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), 
and (f). Exemptions from particular subsections are justified for the 
following reasons:
    (1) From subsection (c)(3) (Accounting for Disclosures) because 
release of the accounting of disclosures could alert the subject of 
intelligence gather operations and reveal investigative interest on the 
part of the Transportation Security Administration, as well as the 
recipient agency. Disclosure of the accounting would therefore present a 
serious impediment to transportation security law enforcement efforts 
and efforts to preserve national security. Disclosure of the accounting 
would also permit the individual who is the subject of a record to 
impede operations and avoid detection and apprehension, which undermined 
the entire system. Disclosure of the accounting may also reveal the 
existence of information that is classified or sensitive security 
information, the release of which would be detrimental to the security 
of transportation.
    (2) From subsection (d) (Access to Records) because access to the 
records contained in this system of records could inform the subject of 
intelligence gathering operations and reveal investigative interest on 
the part of the Transportation Security Administration. Access to the 
records would permit the individual who is the subject of a record to 
impede operations and possibly avoid detection or apprehension. 
Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing intelligence and 
law enforcement activities and impose an impossible administrative 
burden by requiring investigations to be continually reinvestigated. The 
information contained in the system may also include properly classified 
information, the release of which would pose a threat to national 
defense and/or foreign policy. In addition, permitting access and 
amendment to such information also could disclose sensitive security 
information, which could be detrimental to transportation security if 
released. This system may also include information necessary to make a 
determination as to an individual's qualifications, eligibility, or 
suitability for access to classified information, the release of which 
would reveal the identity of a source who received an express or implied 
assurance that their identity would not be revealed to the subject of 
the record.
    (3) From subsection (e)(1) (Relevancy and Necessity of Information) 
because in the course of gathering and analyzing information about 
potential threats to transportation security, the accuracy of 
information obtained or introduced occasionally may be unclear or the 
information may not be strictly

[[Page 274]]

relevant or necessary to a specific operation. In the interests of 
transportation security, it is appropriate to retain all information 
that may aid in identifying threats to transportation security and 
establishing other patterns of unlawful activity.
    (4) From subsections (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) (Agency Requirements), 
and (f) (Agency Rules), because this system is exempt from the access 
and amendment provisions of subsection (d).

time the air transportation is sold. Any changes by the passenger to the 
itinerary that alter the number of enplanements are subject to 
additional collection or refund of the security service fee by the 
direct air carrier or foreign air carrier as appropriate. Direct air 
carriers and foreign air carriers are solely liable to TSA for 
additional security service fees imposed because of involuntary 
enplanement changes to the itinerary.
    (c) Whether or not the security service fee is collected as required

the U.S. government.


<R05>
Sec. 1510.15  Accounting and auditing requirements.

    (a) Direct air carriers and foreign air carriers must establish and 
maintain an accounting system to account for the security service fees 
imposed, collected, refunded and remitted. The accounting records must 
identify the airports at which the passengers were enplaned.
    (b) Each direct air carrier and foreign air carrier that collects 
security services fees from more than 50,000 passengers annually must 
provide for an audit at least annually of its security service fee 
activities or accounts.
    (c) Audits pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section must be 
performed by an independent certified public accountant and may be of 
limited scope. The accountant must express an opinion on the fairness 
and reasonableness of the direct air carrier's and foreign air carrier's 
procedures for collecting, holding, and remitting the fees. The opinion 
must also address whether the quarterly reports required in Sec. 
1510.17 fairly represent the net transactions in the security service 
fee accounts.


<R05>
Sec. 1510.17  Reporting requirements.

    (a) Each direct air carrier and foreign air carrier collecting 
security service fees must provide TSA with quarterly reports that 
provide an accounting of fees imposed, collected, refunded and remitted.

                              Instructions

                            General guidance

    When filling out this form, the responding air carrier or foreign 
air carrier shall include all costs incurred in calendar year 2000 by 
that air carrier for the screening of passengers and property. Costs are 
those attributed to the screening of passengers and property in the 
United States for both flights within the United States and flights from 
the United States to foreign destinations. Reported costs must be 
consistent with the air carrier's financial accounting information 
reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Where actual costs of screening passengers and property cannot be 
directly identified through an air carrier's accounting system, the air 
carrier shall use an appropriate alternate cost assignment methodology. 
Documentation that explains and supports the assignment methodology 
used, the applicable pool and the allocation basis must be made 
available upon request. For costs related to capitalized property, 
please report the associated depreciation expense incurred during 
calendar year 2000. Capitalization policy must also be made available 
upon request.
    To the extent necessary, the reporting air carrier may aggregate 
those specific costs that have been incurred but cannot be stated

[[Page 280]]

in the detailed cost categories requested by this form. However, all of 
the costs identified by this form must be included in the total 
calculations. In addition, explanations regarding costs that have been 
aggregated need to be provided. Costs reported in Appendix A do not need 
to include costs that may have been incurred for a position higher than 
those of the air carrier's director of security (or equivalent). Costs 
incurred for higher positions, such as those of the air carrier's chief 
executive officer, do not need to be included.
    When including cost information on acquired and/or merged air 
carriers, the successor air carrier must specify the names of all of 
such entities whose calendar year 2000 passenger and property screening 
costs are included in that air carrier's submission as Appendix A.
    The costs listed below are to be in US dollars, rounded to the 
nearest dollar. Place a zero in the appropriate box to indicate cost 
categories in which the air carrier did not incur costs for passenger 
and property screening in calendar year 2000.

                            Supporting Notes

    Examples of cost types that appear in the supporting notes below are 
for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to set forth all 
relevant costs that must be reported by air carriers and foreign air 
carriers. In submitting information to TSA, air carriers and foreign air 
carriers must submit all of their relevant costs, regardless of whether 
those costs have been specifically illustrated in the notes.

                           Submission of Data

    This form will be available electronically from the Department of 
Transportation's website at www.dot.gov. Air carriers are asked to 
return the completed form by certified mail to: Chief Financial Officer,

Sec. 1520.9  Restrictions on the disclosure of SSI.

    (a) Duty to protect information. A covered person must--
    (1) Take reasonable steps to safeguard SSI in that person's 
possession or control from unauthorized disclosure. When a person is not 
in physical possession of SSI, the person must store it a secure 
container, such as a locked desk or file cabinet or in a locked room.
    (2) Disclose, or otherwise provide access to, SSI only to covered 
persons who have a need to know, unless otherwise authorized in writing 
by TSA, the Coast Guard, or the Secretary of DOT.
    (3) Refer requests by other persons for SSI to TSA or the applicable 
component or agency within DOT or DHS.
    (4) Mark SSI as specified in Sec. 1520.13.
    (5) Dispose of SSI as specified in Sec. 1520.19.
    (b) Unmarked SSI. If a covered person receives a record containing

must--
    (1) Mark the record as specified in Sec. 1520.13; and

[[Page 294]]

    (2) Inform the sender of the record that the record must be marked 
as specified in Sec. 1520.13.
    (c) Duty to report unauthorized disclosure. When a covered person 
becomes aware that SSI has been released to unauthorized persons, the 
covered person must promptly inform TSA or the applicable DOT or DHS 
component or agency.
    (d) Additional Requirements for Critical Infrastructure Information. 
In the case of information that is both SSI and has been designated as 
critical infrastructure information under section 214 of the Homeland 
Security Act, any covered person who is a Federal employee in possession 
of such information must comply with the disclosure restrictions and 
other requirements applicable to such information under section 214 and 
any implementing regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 1520.11  Persons with a need to know.

    (a) In general. A person has a need to know SSI in each of the 
following circumstances:
    (1) When the person requires access to specific SSI to carry out 
transportation security activities approved, accepted, funded, 
recommended, or directed by DHS or DOT.
    (2) When the person is in training to carry out transportation 
security activities approved, accepted, funded, recommended, or directed

[69 FR 28082, May 18, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 1382, Jan. 7, 2005]


<R05>
Sec. 1520.13  Marking SSI.

    (a) Marking of paper records. In the case of paper records 
containing SSI, a covered person must mark the record by placing the 
protective marking conspicuously on the top, and the distribution 
limitation statement on the bottom, of--
    (1) The outside of any front and back cover, including a binder 
cover or folder, if the document has a front and back cover;
    (2) Any title page; and
    (3) Each page of the document.
    (b) Protective marking. The protective marking is: SENSITIVE 
SECURITY INFORMATION.
    (c) Distribution limitation statement. The distribution limitation 
statement is:

WARNING: This record contains Sensitive Security Information that is 
controlled under 49 CFR parts 15 and 1520. No part of this record may be 
disclosed to persons without a ``need to know'', as defined in 49 CFR 
parts 15 and 1520, except with the written permission of the 
Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration or the 
Secretary of Transportation. Unauthorized release may result in civil 
penalty or other action. For U.S. government agencies, public disclosure 
is governed by 5 U.S.C. 552 and 49 CFR parts 15 and 1520.

    (d) Other types of records. In the case of non-paper records that 
contain SSI, including motion picture films, videotape recordings, audio 
recording, and

[[Page 295]]

electronic and magnetic records, a covered person must clearly and 
conspicuously mark the records with the protective marking and the 
distribution limitation statement such that the viewer or listener is 
reasonably likely to see or hear them when obtaining access to the 
contents of the record.


<R05>
Sec. 1520.15  SSI disclosed by TSA or the Coast Guard.

    (a) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this section, and 
notwithstanding the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the 
Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), and other laws, records containing SSI are 
not available for public inspection or copying, nor does TSA or the 
Coast Guard release such records to persons without a need to know.
    (b) Disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy 
Act. If a record contains both SSI and information that is not SSI, TSA 
or the Coast Guard, on a proper Freedom of Information Act or Privacy 
Act request, may disclose the record with the SSI redacted, provided the 
record is not otherwise exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of 
Information Act or Privacy Act.
    (c) Disclosures to committees of Congress and the General Accounting 
Office. Nothing in this part precludes TSA or the Coast Guard from 
disclosing SSI to a committee of Congress authorized to have the 
information or to the Comptroller General, or to any authorized 
representative of the Comptroller General.
    (d) Disclosure in enforcement proceedings--(1) In general. TSA or 
the Coast Guard may provide SSI to a person in the context of an 
administrative enforcement proceeding when, in the sole discretion of 
TSA or the Coast Guard, as appropriate, access to the SSI is necessary 
for the person to prepare a response to allegations contained in a legal 
enforcement action document issued by TSA or the Coast Guard.
    (2) Security background check. Prior to providing SSI to a person 
under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, TSA or the Coast Guard may 
require the individual or, in the case of an entity, the individuals 
representing the entity, and their counsel, to undergo and satisfy, in 
the judgment of TSA or the Coast Guard, a security background check.
    (e) Other conditional disclosure. TSA may authorize a conditional 
disclosure of specific records or information that constitute SSI upon 
the written determination by TSA that disclosure of such records or 
information, subject to such limitations and restrictions as TSA may 
prescribe, would not be detrimental to transportation security.
    (f) Obligation to protect information. When an individual receives 
SSI pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) of this section that individual 
becomes a covered person under Sec. 1520.7 and is subject to the 
obligations of a covered person under this part.
    (g) No release under FOIA. When TSA discloses SSI pursuant to 
paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, TSA makes the disclosure for 
the sole purpose described in that paragraph. Such disclosure is not a 
public release of information under the Freedom of Information Act.
    (h) Disclosure of Critical Infrastructure Information. Disclosure of 
information that is both SSI and has been designated as critical 
infrastructure information under section 214 of the Homeland Security 
Act is governed solely by the requirements of section 214 and any 
implementing regulations.


<R05>
Sec. 1520.17  Consequences of unauthorized disclosure of SSI.

    Violation of this part is grounds for a civil penalty and other 
enforcement or corrective action by DHS, and appropriate personnel 
actions for Federal employees. Corrective action may include issuance of 
an order requiring retrieval of SSI to remedy unauthorized disclosure or 
an order to cease future unauthorized disclosure.


<R05>
Sec. 1520.19  Destruction of SSI.

    (a) DHS. Subject to the requirements of the Federal Records Act (5 
U.S.C. 105), including the duty to preserve records containing 
documentation of a Federal agency's policies, decisions, and essential 
transactions, DHS destroys SSI when no longer needed to carry out the 
agency's function.

[[Page 296]]

    (b) Other covered persons--(1) In general. A covered person must 
destroy SSI completely to preclude recognition or reconstruction of the 
information when the covered person no longer needs the SSI to carry out 
transportation security measures.
    (2) Exception. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not require a 
State or local government agency to destroy information that the agency 
is required to preserve under State or local law.

she may correct the record, as follows:
    (i) The individual may contact the jurisdiction or entity 
responsible for the information and attempt to correct or complete 
information contained in his or her record.
    (ii) The individual must then provide TSA with the revised record, 
or a certified true copy of the information from the appropriate entity, 
before TSA may determine that the individual meets the standards for the 
Security Threat Assessment.
    (4) Reply. (i) The individual may serve upon TSA a written reply to 
the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment within 30 days of service 
of the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment, or 30 days after the 
date of service of TSA's response to the individual's request for 
materials under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the individual 
served such a request.

individual's reply, TSA serves a Final Determination of Threat 
Assessment or a Withdrawal of the Initial Determination of Threat 
Assessment.
    (d) Final Determination of Threat Assessment. (1) If TSA determines 
that the individual poses a security threat, TSA serves a Final 
Determination of Threat Assessment upon the individual and the operator. 
The Final Determination of Threat Assessment includes--
    (2) A statement that TSA has reviewed the Initial Determination of 
Threat Assessment, the individual's reply, if any, and any other 
materials or information available to him or her and has determined that 
the individual poses a security threat.

concludes that the individual does not pose a security threat, TSA 
serves a Withdrawal of the Initial Determination of Threat Assessment on 
the individual and the operator.

procedures under this section, TSA does not disclose to the individual 
or counsel classified information, as defined in sec. 1.1(d) of 
Executive Order 12968, and reserves the right not to disclose any other 
information or material not warranting disclosure or protected from 
disclosure under law.
    (g) Extension of time. TSA may grant an individual an extension of 
time of the limits set forth in this section for good cause shown. An 
individual's request for an extension of time must be in writing and be 
received by TSA at least 2 days before the due date to be extended. TSA 
may grant itself an extension of time for good cause.
    (h) Judicial review. The Final Determination of Threat Assessment 
constitutes a final TSA order subject to judicial review in accordance 
with 49 U.S.C. 46110.

Sec. 1542.105  Approval and amendments.

    (a) Initial approval of security program. Unless otherwise 
authorized by the designated official, each airport operator required to 
have a security program under this part must submit its initial proposed 
security program to the designated official for approval at least 90 
days before the date any aircraft operator or foreign air carrier 
required to have a security program under part 1544 or part 1546 of this 
chapter is expected to begin operations. Such requests will be processed 
as follows:
    (1) The designated official, within 30 days after receiving the 
proposed security program, will either approve the program or give the 
airport operator written notice to modify the program to comply with the 
applicable requirements of this part.
    (2) The airport operator may either submit a modified security 
program to the designated official for approval, or petition the 
Administrator to reconsider the notice to modify within 30 days of 
receiving a notice to modify. A petition for reconsideration must be 
filed with the designated official.
    (3) The designated official, upon receipt of a petition for 
reconsideration, either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the 
petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator 
for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 
30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to 
withdraw or amend the notice to modify, or by affirming the notice to 
modify.
    (b) Amendment requested by an airport operator. Except as provided 
in Sec. 1542.103(c), an airport operator may submit a request to the 
designated official to amend its security program, as follows:
    (1) The request for an amendment must be filed with the designated 
official at least 45 days before the date it proposes for the amendment 
to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the 
designated official.
    (2) Within 30 days after receiving a proposed amendment, the 
designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request 
to amend.
    (3) An amendment to a security program may be approved if the 
designated official determines that safety

[[Page 311]]

and the public interest will allow it, and the proposed amendment 
provides the level of security required under this part.
    (4) Within 30 days after receiving a denial, the airport operator 
may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial.
    (5) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated 
official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition 
within 30 days of receipt, together with any pertinent information, to 
the Administrator for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the 
petition within 30 days of receipt by either directing the designated 
official to approve the amendment or affirming the denial.
    (c) Amendment by TSA. If safety and the public interest require an 
amendment, the designated official may amend a security program as 
follows:
    (1) The designated official sends to the airport operator a notice, 
in writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 
30 days within which the airport operator may submit written 
information, views, and arguments on the amendment.
    (2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official 
notifies the airport operator of any amendment adopted or rescinds the 
notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 
30 days after the airport operator receives the notice of amendment, 
unless the airport operator petitions the Administrator to reconsider no 
later than 15 days before the effective date of the amendment. The 
airport operator must send the petition for reconsideration to the 
designated official. A timely petition for reconsideration stays the 
effective date of the amendment.
    (3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated 
official either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the 
petition, together with any pertinent information to the Administrator 
for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 
30 days of receipt by either directing the designated official to 
withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.
    (d) Emergency amendments. Notwithstanding paragraph (c) of this 
section, if the designated official finds that there is an emergency 
requiring immediate action with respect to safety and security in air 
transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this section 
contrary to the public interest, the designated official may issue an 
amendment, effective without stay on the date the airport operator 
receives the notice of it. In such a case, the designated official must 
incorporate in the notice a brief statement of the reasons and findings 
for the amendment to be adopted. The airport operator may file a 
petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section; 
however, this does not stay the effective date of the emergency 
amendment.

airport user, or aircraft operator, or contractor to such an entity, 
provided the grant for his or her unescorted access authority was based 
upon a fingerprint-based CHRC through TSA or FAA.
    (ii) An individual who has been continuously employed by an aircraft 
operator or aircraft operator contractor, in a position with authority 
to perform screening functions, provided the grant for his or her 
authority to perform screening functions was based upon a fingerprint-
based CHRC through TSA or FAA.
    (n) Certifications by aircraft operators. An airport operator is in 
compliance with its obligation under paragraph (b) or (c) of this 
section when the airport operator accepts, for each individual seeking 
unescorted access authority, certification from an aircraft operator 
subject to part 1544 of this chapter indicating it has complied with 
Sec. 1544.229 of this chapter for the aircraft operator's employees and

airport operator in accordance with this section and 14 CFR 107.31 in 
effect prior to November 14, 2001 (see 14 CFR Parts 60 through 139 
revised as of January 1, 2001), and those investigations conducted by 
the airport users who provided certification to the airport operator. 
The audit program must be set forth in the airport security program.
    (p) Airport user responsibility. (1) The airport user must report to 
the airport operator information, as it becomes available, that 
indicates an individual with unescorted access authority may have a 
disqualifying criminal offense.
    (2) The airport user must maintain and control, in compliance with 
paragraph (k) of this section, the employment history investigation 
files for investigations conducted before December 6, 2001, unless the 
airport operator decides to maintain and control the employment history 
investigation file.
    (3) The airport user must provide the airport operator with either 
the name or title of the individual acting as custodian of the files 
described in this paragraph (p), the address of the location where the 
files are maintained, and the phone number of that location. The airport

designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the request 
to amend.
    (3) An amendment to an aircraft operator security program may be 
approved if the designated official determines that safety and the 
public interest will allow it, and the proposed amendment provides the 
level of security required under this part.
    (4) Within 30 days after receiving a denial, the aircraft operator 
may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial. A petition for 
reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.

withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.
    (d) Emergency amendments. If the designated official finds that 
there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety 
in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this 
section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may 
issue an amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures in 
paragraph (c) of this section, effective without stay on the date the 
aircraft operator receives notice of it. In such a case, the designated 
official will incorporate in the notice a brief statement of the reasons 
and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The aircraft operator may 
file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section;

Sec. 1544.209  Use of metal detection devices.

    (a) No aircraft operator may use a metal detection device within the 
United States or under the aircraft operator's operational control 
outside the United States to inspect persons, unless specifically 
authorized under a security program under this part. No aircraft 
operator may use such a device contrary to its security program.
    (b) Metal detection devices must meet the calibration standards 
established by TSA.


<R05>
Sec. 1544.211  Use of X-ray systems.

    (a) TSA authorization required. No aircraft operator may use any X-
ray system within the United States or under the aircraft operator's 
operational control outside the United States to inspect accessible 
property or checked baggage, unless specifically authorized under its 
security program. No aircraft operator may use such a system in a manner 
contrary to its security program. TSA authorizes aircraft operators to 
use X-ray systems for inspecting accessible property or checked baggage 
under a security program if the aircraft operator shows that--
    (1) The system meets the standards for cabinet X-ray systems 
primarily for the inspection of baggage issued by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and published in 21 CFR 1020.40;
    (2) A program for initial and recurrent training of operators of the 
system is established, which includes training in radiation safety, the 
efficient use of X-ray systems, and the identification of weapons, 
explosives, and incendiaries; and
    (3) The system meets the imaging requirements set forth in its 
security program using the step wedge specified in American Society for 
Testing Materials (ASTM) Standard F792-88 (Reapproved 1993). This 
standard is incorporated by reference in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (b) Annual radiation survey. No aircraft operator may use any X-ray 
system unless, within the preceding 12 calendar months, a radiation 
survey is conducted that shows that the system meets the applicable 
performance standards in 21 CFR 1020.40.
    (c) Radiation survey after installation or moving. No aircraft 
operator may use any X-ray system after the system has been installed at 
a screening point or after the system has been moved unless a radiation 
survey is conducted which shows that the system meets the applicable 
performance standards in 21 CFR 1020.40. A radiation survey is not 
required for an X-ray system that is designed and constructed as a 
mobile unit and the aircraft operator shows that it can be moved without 
altering its performance.
    (d) Defect notice or modification order. No aircraft operator may 
use any X-ray system that is not in full compliance with any defect 
notice or modification order issued for that system by the FDA, unless 
the FDA has advised

[[Page 333]]

TSA that the defect or failure to comply does not create a significant 
risk of injury, including genetic injury, to any person.
    (e) Signs and inspection of photographic equipment and film. (1) At 
locations at which an aircraft operator uses an X-ray system to inspect 
accessible property the aircraft operator must ensure that a sign is 
posted in a conspicuous place at the screening checkpoint. At locations 
outside the United States at which a foreign government uses an X-ray 
system to inspect accessible property the aircraft operator must ensure 
that a sign is posted in a conspicuous place at the screening 
checkpoint.
    (2) At locations at which an aircraft operator or TSA uses an X-ray 
system to inspect checked baggage the aircraft operator must ensure that 
a sign is posted in a conspicuous place where the aircraft operator 
accepts checked baggage.
    (3) The signs required under this paragraph (e) must notify 
individuals that such items are being inspected by an X-ray and advise 
them to remove all X-ray, scientific, and high-speed film from 
accessible property and checked baggage before inspection. This sign 
must also advise individuals that they may request that an inspection be 
made of their photographic equipment and film packages without exposure 
to an X-ray system. If the X-ray system exposes any accessible property 
or checked baggage to more than one milliroentgen during the inspection, 
the sign must advise individuals to remove film of all kinds from their 
articles before inspection.
    (4) If requested by individuals, their photographic equipment and 
film packages must be inspected without exposure to an X-ray system.
    (f) Radiation survey verification after installation or moving. Each 
aircraft operator must maintain at least one copy of the results of the 
most recent radiation survey conducted under paragraph (b) or (c) of 
this section and must make it available for inspection upon request by 
TSA at each of the following locations--
    (1) The aircraft operator's principal business office; and
    (2) The place where the X-ray system is in operation.
    (g) Incorporation by reference. The American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) Standard F792-88 (Reapproved 1993), ``Standard Practice

the local jurisdiction responsible for the information and the FBI to 
complete or correct the information contained in his or her record, 
subject to the following conditions--
    (1) For an individual seeking unescorted access authority or

intent to correct any information he or she believes to be inaccurate. 
The aircraft operator must obtain a copy, or accept a copy from the 
individual, of the revised FBI record or a certified true copy of the 
information from the appropriate court, prior to authority to perform a 
covered function.
    (ii) If no notification, as described in paragraph (h)(1) of this 
section, is received within 30 days, the aircraft operator may make a 
final determination to deny authority to perform a covered function.
    (2) For an individual with unescorted access authority or authority 
to perform screening functions before December 6, 2001; or an individual 
with authority to perform checked baggage or cargo functions before 
February 17, 2002; the following applies: Within 30 days after being 
advised of suspension because the criminal record received from the FBI 
discloses a disqualifying criminal offense, the individual must notify 
the aircraft operator in writing of his or her intent to correct any 
information he or she believes to be inaccurate. The aircraft operator 
must obtain a copy, or accept a copy from the individual, of the revised 
FBI record, or a certified true copy of the information from the 
appropriate court, prior to reinstating authority to perform a covered 
function.
    (j) Limits on dissemination of results. Criminal record information

<R05>
Sec. 1546.105  Acceptance of and amendments to the security program.

    (a) Initial acceptance of security program. Unless otherwise 
authorized by TSA, each foreign air carrier required to have a security 
program by this part must submit its proposed program to TSA at least 90 
days before the intended date of passenger operations. TSA will notify 
the foreign air carrier of the security program's acceptability, or the 
need to modify the proposed security program for it to be acceptable 
under this part, within 30 days after receiving the proposed security 
program. The foreign air carrier may petition TSA to reconsider the 
notice to modify the security program within 30 days after receiving a 
notice to modify.
    (b) Amendment requested by a foreign air carrier. A foreign air 
carrier may submit a request to TSA to amend its accepted security 
program as follows:
    (1) The proposed amendment must be filed with the designated 
official at least 45 calendar days before the date it proposes for the 
amendment to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the 
designated official.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a proposed amendment, 
the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the 
request to amend.
    (3) An amendment to a foreign air carrier security program may be 
approved if the designated official determines that safety and the 
public interest will allow it, and the proposed amendment provides the 
level of security required under this part.
    (4) Within 45 calendar days after receiving a denial, the foreign 
air carrier may petition the Administrator to reconsider the denial. A 
petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated official.
    (5) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated 
official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition, 
together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for 
reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 
calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to 
approve the amendment, or affirming the denial.
    (6) Any foreign air carrier may submit a group proposal for an 
amendment that is on behalf of it and other aircraft operators that co-
sign the proposal.
    (c) Amendment by TSA. If the safety and the public interest require 
an amendment, the designated official may amend an accepted security 
program as follows:
    (1) The designated official notifies the foreign air carrier, in 
writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 45 
calendar days within which the foreign air carrier may submit written 
information, views, and arguments on the amendment.
    (2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official 
notifies the foreign air carrier of any amendment adopted or rescinds 
the notice. If

[[Page 356]]

the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less than 30 calendar 
days after the foreign air carrier receives the notice of amendment, 
unless the foreign air carrier petitions the Administrator to reconsider 
no later than 15 calendar days before the effective date of the 
amendment. The foreign air carrier must send the petition for 
reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for 
reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.
    (3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated 
official either amends or withdraws the notice or transmits the 
petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator 
for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 
30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official 
to withdraw or amend the amendment, or by affirming the amendment.
    (d) Emergency amendments. If the designated official finds that 
there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety 
in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this 
section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may 
issue an amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures in 
paragraph (c) of this section, effective without stay on the date the 
foreign air carrier receives notice of it. In such a case, the 
designated official will incorporate in the notice a brief statement of 
the reasons and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The foreign 
air carrier may file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) 
of this section; however, this does not stay the effectiveness of the 
emergency amendment.

Sec. 1546.209  Use of X-ray systems.

    (a) TSA authorization required. No foreign air carrier may use any 
X-ray system within the United States to screen accessible property or 
checked baggage, unless specifically authorized under its security 
program. No foreign air carrier may use such a system in a manner 
contrary to its security program. TSA authorizes foreign air carriers to 
use X-ray systems for inspecting accessible property or checked baggage 
under a security program if the foreign air carrier shows that--
    (1) The system meets the standards for cabinet X-ray systems 
primarily for the inspection of baggage issued by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and published in 21 CFR 1020.40;
    (2) A program for initial and recurrent training of operators of the 
system is established, which includes training in radiation safety, the 
efficient use of X-ray systems, and the identification of weapons, 
explosives, and incendiaries; and
    (3) The system meets the imaging requirements set forth in its 
security program using the step wedge specified in American Society for 
Testing Materials (ASTM) Standard F792-88 (Reapproved 1993). This 
standard is incorporated by reference in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (b) Annual radiation survey. No foreign air carrier may use any X-
ray system unless, within the preceding 12 calendar months, a radiation 
survey is conducted that shows that the system meets the applicable 
performance standards in 21 CFR 1020.40.
    (c) Radiation survey after installation or moving. No foreign air 
carrier may use any X-ray system after the system has been installed at 
a screening point or after the system has been moved unless a radiation 
survey is conducted which shows that the system meets the applicable 
performance standards in 21 CFR 1020.40. A radiation survey is not 
required for an X-ray system that is designed and constructed as a 
mobile unit and the foreign air carrier shows that it can be moved 
without altering its performance.
    (d) Defect notice or modification order. No foreign air carrier may 
use any X-ray system that is not in full compliance with any defect 
notice or modification order issued for that system by the FDA, unless 
the FDA has advised TSA that the defect or failure to comply does not 
create a significant risk of injury, including genetic injury, to any 
person.
    (e) Signs and inspection of photographic equipment and film. (1) At 
locations at which a foreign air carrier uses an X-ray system to inspect 
accessible property the foreign air carrier must ensure that a sign is 
posted in a conspicuous place at the screening checkpoint.
    (2) At locations at which a foreign air carrier or TSA uses an X-ray 
system to inspect checked baggage the foreign air carrier must ensure 
that a sign is posted in a conspicuous place where the foreign air 
carrier accepts checked baggage.
    (3) The signs required under this paragraph must notify individuals 
that such items are being inspected by an X-ray and advise them to 
remove all X-ray, scientific, and high-speed film from accessible 
property and checked baggage before inspection. This sign must also 
advise individuals that they may request that an inspection be made of 
their photographic equipment and film packages without exposure to an X-
ray system. If the X-ray system exposes any accessible property or 
checked baggage to more than one milliroentgen during the inspection, 
the sign must advise individuals to remove film of all kinds from their 
articles before inspection.
    (4) If requested by individuals, their photographic equipment and 
film packages must be inspected without exposure to an X-ray system.

[[Page 359]]

    (f) Radiation survey verification after installation or moving. Each 
foreign air carrier must maintain at least one copy of the results of 
the most recent radiation survey conducted under paragraph (b) or (c) of 
this section and must make it available for inspection upon request by 
TSA at each of the following locations--
    (1) The foreign air carrier's principal business office; and
    (2) The place where the X-ray system is in operation.
    (g) Incorporation by reference. The American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) Standard F792-88 (Reapproved 1993), ``Standard Practice

authorize an employee of one or more of the foreign air carriers or 
foreign air carriers to monitor the test for a trainee who will screen 
at that location.
    (3) If TSA or a representative of TSA is not available to administer 
and monitor a screener readiness test, the foreign air carrier must 
provide a direct employee to administer and monitor the screener 
readiness test.
    (4) An foreign air carrier employee who administers and monitors a 
screener readiness test must not be an instructor, screener, screener-
in-charge, checkpoint security supervisor, or other screening 
supervisor. The employee must be familiar with the procedures for 
administering and monitoring the test and must be capable of observing

the program or give the indirect air carrier written notice to modify 
the program to comply with the applicable requirements of this part.
    (2) The indirect air carrier may either submit a modified security 
program to the designated official for approval, or petition the 
Administrator to reconsider the notice to modify within 30 calendar days 
of receiving a notice to modify. A petition for reconsideration must be 
filed with the designated official.
    (3) The designated official, upon receipt of a petition for 
reconsideration, either amends or withdraws the notice, or transmits the 
petition, together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator 
for reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 
30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official 
to withdraw or amend the notice to modify, or by affirming the notice to 
modify.
    (b) Amendment requested by an indirect air carrier. An indirect air 
carrier may submit a request to the designated official to amend its 
security program as follows:
    (1) The request for amendment must be filed with the designated 
official at least 45 calendar days before the date it proposes for the 
amendment to become effective, unless a shorter period is allowed by the 
designated official.
    (2) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a proposed amendment, 
the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the 
request to amend.
    (3) An amendment to an indirect air carrier security program may be 
approved if the designated official determines that safety and the 
public interest will allow it, and if the proposed amendment provides 
the level of security required under this part.
    (4) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a denial, the indirect 
air carrier may petition the Administrator to

[[Page 366]]

reconsider the denial. A petition for reconsideration must be filed with 
the designated official.
    (5) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated 
official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition, 
together with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for 
reconsideration. The Administrator will dispose of the petition within 
30 calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official 
to approve the amendment or by affirming the denial.
    (c) Amendment by TSA. If safety and the public interest require an 
amendment, the designated official may amend a security program as 
follows:
    (1) The designated official notifies the indirect air carrier, in 
writing, of the proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30 
calendar days within which the indirect air carrier may submit written 
information, views, and arguments on the amendment.

notifies the indirect air carrier of any amendment adopted or rescinds 
the notice. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes effective not less 
than 30 calendar days after the indirect air carrier receives the notice 
of amendment, unless the indirect air carrier petitions the 
Administrator to reconsider no later than 15 calendar days before the 
effective date of the amendment. The indirect air carrier must send the 
petition for reconsideration to the designated official. A timely 
petition for reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.
    (3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated 
official either amends or withdraws the notice or transmits the petition 
together, with any pertinent information, to the Administrator for 
reconsideration. The Administrator disposes of the petition within 30 
calendar days of receipt by either directing the designated official to 
withdraw or amend the notice or by affirming the amendment.
    (d) Emergency amendments. If the designated official finds that 
there is an emergency requiring immediate action with respect to safety 
in air transportation or in air commerce that makes procedures in this 
section contrary to the public interest, the designated official may 
issue an amendment, without the prior notice and comment procedures in 
paragraph (c) of this section, effective without stay on the date that 
the indirect air carrier receives notice of it. In such a case, the 
designated official will incorporate in the notice a brief statement of 
the reasons and findings for the amendment to be adopted. The indirect 
air carrier may file a petition for reconsideration under paragraph (c) 
of this section; however, this will not stay the effective date of the 
emergency amendment.

access to cargo.
    (2) Approval. TSA will approve the security program by providing the 
indirect air carrier with the Indirect Air Carrier Standard Security 
Program and any Security Directive upon determining that--
    (i) The indirect air carrier has met the requirements of this part, 
its security program, and any applicable Security Directive;
    (ii) The approval of its security program is not contrary to the 
interests of security and the public interest; and
    (iii) The indirect air carrier has not held a security program that 
was withdrawn within the previous year, unless otherwise authorized by 
TSA.
    (3) Commencement of operations. The indirect air carrier may operate 
under a security program when it meets all requirements, including but 
not limited to successful completion of training and Security Threat 
Assessments by relevant personnel.
    (4) Duration of security program. The security program will remain 
effective until the end of the calendar month one year after the month 
it was approved.
    (5) Requirement to report changes in information. Each indirect air 
carrier with an approved security program under this part must notify 
TSA, in a form and manner approved by TSA, of any changes to the 
information submitted during its initial application.
    (i) This notification must be submitted to the designated official 
not later than 30 days after the date the change occurred.
    (ii) Changes included in the requirement of this paragraph include, 
but are not limited to, changes in the indirect air carrier's contact

business entity.
    (b) Renewal Application. Upon timely submittal of an application for 
renewal, and unless and until TSA denies the application, the indirect 
air carrier's approved security program remains in effect.
    (1) Unless otherwise authorized by TSA, each indirect air carrier 
that has a security program under this part must timely submit to TSA, 
at least 30 calendar days prior to the first day of the anniversary 
month of initial approval of its security program, an application for 
renewal of its security program in a form and a manner approved by TSA.
    (2) The application for renewal must be in writing and include a 
signed statement that the indirect air carrier has reviewed and ensures 
the continuing accuracy of the contents of its initial application for a 
security program, subsequent renewal applications, or other submissions 
to TSA confirming a change of information and noting the date such 
applications and submissions were sent to TSA, including the following 
certification:

    [Name of indirect air carrier] (hereinafter ``the IAC'') has adopted 
and is currently carrying out a security program in accordance with the 
Transportation Security Regulations as originally approved on [Insert 
date of TSA initial approval]. In accordance with TSA regulations, the 
IAC has notified TSA of any new or changed information required for the 
IAC's initial security program. If new or changed information is being 
submitted to TSA as part of this application for reapproval, that 
information is stated in this filing.
    The IAC understands that intentional falsification of certification 
to an air carrier or to TSA may be subject to both civil and criminal 
penalties under 49 CFR 1540 and 1548 and 18 U.S.C. 1001. Failure to 
notify TSA of any new or changed information required for initial 
approval of the IAC's security program in a timely fashion and in a form 
acceptable to TSA may result in withdrawal by TSA of approval of the 
IAC's security program.

    (3) TSA will renew approval of the security program if TSA 
determines that--
    (i) The indirect air carrier has met the requirements of this 
chapter, its security program, and any Security Directive; and
    (ii) The renewal of its security program is not contrary to the 
interests of security and the public interest.
    (4) If TSA determines that the indirect air carrier meets the 
requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, it will renew the 
indirect air carrier's security program. The security program will 
remain effective until the end of the calendar month one year after the 
month it was renewed.
    (c) Amendment requested by an indirect air carrier or applicant. An 
indirect air carrier or applicant may file a request for an amendment to 
its security program with the TSA designated official at least 45 
calendar days before the date it proposes for the amendment to become 
effective, unless the designated official allows a shorter period. Any 
indirect air carrier may submit a group proposal for an amendment that 
is on behalf of it and other indirect air carriers that co-sign the 
proposal.
    (1) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a proposed amendment, 
the designated official, in writing, either approves or denies the 
request to amend.
    (2) An amendment to an indirect air carrier security program may be 
approved, if the designated official determines that safety and the 
public interest will allow it, and if the proposed amendment provides 
the level of security required under this part.

[[Page 368]]

    (3) Within 30 calendar days after receiving a denial of the proposed 
amendment, the indirect air carrier may petition TSA to reconsider the 
denial. A petition for reconsideration must be filed with the designated 
official.
    (4) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated 
official either approves the request to amend or transmits the petition, 
together with any pertinent information, to the TSA for reconsideration. 
TSA will dispose of the petition within 30 calendar days of receipt by 
either directing the designated official to approve the amendment or by 
affirming the denial.
    (d) Amendment by TSA. TSA may amend a security program in the 
interest of safety and the public interest, as follows:
    (1) TSA notifies the indirect air carrier, in writing, of the 
proposed amendment, fixing a period of not less than 30 calendar days 
within which the indirect air carrier may submit written information, 
views, and arguments on the amendment.
    (2) After considering all relevant material, the designated official 
notifies the indirect air carrier of any amendment adopted or rescinds 
the notice of amendment. If the amendment is adopted, it becomes 
effective not less than 30 calendar days after the indirect air carrier 
receives the notice of amendment, unless the indirect air carrier 
disagrees with the proposed amendment and petitions the TSA to 
reconsider, no later than 15 calendar days before the effective date of 
the amendment. The indirect air carrier must send the petition for 
reconsideration to the designated official. A timely petition for 
reconsideration stays the effective date of the amendment.
    (3) Upon receipt of a petition for reconsideration, the designated 
official either amends or withdraws the notice of amendment, or 
transmits the petition, together with any pertinent information, to TSA 
for reconsideration. TSA disposes of the petition within 30 calendar 
days of receipt, either by directing the designated official to withdraw 
or amend the notice of amendment, or by affirming the notice of 
amendment.
    (e)  Emergency Amendments. (1) If TSA finds that there is an 
emergency requiring immediate action, with respect to aviation security 
that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, 
the designated official may issue an emergency amendment, without the 
prior notice and comment procedures described in paragraph (d) of this 
section.
    (2) The emergency amendment is effective without stay on the date 
the indirect air carrier receives notification. TSA will incorporate in 
the notification a brief statement of the reasons and findings for the 
emergency amendment to be adopted.
    (3) The indirect air carrier may file a petition for reconsideration 
with the TSA no later than 15 calendar days after TSA issued the 
emergency amendment. The indirect air carrier must send the petition for 
reconsideration to the designated official; however, the filing does not 
stay the effective date of the emergency amendment.
    (f) Withdrawal of approval of a security program. TSA may withdraw 
the approval of the indirect air carrier's security program, if TSA 
determines continued operation is contrary to safety and the public 
interest, as follows:
    (1) Notice of proposed withdrawal of approval. The designated 
official will serve a notice of proposed withdrawal of approval, which 
notifies the indirect air carrier, in writing, of the facts, charges, 
and applicable law, regulation, or order that form the basis for the 
determination.
    (2) Indirect air carrier reply. The indirect air carrier may respond 
to the notice of proposed withdrawal of approval no later than 15 
calendar days after receipt of the withdrawal by providing the 
designated official, in writing, with any material facts, arguments, 
applicable law, and regulation.
    (3) TSA review. The designated official will consider all 
information available, including any relevant material or information 
submitted by the indirect air carrier, before either issuing a 
withdrawal of approval of the indirect air carrier's security program or 
rescinding the notice of proposed withdrawal of approval. If TSA issues 
a withdrawal of approval, it becomes effective upon receipt by the 
indirect air carrier, or 15 calendar days after service, whichever 
occurs first.
    (4) Petition for reconsideration. The indirect air carrier may 
petition the TSA to reconsider the withdrawal of approval by serving a 
petition for consideration no later than 15 calendar days after the 
indirect air carrier receives the withdrawal of approval. The indirect 
air carrier must serve the petition for reconsideration on the 
designated official. Submission of a petition for reconsideration will 
not automatically stay the withdrawal of approval. The indirect air 
carrier may request the designated official to stay the withdrawal of 
approval pending consideration of the petition.
    (5) Assistant Secretary's review. The designated official transmits 
the petition together with all pertinent information to the Assistant 
Secretary for reconsideration. The Assistant Secretary will dispose of 
the petition within 15 calendar days of receipt by either directing the 
designated official to rescind the withdrawal of approval or by 
affirming the withdrawal of approval. The decision of the Assistant 
Secretary is a final order subject to judicial review in accordance with 
49 U.S.C. 46110.
    (6) Emergency withdrawal. If TSA finds that there is an emergency 
requiring immediate action, with respect to aviation security

[[Page 369]]

that makes procedures in this section contrary to the public interest, 
the designated official may issue an emergency withdrawal of the 
indirect air carrier's security program, without first issuing a notice 
of proposed withdrawal, effective without stay on the date that the 
indirect air carrier receives notice of the emergency withdrawal. In 
such a case, the designated official will send the indirect air carrier 
a brief statement of the facts, charges, and applicable law, regulation, 
or order that forms the basis for the emergency withdrawal. The indirect 
air carrier may submit a petition for reconsideration under the 
procedures in paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(5) of this section; however, 
this petition will not stay the effective date of the emergency 
withdrawal.
    (g) Service of documents for withdrawal of approval of security 
program proceedings. Service may be accomplished by personal delivery, 
certified mail, or express courier. Documents served on an indirect air 
carrier will be served at the indirect air carrier's official place of 
business as designated in its application for approval or its security 
program. Documents served on TSA must be served to the address noted in 
the notice of withdrawal of approval or withdrawal of approval, 
whichever is applicable.
    (1) Certificate of service. An individual may attach a certificate 
of service to a document tendered for filing. A certificate of service 
must consist of a statement, dated and signed by the person filing the 
document, that the document was personally delivered, served by 
certified mail on a specific date, or served by express courier on a 
specific date.
    (2) Date of service. The date of service will be--
    (i) The date of personal delivery;
    (ii) If served by certified mail, the mailing date shown on the 
certificate of service, the date shown on the postmark, if there is no 
certificate of service, or other mailing date shown by other evidence if 
there is no certificate of service or postmark; or
    (iii) If served by express courier, the service date shown on the 
certificate of service, or by other evidence if there is no certificate 
of service.
    (h) Extension of time. TSA may grant an extension of time of the 
limits set forth in this section for good cause shown. An indirect air 
carrier's request for an extension of time must be in writing and be 
received by TSA at least 2 days before the due date to be extended. TSA 
may grant itself an extension of time for good cause.

information is needed to verify your identity and to conduct a security 
threat assessment to evaluate your suitability for a hazardous materials 
endorsement for a commercial drivers license. Furnishing this

services relating to the security threat assessments; to appropriate 
governmental agencies for licensing, law enforcement, or security 
purposes, or in the interests of national security; and to foreign and 
international governmental authorities in accordance with law and 
international agreement.
    The information I have provided on this application is true, 
complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and is 
provided in good faith. I understand that a knowing and willful false 
statement, or an omission of a material fact, on this application can be 
punished by fine or imprisonment or both (see section 1001 of Title 18 
United States Code), and may be grounds for denial of a hazardous

Sec. 1572.403  Fee procedures for collection by States.

    This section describes the procedures that a State that collects 
fingerprints and applicant information under 49 CFR part 1572, and the 
procedures an individual who applies for a new HME or renewal of an 
existing HME for a CDL in that State, must follow for collection and 
transmission of the Threat Assessment Fee and the FBI Fee.

[[Page 402]]

    (a) Imposition of fees. (1) The following Threat Assessment Fee is 
required for TSA to conduct a security threat assessment under 49 CFR 
part 1572 for an individual who applies for a new HME or renewal of an 
existing HME: $34.
    (2) The following FBI Fee is required for the FBI to process 
fingerprint identification records and name checks required under 49 CFR 
part 1572: the fee collected by the FBI under 28 U.S.C. 534.
    (3) An individual who applies for a new or renewed HME, or the 
individual's employer, must remit to the State the Threat Assessment Fee 
and the FBI Fee, in a form and manner approved by TSA and the State, 
when the individual submits the application for the HME to the State.
    (b) Collection of fees. (1) A State must collect the Threat 
Assessment Fee and FBI Fee when an individual submits an application to 
the State for a new HME or renewal of an existing HME.
    (2) Once TSA receives an application from a State for a security 
threat assessment under 49 CFR part 1572, the State is liable for the 
Threat Assessment Fee.
    (3) Nothing in this subpart prevents a State from collecting any 
other fees that a State may impose on an individual who applies for a 
new HME or renewal of an existing HME.
    (c) Handling of fees. (1) A State must safeguard all Threat 
Assessment Fees from the time of collection until remittance to TSA.
    (2) All Threat Assessment Fees are held in trust by a State for the 
beneficial interest of the United States in paying for the costs of 
conducting the security threat assessment required by 49 U.S.C. 5103a 
and 49 CFR part 1572. A State holds neither legal nor equitable interest 
in the Threat Assessment Fees except for the right to retain any accrued 
interest on the principal amounts collected pursuant to this section.
    (3) A State must account for Threat Assessment Fees separately, but 
may commingle such fees with other sources of revenue.
    (d) Remittance of fees. (1) TSA will generate and provide an invoice 
to a State on a monthly basis. The invoice will indicate the total fee 
dollars (number of applicants times the Threat Assessment Fee) that are 
due for the month.
    (2) A State must remit to TSA full payment for the invoice within 30 
days after TSA sends the invoice.
    (3) TSA accepts Threat Assessment Fees only from a State, not from 
an individual applicant for an HME.
    (4) A State may retain any interest that accrues on the principal 
amounts collected between the date of collection and the date the Threat 
Assessment Fee is remitted to TSA in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section.
    (5) A State may not retain any portion of the Threat Assessment Fee 
to offset the costs of collecting, handling, or remitting Threat 
Assessment Fees.
    (6) Threat Assessment Fees remitted to TSA by a State must be in 
U.S. currency and made payable to the ``Transportation Security 
Administration.''
    (7) Threat Assessment Fees must be remitted by check, money order, 
wire or any other payment method acceptable to TSA.
    (8) TSA will not issue any refunds of Threat Assessment Fees.
    (9) If a State does not remit the Threat Assessment Fees for any 
month, TSA may decline to process any HME applications from that State.


<R05>

are remitted to a TSA agent must be made in U.S. currency and made 
payable to the ``Transportation Security Administration.''
