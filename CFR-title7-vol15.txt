F80087
�vi�I06G4T1Explanation
S8092I11The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. 
I11Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows: 
Q02
I37Title 1 through Title 16 Las of January 1 
I37Title 17 through Title 27 Las of April 1 
I37Title 28 through Title 41 Las of July 1 
I37Title 42 through Title 50 Las of October 1 
Q02I11The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. 

Q02I10LEGAL STATUS 
Q02I11The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). 

Q02I10HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS 
Q02I11The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule. 
I11To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2000), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule. 

Q02I10EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES 
Q02I11Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

Q02I10OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
Q02I11The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96�09511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. �vii�Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. 

Q02I10OBSOLETE PROVISIONS 
Q02I11Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949�091963, 1964�091972, or 1973�091985, published in seven separate volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. 

Q02I10CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES 
Q02I11A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR T4Index and Finding Aids.G1T1 This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume. 
I11An index to the text of ``Title 3_The President'' is carried within that volume.
I11The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register. 
I11A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles. 

Q02I10REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
Q02I11There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Q02I10INQUIRIES 
Q02I11For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd�09numbered pages.
I11For inquiries concerning CFR reference assistance, call 202�09523�095227 or write to the Director, Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC 20408 or e�09mail info@fedreg.nara.gov.

I11(2) Additionally, this part establishes intergovernmental review provisions required by Executive Order 12372 for any programs listed in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1 as covered, and policy on competition in awarding discretionary grants and cooperative agreements. 


I11(3) Rules for nonentitlement grants and cooperative agreements to State and local governments are found in part 3016. 
I11(4) Rules for nonentitlement grants and cooperative agreements to institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations are found in part 3019.
I11(b) These rules supersede and take precedence over any individual USDA agency regulations and directives dealing with the administration of grants and cooperative agreements to the extent such regulations and directives are inconsistent with this part, unless such inconsistency is based on a statutory provision or an exception has been obtained from OMB. (See �1A3015.3.) Definitions for the terms used in this part are set forth in Appendix A. Definitions for the implementation of standard audit requirements for State and local governments and Indian Tribal governments are contained in Subpart I_Audits. 
I11(c) The purpose of this part is to simplify, standardize, and improve the administration of USDA grants and cooperative agreements. 
I11(d) Responsibility for developing and interpreting the material for this part and in keeping it up-to-date is assigned to the Office of the Deputy Director, Finance, a component of the Office of Operations and Finance (O&F), which reports to the Assistant Secretary for Administration.

I80�1A3015.2
I89Applicability. 
I11(a) T3Grants and cooperative agreements.G1T1 This part applies to USDA grants and cooperative agreements. For each substantive provision in this part, either the words of the provision itself or other words in the same subpart tell whether the provision applies to subgrants. Exemptions to this part may be applicable to certain kinds of recipients. (See paragraph (d) of this section.) 
I11(b) T3Terminology applicable to this part.G1T1 This part's substantive rules are the same for grants and cooperative agreements. Many of the rules are also the same for subgrants. Therefore, certain simplified terminology is used in the text. Specifically in all portions of this part: 
I11(1) Each provision that applies to T3grantsG1T1 also applies to T3cooperative agreements,G1T1 even though the latter term does not appear in the provisions. 
I11(2) Each provision that applies to T3recipients of grantsG1T1 applies to T3recipients of cooperative agreements,G1T1 even though the latter term does not appear in the provision. 
I11(3) The term T3recipientG1T1 refers equally to recipients of grants and recipients of cooperative agreements. 
I11(4) The term T3awarding agencyG1T1 refers equally to a USDA agency that awards a grant and to one that awards a cooperative agreement. 
I11(5) The term T3subgrantG1T1 refers equally to certain awards under grants and to the same kinds of awards under cooperative agreements. 
I11(c) T3Public institutions of higher education and hospitals.G1T1 Grants, cooperative agreements and subgrants awarded to institutions of higher education and hospitals operated by a government are subject only to the provisions of this part that apply to non-governmental organizations.
I11(d) T3Recipients to which this part does not automatically apply.G1T1 This part does not automatically apply to the kinds of recipients listed below unless other conditions set forth in the grant, cooperative agreement, subgrant, or specific subpart in this part make all or specified portions apply: 
I11(1) Foreign governments or organizations, 
I11(2) International organizations, such as the United Nations,
I11(3) Agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal government, and 
I11(4) Individuals.
I11(5) State and local governments, except open-ended entitlements to State and local governments. 
�59�I11(6) Institutions of higher education, hospitals and other non-profit organizations except open-ended entitlements to those entities.
I11(e) T3Collaborative arrangements.G1T1 (1) Where permitted by the terms of the award, a recipient may enter into collaborative arrangements with other organizations to jointly carry out activities with grant or cooperative agreement funds. In this kind of situation, the arrangement between the recipient and each collaborating organization is subject to the rules in this part that apply to subgrants awarded by the recipients. (See the example shown in �1A3015.195.)
I11(2) This paragraph (e) does not apply to arrangements where the organizations receive an award jointly. In this case, they are not a recipient and subrecipient but, as the award notice states, joint recipients.

I80�1A3015.3 
I89Conflicting policies and deviations. 
I11(a) T3Statutory provisions.G1T1 Federal statutes that apply to some USDA grant programs may contain provisions that conflict with this part. Those statutory provisions take precedence over this part. 
I11(b) T3Nonstatutory provisions.G1T1 USDA awarding agencies occasionally develop grant provisions that are inconsistent with this part. USDA attempts to keep these provisions to a minimum by internal procedures that require these provisions to be justified to appropriate officials of USDA and OMB. If the conflicting provisions are of long-term and general applicability, O&F may require that the awarding agency (1) publish the conflicting provision as a notice in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1 and (2) give the public an opportunity to comment before making the regulations final. 
I11(c) T3Nonstatutory provisions-subgrants.G1T1 If a provision of a subgrant conflicts with this part, the recipient is considered as violating the provisions of the grant, unless the subgrant provision is authorized in writing, by the awarding agency. 
I11(d) T3OMB exceptions.G1T1 In some cases, OMB grants exceptions from the requirements of the Circulars, when permissible under existing laws. In those instances where a program receives an exception to a particular provision of a Circular, the exception takes precedence over this part. 

I80�1A3015.4
I89Special restrictive terms. 
I11(a) Occasionally an awarding agency, or a recipient awarding a subgrant, may find that a particular recipient: 
I11(1) Is financially unstable, 
I11(2) Has a history of poor performance, or 
I11(3) Has a management system that does not meet the standards in this part.
Q02I10In these cases the awarding agency may impose special conditions that are more restrictive than otherwise permitted by this part. If so, the awarding agency must tell the recipient in writing why it is imposing the special conditions and what corrective action is needed. 
I11(b) At the time an awarding agency imposes a special grant condition under paragraph (a) of this section, the awarding agency, through O&F, shall notify OMB and other interested parties. 
I11(c) At the time a recipient imposes a special restrictive subgrant condition under paragraph (a) of this section, it must notify the awarding agency, giving full particulars. The awarding agency, through O&F, shall then notify OMB and other interested parties. 
I11(d) A special restrictive grant or subgrant condition under paragraph (a) of this section is considered consistent with this part.

I80�1A3015.10
I89Physical segregation and eligibility. 
I11Except as provided in �1A3015.11, awarding agencies shall not impose grant or subgrant conditions which: 
I11(a) Require the recipient to use a separate bank account for the deposit of grant or subgrant funds, or 
I11(b) Establish any eligibility requirements for banks or other financial institutions in which recipients deposit grant or subgrant funds. 

�60�I80�1A3015.11
I89Separate bank accounts. 
I11A separate bank account shall be required when applicable letter of credit agreements provide that funds will not be drawn until the recipient's checks are presented to the bank for payment. 

I80�1A3015.12
I89Moneys advanced to recipients. 
I11Any moneys advanced to recipients which are subject to the control or regulation of the United States or any of its officers, agents, or employees (public moneys as defined in Treasury Circular 176, as amended), must be deposited in a bank with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance coverage and the balance exceeding the FDIC coverage must be collaterally secured. 

I80�1A3015.13
I89Minority and women-owned banks. 
I11Consistent with the national goal of expanding opportunities for minority business enterprises, recipients, and subrecipients are encouraged to use minority and women-owned banks. Upon request, awarding agencies will furnish a listing of minority and women-owned banks to recipients. 

I56Subpart C_Bonding and Insurance 

I80�1A3015.15
I89General. 
I11In administering grants, subgrants, and cooperative agreements, recipients shall observe their regular requirements and practices with respect to bonding and insurance. No additional bonding and insurance requirements, including fidelity bonds, shall be imposed by the provisions of the grant, subgrant, or cooperative agreement except as provided in �1A3015.16 through 3015.18. 

I80�1A3015.16
I89Construction and facility improvement. 
I11(a) T3Scope.G1T1 This section covers requirements for bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds when the recipients will contract or subcontract for construction or facility improvement (including alterations and renovations of real property) under a grant or subgrant. 
I11(b) T3Bids and contracts or subcontracts of $100,000 or less.G1T1 Unless otherwise required by law, the recipients shall follow its own requirements and practices relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds. 
I11(c) T3Bids and contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000.G1T1 Unless otherwise required by law, the recipient may follow its own regular policy and requirements if the USDA awarding agency has decided that the Federal government's interest will be adequately protected. If this decision has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows: 
I11(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to 5 percent of the bid price; 
I11(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price; and 
I11(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price.

I80�1A3015.17
I89Fidelity bonds.
I11(a) If the recipient is not a unit of government, the awarding agency may require the recipient to carry adequate fidelity bond coverage where the absence of coverage for the grant-supported activity is considered as created an unacceptable risk.
I11(b) If the subrecipient is not a unit of government, the awarding agency or the recipient may require that the subrecipient carry adequate fidelity bond coverage where the absence of coverage for the subgrant-supported activity is considered as creating an unacceptable risk.

I80�1A3015.18
I89Source of bonds.
I11Any bonds required under �1A3015.16(c) (1) through (3) or �1A3015.17 shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties (31 CFR part 223). A list of these companies is published annually by the Department of the Treasury in its Circular 570. 

I56Subpart D_Record Retention and Access Requirements

I80�1A3015.20
I89Applicability.
I11(a) This subpart applies to all financial records, supporting documents, �61�statistical records and other records of recipients, which are:
I11(1) Required to be maintained by the provisions of a USDA grant or cooperative agreement, or
I11(2) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to a USDA grant or cooperative agreement.
I11(b) This subpart does not apply to the records of contractors and subcontractors under grants, subgrants and cooperative agreements. For a requirement to place a provision concerning these records in certain kinds of contracts, see Subpart S of this part.

I80�1A3015.21
I89Retention period.
I11(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, records shall be kept for 3 years from the starting date specified in �1A3015.22.
I11(b) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been started before the end of the 3-year period, the records shall be kept until all issues are resolved, or until the end of the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
I11(c) In order to avoid dual recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make special arrangements for recipients to keep any records which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency shall request a recipient to transfer records to its custody when the awarding agency decides that the records possess long-term retention value. When the records are transferred to or maintained by the awarding agency the 3-year retention requirement shall not apply to the recipient.
I11(d) Records for nonexpendable property acquired in whole or in part, with Federal funds shall be retained for three years after its final disposition.

I80�1A3015.22
I89Starting date of retention period.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 The retention period starts from the date of the submission of the final expenditure report or, where USDA grant support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the 3-year retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the day the recipient submits to USDA its annual or final expenditure report for that period. If an expenditure report has been waived, the 3-year retention period starts on the day the report would have been due. Exceptions to this paragraph are contained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
I11(b) T3Equipment records.G1T1 The 3-year retention period for the equipment records required by Subpart R starts from the date of the equipment's disposition, replacement, or transfer at the direction of the awarding agency.
I11(c) T3Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support.G1T1 (1) In cases where USDA requires that program income (as defined in Appendix A) be applied to costs incurred after expiration or termination of grant or subgrant support, the 3-year retention period for these cost records starts from the end of the recipient's fiscal year in which the costs are incurred.
I11(2) Where USDA requires the disposition of copyright royalties or other program income earned after expiration or termination of grant or subgrant support, the 3-year retention period for those income records starts from the end of the recipient's fiscal year in which the income was earned. (See Subpart F, �1A3015.44.)
I11(d) T3Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocation plans, etc._G1T1(1) T3Applicability.G1T1 This paragraph applies to the following types of documents and their supporting records:
I11(i) Indirect cost rate computations or proposals;
I11(ii) Cost allocation plans; and
I11(iii) Any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
I11(2) T3If submitted for negotiation.G1T1 If the Federal government requires submission of the proposal; plan, or other computation for negotiation of the rate chargeable for particular costs, then the 3-year retention period for the plan, proposal or other computation and the supporting records starts from the date of such submission.
I11(3) T3If not submitted for negotiation.G1T1 If the Federal government does not require submission of the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation of the rate chargeable for particular costs, then the 3-year retention period �62�for the proposal, plan, or other computation and the supporting records starts from the end of the fiscal year covered by such proposal, plan, or other computation.

I80�1A3015.23
I89Microfilm.
I11Copies made by microfilming, photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original records.

I80�1A3015.24
I89Access to records.
I11(a) T3Records of recipients.G1T1 USDA and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of the recipient which are pertinent in a specific USDA award in order to make audit, examination, excerpts, and transcripts.
I11(b) T3Records of subrecipients.G1T1 USDA and the Comptroller General of the United States, and the recipient, or any of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of the subrecipient which are pertinent to a specific USDA grant or cooperative agreement, in order to make audit, examination, excerpts, and transcripts.
I11(c) T3Expiration of right of access.G1T1 The rights of access in this section shall not be limited to the required retention period but shall last as long as the records are kept.

I80�1A3015.25
I89Restrictions to public access.
I11Unless required by law, no awarding agency shall impose grant or subgrant conditions which limit public access to records covered by this subpart, except when the awarding agency determines that such records must be kept confidential and would have been excepted from disclosure pursuant to USDA's ``Freedom of Information'' regulations if the records had belonged to USDA (7 CFR 1.1�091.16). 

I56Subpart E_Waiver of ``Single'' State Agency Requirements

I80�1A3015.30
I89Waiver of ``single'' State agency requirements.
I11Section 204 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 authorizes Federal agencies to waive ``single'' State agency requirements on request of the Governor or other duly constituted State authorities.
I11(a) T3Approval authority.G1T1 The awarding agency has approval authority for waiver requests, and shall handle them as quickly as feasible. Approval should be given whenever possible.
I11(b) T3Refusal procedures.G1T1 When it is necessary to refuse a request for waiver of the ``single'' State agency requirements under section 204, the awarding agency shall, through O&F, advise OMB that the request cannot be granted. Such advice should indicate the reasons for the denial of the request. Notification, through O&F, to OMB shall occur prior to informing the State of the refusal.

I56Subpart F_Grant Related Income

I80�1A3015.40
I89Scope.
I11This subpart contains policies and requirements related to program income and interest and other investment income earned on advances of grant funds. Appendix A defines the term ``program income.'' There are five categories of program income covered in this subpart. Each is treated in a separate section. The categories are:
I11(a) General program income;
I11(b) Proceeds from sale of real property and from sale of equipment and supplies acquired for use;
I11(c) Royalties and other income earned from a copyrighted work;
I11(d) Royalties or equivalent income earned from patents or inventions; and
I11(e) Income after the period of grant or subgrant support not otherwise treated.

I80�1A3015.41
I89General program income.
I11(a) T3Applicability.G1T1 This section applies to ``general program income'' as defined in Appendix A.
I11(b) T3Use.G1T1 (1) General program income shall be retained by the recipient and used in accordance with one or a combination of the alternatives in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, as follows: The alternative in paragraph (c) may always be used by recipients and must be used if neither of the other two alternatives is permitted by the provisions of the grant award. The alternatives in paragraph (d) or (e) of �63�this section may be used only if expressly permitted by the provisions of the grant award. In specifying alternatives that may be used, the provisions of the grant award may distinguish between income earned by the recipient and income earned by subrecipients and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income.
I11(2) The provisions of a subgrant award may restrict the use of general program income earned by the subrecipient to only one or some of the alternatives permitted by the provisions of the grant, but the alternative in paragraph (c) of this section shall always be permitted.
I11(c) T3Deduction alternative.G1T1 (1) Under this alternative, the income is used for allowable costs of the project or program. If there is a cost-sharing or matching requirement, costs supported by the income may not count toward satisfying that requirement. Therefore, the maximum percentage of Federal cost-sharing is applied to the net amount determined by deducting the income from total allowable costs and third party in-kind contributions. The income shall be used for current costs unless the awarding agency authorizes the income to be used in a later period.
I11(2) To illustrate this alternative, assume a project in which the recipient incurs $100,000 of allowable costs and receives no third party in-kind contributions. If the recipient earns $10,000 in general program income and this alternative applies, that $10,000 must be deducted from the $100,000 before applying the maximum percentage of Federal cost-sharing. If that percentage is 90 percent, the most that could be paid to the recipient would therefore be $81,000 (90 percent times $90,000).
I11(d) T3Cost-sharing or matching alternative.G1T1 (1) Under this alternative, the income is used for allowable costs of the project or program but, in this case, the costs supported by the income may count toward satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement. Therefore, the maximum percentage of Federal cost-sharing is applied to total allowable costs and third party in-kind contributions. The income shall be used for current costs unless the awarding agency authorizes its use in a later period.
I11(2) To illustrate this alternative, assume the same situation as in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Under this alternative, the 90 percent maximum percentage of Federal cost-sharing would be applied to the full $100,000, and $90,000 could therefore be paid to the recipient.
I11(e) T3Additional costs alternative.G1T1 Under this alternative, the income is used for costs which are in addition to the allowable costs of the project or program but which nevertheless further the objectives of the Federal statute under which the grant was made. Provided that the costs supported by the income further the broad objectives of that statute, they need not be of a kind that would be permissible as charges to Federal funds. Examples of purposes for which the income may be used are:
I11(1) Expanding the project or program.
I11(2) Continuing the project or program after grant or subgrant support ends.
I11(3) Supporting other projects or programs that further the broad objectives of the statute.
I11(4) Obtaining equipment or other assets needed for the project or program or for other activities that further the statute's objectives.

I80�1A3015.42
I89Proceeds from sale of real property and from sale of equipment and supplies acquired for use.
I11The following kinds of program income shall be governed by Subpart R of this part:
I11(a) Proceeds from the sale of real property purchased or constructed under a grant or subgrant.
I11(b) Proceeds from the sale of equipment and supplies created or purchased under a grant or subgrant and intended primarily for use in the grant or subgrant-supported project or program rather than for sale or rental.

I80�1A3015.43
I89Royalties and other income earned from a copyrighted work.
I11(a) This section applies to royalties, license fees, and other income earned by a recipient from a copyrighted work developed under the grant or subgrant. Income of that kind is covered by this �64�section whether a third party or the recipient acts as the publisher, seller, exhibitor, or performer of the copyrighted work. In some cases the recipient incurs costs to earn the income but does not charge these costs to USDA grant funds, to required cost-sharing or matching funds, or to other program income. Costs of that kind may be deducted from the gross income in order to determine how much must be treated as program income.
I11(b) The provisions of the grant award govern the disposition of income subject to this section. If the provisions of the grant award do not treat this kind of income, there are no USDA requirements governing its disposition. A recipient is not prohibited from imposing requirements of its own on the disposition of this kind of income which is earned by its subrecipients provided those requirements are in addition to, and not inconsistent with, any requirements imposed by the provisions of the grant award.

I80�1A3015.44
I89Royalties or equivalent income earned from patents or from inventions.
I11Disposition of royalties or equivalent income earned on patents or inventions arising out of activities assisted by a grant or subgrant shall be governed by the provisions of the grant or subgrant agreement. If the agreement does not provide for the disposition of the royalties or equivalent income, the disposition shall be in accordance with the recipient's own policies. 

I80�1A3015.45
I89Other program income.
I11(a) This section applies to program income not treated elsewhere in this part which subsequently results from an activity supported by a grant or subgrant but which does not accrue until after the period of grant or subgrant support. An example is proceeds from the sale or rental of a residual inventory of merchandise created or purchased by a grant-supported workshop during the period of support.
I11(b) The provisions of the grant award govern the disposition of income subject to this section. If the provisions do not treat this kind of income, there are no USDA requirements governing its disposition. A recipient may impose requirements of its own on the disposition of this kind of income which is earned by its subrecipients provided those requirements are in addition to and not inconsistent with any requirements imposed by the provisions of the grant award. 

I80�1A3015.46
I89Interest earned on advances of grant funds.
I11(a) Except when exempted by Federal statute (see paragraph (b) of this section for the principal exemption), recipients shall remit to the Federal government any interest or other investment income earned on advances of USDA grant funds. This includes any interest or investment income earned by subrecipients and cost-type contractors on advances to them that result from advances of USDA grant funds to the recipient. Unless the recipient receives other instructions from the responsible USDA awarding agency, the recipient shall remit the amount due by check or money order payable to the awarding agency. This requirement may not be administratively waived.
I11(b) In accordance with the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4213), States, as defined in the Act, shall not be accountable to the Federal government for interest or investment income earned by the State itself, or by its subrecipents, where this income is attributable to grants-in-aid, as defined in the Act.\1\T1N

I28NG2T11G1T1�1A``State'' is defined in the Act to include any agency or instrumentality of a State, and the definition does not exclude a hospital or institution of higher education which is such an agency or instrumentality. ``Grant-in-aid'' is defined in the Act to exclude payments under research and development contracts or grants which are awarded directly and on similar terms to all qualifying organizations, whether public or private. (42 U.S.C. 4201)

I11(c) Recipients are cautioned that they are subject to the provisions of Subpart L for minimizing the time between the transfer of advances and their disbursement. Those provisions apply even if there is no accountability to the Federal government for interest or other investment income earned on the advances.

�65�I56Subpart G_Cost-Sharing or Matching

I80�1A3015.50
I89Scope.
I11This subpart contains rules reflecting Federal requirements for cost-sharing or matching. These rules apply whether cost-sharing or matching is required by Federal statute, awarding agency regulations, or by other provisions established by the specific grant agreement.

I80�1A3015.51
I89Acceptable contributions and costs.
I11A cost-sharing or a matching requirement may be satisfied after qualifications and exceptions are met in �1A3015.52 and by satisfying either or both of the following:
I11(a) Allowable costs incurred by the recipient or by any subrecipient under the grant or subgrant. This includes allowable costs supported by non-Federal grants or by cash donations from non-Federal third parties. Allowable costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles set forth in Subpart T.
I11(b) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the same period when a cost-sharing or matching requirement applies. 

I80�1A3015.52
I89Qualifications and exceptions.
I11(a) T3Costs supported by other Federal grants.G1T1 (1) A cost-sharing or a matching requirement shall not be met by costs supported by another Federal grant, except as provided by Federal statute. This exception however, does not apply to costs supported by general program income earned from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
I11(2) For the purpose of this part, funds provided under General or Countercyclical Revenue Sharing Programs (31 U.S.C. 1221 T3et seq.G1T1 and 42 U.S.C. 6721 T3et seq.G1T1) are not considered Federal grants. Therefore, allowable costs supported by these funds may be used to satisfy a cost-sharing or a matching requirement.
I11(b) T3Costs or contributions applied towards other Federal cost-sharing requirements.G1T1 Recipient costs or the value of third party in-kind contributions shall not count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of a USDA grant if they are or will be counted towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of another Federal grant, a Federal procurement contract, or any other award of Federal funds.
I11(c) T3Costs financed by general program income.G1T1 Costs financed by general program income as defined in Appendix A shall not count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of a USDA grant supporting the activity unless the provisions of the grant award expressly permit the income to be used for cost-sharing or matching purposes. (This is the alternative for use of general program income described in �1A3015.41).
I11(d) T3Services or property financed by income earned by contractors.G1T1 Contractors under a grant or subgrant may earn income from the activities carried out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by this income may count toward satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement unless other provisions of the grant award expressly permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
I11(e) T3Records.G1T1 In order to count cost and third party in-kind contributions towards satisfying a cost-sharing or a matching requirement, there must be verification and accurate documentation from the records of recipients or cost-type contractors. These records shall show how the value placed on third party in-kind contributions was decided. Special standards and procedures for calculating these contributions are discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. Volunteer services, to the extent possible, shall be supported by the same pay procedures and rates employed by the organization when paying for similar work performed by its personnel.
I11(f) T3Special standards for third party in-kind contributions_G1T1(1) T3Contributions to recipients or cost-type contractors.G1T1 A third party in-kind contribution to a recipient or cost-type contractor may count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement only where, if the recipient or cost-type contractor �66�were to pay for it, the payment would be an allowable cost.
I11(2) T3Contributions to fixed-price contractors.G1T1 A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contractor may count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement only if it results in:
I11(i) An increase in the services or property provided under the contract (without additional cost to the recipient or subrecipient), or
I11(ii) A cost savings to the recipient or subrecipient.

I80�1A3015.53
I89Valuation of donated services.
I11(a) T3Volunteer services.G1T1 Unpaid services provided to a recipient by an individual shall be valued at rates consistent with the rates normally paid for similar work in the recipient organization. If there is no similar work in the recipient organization, the rate of pay for volunteer services should be consistent with those regular rates paid for similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
I11(b) T3Employees of other organizations.G1T1 When an employer, other than a recipient or cost-type contractor, furnishes the services of an employee without cost to perform the employee's normal line of work, the services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay, exclusive of the employer's fringe benefits and overhead cost. If the services are in a different line of work, paragraph (a) of this section shall apply.

I80�1A3015.54
I89Valuation of donated supplies and loaned equipment or space.
I11(a) If a third party donates supplies, the contributions shall not exceed the cost of the supplies to the donor or the market value of the supplies, at the time of the donation, whichever is less.
I11(b) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a building but retains the title, the contribution shall be valued at the fair rental rate of the equipment or space.

I80�1A3015.55
I89Valuation of donated equipment, buildings, and land.
I11When a third party donates equipment, buildings or land, and the title is given to the recipient, the treatment of this donated property shall depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant as follows:
I11(a) T3Awards for capital expenditures.G1T1 If the purpose of the grant or subgrant is to assist the recipient in acquiring property, such as equipment, buildings, and land, then the market value of that property at the time of donation may be counted as cost-sharing or matching.
I11(b) T3Other awards.G1T1 If the nature of the grant or subgrant is not for the purpose of acquiring property, the following rules shall apply:
I11(1) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market value at the time of donation of the equipment or buildings and the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost-sharing or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the provisions of the USDA grant should require that the approval be obtained from the awarding agency as well as the recipient. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an allowable direct cost.
I11(2) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, no amount shall be counted for donated land. Instead, only depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and buildings and treated as costs incurred by the recipient. They are computed and allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost principles specified in Subpart T of this part. They will thus be handled in the same way as depreciation or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.

I80�1A3015.56
I89Appraisal of real property.
I11In some cases, it will be necessary to establish the market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of space in a building. In these cases, the awarding agency must require that �67�the market value or fair rental rate be set by an independent appraiser (or by a representative of the U.S. General Services Administration, if available) and that the value or rate be certified by a responsible official of the party to which the property or its use is donated. This requirement must also be imposed by the recipient on subgrants.

I56Subpart H_Standards for Financial Management Systems

I80�1A3015.60
I89Scope.
I11This subpart contains standards for financial management systems of recipients. No additional financial management standards or requirements shall be imposed by awarding agencies. Awarding agencies will, however, provide recipients with suggestions and assistance on establishing or improving financial management systems when such assistance is needed or requested.

I80�1A3015.61
I89Financial management standards.
I11The following standards shall be met by recipients and subrecipients in managing their financial management system.
I11(a) T3Financial reporting.G1T1 Complete, accurate, and current disclosure of the financial results of each USDA sponsored project or program shall be made in accordance with the financial reporting requirements set forth in the grant or subgrant. When a USDA awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system, but shall develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.
I11(b) T3Accounting records.G1T1 The source and application of funds shall be readily identified by the continuous maintenance of updated records. Records, as such, shall contain information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, and income. When the recipient is a governmental entity, the records shall also contain liabilities.
I11(c) T3Internal control.G1T1 Effective control over and accountability for all USDA grant or subgrant funds, real and personal property assets shall be maintained. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all such property and shall ensure that it is used solely for authorized purposes. In cases where projects are not 100 percent Federally funded, recipients must have effective internal controls to assure that expenditures financed with Federal funds are properly chargeable to the grant supported project.
I11(d) T3Budgetary control.G1T1 The actual and budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant shall be compared. If appropriate, or required by the awarding agency, financial information shall be related to performance and unit cost data. When unit cost data is required, estimates based on available documentation may be accepted whenever possible.
I11(e) T3Advance payments.G1T1 There shall be specific procedures established to minimize the time elapsing between the advance of Federal grant or subgrant funds and their subsequent disbursement by the recipient. When advances are made by a letter of credit method, the recipients shall make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of making the disbursements. This same procedure shall be followed by recipients who advance cash to subrecipients to ensure that timely fiscal transactions and reporting requirements are conducted.
I11(f) T3Allowable costs.G1T1 Established procedures shall be used for determining the reasonableness, allowability, and allocability of costs in accordance with the cost principles prescribed by Subpart T of this part and the provisions of the grant award.
I11(g) T3Source documentation.G1T1 Accounting records shall be supported by source documentation. These documentations include, but are not limited to, cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, contract and subgrant award documents.
I11(h) T3Audit resolution.G1T1 A systematic method shall be employed by each recipient to assure timely and appropriate resolution of audit findings and recommendations.

�68�I56Subpart J_Financial Reporting Requirements

I80�1A3015.80 
I89Scope and applicability.
I11(a) This subpart prescribes requirements and forms for recipients to report financial information to USDA and to request grant payments when a letter of credit is not used.
I11(b) This subpart need not be applied by recipients in dealing with their subrecipients. Recipients are encouraged not to impose on subrecipients more burdensome requirements than USDA imposes on them.

I80�1A3015.81 
I89General.
I11(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, recipients shall use only the forms specified in �1A3015.82 through 3015.85, and such other forms as may be authorized by OMB for: 
I11(1) Submitting grant financial reports to awarding agencies, or 
I11(2) Requesting grant payments when letters of credit or automatic prescheduled Treasury check advances are not used.
I11(b) Recipients shall follow all applicable standard instructions issued by OMB for use in connection with the forms specified in �1A3015.82 through 3015.85. Awarding agencies may not issue substantive supplementary instructions that are inconsistent with this subpart or impose additional requirements on recipients without the approval of O&F and OMB. However, awarding agencies may shade out or instruct the recipient to disregard any line item that the awarding agency finds unnecessary for its decision-making purposes.
I11(c) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than one original and two copies of the forms required under this subpart. 
I11(d) Awarding agencies may provide computer outputs to recipients to expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Awarding agencies may accept the required information from recipients in machine readable form or computer printouts instead of prescribed formats.
I11(e) When an awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards for financial management systems contained in Subpart H of this part, it may require more frequent financial reports or more detail (or both) upon written notice to the recipient (without regard to �1A3015.4) until such time as the standards are met. 
I11(f) Awarding agencies may waive any report required by this subpart, if not needed.
I11(g) Awarding agencies may extend the due date for any financial report upon receiving a justified request from the recipient. The recipient should not wait until the due date if an extension is to be requested, but should submit the request as soon as the need becomes known. Failure by a recipient to submit a report by its due date may result in severe enforcement actions by USDA. These may include withholding of further grant payments, suspension or termination of the grant, etc. Therefore recipients are urged to submit reports on time.

I80�1A3015.82
I89Financial status report.
I11(a) T3Form.G1T1 Recipients shall use Standard Form 269, Financial Status Report, to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs.
I11(b) T3Accounting basis.G1T1 Unless specified in the provisions of the grant or subgrant each recipient shall report program outlays and program income on the same accounting basis, i.e., cash or accrual, which it uses in its accounting system.
I11(c) T3Frequency.G1T1 The awarding agency may prescribe the frequency of the report for each project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly except as provided in �1A3015.4, 3015.81(e), or by statute. If the awarding agency does not specify the frequency of the report, it shall be submitted annually. Upon expiration or termination of the grant or cooperative agreement, if a period of time remains not covered by a periodic report (i.e., a quarterly, semi-annual or annual report), a final report shall be required.
I11(d) T3Due date.G1T1 When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual basis, they shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. When required on an annual basis, they shall be due 90 days after the end of the grant or �69�agreement period. In addition, final reports as defined in �1A3015.82(c) shall be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of grant or agreement support, except in those instances where an extension has been granted.
I11(e) T3Final reports.G1T1 (1) Final reports (i.e., the last report submitted) must not show any unpaid obligations.
I11(2) If the recipient will still have unpaid obligations when the final report is due, the recipient shall submit a provisional final report (showing the unpaid obligations) by the due date, and a true final report when all obligations have been paid. When submitting a provisional final report, the recipient shall tell the awarding agency when it expects to submit a true final report.
I11(3) As provided in �1A3015.81(f), awarding agencies may waive provisional final reports.

I80�1A3015.83
I89Federal cash transactions report.
I11(a) T3Form.G1T1 (1) For grants or cooperative agreements paid by letters of credit (or Treasury check advances) through any USDA payment office, the recipient shall submit to USDA a Standard Form 272, Federal Cash Transactions Report, and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF�09272a. Recipients under the Regional Disbursing Office (RDO) system shall not be required to submit a SF�09272. For these recipients, awarding agencies shall use information contained in the Request for Payment to monitor recipient cash balances and to get disbursement information.
I11(2) The SF�09272 will be used by USDA to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement or outlay information from recipients for each grant or cooperative agreement. The format of the report may be adapted, as appropriate, when reporting is to be accomplished with the assistance of automatic data processing equipment, provided that the identical information is submitted.
I11(b) T3Forecasts of Federal cash requirements.G1T1 Awarding agencies may require that forecasts of Federal cash requirements be provided in the ``Remarks'' section of the report.
I11(c) T3Cash in hands of subrecipients or contractors.G1T1 When considered necessary and feasible by the responsible USDA awarding agency, recipients may be required to:
I11(1) Show in the ``Remarks'' section of the report the amount of cash advances exceeding three days needs in the hands of their subrecipients or contractors, and 
I11(2) Provide short narrative explanations or actions taken by the recipient to reduce such excess balances.
I11(d) T3Frequency and due date.G1T1 Recipients shall submit the report no later than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, the USDA payment office may require recipients receiving advances of one million dollars or more per year to submit a report within 15 working days following the end of each month. Awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF�09272 when monthly advances do not exceed $10,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this subpart, or if, in the awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances.

I80�1A3015.84
I89Request for advance or reimbursement.
I11(a) T3Advance payments.G1T1 Recipients of nonconstruction grants or cooperative agreements shall request Treasury check advance payments on Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. This form is not used for letter of credit drawdowns or predetermined automatic advance payments.
I11(b) T3Reimbursements.G1T1 Recipients of nonconstruction grants or cooperative agreements shall request reimbursement on Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement (for reimbursement request under construction grants or cooperative agreements, see �1A3015.85).
I11(c) The frequency for submitting payment requests on SF�09270 is treated in �1A3015.104.

I80�1A3015.85
I89Outlay report and request for reimbursement for construction programs.
I11(a) T3Construction grants paid by reimbursement method.G1T1 (1) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants shall be submitted on Standard Form �70�271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Awarding agencies may, however, prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form specified in �1A3015.84 instead of this form.
I11(2) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated in �1A3015.104.
I11(b) T3Construction grants paid by letter of credit or Treasury check advance.G1T1 (1) When a construction grant or a cooperative agreement is paid by letter of credit or Treasury check advances, the recipient shall report its outlays to the awarding agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The awarding agency will provide any necessary special instructions. However, frequency and due date shall be governed by �1A3015.82 (c) and (d).
I11(2) When a construction grant or cooperative agreement is paid by Treasury check advances based on periodic requests from the recipient, the advances shall be requested on the form specified in �1A3015.84.
I11(3) The awarding agency may substitute the Financial Status Report specified in �1A3015.82 for the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement.
I11(c) T3Accounting basis.G1T1 The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by �1A3015.82(b).

I56Subpart K_Monitoring and Reporting Program Performance

I80�1A3015.90
I89Scope.
I11This subpart establishes procedures for monitoring and reporting program performance of recipients. These procedures place responsibility on recipients to manage the day-to-day operations of their grant and subgrant supported activities.

I80�1A3015.91
I89Monitoring by recipients.
I11Recipients shall monitor the performance of grant and subgrant-supported activities to assure that performance goals are being achieved. Recipient monitoring shall cover each program, function, or activity.

I80�1A3015.92
I89Performance reports.
I11(a) T3Nonconstruction.G1T1 The awarding agency shall, if it decides that performance information available from subsequent applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic needs, require the recipient to submit a performance report only upon expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the awarding agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial Status Report (as provided in �1A3015.82 (d) and (e)).
I11(1) Recipients shall submit annual peformance reports unless the awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports or unless covered under paragraph (a) of this section. Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The final performance report shall be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a recipient, the awarding agency may extend the due date for any performance report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports may be waived by the awarding agency.
I11(2) Performance reports shall contain, for each grant, brief information on the following:
I11(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the goals established for the period. Where the output of the project can be readily expressed in numbers, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required if that information will be useful.
I11(ii) The reasons for slippage if established goals were not met.
I11(iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
I11(3) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.
I11(4) Recipients shall adhere to the standards in paragraph (a) of this section in prescribing performance reporting requirements for subrecipients.
I11(b) T3Construction.G1T1 For the most part, on-site technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data �71�are relied on heavily by awarding agencies to monitor progress under construction grants and subgrants. The awarding agency shall require additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, and never more frequently than quarterly.

I80�1A3015.93
I89Significant developments.
I11Events may occur between the scheduled performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the recipient shall inform the awarding agency as soon as the following types of conditions become known:
I11(a) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure shall include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.
I11(b) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and goals sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more beneficial results than originally planned.

I80�1A3015.94
I89Site visits.
I11The awarding agency shall make site visits as frequently as practicable to:
I11(a) Review program accomplishments and manage control systems.
I11(b) Provide such technical assistance as may be required.

I80�1A3015.95
I89Waivers, extensions and enforcement actions.
I11(a) T3Reports from recipients.G1T1 USDA may waive any performance report required by this subpart if not needed.
I11(b) T3Reports from subrecipients.G1T1 The recipient may waive any performance report from a subrecipient when not needed. The recipient may extend the due date for any performance report from a subrecipient if the recipient will still be able to meet its performance reporting obligations to the USDA awarding agency.

I56Subpart L_Payment Requirements

I80�1A3015.100
I89Scope.
I11This subpart prescribes the basic standards and methods under which a USDA awarding agency will make grant payments to recipients, and recipients will make subgrant payments to their subrecipients.

I80�1A3015.101
I89General.
I11Methods and procedures for making payments to recipients shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and the recipient's disbursements.

I80�1A3015.102
I89Payment methods.
I11(a) T3Non-construction.G1T1 (1) Letters of credit will be used to pay USDA recipients when all the following conditions exist:
I11(i) There is or will be a continuing relationship between the recipient and the USDA awarding agency for at least a 12 month period and the total amount of advances to be received within that period from the awarding agency is $120,000 or more per year.
I11(ii) The recipient has established or demonstrated to the USDA awarding agency the willingness and ability to establish procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the Treasury and their disbursement by the recipient.
I11(iii) The recipient's financial management system meets the standards for fund control and accountability prescribed in Subpart H of this part.
I11(2) Advances by Treasury check will be used, in accordance with Treasury Circular No. 1075, when the recipient does not meet the requirements in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section but does meet the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section.
I11(3) Reimbursement by Treasury check shall be the preferred method when the recipient does not meet the requirements specified in either paragraph (a)(1)(ii) or paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section. This method may also be used when USDA financial assistance makes up only a minor portion of the program and where the major portion of the program is accomplished through private financing or Federal loans.
I11(b) T3Construction.G1T1 (1) Reimbursement by Treasury check shall be the preferred method when the recipient does not meet the requirements specified in �72��1A3015.102(a)(1) (ii) or (iii), and may be used for any USDA construction grant unless USDA has entered into an agreement with the recipient to use a letter of credit for all USDA grants, including construction grants.
I11(2) When the reimbursement by Treasury check method is not used, �1A3015.102(a) (1) and (2) shall apply to the construction grants. Implementing procedures under �1A3015.102(a) (1) and (2) will be the same for construction grants as for nonconstruction grants awarded to the same recipient, insofar as possible.
I11(3) USDA awarding agencies will not use the percentage-of-completion method to pay its construction grants. The recipient may use that method to pay its construction contractor, but if it does, USDA payments to the recipient will nevertheless be based on the recipient's actual rate of disbursements.

I80�1A3015.103
I89Withholding payments.
I11(a) Unless otherwise required by Federal statute, payments for proper charges incurred by recipients will not be withheld at any time during the grant period unless (1) the recipient has failed to comply with the program objectives, grant award conditions, or Federal reporting requirements, or (2) the recipient is indebted to the United States and collection of the indebtedness will not impair accomplishment of the objectives of any grant program sponsored by the United States, or (3) the grant is suspended pursuant to Subpart N of this part.
I11(b) Payments withheld for failure of a recipient to comply with reporting requirements, but without suspension of the grant, will be released to the recipient upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with Subpart N of this part. When a debt is to be collected, USDA awarding agencies may withhold payments or require appropriate accounting adjustments to recorded cash balances for which the recipient is accountable to the Federal government, in order to liquidate the indebtedness.

I80�1A3015.104
I89Requesting advances or reimbursements.
I11(a) T3Advances.G1T1 If advance payments are by Treasury check and are not prescheduled, the recipient shall submit its payment requests at least monthly. Less frequent requests are not permitted for they result in advances covering excessive periods of time. Recipient requests for advances shall not be made in excess of the Federal share of reasonable estimates of outlays for the month covered. These estimates shall be made on a cash basis, even if the recipient uses an accrual accounting system.
I11(b) T3Reimbursements.G1T1 If payments are made through reimbursement or by Treasury check:
I11(1) Requests for reimbursements may be submitted monthly or more frequently if authorized to do so by the awarding agency. Ordinarily, payment will be made within 30 days after receipt of a proper request for reimbursement.
I11(2) The recipient shall not request reimbursement for the Federal share of amounts withheld from contractors to ensure satisfactory completion of work until after it makes those payments.
I11(c) T3Forms.G1T1 The forms for requesting advances or reimbursements are identified in Subpart J of this part.

I80�1A3015.105
I89Payments to subrecipients.
I11Recipients shall observe the requirements of this subpart in making (or withholding) payments to subrecipients, with the following exceptions:
I11(a) Advance payment by Treasury check may be used instead of letter of credit;
I11(b) The forms specified in Subpart J of this part for requesting advances and reimbursements are not required to be used by subrecipients; and
I11(c) The reimbursement by check method may be used to pay any construction subgrant.

I56Subpart M_Programmatic Changes and Budget Revisions

I80�1A3015.110
I89Scope and applicability.
I11(a) T3Scope.G1T1 This subpart deals with prior approval requirements for post-�73�award programmatic changes and budget revisions by recipients.
I11(b) T3Exemption of mandatory or formula grants.G1T1 Sections 3015.113 through 3015.115 do not apply to programmatic changes or budget revisions made by recipients under State plans or other grants which the awarding agency is required by law to award if the applicant meets all applicable requirements for entitlement.
I11(c) T3Exemption of certain subgrants.G1T1 Sections 3015.113 through 3015.115 do not apply to subgrants from States to their local governments under a mandatory or formula grant, if the local government is not required to apply for the subgrant on a project basis. Generally, such exempt subgrants will occur under a State plan which provides for local administration of a State-wide program under State supervision.

I89Approval procedures.
I11(a) T3For grants or cooperative agreements.G1T1 When requesting a prior approval required by this subpart, recipients shall address their requests to the responsible official of the awarding agency. Approvals shall not be valid unless they are in writing and signed by either the responsible officer, the head of the awarding agency, or the head of the awarding agency's regional office.
I11(b) T3For subgrants.G1T1 Recipients shall be responsible for reviewing requests from their subrecipients for the approvals required by this subpart and for giving or denying the approval. A recipient shall not approve any action which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms of the Federal grant or cooperative agreement. If an action by a subrecipient will result in a change in the overall grant project or budget requiring approval from the awarding agency, the recipient shall obtain that approval before giving its approval to the subrecipient. Approvals shall not be valid unless they are in writing and signed by an authorized official of the recipient organization.
I11(c) T3Timing.G1T1 Within 30 days from the date of receipt of a request for approval, the approval authority shall review the request and notify the recipient of its decision. If the request for approval is still under consideration at the end of 30 days, the approval authority shall inform the recipient in writing as to when to expect the decision.

I80�1A3015.113 
I89Programmatic changes.
I11(a) T3Scope.G1T1 This section contains requirements for prior approval of departures, other than budget revisions, from approved project plans. In addition to the requirements in this section, awarding agencies may require prior approval for other kinds of programmatic changes to an approved cooperative agreement, grant, or subgrant project.
I11(b) T3Changes to project scope or objectives.G1T1 The recipient shall obtain prior approval for any change to the scope or objectives of the approved project. (For construction projects, any material change in approved space utilization or functional layout shall be considered a change in scope).
I11(c) T3Changes in key people.G1T1 This section applies to grants, subgrants, and cooperative agreements for research. This section does not apply to other types of grants, subgrants, or cooperative agreements unless other terms of the award make it apply. The recipient shall obtain prior approval:
I11(1) To continue the project during any continuous period of more than three months without the active direction of an approved project director or principal investigator;
I11(2) For its selection of a replacement for the project director of principal investigator;
I11(3) For its selection of a replacement for any other persons named and expressly designated as key project people in the grant, subgrant, or cooperative agreement award document; or
�74�I11(4) To permit the project director or principal investigator (or anyone covered by paragraph (c)(3) of this section) to devote substantially less effort to the project than was anticipated when the award was made.
I11(d) T3Transferring work and providing financial assistance to others.G1T1 Recipients shall obtain prior approval for transferring to another party the actual performance of the substantive programmatic work, and for providing any form of financial assistance to another party.
I11(e) T3Audiovisual activities.G1T1 (1) Except to the extent explicitly included in the project plan approved at the time of award, using grant support for any of the following requires prior approval: 
I11(i) Producing an audiovisual.
I11(ii) Buying ownership of any of the rights in the work embodied in the audiovisual. (This does not apply to merely buying a license in any of the rights. For the remainder of this section, buying ownership of the rights is referred to simply as buying or purchasing an audiovisual).
I11(iii) Presenting or distributing to the general public an audiovisual that was produced or bought with grant support. 
I11(2) Prior approval is not required for:
I11(i) Any audiovisual activity under a subgrant.
I11(ii) Any audiovisual whose direct production or purchase cost to the recipient is $5,000 or less.
I11(iii) The production or purchase of an audiovisual as a research instrument or for documenting experimentation or findings, if the audiovisual is not intended for presentation or distribution to the general public.
I11(3) Following are examples of presentation or distribution of an audiovisual to the general public.
I11(i) Broadcast on commercial, cable, or educational television, or radio.
I11(ii) Showing in commercial motion picture theaters.
I11(iii) Showing in public places such as airports, waiting rooms, bus or railroad depots, and vacation resorts.
I11(iv) Showing to civic associations, schools (except when used as a teaching tool in a classroom setting), clubs, fraternal organizations, or similar lay groups. 

I80�1A3015.114 
I89Budgets_general.
I11(a) T3Research and non-research project budgets.G1T1 For research and non-research projects which involve cost-sharing or matching, approved budgets shall ordinarily consist of a single set of figures covering total project cost (the sum of the awarding agency's share and the recipient's share). However, the awarding agency may specify that the recipient's share not be included in the approved budget. In no case, however, shall the approved budget be in the form of a separate set of figures for each share.
I11(b) T3Subdivision by programmatic segments.G1T1 Some grants, subgrants, and cooperative agreements contain two or more programmatic segments (such as discrete programs, projects, functions, or types of activities). In these cases, the awarding agency may require that the approved budget be subdivided to show the anticipated cost of each programmatic segment.

I80�1A3015.115
I89Budget revisions.
I11(a) T3Nonconstruction projects.G1T1 (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the recipient of a grant, subgrant, or cooperative agreement having an approved budget shall obtain prior approval for any budget revision which will:
I11(i) Involve transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or
I11(ii) Involve transfer of amounts previously budgeted for training allowances (direct payments to trainees), or
I11(iii) Result in a need for the award of additional funds, e.g., an increase in the base upon which indirect costs are calculated which will increase allocable indirect costs and result in a claim for a supplementary award.
I11(2) Any or all of the prior approval requirements in paragraph (a) of this section may be waived by the awarding agency.
I11(3) Except as provided in �1A3015.116 other budget changes under nonconstruction grants do not require approval.
I11(b) T3Construction projects.G1T1 Unless provided otherwise by the terms of the grant, subgrant, or cooperative agreement, revisions to construction project budgets do not require approval. 

�75�I80�1A3015.116
I89Construction and nonconstruction work under the same grant, subgrant, or cooperative agreement.
I11When a grant, subgrant, or cooperative agreement provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, the awarding agency may require prior approval for any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work. 

I56Subpart N_Grant and Subgrant Closeout, Suspension and Termination

I80�1A3015.120
I89Closeout.
I11(a) Each grant or subgrant shall be closed out as soon as possible after expiration or notice of termination.
I11(b) The following shall apply when closing out USDA grants:
I11(1) Upon request from the recipient, any allowable reimbursable cost not covered by previous payments shall be promptly paid by USDA.
I11(2) Any unobligated balance of cash advanced to the recipient shall be immediately refunded to the awarding agency or managed in accordance with USDA instructions.
I11(3) Within a maximum period of 90 days following the date of expiration or termination of a grant, all financial performance and related reports required by the terms of the agreement shall be submitted to the awarding agency by the recipient. USDA reserves the option of extending the due date for any report and may waive any report that it considers to be unnecessary.
I11(4) The provisions formally expressed and agreed to within the grant arrangement shall dictate the settlement of any upward or downward adjustments of the Federal share of costs.
I11(c)(1) A grant closeout shall not affect the retention period for, or Federal rights of access to, grant records. (See Subpart D of this part).
I11(2) The closeout of a grant does not affect the recipient's responsibilities regarding property under Subpart R of this part or with respect to any program income the recipient is still accountable for under Subpart F of this part.
I11(3) Final audits (See Attachment L, Circular A�09102 and Attachment K of Circular A�09110) are not a required part of the grant or subgrant closeout procedures. Normally, a final audit should not be needed unless there are problems with a grant or subgrant that require audit attention. If a USDA agency considers a final audit to be necessary, it shall contact the OIG Region within which the recipient or subrecipient is located and inform OIG of the situation. OIG shall be responsible for assuring that necessary final audits are performed and for any necessary coodination with other Federal cognizant audit agencies, recipients or State and local auditors. Audits performed in accordance with Subpart I may serve as final audits providing such audits meet the needs of the requesting agency. 
I11(4) If a grant is closed out without audit, the awarding agency reserves the right to disallow and recover an appropriate amount after fully considering any recommended disallowances resulting from an audit which may be conducted later.

I80�1A3015.121
I89Amounts payable to the Federal government.
I11The following outstanding sums for each grant shall be considered as a debt or debts owed by the recipient to the Federal government. They shall, if not paid upon demand, be subject to recovery by the awarding agency from the recipient or its successor or assignees by set off or other action provided by law:
I11(a) Any grant funds paid to the recipient by the Federal government which exceed the amount the recipient is finally determined to be entitled to under the provisions of the grant award;
I11(b) Any interest or other investment income earned on advances of grant funds which is due the Federal government; 
I11(c) Any royalties or other special classes of program income which, under the provisions of the grant award, are required to be returned to the Federal government;
I11(d) Any amount the Federal government is entitled to under Subpart R of this part; and 
�76�I11(e) Under the provisions of the grant award, any other amounts finally determined to be due to the Federal government.

I80�1A3015.122
I89Violation of terms.
I11(a) Whenever it is determined that the recipient has materially failed to comply with the provisons of the grant award, the awarding agency may suspend or terminate, in accordance with �1A3015.123 and 3015.124, any grant in whole, or in part, at any time before the date of completion, or take such other remedies as may be legally available and appropriate.
I11(b) A grant may be suspended or terminated in the current period for failure to submit a report still due from a prior period. This action is applicable when a project or program is supported over two or more funding periods.

I80�1A3015.123
I89Suspension.
I11(a) When a recipient has materially failed to comply with the provisions prescribed in the grant agreement, the awarding agency may, after reasonable notice to the recipient, suspend the grant in whole or in part. A suspension notice shall be issued by the awarding agency stating the reasons for the suspension, any corrective action required of the recipient, and the effective date. Suspension may go into effect immediately if the awarding agency deems it necessary to protect its interest and if a delayed effective date would be unreasonable considering the awarding agency's responsibilities to protect the Federal government's interest. Suspension shall remain in effect until the recipient has taken corrective action satisfactory to the awarding agency, or given evidence that such corrective action will be taken, or until the awarding agency terminates the grant.
I11(b) Unless specifically authorized by the awarding agency in the notice of suspension or subsequently expressed in an amendment to it, new obligations incurred by the recipient during the suspension period shall not be allowed. Necessary and otherwise allowable costs which the recipient could not reasonably avoid during the suspension period will be allowed, if they result from obligations properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of the suspension and not in anticipation of suspension or termination. If the awarding agency approves, third party in-kind contributions applicable to the suspension period may be allowed in satisfaction of cost-sharing or matching requirements.
I11(c) During the suspension period, appropriate adjustments to payments under the suspended grant will be made by not giving credit to the recipient for disbursements made in payment of unauthorized obligations incurred during the suspension period or by withholding subsequent payments.

I80�1A3015.124
I89Termination.
I11(a) T3Termination for cause.G1T1 The awarding agency may terminate any grant or other agreement in whole, or in part, at any time before the date of expiration, whenever it is determined that the recipient has materially failed to comply with the conditions of the agreement. The awarding agency shall promptly notify the recipient in writing of the determination and reasons for the termination, together with the effective date.
I11(b) T3Termination by mutual agreement.G1T1 Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, grants may be terminated in whole, or in part, only as follows:
I11(1) When the awarding agency and recipient agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.
I11(2) By written notification by the recipient to the awarding agency setting forth the reasons for termination, the effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. In the case of a partial termination, if the awarding agency decides that the remaining portion of the grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, the awarding agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either paragraph (a) or paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
I11(c) T3Termination settlements.G1T1 Upon termination of a grant, the recipient shall not incur any new obligations for the terminated portion of the agreement after the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as �77�possible. The awarding agency, however, shall allow full credit to the recipient for the Federal share of the non-cancellable obligations properly incurred by the recipient prior to termination.

I80�1A3015.125
I89Applicability to subgrants.
I11Recipient subgrants shall be subjected to the same standards regarding closeout, suspension, and termination of subgrants as prescribed in this subpart for awarding agencies.

I89Scope and applicability.
I11(a) This subpart prescribes forms and instructions to be used by governmental organizations (except hospitals, non-profit organizations, and institutions of higher education operated by a government) in applying to USDA for discretionary grants. This subpart is not applicable, however, to mandatory or formula grants or programs which do not require applicants to apply to USDA for funds on a project basis.
I11(b) This subpart permits awarding agencies to prescribe the form of applications by nongovernmental organizations (including hospitals, non-profit organizations and institutions of higher education operated by a government), but prescribes the use of a standard facesheet for certain of these applications.
I11(c) This subpart applies only to applications for grants or cooperative agreements and is not required to be applied by recipients in dealing with applicants for subgrants. However, recipients are encouraged not to adopt more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.
I11(d) This subpart also prescribes standards for competition to be used by USDA agencies in awarding discretionary cooperative agreements and grants. (This subpart is not applicable to cooperative agreements awarded pursuant to the provisions of sections 1472(b) and 1473C of the National Agricultural Research, Extension and Teaching Policy Act of 1977, as amended.)

I89Authorized forms. 
I11(a) Sections 3015.152 through 3015.156 specify the forms that governmental organizations shall use to apply to USDA for a discretionary grant.
I11(b) Governments need not submit more than the original and two copies of application forms. When less will suffice, the awarding agency shall notify potential applicants.
I11(c) When a government agency amends a previously submitted application or applies for additional funding (such as a continuation or supplemental award) only the facesheet and any other affected pages are required to be submitted. Previously submitted pages whose information is still current may be resubmitted, but are not required to be resubmitted.

I80�1A3015.152
I89Preapplication for Federal assistance.
I11(a) When a government submits a preapplication, it shall use the Preapplication for Federal Assistance form prescribed by Circular A�09102. The purposes of these preapplications shall be to:
I11(1) Establish communication between the potential applicant and the awarding agency;
I11(2) Determine the potential applicant's eligibility;
I11(3) Identify projects which have little or no chance for Federal funding before applicants incur significant costs for preparing an application.
I11(b) Preapplication is always required if the potential applicant is a government and the proposed project (1) is for construction, land acquisition, or land development, and (2) would require more than $100,000 of Federal funding. If these conditions are not present, potential applicants need not submit preapplications unless required to do so by the awarding agency. Any government may submit a preapplication even when not required.

�78�I80�1A3015.153
I89Notice of preapplication review action.
I11Awarding agencies shall inform governmental applicants of the results of their review of preapplications by using the Notice of Preapplication Review Action form prescribed by Circular A�09102. If the review cannot be completed within 45 days, the awarding agency shall inform the applicant, in writing, when it will complete the review.

I80�1A3015.154
I89Application for Federal assistance (nonconstruction programs).
I11Governments shall use the Application for Federal Assistance (Nonconstruction Programs) form prescribed by OMB Circular A�09102 in applying for discretionary grants unless a form specified in �1A3015.155 or �1A3015.156 is to be used.

I80�1A3015.155
I89Application for Federal assistance (construction programs). 
I11Governments shall use the Application for Federal Assistance (for Construction Programs) form prescribed by Circular A�09102 in applying for any grant whose purpose is solely or primarily construction, land acquisition, or land development.

I80�1A3015.156
I89Application for Federal assistance (short form). 
I11Governments shall use the Application for Federal Assistance (Short Form) form prescribed by Circular A�09102 in applying for any single-purpose, one-time grant of less than $10,000 not requiring Circular A�0995 clearinghouse review, an environmental impact statement, or the relocation of persons, businesses, or farms. Awarding agencies may, at their discretion, authorize or require this form for applications for larger amounts.

I80�1A3015.157
I89Authorized form for nongovernmental organizations.
I11Nongovernmental organizations shall use application forms prescribed by the awarding agency. The facesheet of these applications shall be Standard Form 424.

I80�1A3015.158
I89Competition in the awarding of discretionary grants and cooperative agreements. 
I11(a) T3Standards for competition.G1T1 Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, awarding agencies shall enter into discretionary grants and cooperative agreements only after competition. An awarding agency's competitive award process shall adhere to the following standards: 
I11(1) Potential applicants must be invited to submit proposals through publications such as the T4Federal Register,G1T1 professional trade journals, agency or program handbooks, the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, or any other appropriate means of solicitation. In so doing, awarding agencies should consider the broadest dissemination of project solicitations in order to reach the highest number of potential applicants. 
I11(2) Proposals are to be evaluated objectively by independent reviewers in accordance with written criteria set forth by the awarding agency. Reviewers should make written comments, as appropriate, on each application. Independent reviewers may be from the private sector, another agency, or within the awarding agency, as long as they do not include anyone who has approval authority for the applications being reviewed or anyone who might appear to have a conflict of interest in the role of reviewer of applications. A conflict of interest might arise when the reviewer or the reviewer's immediate family members have been associated with the applicant or applicant organization within the past two years as an owner, partner, officer, director, employee, or consultant; has any financial interest in the applicant or applicant organization; or is negotiating for, or has any arrangement, concerning prospective employment. 
I11(3) An unsolicited application, which is not unique and innovative, shall be competed under the project solicitation it comes closest to fitting. Awarding agency officials will determine the solicitation under which the application is to be evaluated. When the awarding agency official decides that the unsolicited application does not fall under a recent, current, or planned solicitation, a noncompetitive award �79�may be made, if appropriate to do so under the criteria of this section. Otherwise, the application should be returned to the applicant. 
I11(b) T3Project solicitations.G1T1 A project solicitation by the awarding agency shall include or reference the following, as appropriate: 
I11(1) A description of the eligible activities which the awarding agency proposes to support and the program priorities; 
I11(2) Eligible applicants; 
I11(3) The dates and amounts of funds expected to be available for awards; 
I11(4) Evaluation criteria and weights, if appropriate, assigned to each; 
I11(5) Methods for evaluating and ranking applications; 
I11(6) Name and address where proposals should be mailed and submission deadline(s); 
I11(7) Any required forms and how to obtain them; 
I11(8) Applicable cost principles and administrative requirements; 
I11(9) Type of funding instrument intended to be used (grant or cooperative agreement); and 
I11(10) The T3Catalog of Federal Domestic AssistanceG1T1 number and title. 
I11(c) T3Approval of applications.G1T1 The final decision to award is at the discretion of the awarding/approving official in each agency. The awarding/approving official shall consider the ranking, comments, and recommendations from the independent review group, and any other pertinent information before deciding which applications to approve and their order of approval. Any appeals by applicants regarding the award decision shall be handled by the awarding agency using existing agency appeal procedures or good administrative practice and sound business judgment. 
I11(d) T3Exceptions.G1T1 The awarding/approving official may make a determination in writing that competition is not deemed appropriate for a particular transaction. Such determination shall be limited to transactions where it can be adequately justified that a noncompetitive award is in the best interest of the Government and necessary to the accomplishment of the goals of the program. Reasons for considering noncompetitive awards may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: 
I11(1) Nonmonetary awards of property or services; 
I11(2) Awards of less than $75,000; 
I11(3) Awards to fund continuing work already started under a previous award; 
I11(4) Awards which cannot be delayed due to an emergency or a substantial danger to health or safety; 
I11(5) Awards when it is impracticable to secure competition; or 
I11(6) Awards to fund unique and innovative unsolicited applications.

I89Scope and applicability.
I11(a) Except as explained in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, this subpart applies to real property, equipment (including ADP) and supplies whose acquisition is supported by a grant.
I11(b) Also contained in this subpart are standards covering inventions, patents, and copyrights arising out of activities supported by a grant.
I11(c) This subpart does not apply to:
I11(1) Property for which only depreciation or use allowances are charged;
I11(2) Property donated entirely as a third party in-kind contribution; or
I11(3) Equipment or supplies acquired primarily for sale or rental, rather than for use.
I11(d) This subpart applies to equipment or supplies acquired by a contractor under a grant or subgrant only if, by terms of the contract, title vests in the recipient or subrecipient.
I11(e) For research grants that are subject to an institutional cost-sharing agreement, real property, equipment, and supplies shall be subject to this subpart only if at least some part of the acquisition cost is supported as a direct cost by Federal grant funds.

I80�1A3015.161 
I89Additional requirements.
I11Provided they observe the requirements of this subpart, recipients may follow their own property management policies and procedures. Unless specifically required by Federal statutes or Executive Orders, awarding agencies �80�may not impose on recipients property requirements (including property reporting requirements) not authorized by this subpart.

I80�1A3015.162 
I89Title to real property, equipment and supplies.
I11Subject to the obligations and conditions specified in this subpart, title to real property, equipment, and supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant shall vest, upon acquisition, in the recipient or subrecipient, respectively. In certain cases, money due the Federal government upon disposition of real property may be authorized to be used for allowable costs rather than paid to USDA. (See �1A3015.173.)

I80�1A3015.163 
I89Real property.
I11Except as stated otherwise by Federal statutes, real property applicable to this subpart shall be subject to the following requirements, in addition to any other requirements imposed by the provisions of the grant award:
I11(a) T3Use.G1T1 The property shall be used for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose. When no longer so needed, the awarding agency may approve the use of the property for other purposes. These uses shall be limited to:
I11(1) Projects or programs supported by other Federal grants or assistance agreements.
I11(2) Activities not supported by other Federal grants or assistance agreements but having purposes consistent with those of the legislation under which the original grant was made.
I11(b) T3Transfer of title.G1T1 In accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, approval may be requested from the awarding agency to transfer title to an eligible third party for continued use for authorized purposes. If approval is permissible under Federal statutes, and is given, the terms of the transfer shall provide that the transferee shall assume all the rights and obligations of the transferor set forth in this subpart or in other terms of the grant or subgrant.
I11(c) T3Disposition.G1T1 When the real property is no longer to be used as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the disposition instructions of the awarding agency shall be followed. Those instructions will provide for one of the following alternatives:
I11(1) The property shall be sold and the Federal government shall have a right to an amount computed by multiplying the Federal share of the property times the proceeds from sale (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). Proper sales procedures shall be followed which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
I11(2) The recipient shall have the option either of selling the property in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section or of retaining title. If title is retained, the Federal government shall have a right to an amount computed by multiplying the market value of the property by the Federal share of the property.
I11(3) The recipient shall transfer the title to either the Federal government or an eligible non-Federal party named by the awarding agency. The recipient shall be entitled to be paid an amount computed by multiplying the market value of the property by the non-Federal share of the property. In cases where the property belonged to a subrecipient, see �1A3015.172 for the subrecipient's share.

I80�1A3015.164
I89Statutory exemptions for equipment and supplies.
I11(a) In certain circumstances some Federal statutes permit title to equipment or supplies acquired with grant funds to vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal government or on such terms and conditions set forth in the grant award, as deemed appropriate. The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95�09224, is an example of such a statute. It provides this authority for equipment and supplies purchased with the funds of grants (and Federal contracts and cooperative agreements) for the conduct of basic or applied scientific research at non-profit institutions of higher education or at non-profit organizations whose primary purpose is the conduct of scientific research.
I11(b) If equipment is subject to a statute of the kind described in paragraph (a) of this section, it shall be exempt �81�from the requirements in the remaining sections of this subpart. However, when an equipment item has a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more, it shall be subject to �1A3015.165 concerning rights to require transfer, and, while subject to such a right, to the rules on replacement in �1A3015.167.
I11(c) If supplies are subject to a statute of the kind described in paragraph (a) of this section, they shall be exempt from all provisions of the remainder of this subpart which would otherwise apply.

I80�1A3015.165
I89Rights to require transfer of equipment.
I11(a) T3USDA right.G1T1 The awarding agency shall have the right to require the transfer of equipment (including title) for items of equipment having a unit cost of $1,000 or more to the Federal government or to an eligible non-Federal party named by the awarding agency. Normally, USDA agencies will only exercise this right if the project or program for which the equipment was acquired is transferred from one recipient to another. The following conditions shall govern this right:
I11(1) The property shall be appropriately identified in the grant award.
I11(2) In order for the awarding agency to exercise the right, disposition instructions must be issued no later than 120 days after the end of USDA grant support for the project or program for which the equipment was acquired. Furthermore:
I11(i) If the equipment is eligible for the exemptions in �1A3015.164 and ceases to be needed for the project or program for which it was acquired while the project or program is still being performed by the recipient, the disposition instructions must have been received by the recipient while the equipment was still needed for that project or program.
I11(ii) If the equipment is not eligible for those exemptions, disposition instructions must have been received by the recipient before other permissible disposition of the equipment took place in accordance with �1A3015.168.
I11(3) If the right is exercised, the recipient shall be entitled to be paid any reasonable, resulting shipping or storage costs incurred, plus an amount computed by multiplying the market value of the equipment by the non-Federal share of the equipment.
I11(b) T3Right of parties awarding subgrants.G1T1 A recipient may reserve for itself, when awarding a subgrant, rights similar to those found in paragraph (a) of this section which covers items of equipment having a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more which are acquired under that subgrant. Without the approval of the awarding agency, the right may be exercised only if the project or program for which the equipment was acquired is transferred to another subrecipient and only for the purpose of transferring the equipment to the new subrecipient for continued use in the project or program.
I11(c) T3Equipment lists.G1T1 If at any time an awarding agency is considering exercising its right to require transfer of equipment, it may require the recipient to furnish it with a list of all items of equipment that are subject to the right. As such, the awarding agency will decide which items, if any, should be transferred.

I80�1A3015.166
I89Use of equipment.
I11(a) T3Basic rule.G1T1 Whenever the equipment is not transferred under the provisions set forth in �1A3015.165, it shall be used by the recipient in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When the equipment is no longer needed for the original project or program the recipient shall use the equipment, if needed, in other projects or programs currently or previously funded by the Federal government, in the following order of priority:
I11(1) Projects or programs currently or previously funded by the same USDA awarding agency.
I11(2) Projects or programs currently or previously funded by any USDA awarding agency.
I11(3) Projects or programs currently or previously funded by other Federal agencies.
I11(b) T3Shared use.G1T1 When equipment is used less than full time in the original project or program, the recipient shall make it available for use in other �82�projects or programs currently or previously funded by the Federal government. Provided, such other use will not interfere with the work on the original project or program. First preference for such use, however, shall be given to other projects or programs funded by the same USDA awarding agency.
I11(c) T3Use by other recipients.G1T1 When the recipient can no longer use the equipment as required by paragraph (a) of this section, it may voluntarily make the equipment available for use on projects or programs currently or previously funded by the Federal government which the recipient is supporting through subgrants or through non-Federal grants. A subrecipient may also voluntarily make the equipment available for use in projects or programs currently or previously funded by the Federal government which are being conducted or supported by the recipient.
I11(d) T3Other uses.G1T1 Unless the awarding agency provides otherwise, while equipment is being used as described in the preceding paragraphs of this section, it may also be used part-time for other purposes. The use as described in the previous paragraphs, however, shall be given priority over other uses.

I80�1A3015.167 
I89Replacement of equipment.
I11(a) If needed, equipment may be exchanged for replacement equipment. Replacement of equipment may be done either through trade-in or through sale and application of the proceeds to the acquisition cost of replacement equipment. In either case, the transaction must be one which a prudent person would make in like circumstances.
I11(b) If an additional outlay to acquire the replacement equipment is charged as a direct cost to either Federal funds or required cost-sharing or matching under a Federal award, the replacement equipment shall be subject to whatever property requirements or exemptions are applicable to that award. If the award is a grant from USDA, the full acquisition cost of the replacement equipment shall determine which provisions of this subpart apply.
I11(c) For any replacement not covered by paragraph (b) of this section, the provisions of this subpart applicable to the equipment replaced shall carry over to the replacement equipment. None of the provisions of this subpart shall carry over if (1) the Federal share of the equipment replaced was 10 percent or less or (2) the product of that share times the amount received for trade-in or sale is $100 or less. 

I80�1A3015.168 
I89Disposal of equipment.
I11When original or replacement equipment is no longer to be used in projects or programs currently or previously sponsored by the Federal government, disposal of the equipment shall be made as follows:
I11(a) Equipment with a unit acquisition cost of less than $1,000 may be sold, retained or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the Federal government.
I11(b) All other equipment may be retained or sold. The Federal government shall have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by the Federal share of the equipment (see �1A3015.172). If part of the Federal share of the equipment came from an award under which the exemptions in �1A3015.164 were applicable, the amount due shall be reduced pro rata. In any case, if the equipment is sold, $100 or 10 percent of the total sales proceeds, whichever is greater, may be deducted and retained from the amount otherwise due for selling and handling expenses. If the recipient's project or program for which or under which the equipment was acquired is still receiving grant support from the same Federal program and if the awarding agency approves, the net amount due may be used for allowable costs of that project or program. Otherwise, the net amount must be returned to the awarding agency by check or money order. 

I80�1A3015.169 
I89Equipment management requirements.
I11Recipient procedures for managing equipment shall, as a minimum, meet the following requirements (including replacement equipment) until such actions as transfer, replacement or disposal takes place:
I11(a) Property records shall be maintained accurately. (Subpart D of this �83�part contains retention and access requirements for these records.) The records shall include for each item of equipment the following:
I11(1) A description of the equipment including manufacturer's serial numbers.
I11(2) An identification number, such as the manufacturer's serial number.
I11(3) Identification of the grant under which the recipient acquired the equipment.
I11(4) The information needed to calculate the Federal share of the equipment (see �1A3015.172).
I11(5) Acquisition date and unit acquisition cost.
I11(6) Location, use and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.
I11(7) All pertinent information on the ultimate transfer, replacement, or disposal of the equipment.
I11(b) Every two years, at a minimum, a physical inventory shall be conducted and the results reconciled with the property records to verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment. Any discrepancies between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the differences.
I11(c) In order to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage or theft of equipment, a control system shall be used. Any loss, damage or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented. The awarding agency may require a report of the circumstances involving the loss, damage, or theft of equipment.
I11(d) In order to keep the equipment in good condition, adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented.
I11(e) Where equipment is to be sold and the Federal government is to have a right to part or all of the proceeds, selling procedures shall be established which will provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

I80�1A3015.170
I89Damage, loss, or theft of equipment.
I11(a) T3Applicability.G1T1 This section applies to equipment with a unit acquisition cost of $1,000 or more that, before disposal (see �1A3015.168), is damaged beyond repair, lost, or stolen.
I11(b) T3Recipient at fault_G1T1(1) T3Applicability.G1T1 This paragraph applies if:
I11(i) At the time of the damage, loss, or theft, the recipient does not have a control system in effect as required by �1A3015.169, and
I11(ii) The damage, loss, or theft is not due to an act of God.
I11(2) T3Equipment replaced.G1T1 If the equipment is replaced, the replacement is governed by �1A3015.167. When that happens, the market value of the original equipment at the time it was damaged, lost, or stolen is used instead of the amount received for trade-in or sale.
I11(3) T3Equipment not replaced.G1T1 If the equipment is not replaced, the Federal government has a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the Federal share in the equipment by its market value at the time of damage, loss, or theft. The amount is reduced pro rata if part of the Federal share of the equipment comes from an award under which the exemption in �1A3015.164 applied.
I11(4) T3Other remedies.G1T1 The provisions in this paragraph (b) are in addition to other remedies available to the awarding agency if a recipient acquires equipment with grant support but fails to establish the control system required by �1A3015.169.
I11(c) T3Recipient not at fault_G1T1(1) T3Applicability.G1T1 This paragraph applies if:
I11(i) At the time of the damage, loss, or theft, the recipient does have a control system in effect as required by �1A3015.169(c) or
I11(ii) The damage, loss, or theft is due to an act of God.
I11(2) T3Recipient not compensated.G1T1 If the recipient is not compensated for the damage, loss, or theft, through insurance or some other means, there is no obligation to USDA for the equipment.
I11(3) T3Recipient compensated.G1T1 If the recipient is compensated for the damage, loss, or theft and replaces the equipment, �1A3015.167 applies to the replacement equipment. If the recipient is compensated but does not replace the equipment, �1A3015.168 applies as though the recipient had sold the equipment. (All of �1A3015.168 applies including the rule permitting the amount due the Federal government to be reduced by 10 �84�percent of the proceeds or $100, whichever is greater.) The amount received for trade-in or sale is considered the lesser of (i) the amount of compensation or (ii) the market value of the equipment at the time it was damaged, lost, or stolen.
I11(d) T3Waivers.G1T1 The awarding agency may waive in whole or in part any provision of this section. 

I80�1A3015.171
I89Unused supplies.
I11(a) If unused supplies exceeding $1,000 in total aggregate market value are left over upon termination or expiration of the grant or subgrant for which they were acquired and the supplies are not needed for any project or program currently or previously funded by the Federal government, the grant shall be credited by an amount computed by multiplying the Federal share of the supplies times the current market value or, if the supplies are sold, the proceeds from sale. If the supplies are sold, 10 percent of the proceeds may be deducted and retained from the credit, for selling and handling expenses.
I11(b) For possible exemptions from this section, see �1A3015.164.

I80�1A3015.172
I89Federal share of real property, equipment, and supplies. 
I11This subpart contains principles necessary to determine the Federal (or non-Federal) share of real property, equipment or supplies.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 (1) Except as explained in the following paragraphs of this section, the Federal share of the property shall be the same percentage as the Federal share of the acquiring party's total cost under the grant during the grant or subgrant year (or other funding period) to which the acquisition cost of the property was charged. For this purpose, ``costs under the grant'' means allowable costs which are either supported by the grant or counted toward satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of the grant.
I11(2) If the property is acquired by a subrecipient, the Federal share of the subrecipient's costs under the grant and hence of the property shall be calculated by multiplying the Federal share of the recipient's costs by the latter's share of the subrecipient's costs. (For example, if the Federal share of the recipient's costs is 50 percent and the subgrant bears only 50 percent of a subrecipient's costs, then the Federal share of that subrecipient's costs (and of the property acquired by that subrecipient) is 25 percent.)
I11(3) The provisions of some grant awards set different maximum percentages of Federal financial participation for different categories of costs. In these cases, for the purposes of this section, the costs in each category are considered as costs under a separate grant. If two categories have the same maximum percentage of Federal participation and costs in one category are permitted to count toward satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of the other, they are a single category for the purposes of this rule. Also, all categories with a 100 percent rate are considered a single category for the purposes of this rule.
I11(b) T3Property acquired only partly under a grant.G1T1 (1) Sometimes only a part of the acquisition cost of an item of property is supported as a direct cost by the grant or counted as a direct cost towards a cost-sharing or matching requirement. Occasionally, the amount paid for the property is only a part of its value. The remainder is donated as an in-kind contribution by the party that provided the property.
I11(2) To determine the Federal share of such property, first calculate the Federal share of the acquiring party's total costs under the grant as explained in paragraph (a) of this section. Next multiply that share by the percentage of the property's acquisition cost (or its market value, if the item was partly donated) which was supported as a direct cost by the grant or counted as a direct cost towards a cost-sharing or matching requirement.
I11(c) T3Replacement equipment.G1T1 To calculate the Federal share of replacement equipment the following procedures shall be followed:
I11(1) T3Step 1:G1T1 Determine the Federal share (percentage) of the equipment replaced.
I11(2) T3Step 2:G1T1 Determine the percentage of the replacement equipment's costs that was covered by the amount received for trade-in or the sale proceeds from the equipment replaced.
�85�I11(3) T3Step 3:G1T1 Multiply the step 1 percentage by the step 2 percentage.
I11(4) T3Step 4:G1T1 If an additional outlay for the replacement equipment was charged as a direct cost either to USDA grant funds or to required cost-sharing or matching funds, calculate the Federal share attributable to that additional outlay as explained in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Add that additional percentage to the step 3 percentage.

I80�1A3015.173
I89Using or returning the Federal share.
I11(a) This section applies when, under �1A3015.163, 3015.168 or 3015.170, the Federal government has a right to an amount of money upon disposal or loss, theft, or damage of property.
I11(b) If the recipient's project or program for which the property was acquired is still receiving grant support from the same Federal program, the awarding agency may authorize use of the net money due for allowable costs of that project or program.
I11(c) Otherwise, the net amount must be returned to the awarding agency by check or money order.

I80�1A3015.174
I89Subrecipient's share.
I11Where this subpart requires a sharing of the market value or sale proceeds of property acquired under a subgrant, the non-Federal share shall be proportionally divided between the recipient and the subrecipient. The subrecipient shall be entitled to the amount it would have received or retained if the award to it had been made directly by the Federal government. The remainder of the non-Federal share shall belong to the recipient.

I80�1A3015.175 
I89Intangible personal property.
I11(a) T3Inventions and Patents.G1T1 (1) If the recipient is a small business or nonprofit organization (including universities and other institutions of higher education), the allocation of rights in inventions produced under a grant or cooperative agreement shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of sections 200 through 206 of Pub. L. 96�09517 (35 U.S.C. 200�09206) and OMB Circular A�09124.
I11(2) For all other recipients, the allocation of rights in inventions shall be determined in accordance with the ``Government Patent Policy'' (President's Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, February 18, 1983) and OMB Circular A�09124.
I11(b) T3Copyrights_G1T1(1) T3Applicability.G1T1 This section applies to the copyright in any original work of authorship prepared with grant support. Additionally, if ownership of a copyright or of any of the exclusive rights comprising a copyright are purchased with grant support, this section applies to the purchased copyright or rights.
I11(2) T3Basic rules.G1T1 (i) USDA reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to exercise, and to authorize others to exercise, the rights for Federal Government purposes. Subject to this license, the owner is free to exercise, preserve, or transfer all its rights. The recipient shall ensure that no agreement is entered into for transferring the rights which would conflict with the nonexclusive license of USDA.
I11(ii) One way that USDA may exercise its nonexclusive license is to authorize exercise of the rights in another project or activity that receives or has received grant support from the Federal Government.
I11(iii) A recipient awarding a subgrant is allowed to impose subgrant terms reserving a nonexclusive license for itself, similar to the one reserved by this section for USDA, with respect to any copyright or rights subject to this section that arise under the subgrant.

I80�1A3015.183
I89Access to contractor records.
I11The Attachment 0 requires recipients to include in specified kinds of contracts a provision for access to the contractor's records by the recipient and the Federal government. The following applies to the provision:
I11(a) The provision must require the contractor to place the same provision in any subcontract which would have to have the provision were it awarded by the recipient.
I11(b) The provision must require retention of records for three years after final payment is made under the contract or subcontract and all pending matters are closed. The provision must also require that, if any audit, litigation, or other action involving the records is started before the end of the three year period, the records must be retained until all issues arising out of the action are resolved or until the end of the three year period, whichever is later.
I11(c) In contracts and subcontracts under a subgrant, the provision must require that access to the records be provided to the recipient as well as the subrecipient and the Federal government.

I80�1A3015.184

I11(b) If construction is to be assisted by a grant or subgrant, the Executive Order and the Department of Labor supplementing regulations apply, unless an exemption is granted by or under those regulations. Recipients shall observe all applicable requirements of the Order and regulations and include in their nonexempt construction contracts the specific clauses prescribed by 41 CFR 60�091.4(b) and, if applicable, 41 CFR 60�094.3.

�87�I56Subpart T_Cost Principles

I80�1A3015.190
I89Scope.
I11This subpart makes the allowable costs incurred by the recipient the maximum amount of money a recipient is entitled to receive from USDA. In addition, this subpart identifies the principles to be used in determining allowable costs. These cost principles shall apply to transactions and activities conducted under grants, subgrants, cooperative agreements, cost-type contracts and cost-type subcontracts under grants.
I11(a) T3Allowable costs.G1T1 Grant funds may be used only for allowable costs of the activities for which the grant was awarded. This means that the total amount of money that the recipient is entitled to receive from USDA may not exceed the allowable costs incurred by the recipient for those activities.
I11(b) The following rules apply in computing maximum allowable costs:
I11(1) T3Third party in-kind contributions.G1T1 Because they are not allowable costs of the party that receives them, the value of third party in-kind contributions received may not be included in determining maximum allowable costs. However, as provided in Subpart G of this part, third party in-kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of the Federal grant.
I11(2) T3Costs supported by another grant.G1T1 Allowable costs incurred by the recipient and supported by another Federal grant (or by a non-Federal grant) awarded to the recipient may not be included in determining maximum allowable costs. The basic intent of this rule is to prevent double compensation. It does not, however, prevent proration of costs that are allowable under two or more awards.
I11(3) T3Costs used to match another Federal grant.G1T1 A cost that the recipient uses to meet a cost-sharing or matching requirement of one Federal grant may not count towards determining maximum allowable costs under another Federal grant, unless specifically authorized by a Federal statute.
I11(4) T3Costs supported by general program income.G1T1 A grant may not pay for a cost which is supported by general program income earned by the recipient or by a subrecipient under the grant. Therefore, these costs may not be included in determining maximum allowable costs. 
I11(5) T3Use of money due Federal government.G1T1 In accordance with �1A3015.173, an awarding agency, under certain circumstances, may authorize a recipient to use certain money due the Federal government for allowable costs of the project or programs, instead of returning the money to the Federal Government. Costs supported by the money may not be included as part of the maximum allowable costs charged to USDA.
I11(6) T3Subgrant and contract costs.G1T1 The recipient's allowable costs include allowable outlays, if any, to its subrecipients and contractors. If the recipient pays a subrecipient more than the allowable costs incurred by the subrecipient, the excess is not an allowable cost of the recipient and may not be included as part of the maximum allowable costs charged to USDA. However, for cost-type contracts a reasonable fee or profit paid by the recipient to the contractor, in addition to the contractor's allowable costs, may be included in this maximum unless prohibited by the provisions of the grant award.

I80�1A3015.191
I89Governments.
I11(a) OMB Circular No. A�0987, and any subsequent amendments to this Circular published in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1 by OMB, shall be used in determining the allowable costs of activities conducted by governments.
I11(b) Additional amendments to the Circular, unless otherwise prescribed by OMB, shall go into effect at the start of a government's first fiscal year following the amendment's publication in the T4Federal Register.G1T1

I80�1A3015.192
I89Institutions of higher education.
I11(a) OMB Circular No. A�0921, including any amendments to the Circular published in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1 by OMB, shall be used in determining the allowable costs of activities conducted by institutions of higher education (other than for-profit institutions).
I11(b) Additional amendments to the Circular, unless otherwise prescribed by OMB, shall go into effect at the start of an institution's first fiscal �88�year following the amendment's publication in the T4Federal Register.G1T1

I80�1A3015.193
I89Other non-profit organizations.
I11(a) OMB Circular No. A�09122, including any subsequent amendments to the Circulars published in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1 by OMB, shall be used in determining the allowable costs of activities conducted by nonprofit organizations under grants, cooperative agreements, cost reimbursement contracts, and other contracts in which costs are used in pricing, administration, or settlement. It does not apply to colleges or universities which are covered by Circular A�0921; State, local and federally recognized Indian Tribal governments which are covered by Circular A�0987, or hospitals.
I11(b) Future amendments to the Circular, unless otherwise prescribed by OMB, shall go into effect at the time the initial award is made to the recipient.

I80�1A3015.194 
I89For-profit organizations.
I11The principles to be used when determining the allowable costs of activities conducted by for-profit organizations are contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 48 CFR Subpart 31.2. Exception: Independent research and development costs including any indirect costs allocable to them are unallowable. Independent research and development are defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation at 48 CFR 31.205�0918.

I80�1A3015.195
I89Subgrants and cost-type contracts.
I11USDA cost principles applicable to a cost-type contractor or a subrecipient will not necessarily be the same as those applicable to the recipient. For example, where a State government awards a subrecipient or cost-type contract to an institution of higher education, OMB Circular A�0921 would apply to the costs incurred by the institution of higher education even though OMB Circular A�0987 would apply to the costs incurred by the State.

I80�1A3015.196
I89Costs allowable with approval.
I11Each set of cost principles specifically identifies certain costs that, in order to be allowable, must be approved by the awarding agency. Other costs do not require approval. The following procedures govern approval of these costs:
I11(a) When costs are allocated in accordance with a government-wide cost allocation plan or when treated as indirect costs, acceptance of the costs as part of the indirect cost rate or cost allocation plan shall constitute approval.
I11(b)(1) All direct costs must be approved in advance by the awarding agency.
I11(2) When costs are specified in the budget, approval of the budget shall constitute approval of the cost.
I11(3) Specific prior approval in writing from the awarding agency is required if the costs are not specified in the budget, or if there is no approved budget. For this purpose the prior approval procedures of Subpart M shall be followed, except that, for formula or mandatory grants, the awarding agency's written approval may be signed by any authorized official of the awarding agency.
I11(c) The awarding agency may waive or conditionally waive the requirement for its approval of the costs. A waiver, as such, shall be applicable only to the requirement for approval. If it is determined, by audit or otherwise, that the costs do not meet other requirements or tests for allowability specified by the applicable cost principles, such as reasonableness and necessity, the costs may be disallowed.
I11(d) In the case of subgrants and cost-type contracts, no approval shall be given which is inconsistent with the purpose or the provisions of the Federal grant.

I89Use of consultants. 
I11(a) T3Definition.G1T1 Appendix A defines ``consultant.'' 
I11(b) T3Applicability.G1T1 This section applies only to the use of consultants whose fees are supported by a grant, subgrant, or cost-type contract. 
I11(c) T3Basic policy_G1T1(1) T3Prior approval.G1T1 Awarding agencies shall not require prior approval for the use of consultants. 
I11(2) T3Exceptions.G1T1 (i) In unusual cases, using a consultant may constitute a transfer of substantive programmatic work, which requires prior approval under discretionary grants. 
I11(ii) Consulting fees paid by an organization to its own employees require prior approval. 
I11(d) T3Use of an organization's own employees_G1T1(1) T3Faculty members of education institutions.G1T1 Charges representing extra compensation (above base salary) paid by an educational institution to a salaried member of its faculty for consulting work are allowable only in unusual cases, and only if both of the following conditions exist: 
I11(i) The consultation is across departmental lines or involves a separate or remote operation; and 
I11(ii) The work performed by the consultant is in addition to his or her regular departmental load. 
I11(2) T3All other cases.G1T1 In all other cases, consulting fees paid in addition to salary by recipients or cost-type contractors to people who are also their employees may be supported by a grant, subgrant, or cost-type contract only in unusual cases, and only if all of the following three conditions exist: 
I11(i) The policies of the recipient or contractor permit such consulting fee payments to its own employees regardless of whether Federal grant funds are involved; 
I11(ii) The work involved is clearly outside the scope of the person's salaried employment; and 
I11(iii) It would be inappropriate or not feasible to compensate for the additional work by paying additional salary to the employee. 
I11(3) T3Requirement for approval.G1T1 Consulting fees paid under this section must have a specific prior approval in writing from the Head of the recipient or contractor or from his or her designated representative. If the recipient or contractor is a government, the approval may be given by the Head (or a designated representative of the Head) of the government agency which is primarily responsible for administering or carrying out the project or program. If the designated representative is personally involved in the project or program under consideration, the approval may be given only by the Head. If the Head is personally involved in the project or program under consideration, prior approval from the awarding agency is required. Such prior approval must include a determination that the applicable requirements in paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section are present. 
I11(e) T3Documentation standards.G1T1 (1) Charges for consulting payments must be supported in the records of the recipient or cost-type contractor by an invoice from the consultant and a copy of the written report (if a report is appropriate) or other documented evidence of the work performed from the consultant. 
I11(2) If any of the following information is not shown on the invoice and/or �90�report from the consultant, the information must be shown in a memorandum or other document prepared by the recipient or contractor for its files, or noted in handwriting on the consultant's invoice by the recipient or contractor. The memorandum, other document, or handwritten notation must be signed by an official of the recipient or contractor and show: 
I11(i) The name of the consultant; 
I11(ii) The nature of the services provided (such as statistical analysis of data, participation on project advisory committee, or specified medical services to eligible beneficiaries); 
I11(iii) The relevance of the services to the project or program, if not apparent from the nature of the services; and 
I11(iv) Whichever of the following is applicable: 
I11(A) (If the fee was based on a rate per day or hours worked) the rate and the dates and/or hours worked; 
I11(B) (If the fee was based on a rate per unit of service provided, such as the number of patients examined by a physician) the rate, the number of units of service provided, and the beginning and ending dates of the overall period of service; or

I89Federal Register publications.
I11(a) T3Program regulations.G1T1 Most grant programs have program-specific regulations, which are published in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1 and codified in the T3Code of Federal Regulations.G1T1 In some cases the program-specific regulations are promulgated in the form of agency directives or manuals which may be obtained from the awarding agency.
I11(b) T3Program announcements.G1T1 For each program, the awarding agency may publish in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1 one or more program announcements. Program announcements invite applications for one or more stated program objectives. They include at least the following information:
I11(1) An estimate of how much money will be available for competing awards, and the expected size of the awards, broken down by subprogram or priority area when appropriate;
I11(2) Who is eligible;
I11(3) How to obtain application kits;
I11(4) Where to submit applications; and
I11(5) The deadline for submitting applications.
I11(c) T3Cooperative agreements.G1T1 If any or all of the awards are likely to be cooperative agreements rather than grants, the program announcement so states. In that case, if feasible, the program announcement also describes the anticipated substantial Federal involvement in performance. (This paragraph does not prevent the award of cooperative agreements under a program announcement that mentioned only grants. Nor does it prevent the award of grants under a program announcement that mentioned only cooperative agreements.)
I11(d) T3Evaluation criteria.G1T1 The awarding agency publishes its criteria for evaluating grant applications either in the program regulations or the program announcement. If the criteria are not all equal in importance, their relative �91�weights are also published. The criteria cover at least the following factors (except where the nature of the eligible projects makes one or more of these factors irrelevant):
I11(1) How well qualified the project's personnel will be;
I11(2) The adequacy of the applicant's facilities and resources;
I11(3) The adequacy of the project plan or methodology;
I11(4) The cost-effectiveness of the project; and
I11(5) How closely the project objectives fit the objectives for which applications were invited.
I11(e) T3Funding priorities.G1T1 If the awarding agency will give priority to one or more particular kinds of projects, the priority (and how it will be applied in deciding which applications to fund) is described in the program announcement.
I11(f) T3Competing continuations vs. ``new'' projects.G1T1 If the awarding agency will give a preference to competing continuation applications over applications for projects not already receiving support under the program, or vice versa, the preference is described in the program announcement.
I11(g) T3Programs with few potential applicants.G1T1 In some programs the number of potential applicants is relatively small. (For example, in some programs only the States are eligible.) In these situations the awarding agency may send a copy of the program announcement directly to every potential applicant instead of publishing it in the T4Federal Register.G1T1
I11(h) T3Register_Other information which is available.G1T1 In addition to the items specified above, each awarding Agency makes available to the public the following information and materials for each program:
I11(1) A copy of, or reference to, the authorizing statutes for the program;
I11(2) All guidelines of general applicability for administration of the program;
I11(3) A description of the procedures the awarding agency will use for evaluating applications; and
I11(4) Any other information that the awarding agency believes will be helpful.
I11(i) T3Consulting with applicants.G1T1 Each awarding agency publishes as much information as practicable to reduce the need for consultation by applicants. If the awarding agency does provide consultation, its staff members try to give consistent interpretations and fair treatment to all requestors.

I21Section IT3``Grant'' and ``Cooperative Agreement''G1T1
Q02
I21(a) ``Grant'' unless qualified by ``non-Federal'' means an award by the Federal government of money, property instead of money, services, or anything of value, to the State or other recipient, with the following characteristics:
I21(1) The principal purpose of the award is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute, rather than acquisition, by purchase, lease, or barter, of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal government; and
I21(2) At the time the award is made, no substantial involvement is anticipated between the executive agency, acting for the Federal government, and the State or local government or other recipient during performance of the contemplated activity.
I21(b) ``Cooperative agreement'' has the same meaning as ``grant,'' except that, at the time a cooperative agreement is awarded, substantial involvement is anticipated between the executive agency, acting for the Federal government, and the State or local government or other recipient during performance of the contemplated activity.
I21(c) ``Grants'' and ``cooperative agreements'' do not include technical assistance, which provides services instead of money; revenue sharing; loans; loan guarantees; capital contributions to loan funds; interest subsidies; insurance; or direct appropriations. (See the definition of ``Non-Federal grant'' in Section II of this appendix.)
Q02
I21Section IIT3Other Definitions.G1T1
Q02
I21``Acquisition'' of property includes purchase, construction, or fabrication of property. It does not include rental of property or alterations and renovations of real property.
I21``Acquisition cost'' of an item of purchased equipment means the net invoice price of the equipment. It includes the cost of modifications, attachments, accessories, or auxiliary apparatus necessary to make the equipment useable for the purpose for which it was acquired. Other charges, such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty, or protective in-transit insurance shall be included in or excluded from the unit acquisition cost in accordance with the regular accounting practices of the organization purchasing the equipment.
I21If an item of equipment is acquired by trading in another item and paying an additional amount, ``acquisition cost'' means the amount received for trade-in plus the additional outlay. (See the definition of ``amount received for trade-in.'')
I21For purposes of the rules on equipment and supplies, ``acquisition cost'' of a copy of a work of authorship (such as a book, print of a motion picture, or tape of a television program) refers to the cost of fabricating or purchasing the individual copy, considered as a material object. It does not include the cost of developing, or acquiring rights to, the work embodied in the copy.
I21``Advance by Treasury check'' is a payment made by a Treasury check to a recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement, before payments are made by the recipient of the grant or cooperative agreement. Advances by Treasury check are based on either a periodic request from the recipient or a predetermined payment schedule.
I21``Amount received for trade-in'' of an item of equipment traded in for replacement equipment means the amount that would have been paid for the replacement equipment without a trade-in, minus the amount paid with the trade-in. The term refers to the actual difference, not necessarily the trade-in value, shown on an invoice. For example, suppose that a recipient can buy a new machine for $5,000 in cash. The recipient actually buys this machine by trading in a used machine and paying $3,000 in cash. In this case, the amount received for trade-in �98�would be $2,000 ($5,000 minus $3,000) regardless of the trade-in allowance shown on the invoice.
I21``Approved budget'' means a budget (including any revised budget) which has been approved in writing by the awarding agency. (See the definition of ``budget.'')

I21``Budget'' means the recipient's financial expenditure plan approved by the awarding agency to carry out the purposes of the Federally-supported project. The budget is comprised of both the Federal share and any non-Federal share of such plan and any subsequent authorized rebudgeting of funds.
I21For those programs that do not involve Federal approval of the non-Federal share of costs, such as research grants, the term ``budget'' means the financial expenditure plan approved by the awarding agency including any subsequent authorized rebudgeting of funds, for the use of Federal funds only. Any expenditures charged to an approved budget consisting of Federal and non-Federal shares are deemed to be supported by the grant in the same proportion as the percentage of Federal/non-Federal participation in the overall budget.
I21``Budget period'' means the period specified in the grant or cooperative agreement during which Federal funds awarded are authorized to be expended, obligated, or firmly committed by the recipient for the purposes specified in the agreement.
I21``Closeout'' of a grant or cooperative agreement means the process by which an awarding agency determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required work of the grant or cooperative agreement have been completed by the recipient and the awarding agency.
I21``Consultant'' means a person who gives advice or services for a fee, but not as an employee. The term includes guest speakers when not acting as employees of the party that engages them.

I21``Contract'' means a procurement contract awarded under a grant, cooperative agreement, or subgrant; and ``subcontract'' means a procurement subcontract under such a contract. Procurement contracts and subcontracts are ones which place the parties in a buyer-seller relationship, regardless of the label used by the parties to describe the relationship (e.g., purchase-of-service agreement). The terms ``contract'' and ``subcontract'' do not include any agreements between organizational components of the same legal entity, even if one of the components provides property or services to or for the other. (See definitions of ``subgrant,'' ``cost-type contract,'' and ``fixed price contract.'')
I21``Cost-sharing'' and ``matching'' each mean the value of third party in-kind contributions plus that portion of the allowable costs of recipients not supported by the Federal Government. (The terms ``cost-sharing'' and ``matching,'' in this part, are synonymous.)
I21``Cost-type contract'' means a contract or subcontract in which the contractor or subcontractor is paid on the basis of the costs it incurs. The term includes cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts and subcontracts. (However, the term does not include any subcontracts under a ``fixed-price contract.'')
I21``Discretionary'' grants and cooperative agreements are ones which a Federal statute authorizes but does not require USDA to award.
I21``Equipment'' means an article of tangible personal property that has a useful life of more than two years and acquisition cost of $500 or more. Any recipient may use its own definition of equipment if its definition would at least include all items of equipment as defined here.

This amount is a limit on the total amount of money that the recipient is entitled to receive from the Federal Government as a result of the award. In addition to this limit, there are other limits. Refer to �1A3015.202 for a summary of these.
I21``Federally recognized Indian Tribal government'' means the governing body or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community (including any Native village as defined in section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 Stat. 688) certified by the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for the special programs and services provided by him or her through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
I21``Fidelity bond'' means a bond indemnifying the recipient against losses resulting �99�from the fraud or lack of integrity, honesty or fidelity of one or more employees, officers or other persons holding a position of trust.
I21``Fixed-price contract'' means any contract except a cost-type contract. The term includes firm-fixed price contracts. It also includes contracts under which the contractor is paid at a fixed rate per unit of service or unit of labor time. (See the definitions of ``contract'' and ``cost-type contract.'')
I21``General program income'' means all program income except the special categories treated in �1A3015.43 through 3015.46. The term ``general program income'' is limited to amounts that accrue to a recipient of grant or cooperative agreement during the period of Federally assisted support, or to a subrecipient during the period of sub-award support.
I21``Local government'' means a local unit of government including specifically, a county, municipality, city, town, township, local public authority, school district, special district, intra-state district, council of governments (whether or not incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under State law), sponsor or sponsoring local organization of a watershed project (as defined in 7 CFR 620.2, 40 FR 12472, March 19, 1974), any other regional or interstate government entity, or any agency or instrumentality of a local government.
I21``Mandatory'' or ``formula'' grants and cooperative agreements are ones which a Federal statute requires USDA to award if the applicant meets specified conditions.
I21``Non-Federal grant'' means an award of financial assistance in the form of money which includes no Federal funds, and for which the recipient must account to the donor on an actual cost basis. The term does not include any award that would be excluded from the definitions of ``grant'' and ``cooperative agreement'' if it were made by the Federal government.
I21``Obligations'' means the amounts of orders placed, contracts and subgrants awarded, services received, and similar transactions during a given period, which will require payment during the same or future period.

I21``Percentage-of-completion method'' refers to a system under which payments are made for construction work according to the percentage of completion of the work, instead of the recipient's rate of disbursements.
I21``Performance bond'' means a bond executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under the contract.
I21``Personal property'' means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible_having physical existence, or intangible_having no physical existence, such as patents, inventions, and copyrights.
I21``Production of an audiovisual'' means any of the steps that lead to a finished audiovisual, including design, layout, script-writing, filming, editing, fabrication, sound recording, or taping. The term does not include the placing of captions for the hearing impaired on films or videotapes not originally produced for use with the hearing impaired.
I21``Program income'' means gross income earned by a recipient from activities supported by a grant or cooperative agreement. (See definition of ``supported by a grant or cooperative agreement.'') It includes but is not limited to income in the form of fees for services performed during the life of the grant, cooperative agreement, or subgrant, proceeds from sale of tangible personal or real property, usage or rental fees, and patent or copyright royalties. If income meets this definition, it shall be considered program income regardless of the method used to calculate the amount paid to the recipient whether, for example, by a cost-reimbursement method or fixed price arrangement. Nor will the income's classification as program income be affected by the fact that the recipient earns it from a procurement contract awarded to the recipient (1) by the Federal government or (2) by another recipient acting under another Federal grant, cooperative agreement, or subgrant.
Q02
S8003I20The following are not considered program income:
S8002I21(1) ``Revenues'' raised by a government recipient under its governing powers, such as taxes, special assessments, levies, and fines. (However, the receipt and expenditure of these revenues shall be recorded as a part of the transactions of the Federally-assisted project or program when the revenues are specifically earmarked for the project in accordance with the terms of the grant, cooperative agreement, or subgrant.)
I21(2) Tuition and related fees received by an institution of higher education for a regularly offered course taught by an employee performing under a grant, cooperative agreement, or subgrant.
I21(3) Income earned by contractors or subcontractors.
I21(4) Internal reimbursements or transfers of funds between organizational components of the same legal entity (e.g., between agencies of the same government).

I21``Publication'' means a published book, periodical, pamphlet, brochure, flier, or similar item. It does not include any audiovisuals.
I21``Real property'' means land, land improvements, structures, and things attached to them so as to become a part of them. Movable machinery and other kinds of equipment are not real property. If a question comes up about whether certain property should be classified as real property, the law of the State or foreign country in which the property is located governs.
I21``Recipient'' means a State or local government, Federally recognized Indian Tribe, university, non-profit, for profit, or other organization that is a recipient of grants or cooperative agreements from a USDA agency.
I21``Replacement equipment'' means property acquired to take the place of other equipment. To qualify as replacement equipment, it must serve the same function as the equipment replaced and must be of the same nature or character, although not necessarily the same model, grade, or quality.

I21(1) Is made under a grant or cooperative agreement by the recipient of the grant or cooperative agreement; and
I21(2) Is made principally to accomplish a purpose of support of stimulation rather than to establish a buyer-seller relationship between the two parties.
I21Any award which meets that definition is a subgrant even if the parties to the award use some other label such as ``grant,'' ``agreement,'' ``cooperative agreement,'' ``contract,'' ``allotment,'' or ``delegation agreement.'' Also, if the award meets that definition, it is a subgrant whether or not the awarding agency is expected to be substantially involved in its performance. However, the term ``subgrant'' does not include any type of assistance which is excluded from the definitions of ``grant'' and ``cooperative agreement'' by Section I(c) of this Appendix.
I21``Supplies'' means all tangible personal property other than equipment.
I21``Supported by a grant or cooperative agreement,'' as applied to a cost or an activity, means that the cost or the cost of the activity is entirely or partly (1) treated as a direct cost under a grant, cooperative agreement, subgrant, or cost-type contract, and (2) either supported by Federal funds or counted towards a Federal cost-sharing or matching requirement.
I21``Suspension'' of an award means temporary withdrawal of the recipient's authority to obligate the funds awarded pending corrective action by the recipient or a decision to terminate the award.
I21``Termination'' of an award means permanent withdrawal of the recipient's authority to obligate previously awarded funds before that authority would otherwise expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by the recipient.
I21``Termination'' does not include:

I21(b) Refusal by the awarding agency to extend an award or to award additional funds (such as refusal to make a competing or noncompeting continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award);
I21(c) Annulment, i.e., voiding of an award upon determination that the award was obtained fraudulently or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception;
I21(d) Withdrawal of surplus Federal funds from a discretionary grant or any analogous withdrawal of funds by a recipient from a subrecipient; or
I21(e) Withdrawal from a mandatory or formula grant of surplus Federal funds authorized which the recipient will not obligate during the fiscal year, or any analogous withdrawal of funds by a recipient from a subrecipient.
I21``Terms'' of a grant, cooperative agreement, subgrant, or contract means all rights and duties created by the award, whether stated in statute, this part or other regulations, the award document itself, or any other document.
I21``Third party'' means, with respect to a grant or cooperative agreement, any entity except (1) the Federal government, (2) the recipient of the cooperative agreement, and (3) subrecipients under that grant or cooperative agreement. Note that contractors of recipients are third parties under this definition, although subrecipients are not.
I21``Third party in-kind contributions'' means property or services benefiting the federally assisted project or program which are contributed by third parties without charge. Note that the term does not include any costs incurred by the recipient or subrecipient.
I21``Unliquidated obligations,'' means, for financial reports prepared on a cash basis, the �101�amount of obligations incurred by the recipient that has not been paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they are the amount of obligations incurred by the recipient for which an outlay has not been recorded.
I21``Unobligated balance'' is the portion of Federal funds authorized which has not been obligated by the recipient. It is calculated by subtracting the Federal share of the recipient's cumulative obligations from the cumulative Federal funds authorized.

I26Subject: Audits of State and Local Governments.
Q04
I211. T3Purpose.G1T1 G1T1This Circular is issued pursuant to the Single Audit Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98�09502. It establishes audit requirements for State and local governments that receive Federal aid, and defines Federal responsibilities for implementing and monitoring those requirements.G1T1
I212. T3Supersession.G1T1 G1T1The Circular supersedes Attachment P, ``Audit Requirements,'' of Circular A�09102, ``Uniform requirements for grants to State and local governments.''G1T1
I213. T3Background.G1T1 G1T1The Single Audit Act builds upon earlier efforts to improve audits of Federal aid programs. The Act requires State or local governments that receive $100,000 or more a year in Federal funds to have an audit made for that year. Section 7505 of the Act requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to prescribe policies, procedures and guidelines to implement the Act. It specifies that the Director shall designate ``cognizant'' Federal agencies, determine criteria for making appropriate charges to Federal programs for the cost of audits, and provide procedures to assure that small firms or firms owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals have the opportunity to participate in contracts for single audits.G1T1
I214. T3Policy.G1T1 G1T1The Single Audit Act requires the following:G1T1
I21a. State or local governments that receive $100,000 or more a year in Federal financial assistance shall have an audit made in accordance with this Circular.

I21c. State or local governments that receive less than $25,000 a year shall be exempt from compliance with the Act and other Federal audit requirements. These State and local governments shall be governed by audit requirements prescribed by State or local law or regulation.
I21d.

It shall also honor requests for biennial audits by governments that have an administrative policy calling for audits less frequent than annual, but only for fiscal years beginning before January 1, 1987.
I218. T3Internal control and compliance reviews.G1T1 The Single Audit Act requires that the independent auditor determine and report on whether the organization has internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance that it is managing Federal assistance programs in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
I21a. T3Internal control review.G1T1 In order to provide this assurance the auditor must make a study and evaluation of internal control systems used in administering Federal assistance programs. The study and evaluation must be made whether or not the auditor intends to place reliance on such systems. As part of this review, the auditor shall:
I21(1) Test whether these internal control systems are functioning in accordance with prescribed procedures.
I21(2) Examine the recipient's system for monitoring subrecipients and obtaining and acting on subrecipient audit reports.
I21b. T3Compliance review.G1T1 The law also requires the auditor to determine whether the organization has complied with laws and regulations that may have a material effect on each major Federal assistance program.
I21(1) In order to determine which major programs are to be tested for compliance, State and local governments shall identify in their accounts all Federal funds received and expended and the programs under which they were received. This shall include funds received directly from Federal agencies and through other State and local governments.
�103�I21(2) The review must include the selection and testing of a representative number of charges from each major Federal assistance program. The selection and testing of transactions shall be based on the auditor's professional judgment considering such factors as the amount of expenditures for the program and the individual awards; the newness of the program or changes in its conditions; prior experience with the program, particularly as revealed in audits and other evaluations (e.g., inspections, program reviews); the extent to which the program is carried out through subrecipients; the extent to which the program contracts for goods or services; the level to which the program is already subject to program reviews of other forms of independent oversight; the adequacy of the controls for ensuring compliance; the expectation of adherence or lack of adherence to the applicable laws and regulations; and the potential impact of adverse findings.
I21(a) In making the test of transactions, the auditor shall determine whether:

Q02
I26_The amounts reported as expenditures were for allowable services, and
I26_The records show that those who received services or benefits were eligible to receive them.

Q02
I21(b) In addition to transaction testing, the auditor shall determine whether:

Q02
I26_Matching requirements, levels of effort and earmarking limitations were met,
I26_Federal financial reports and claims for advances and reimbursements contain information that is supported by the books and records from which the basic financial statements have been prepared, and
I26_Amounts claimed or used for matching were determined in accordance with OMB Circular A�0987, ``Cost principles for State and local governments,'' and Attachment F of Circular A�09102, ``Uniform requirements for grants to State and local governments.''

Q02
I21(c) The principal compliance requirements of the largest Federal aid programs may be ascertained by referring to the T3Compliance Supplement for Single Audits of State and Local Governments,G1T1 issued by OMB and available from the Government Printing Office. For those programs not covered in the Compliance Supplement, the auditor may ascertain compliance requirements by researching the statutes, regulations, and agreements governing individual programs.
I21(3) Transactions related to other Federal assistance programs that are selected in connection with examinations of financial statements and evaluations of internal controls shall be tested for compliance with Federal laws and regulations that apply to such transactions.
I219. T3Subrecipients.G1T1 State or local governments that receive Federal financial assistance and provide $25,000 or more of it in a fiscal year to a subrecipient shall:
I21a. Determine whether State or local subrecipients have met the audit requirements of this Circular and whether subrecipients covered by Circular A�09110, ``Uniform requirements for grants to universities, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations,'' have met that requirement;
I21b. Determine whether the subrecipient spent Federal assistance funds provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subrecipient made in accordance with this Circular, Circular A�09110, or through other means (e.g., program reviews) if the subrecipient has not yet had such an audit;
I21c. Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six months after receipt of the audit report in instances of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations;
I21d. Consider whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of the recipient's own records; and
I21e. Require each subrecipient to permit independent auditors to have access to the records and financial statements as necessary to comply with this Circular.
I2110. T3Relation to other audit requirements.G1T1 The Single Audit Act provides that an audit made in accordance with this Circular shall be in lieu of any financial or financial compliance audit required under individual Federal assistance programs. To the extent that a single audit provides Federal agencies with information and assurances they need to carry out their overall responsibilities, they shall rely upon and use such information. However, a Federal agency shall make any additional audits which are necessary to carry out its responsibilities under Federal law and regulation. Any additional Federal audit effort shall be planned and carried out in such a way as to avoid duplication. 
I21a. The provisions of this Circular do not limit the authority of Federal agencies to make, or contract for audits and evaluations of Federal financial assistance programs, nor do they limit the authority of any Federal agency Inspector General or other Federal audit official. 
I21b. The provisions of this Circular do not authorize any State or local government or subrecipient thereof to constrain Federal agencies, in any manner, from carrying out additional audits. 
I21c. A Federal agency that makes or contracts for audits in addition to the audits made by recipients pursuant to this Circular shall, consistent with other applicable laws and regulations, arrange for funding the cost of such additional audits. Such additional audits include economy and efficiency audits, program results audits, and program evaluations. 
�104�I2111. T3Cognizant agency responsibilities.G1T1 The Single Audit Act provides for cognizant Federal agencies to oversee the implementation of this Circular. 
I21a. The Office of Management and Budget will assign cognizant agencies for States and their subdivisions and larger local governments and their subdivisions. Other Federal agencies may participate with an assigned cognizant agency, in order to fulfill the cognizance responsibilities. Smaller governments not assigned a cognizant agency will be under the general oversight of the Federal agency that provides them the most funds whether directly or indirectly. 
I21b. A cognizant agency shall have the following responsibilities: 
I21(1) Ensure that audits are made and reports are received in a timely manner and in accordance with the requirements of this Circular. 
I21(2) Provide technical advice and liaison to State and local governments and independent auditors. 
I21(3) Obtain or make quality control reviews of selected audits made by non-Federal audit organizations, and provide the results, when appropriate, to other interested organizations. 
I21(4) Promptly inform other affected Federal agencies and appropriate Federal law enforcement officials of any reported illegal acts or irregularities. They should also inform State or local law enforcement and prosecuting authorities, if not advised by the recipient, of any violation of law within their jurisdiction. 
I21(5) Advise the recipient of audits that have been found not to have met the requirements set forth in this Circular. In such instances, the recipient will be expected to work with the auditor to take corrective action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency shall notify the recipient and Federal awarding agencies of the facts and make recommendations for followup action. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard performance of independent auditors shall be referred to appropriate professional bodies for disciplinary action. 
I21(6) Coordinate, to the extent practicable, audits made by or for Federal agencies that are in addition to the audits made pursuant to this Circular; so that the additional audits build upon such audits. 
I21(7) Oversee the resolution of audit findings that affect the programs of more than one agency. 
I2112. T3Illegal acts or irregularities.G1T1 If the auditor becomes aware of illegal acts or other irregularities, prompt notice shall be given to recipient management officials above the level of involvement. (See also paragraph 13(a)(3) below for the auditor's reporting responsibilities.) The recipient, in turn, shall promptly notify the cognizant agency of the illegal acts or irregularities and of proposed and actual actions, if any. Illegal acts and irregularities include such matters as conflicts of interest, falsification of records or reports, and misappropriations of funds or other assets. 
I2113. T3Audit Reports.G1T1 Audit reports must be prepared at the completion of the audit. Reports serve many needs of State and local governments as well as meeting the requirements of the Single Audit Act. 
I21a. The audit report shall state that the audit was made in accordance with the provisions of this Circular. The report shall be made up of at least:
I21(1) The auditor's report on financial statements and on a schedule of Federal assistance; the financial statements; and a schedule of Federal assistance, showing the total expenditures for each Federal assistance program as identified in the T3Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.G1T1 Federal programs or grants that have not been assigned a catalog number shall be identified under the caption ``other Federal assistance.'' 
I21(2) The auditor's report on the study and evaluation of internal control systems must identify the organization's significant internal accounting controls, and those controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that Federal programs are being managed in compliance with laws and regulations. It must also identify the controls that were evaluated, the controls that were not evaluated, and the material weaknesses identified as a result of the evaluation. 
I21(3) The auditor's report on compliance containing: 
I26_A statement of positive assurance with respect to those items tested for compliance, including compliance with law and regulations pertaining to financial reports and claims for advances and reimbursements;
I26_Negative assurance on those items not tested; 
I26_A summary of all instances of noncompliance; and 
I26_An identification of total amounts questioned, if any, for each Federal assistance award, as a result of noncompliance.
Q02
I21b. The three parts of the audit report may be bound into a single report, or presented at the same time as separate documents. 
I21c. All fraud abuse, or illegal acts or indications of such acts, including all questioned costs found as the result of these acts that auditors become aware of, should normally be covered in a separate written report submitted in accordance with paragraph 13f. 
I21d. In addition to the audit report, the recipient shall provide comments on the findings and recommendations in the report, including a plan for corrective action taken or planned and comments on the status of corrective action taken on prior findings. If corrective action is not necessary, a statement �105�describing the reason it is not should accompany the audit report. 
I21e. The reports shall be made available by the State or local government for public inspection within 30 days after the completion of the audit. 
I21f. In accordance with generally accepted government audit standards, reports shall be submitted by the auditor to the organization audited and to those requiring or arranging for the audit. In addition, the recipient shall submit copies of the reports to each Federal department or agency that provided Federal assistance funds to the recipient. Subrecipients shall submit copies to recipients that provided them Federal assistance funds. The reports shall be sent within 30 days after the completion of the audit, but no later than one year after the end of the audit period unless a longer period is agreed to with the cognizant agency.
I21g. Recipients of more than $100,000 in Federal funds shall submit one copy of the audit report within 30 days after issuance to a central clearinghouse to be designated by the Office of Management and Budget. The clearinghouse will keep completed audits on file and follow up with State and local governments that have not submitted required audit reports.
I21h. Recipients shall keep audit reports on file for three years from their issuance.
I2114. T3Audit Resolution.G1T1 As provided in paragraph 11, the cognizant agency shall be responsible for monitoring the resolution of audit findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency. Resolution of findings that relate to the programs of a single Federal agency will be the responsibility of the recipient and that agency. Alternate arrangements may be made on case-by-case basis by a case-by-case basis by agreement among the agenices concerned.
I21Resolution shall be made within six months after receipt of the report by the Federal departments and agencies. Corrective action should proceed as rapidly as possible.
I2115. T3Audit workpapers and reports.G1T1 Workpapers and reports shall be retained for a minimum of three years from the date of the audit report, unless the auditor is notified in writing by the cognizant agency to extend the retention period. Audit workpapers shall be made available upon request to the cognizant agency or its designee or the General Accounting Office, at the completion of the audit.
I2116. T3Audit Costs.G1T1 The cost of audits made in accordance with the provisions of this Circular are allowable charges to Federal assistance programs.
I21a. The charges may be considered a direct cost or an allocated indirect cost, determined in accordance with the provision of Circular A�0987, ``Cost principles for State and local governments.''
I21b. Generally, the percentage of costs charged to Federal assistance programs for a single audit shall not exceed the percentage that Federal funds expended represent of total funds expended by the recipient during the fiscal year. The percentage may be exceeded, however, if appropriate documentation demonstrates higher actual cost.
I2117. T3Sanctions.G1T1 The Single Audit Act provides that no cost may be charged to Federal assistance programs for audits required by the Act that are not made in accordance with this Circular. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have a proper audit, Federal agencies must consider other appropropriate sanctions including:
Q02
I26_Withholding a percentage of assistance payments until the audit is completed satisfactorily,
I26_Withholding or disallowing overhead costs, and 
I26_Suspending the Federal assistance agreement until the audit is made.

Q02
I2118. T3Auditor Selection.G1T1 In arranging for audit services State and local governments shall follow the procurement standards prescribed by Attachment O of Circular A�09102, ``Uniform requirements for grants to State and local governments.'' The standards provide that while recipients are encouraged to enter into intergovernmental agreements for audit and other services, analysis should be made to determine whether it would be more economical to purchase the services from private firms. In instances where use of such intergovernmental agreements are required by State statutes (e.g., audit services) these statutes will take precedence.
I2119. T3Small and Minority Audit Firms.G1T1 Small audit firms and audit firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals shall have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in contracts awarded to fulfill the requirements of this Circular. Recipients of Federal assistance shall take the following steps to further this goal:
I21a. Assure that small audit firms and audit firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals are used to the fullest extent practicable.
I21b. Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange timeframes for the audit so as to encourage and facilitate participation by small audit firms and audit firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
I21c. Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for large audits intend to subcontract with small audit firms and audit firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
I21d. Encourage contracting with small audit firms or audit firms owned and controlled by �106�socially and economically disadvantaged individuals which have traditionally audited government programs and, in such cases where this is not possible, assure that these firms are given consideration for audit subcontracting opportunities.
I21e. Encourage contracting with consortiums of small audit firms as described in paragraph (a) above when a contract is too large for an individual small audit firm or audit firm owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
I21f. Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration in the solicitation and utilization of small audit firms or audit firms owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
I2120. T3Reporting.G1T1 Each Federal agency will report to the Director of OMB on or before March 1, 1987, and annually thereafter on the effectiveness of State and local governments in carrying out the provisions of this Circular. The report must identify each State or local government or Indian tribe that, in the opinion of the agency, is failing to comply with the Circular.
I2121. T3Regulations.G1T1 Each Federal agency shall include the provisions of this Circular in its regulations implementing the Single Audit Act.
I2122. T3Effective date.G1T1 This Circular is effective upon publication and shall apply to fiscal years of State and local governments that begin after December 31, 1984. Earlier implementation is encouraged. However, until it is implemented, the audit provisions of Attachment P to Circular A�09102 shall continue to be observed.
I2123. T3Inquiries.G1T1 All questions or inquiries should be addressed to Financial Management Division, Office of Management and Budget, telephone number 202/395�093993.
I2124. T3Sunset review date.G1T1 This Circular shall have an independent policy review to ascertain its effectiveness three years from the date of issuance.

I11T3AdministrativeG1T1 requirements mean those matters common to grants in general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, and retention of records.

I11T3Awarding agencyG1T1 means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the subgrant.
I11T3Cash contributionsG1T1 means the grantee's cash outlay, including the outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee cash contributions.
I11T3ContractG1T1 means (except as used in the definitions for T3grantG1T1 and T3subgrantG1T1 in this section and except where qualified by T3FederalG1T1) a procurement contract under a grant or subgrant, and means a procurement subcontract under a contract.

I80�1A3016.11
I89State plans.
I11(a) T3Scope.G1T1 The statutes for some programs require States to submit plans before receiving grants.

I11(b) T3Requirements.G1T1 A State need meet only Federal administrative or programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified regulations.
I11(c) T3Assurances.G1T1 In each plan the State will include an assurance that the State shall comply with all applicable Federal statutes and regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in the plan, the State may:
I11(1) Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those provisions,
I11(2) Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or

I80�1A3016.20
I89Standards for financial management systems.
I11(a) A State must expand and account for grant funds in accordance with State laws and procedures for expending and accounting for its own funds. Fiscal control and accounting procedures of the State, as well as its subgrantees and cost-type contractors, must be sufficient to_
I11(1) Permit preparation of reports required by this part and the statutes authorizing the grant, and 
I11(2) Permit the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate to establish that such funds have not been used in violation of the restrictions and prohibitions of applicable statutes.
I11(b) The financial management systems of other grantees and subgrantees must meet the following standards:
I11(1) T3Financial reporting.G1T1 Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of financially assisted activities must be made in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of the grant or subgrant.
I11(2) T3Accounting records.G1T1 Grantees and subgrantees must maintain records which adequately identify the source and application of funds provided for financially-assisted activities. These records must contain information pertaining to grant or subgrant awards and authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays or expenditures, and income.
I11(3) T3Internal control.G1T1 Effective control and accountability must be maintained for all grant and subgrant cash, real and personal property, and other assets. Grantees and subgrantees must adequately safeguard all such property and must assure that it is used solely for authorized purposes.
I11(4) T3Budget control.G1T1 Actual expenditures or outlays must be compared with budgeted amounts for each grant or subgrant. Financial information must be related to performance or productivity data, including the development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be accepted whenever possible.
I11(5) T3Allowable cost.G1T1 Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability, and allocability of costs.
I11(6) T3Source documentation.G1T1 Accounting records must be supported by such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.
I11(7) T3Cash management.G1T1 Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing between �113�the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.
I11(c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.

I80�1A3016.21 
I89Payment. 
I11(a) T3Scope.G1T1 This section prescribes the basic standard and the methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors. 
I11(b) T3Basic standard.G1T1 Methods and procedures for payment shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205. 
I11(c) T3Advances.G1T1 Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee. 
I11(d) T3Reimbursement.G1T1 Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its construction contractor, and if it does, the awarding agency's payments to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement. 
I11(e) T3Working capital advances.G1T1 If a grantee cannot meet the criteria for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the grantee lacks sufficient working capital, the awarding agency may provide cash or a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements. 
I11(f) T3Effect of program income, refunds, and audit recoveries on payment.G1T1 (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash payments for the same activity. 
I11(2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments. 
I11(g) T3Withholding payments.G1T1 (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless_ 
I11(i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award conditions or 
I11(ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States. 
I11(2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award condition, but without suspension of the grant, shall �114�be released to the grantee upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with �1A3016.43(c). 
I11(3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to assure satisfactory completion of work. 
I11(h) T3Cash depositories.G1T1 (1) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. 
I11(2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account only when required by Federal-State agreement. 
I11(i) T3Interest earned on advances.G1T1 Except for interest earned on advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6501 T3et seq.G1T1) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for administrative expenses. 

I80�1A3016.22 
I89Allowable costs.
I11(a) T3Limitation on use of funds.G1T1 Grant funds may be used only for:
I11(1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-price contractors; and
I11(2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee or subgrantee.
I11(b) T3Applicable cost principles.G1T1 For each kind of organization, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost principles.

I89Period of availability of funds.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding period unless carryover of unobligated balances is permitted, in which case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from obligations of the subsequent funding period.
I11(b) T3Liquidation of obligations.G1T1 A grantee must liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF�09269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the grantee.

I80�1A3016.24 
I89Matching or cost sharing.
I11(a) T3Basic rule: Costs and contributions acceptable.G1T1 With the qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both of the following:
I11(1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost-type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable costs borne by non-Federal grants or by others cash donations from non-Federal third parties.
�115�I11(2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements applies.
I11(b) T3Qualifications and exceptionsG1T1_(1) T3Costs borne by other Federal grant agreements.G1T1 Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.
I11(2) T3General revenue sharing.G1T1 For the purpose of this section, general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not considered Federal grant funds.
I11(3) T3Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal costs-sharing requirements.G1T1 Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any other award of Federal funds.
I11(4) T3Costs financed by program income.G1T1 Costs financed by program income, as defined in �1A3016.25, shall not count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program income is described in �1A3016.25(g).)
I11(5) T3Services or property financed by income earned by contractors.G1T1 Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.
I11(6) T3Records.G1T1 Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer services will be supported by the same methods that the organization uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.
I11(7) T3Special standards for third party in-kind contributions.G1T1 (i) Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable costs.
I11(ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an indirect costs. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the contributions.
I11(iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only if it results in:
I11(A) An increase in the services or property provided under the contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or
I11(B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.
I11(iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair and reasonable.
I11(c) T3Valuation of donated servicesG1T1_(1) T3Volunteer services.G1T1 Unpaid services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar �116�work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.
I11(2) T3Employees of other organizations.G1T1 When an employer other than a grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.
I11(d) T3Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment or space.G1T1 (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.
I11(2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair rental rate of the equipment or space.
I11(e) T3Valuation of third party donated equipment, buildings, and land.G1T1 If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and title passes to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant, as follows:
I11(1) T3Awards for capital expenditures.G1T1 If the purpose of the grant or subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may be counted as cost sharing or matching,
I11(2) T3Other awards.G1T1 If assisting in the acquisition of property is not the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section apply:
I11(i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost-sharing or matching.
I11(ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost principles specified in �1A3016.22, in the same way as depreciation or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.
I11(f) T3Valuation of grantee or subgrantee donated real property for construction/acquisition.G1T1 If a grantee or subgrantee donates real property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-federal share of the property may be counted as cost sharing or matching.
I11(g) T3Appraisal of real property.G1T1 In some cases under paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of space in a building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.

I80�1A3016.25 
I89Program income. 
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a grant agreement, �117�and from payments of principal and interest on loans made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on any of them. 
I11(b) T3Definition of program income.G1T1 Program income means gross income received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement during the grant period. ``During the grant period'' is the time between the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award reflected in the final financial report. 
I11(c) T3Cost of generating program income.G1T1 If authorized by Federal regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income. 
I11(d) T3Governmental revenues.G1T1 Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income. 
I11(e) T3Royalties.G1T1 Income from royalties and license fees for copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income. (See �1A3016.34.) 
I11(f) T3Property.G1T1 Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment will be handled in accordance with the requirements of �1A3016.31 and 3016.32. 
I11(g) T3Use of program income.G1T1 Program income shall be deducted from outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be deducted from outlays. 
I11(1) T3Deduction.G1T1 Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to the project. 
I11(2) T3Addition.G1T1 When authorized, program income may be added to the funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the grant agreement. 
I11(3) T3Cost sharing or matching.G1T1 When authorized, program income may be used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same. 
I11(h) T3Income after the award period.G1T1 There are no Federal requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.


I80�1A3016.26 
I89Non-Federal audit. 


I11(a) T3Basic rule.G1T1 Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501�097507) and revised OMB Circular A�09133, ``Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.'' The audits shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.

I11(1) In USDA, revised OMB Circular A�09133 is implemented in 7 CFR part 3052, ``Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.''

I11(2) [Reserved]


I11(b) T3Subgrantees.G1T1 State or local governments, as those terms are defined for �118�purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more (or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal year, shall:

I11(1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular A�09110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,'' have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental organizations) providing goods and services to State and local governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal funds;


I11(2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance with the Act, Circular A�09110, or through other means (e.g., program reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit; 
I11(3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken within six months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations; 
I11(4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the grantee's own records; and 
I11(5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have access to the records and financial statements. 
I11(c) T3Auditor selection.G1T1 In arranging for audit services, �1A3016.36 shall be followed.

I84Changes, Property, and Subawards

I80�1A3016.30
I89Changes.
I11(a) T3GeneralG1T1. Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior written approval of the awarding agency.
I11(b) T3Relation to cost principles.G1T1 The applicable cost principles (see �1A3016.22) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.
I11(c) T3Budget changes.G1T1 (1) T3Nonconstruction projects.G1T1 Except as stated in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following changes is anticipated under a nonconstruction award:
I11(i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional funding. 
I11(ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.
I11(iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).
I11(2) T3Construction projects.G1T1 Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the need for additional funds.
I11(3) T3Combined construction and nonconstruction projects.G1T1 When a grant or subgrant provides funding for both construction and nonconstruction activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from nonconstruction to construction or vice versa.
I11(d) T3Programmatic changes.G1T1 Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following actions is anticipated:
�119�I11(1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project (regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring prior approval).
I11(2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.
I11(3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the project director or principal investigator shall always require approval unless waived by the awarding agency. 
I11(4) Under nonconstruction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of �1A3016.36 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, supplies, and general support services.
I11(e) T3Additional prior approval requirements.G1T1 The awarding agency may not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not described in paragraph (c) of this section.
I11(f) T3Requesting prior approval.G1T1 (1) A request for prior approval of any budget revision will be in the same budget formal the grantee used in its application and shall be accompanied by a narrative justification for the proposed revision.
I11(2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost principles (see �1A3016.22) may be made by letter.
I11(3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving the subgrantee's request.

I80�1A3016.31
I89Real property.
I11(a) T3Title.G1T1 Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
I11(b) T3Use.G1T1 Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as needed for that purposes, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.
I11(c) T3Disposition.G1T1 When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will provide for one of the following alternatives:
I11(1) T3Retention of title.G1T1 Retain title after compensating the awarding agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.
I11(2) T3Sale of property.G1T1 Sell the property and compensate the awarding agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant is still active, the net proceeds from sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
I11(3) T3Transfer of title.G1T1 Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a third-party designated/approved by the �120�awarding agency. The grantee or subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real property to the current fair market value of the property.

I80�1A3016.32
I89Equipment.
I11(a) T3Title.G1T1 Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
I11(b) T3States.G1T1 A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.
I11(c) T3Use.G1T1 (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency.
I11(2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with the work on the projects or program for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should be considered if appropriate.
I11(3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in �1A3016.25(a) to earn program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.
I11(4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, subject to the approval of the awarding agency.
I11(d) T3Management requirements.G1T1 Procedures for managing equipment (including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:
I11(1) Property records must be maintained that include a description of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the source of property, who holds title, the acquisition date, and cost of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any ultimate disposition data including the date of disposal and sale price of the property.
I11(2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.
I11(3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the property. Any loss, damage, or theft shall be investigated.
I11(4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the property in good condition.
I11(5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the highest possible return.
I11(e) T3Disposition.G1T1 When original or replacement equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:
I11(1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency.
I11(2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the equipment.
�121�I11(3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.
I11(f) T3Federal equipment.G1T1 In the event a grantee or subgrantee is provided federally-owned equipment:
I11(1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.
I11(2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory listing.
I11(3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal agency.
I11(g) T3Right to transfer title.G1T1 The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third part named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the following standards:
I11(1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing.
I11(2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the grantee shall follow �1A3016.32(e).
I11(3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.

I80�1A3016.33
I89Supplies.
I11(a) T3Title.G1T1 Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.
I11(b) T3Disposition.G1T1 If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.

I80�1A3016.34
I89Copyrights.
I11The Federal awarding agency reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, for Federal Government purposes:
I11(a) The copyright in any work developed under a grant, subgrant, or contract under a grant or subgrant; and
I11(b) Any rights of copyright to which a grantee, subgrantee or a contractor purchases ownership with grant support.

I80�1A3016.35
I89Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.
I11Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award (subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension.''

I80�1A3016.36
I89Procurement.
I11(a) T3States.G1T1 When procuring property and services under a grant, a State will follow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) through (i) in this section.
I11(b) T3Procurement standards.G1T1 (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.
I11(2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.
I11(3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of standards of �122�conduct governing the performance of their employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when:
I11(i) The employee, officer or agent, 
I11(ii) Any member of his immediate family,
I11(iii) His or her partner, or 
I11(iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agents will neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subagreements. Grantee and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, such standards or conduct will provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the grantee's and subgrantee's officers, employees, or agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, or potential conflicts of interest.
I11(4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.
I11(5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and services.
I11(6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.
I11(7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost.
I11(8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources.
I11(9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
I11(10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type contracts only_
I11(i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and 
I11(ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.
I11(11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims. These standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, State, or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction. 
�123�I11(12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all instances disclose information regarding the protest to the awarding agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to: 
I11(i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of this section (violations of State or local law will be under the jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and 
I11(ii) Violations of the grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the grantee or subgrantee. 
I11(c) T3CompetitionG1T1. (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the standards of �1A3016.36. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but are not limited to: 
I11(i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business, 
I11(ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding, 
I11(iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies, 
I11(iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer contracts, 
I11(v) Organizational conflicts of interest, 
I11(vi) Specifying only a ``brand name'' product instead of allowing ``an equal'' product to be offered and describing the performance of other relevant requirements of the procurement, and 
I11(vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process. 
I11(2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract. 
I11(3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations: 
I11(i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a ``brand name or equal'' description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be clearly stated; and 
I11(ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals. 
I11(4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period. 
I11(d) T3Methods of procurement to be followed.G1T1 (1) Procurement by T3small purchase proceduresG1T1. Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at �124�$100,000). If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources. 
I11(2) Procurement by T3sealed bidsG1T1 (formal advertising). Bids are publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for procuring construction, if the conditions in �1A3016.36(d)(2)(i) apply. 
I11(i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present: 
I11(A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available; 
I11(B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively and for the business; and 
I11(C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price. 
I11(ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply: 
I11(A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids; 
I11(B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond; 
I11(C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids; 
I11(D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and 
I11(E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason. 
I11(3) Procurement by T3competitive proposals.G1T1 The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements apply: 
I11(i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent practical; 
I11(ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources; 
I11(iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting awardees; 
I11(iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered; and 
I11(v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort. 
I11(4) Procurement by T3noncompetitive proposalsG1T1 is procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate. 
I11(i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following circumstances applies: 
I11(A) The item is available only from a single source; 
I11(B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a �125�delay resulting from competitive solicitation; 
I11(C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or 
I11(D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate. 
I11(ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of costs and profits, is required. 
I11(iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. 
I11(e) T3Contracting with small and minority firms, women's business enterprise and labor surplus area firms.G1T1 (1) The grantee and subgrantee will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible.
I11(2) Affirmative steps shall include:
I11(i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's business enterprises on solicitation lists;
I11(ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;
I11(iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and minority business, and women's business enterprises;
I11(iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage participation by small and minority business, and women's business enterprises;
I11(v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and
I11(vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (v) of this section.
I11(f) T3Contract cost and price.G1T1 (1) Grantees and subgrantees must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, unless price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price.
I11(2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate element of the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.
I11(3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost principles (see �1A3016.22). Grantees may reference their own cost principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.
I11(4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.
I11(g) T3Awarding agency review.G1T1 (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review is needed to ensure that the item and/or �126�service specified is the one being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase. 
I11(2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. when: 
I11(i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or 
I11(ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or 
I11(iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product; or 
I11(iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement; or 
I11(v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition threshold. 
I11(3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section. 
I11(i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis. 
I11(ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available for review. 
I11(h) T3Bonding requirements.G1T1 For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows: 
I11(1) T3A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price.G1T1 The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified. 
I11(2) T3A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price.G1T1 A ``performance bond'' is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract. 
I11(3) T3A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price.G1T1 A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. 
I11(i) T3Contract provisions.G1T1 A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access and records retention, suspension of work, and other �127�clauses approved by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. 
I11(1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the simplified acquisition threshold) 
I11(2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)

I11(7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to reporting. 
I11(8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract. 
I11(9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to copyrights and rights in data. 
I11(10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.

I89Monitoring and reporting program performance.
I11(a) T3Monitoring by grantees.G1T1 Grantees are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, function or activity.
I11(b) T3Nonconstruction performance reports.G1T1 The Federal agency may, if it decides that performance information available from subsequent applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial Status Report.
I11(1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the awarding agency requires quarterly or semi-annual reports. However, performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports may be waived by the Federal agency.
I11(2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief information on the following:
I11(i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives established for the period. Where the output of the project can be quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required if that information will be useful.

I11(3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value. When the records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee. 
I11(c) T3Starting date of retention periodG1T1_(1) T3General.G1T1 When grant support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the retention period starts on the day the report would have been due. 
I11(2) T3Real property and equipment records.G1T1 The retention period for real property and equipment records starts from the date of the disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding agency. 
I11(3) T3Records for income transactions after grant or subgrant support.G1T1 In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned. 
I11(4) T3Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc.G1T1 This paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates). 
I11(i) T3If submitted for negotiation.G1T1 If the proposal, plan, or other computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of such submission. 
I11(ii) T3If not submitted for negotiation.G1T1 If the proposal, plan, or other computation is not required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation. 
I11(d) T3Substitution of microfilm.G1T1 Copies made by microfilming, photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original records. 
I11(e) T3Access to records_G1T1(1) T3Records of grantees and subgrantees.G1T1 The awarding agency and the Comptroller General of �132�the United States, or any of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts. 
I11(2) T3Expiration of right of access.G1T1 The rights of access in this section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall last as long as the records are retained. 
I11(f) T3Restrictions on public access.G1T1 The Federal Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records Unless required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not required to permit public access to their records.

I11(a) T3Remedies for noncompliance.G1T1 If a grantee or subgrantee materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances: 
I11(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement action by the awarding agency, 
I11(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance, 
I11(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the grantee's or subgrantee's program, 
I11(4) Withhold further awards for the program, or 
I11(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available. 
I11(b) T3Hearings, appeals.G1T1 In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

Other grantee or subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if: 
I11(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a termination, are noncancellable, and, 
I11(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect. 
I11(d) T3Relationship to Debarment and Suspension.G1T1 The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to ``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see �1A3016.35). 

I80�1A3016.44 
I89Termination for convenience.

I11(a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or 
I11(b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either �1A3016.43 or paragraph (a) of this section.

I11(c) T3Cost adjustment.G1T1 The Federal agency will, within 90 days after receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or downward adjustments to the allowable costs. 
I11(d) T3Cash adjustments.G1T1 (1) The Federal agency will make prompt payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs. 
I11(2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not authorized to be retained for use on other grants. 

I80�1A3016.51 
I89Later disallowances and adjustments.

I89Collection of amounts due. 
I11(a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt by: 
I11(1) Making an adminstrative offset against other requests for reimbursements, 
I11(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or 
I11(3) Other action permitted by law. 
I11(b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the filing of any form of appeal.

I89Purpose.
I11(a) Executive Order (E.O.) 12549 provides that, to the extent permitted by law, Executive departments and agencies shall participate in a governmentwide system for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. A person who is debarred or suspended shall be excluded from Federal financial and nonfinancial assistance and benefits under Federal programs and activities. Debarment or suspension of a participant in a program by one agency shall have governmentwide effect. 
I11(b) These regulations implement section 3 of E.O. 12549 and the guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget under section 6 of the E.O. by:
I11(1) Prescribing the programs and activities that are covered by the governmentwide system; 
I11(2) Prescribing the governmentwide criteria and governmentwide minimum due process procedures that each agency shall use; 
I11(3) Providing for the listing of debarred and suspended participants, participants declared ineligible (see definition of ``ineligible'' in �1A3017.105), and participants who have voluntarily excluded themselves from participation in covered transactions; 
I11(4) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion; and 
I11(5) Offering such other guidance as necessary for the effective implementation and administration of the governmentwide system. 
I11(c) These regulations also implement Executive Order 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Public Law 103�09355, sec. 2455, 108 Stat. 3327) by_
I11(1) Providing for the inclusion in the T3List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement ProgramsG1T1 all persons proposed for debarment, �135�debarred or suspended under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR Part 9, subpart 9.4; persons against which governmentwide exclusions have been entered under this part; and persons determined to be ineligible; and 
I11(2) Setting forth the consequences of a debarment, suspension, determination of ineligibility, or voluntary exclusion. 
I11(d) Although these regulations cover the listing of ineligible participants and the effect of such listing, they do not prescribe policies and procedures governing declarations of ineligibility.

I89Coverage.
I11(a) These regulations apply to all persons who have participated, are currently participating or may reasonably be expected to participate in transactions under Federal nonprocurement programs. For purposes of these regulations such transactions will be referred to as ``covered transactions.'' 
I11(1) T3Covered transaction.G1T1 For purposes of these regulations, a covered transaction is a primary covered transaction or a lower tier covered transaction. Covered transactions at any tier need not involve the transfer of Federal funds. 
I11(i) T3Primary covered transaction.G1T1 Except as noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a primary covered transaction is any nonprocurement transaction between an agency and a person, regardless of type, including: Grants, cooperative agreements, scholarships, fellowships, contracts of assistance, loans, loan guarantees, subsidies, insurance, payments for specified use, donation agreements and any other nonprocurement transactions between a Federal agency and a person. Primary covered transactions also include those transactions specially designated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in such agency's regulations governing debarment and suspension. 
I11(ii) T3Lower tier covered transaction.G1T1 A lower tier covered transaction is: 
I11(A) Any transaction between a participant and a person other than a procurement contract for goods or services, regardless of type, under a primary covered transaction. 
I11(B) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person, regardless of type, expected to equal or exceed the Federal procurement small purchase threshold fixed at 10 U.S.C. 2304(g) and 41 U.S.C. 253(g) (currently $25,000) under a primary covered transaction. 
I11(C) Any procurement contract for goods or services between a participant and a person under a covered transaction, regardless of amount, under which that person will have a critical influence on or substantive control over that covered transaction. Such persons are: 
I11(T31G1T1) Principal investigators. 
I11(T32G1T1) Providers of federally-required audit services. 
I11(2) T3Exceptions.G1T1 The following transactions are not covered: 
I11(i) Statutory entitlements or mandatory awards (but not subtier awards thereunder which are not themselves mandatory), including deposited funds insured by the Federal Government; 
I11(ii) Direct awards to foreign governments or public international organizations, or transactions with foreign governments or foreign governmental entities, public international organizations, foreign government owned (in whole or in part) or controlled entities, entities consisting wholly or partially of foreign governments or foreign governmental entities; 
I11(iii) Benefits to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted); 
I11(iv) Federal employment; 
I11(v) Transactions pursuant to national or agency-recognized emergencies or disasters; 
I11(vi) Incidental benefits derived from ordinary governmental operations; and 
I11(vii) Other transactions where the application of these regulations would be prohibited by law. 
�138�I11(3) T3Department of Agriculture covered transactions.G1T1 (i) With respect to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for USDA's export and foreign assistance programs, covered transactions will include only primary covered transactions. Any lower tier transactions with respect to UDSA's export and foreign assistance programs will not be considered lower tier covered transactions for the purposes of this part. The export or substitution of Federal timber governed by the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act of 1990, 16 U.S.C. 620 T3et seq.G1T1 (the ``Export Act''), is specifically excluded from the coverage of this rule. The Export Act provides separate statutory authority to debar persons engaged in both primary covered transactions and lower tier transactions.
I11(ii) With respect to paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, for USDA's domestic food assistance programs, only the initial such procurement contract and the first tier subcontract under that procurement contract shall be considered lower tier covered transactions.
I11(iii) With respect to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the following USDA transactions also are not covered: transactions under programs which provide statutory entitlements and make available loans to individuals and entities in their capacity as producers of agricultural commodities; transactions under conservation programs; transactions under warehouse licensing programs; the receipt of licenses, permits, certificates, and indemnification under regulatory programs conducted in the interest of public health and safety and animal and plant health and safety; the receipt of official grading and inspection services, animal damage control services, public health and safety inspection services, and animal and plant health and safety inspection services; if the person is a State or local government, the provision of official grading and inspection services, animal damage control services, public health and safety inspection services, animal and plant health and safety inspection services; and permits, licenses, exchanges and other acquisitions of real property, rights of way, and easements under natural resource management programs.
I11(b) T3Relationship to other sections.G1T1 This section describes the types of transactions to which a debarment or suspension under the regulations will apply. Subpart B, ``Effect of Action,'' �1A3017.200, ``Debarment or suspension,'' sets forth the consequences of a debarment or suspension. Those consequences would obtain only with respect to participants and principals in the covered transactions and activities described in �1A3017.110(a). Sections 3017.325, ``Scope of debarment,'' and 3017.420, ``Scope of suspension,'' govern the extent to which a specific participant or organizational elements of a participant would be automatically included within a debarment or suspension action, and the conditions under which affiliates or persons associated with a participant may also be brought within the scope of the action. 
I11(c) T3Relationship to Federal procurement activities.G1T1 In accordance with E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Public Law 103�09355, any debarment, suspension, proposed debarment or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for Executive Branch agencies and participants as an exclusion under this regulation. Similarly, any debarment, suspension or other governmentwide exclusion initiated under this regulation on or after August 25, 1995 shall be recognized by and effective for those agencies as a debarment or suspension under the FAR.

I80�1A3017.115 
I89Policy. 
I11(a) In order to protect the public interest, it is the policy of the Federal Government to conduct business only with responsible persons. Debarment and suspension are discretionary actions that, taken in accordance with Executive Order 12549 and these regulations, are appropriate means to implement this policy. 
I11(b) Debarment and suspension are serious actions which shall be used only in the public interest and for the Federal Government's protection and not �139�for purposes of punishment. Agencies may impose debarment or suspension for the causes and in accordance with the procedures set forth in these regulations.

I11The suspending official may modify or terminate the suspension (for example, see �1A3017.320(c) for reasons for reducing the period or scope of debarment) or may leave it in force. However, a decision to modify or terminate the suspension shall be without prejudice to the subsequent imposition of suspension by any other agency or debarment by any agency. The decision shall be rendered in accordance with the following provisions:
I11(a) T3No additional proceedings necessary.G1T1 In actions: based on an indictment, conviction, or civil judgment; in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts; or in which additional proceedings to determine disputed material facts have been denied on the basis of Department of Justice advice, the suspending official shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the respondent. The decision shall be made within 45 days after receipt of any information and argument submitted by the respondent, unless the suspending official extends this period for good cause.
I11(1) In USDA, the suspending official shall terminate the suspension immediately when additional proceedings to determine disputed facts have been denied on the basis of DOJ advice.

I11(2) In USDA suspension actions, where the respondent(s) fail(s) to timely provide any submission in opposition, the action will be considered decided.
I11(b) T3Additional proceedings necessary.G1T1 (1) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, written findings of fact shall be prepared. The suspending official shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the respondent and any other information in the administrative record. 
I11(2) The suspending official may refer matters involving disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may reject any such findings, in whole or in part, only after specificially determining them to be arbitrary or capricious or clearly erroneous. 
I11(c) T3Notice of suspending official's decision.G1T1 Prompt written notice of the suspending official's decision shall be sent to the respondent.
I11(1) In USDA, the notice to the respondent shall be signed by the suspending official and transmitted by certified mail, return receipt requested. OGC will be consulted on all proposed suspension actions prior to the notice being sent to the respondent. The notice shall include the following:
I11(i) Reference to the previously issued notice of suspension;
I11(ii) The reason(s) for the action taken in this notice. 
I11(iii) The effective date(s) of the suspension taken in this notice and, where appropriate, the period of the suspension; 
I11(iv) Advice that the suspension is effective for covered transactions throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government unless an agency head or a designee authorized by an agency head makes a determination referred to in �1A3017.215.

I11(b) If legal or administrative proceedings are not initiated within 12 months after the date of the suspension notice, the suspension shall be terminated unless an Assistant Attorney General or United States Attorney requests its extension in writing, in which case it may be extended for an additional six months. In no event may a suspension extend beyond 18 months, unless such proceedings have been initiated within that period.
I11(c) The suspending official shall notify the Department of Justice of an impending termination of a suspension, at least 30 days before the 12-month period expires, to give that Department an opportunity to request an extension.

I211. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary participant is providing the certification set out below. 
I212. The inability of a person to provide the certification required below will not necessarily result in denial of participation in this covered transaction. The prospective participant shall submit an explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out below. The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with the department or agency's determination whether to enter into this transaction. However, failure of the prospective primary participant to furnish a certification or an explanation shall disqualify such person from participation in this transaction. 
I213. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when the department or agency determined to enter into this transaction. If it is later determined that the prospective primary participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or default. 
I214. The prospective primary participant shall provide immediate written notice to the department or agency to which this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective primary participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. 
I215. The terms T3covered transaction, debarred, suspended, ineligible, lower tier covered transaction, participant, person, primary covered transaction, principal, proposal, and voluntarily excludedG1T1, as used in this clause, have the meanings set out in the Definitions and Coverage sections of the rules implementing Executive Order 12549. You may contact the department or agency to which this proposal is being submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.

I217. The prospective primary participant further agrees by submitting this proposal that it will include the clause titled ``Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and Voluntary Exclusion-Lower Tier Covered Transaction,'' provided by the department or agency entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier covered transactions. 
I218. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A participant may decide the method and frequency by which it determines the eligibility of its principals. Each participant may, but is not required to, check the List of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Nonprocurement Programs. 
I219. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. 
I2110. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these instructions, if a participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the Federal Government, the department or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or default.

I73Instructions for Certification
I211. By signing and/or submitting this application or grant agreement, the grantee is providing the certification set out below. 
I212. The certification set out below is a material representation of fact upon which reliance is placed when the agency awards the grant. If it is later determined that the grantee knowingly rendered a false certification, or otherwise violates the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act, the agency, in addition to any other remedies available to the Federal Government, may take action authorized under the Drug-Free Workplace Act. 
I213. For grantees other than individuals, Alternate I applies. 
I214. For grantees who are individuals, Alternate II applies. 
I215. Workplaces under grants, for grantees other than individuals, need not be identified on the certification. If known, they may be identified in the grant application. If the grantee does not identify the workplaces at the time of application, or upon award, if there is no application, the grantee must keep the identity of the workplace(s) on file in its office and make the information available for Federal inspection. Failure to identify all known workplaces constitutes a violation of the grantee's drug-free workplace requirements. 
I216. Workplace identifications must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the grant takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios). 
I217. If the workplace identified to the agency changes during the performance of the grant, the grantee shall inform the agency of the change(s), if it previously identified the workplaces in question (see paragraph five). 
I218. Definitions of terms in the Nonprocurement Suspension and Debarment common rule and Drug-Free Workplace common rule apply to this certification. Grantees' attention is called, in particular, to the following definitions from these rules: 
I21T3Controlled substanceG1T1 means a controlled substance in Schedules I through V of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812) and as further defined by regulation (21 CFR 1308.11 through 1308.15); 
I21T3ConvictionG1T1 means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the Federal or State criminal drug statutes; 
I21T3Criminal drug statuteG1T1 means a Federal or non-Federal criminal statute involving the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, or possession of any controlled substance; 
I21T3EmployeeG1T1 means the employee of a grantee directly engaged in the performance of work under a grant, including: (i) All T3direct chargeG1T1 employees; (ii) All T3indirect chargeG1T1 employees unless their impact or involvement is insignificant to the performance of the grant; and, (iii) Temporary personnel and consultants who are directly engaged in the performance of work under the grant and who are on the grantee's payroll. This definition does not include workers not on the payroll of the grantee (e.g., volunteers, even if used to meet a matching requirement; consultants or independent contractors not on the grantee's payroll; or employees of subrecipients or subcontractors in covered workplaces).

I11(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.
I11(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:
I11(1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and, 
I11(2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.
I11(d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
I11(1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action; 
I11(2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

I89Professional and technical services.
I11(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in �1A3018.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement. 
I11(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ``professional and technical services'' shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of �160�his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
I11(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
I11(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
I11(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
�161�I11(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.
I11(f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

I80�1A3019.4
I89Deviations.
I11The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may grant exceptions for classes of grants or recipients subject to the requirements of this part when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in the interest of maximum uniformity, exceptions from the requirements of this part shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. Federal awarding agencies may apply more restrictive requirements to a class of recipients when approved by OMB. Federal awarding agencies may apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for those requirements which are statutory. Exceptions on a case-by-case basis may also be made by Federal awarding agencies.

I80�1A3019.5
I89Subawards.
I11Unless sections of this part specifically exclude subrecipients from coverage, the provisions of this part shall be applied to subrecipients performing work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher education, hospitals or other non-profit organizations. State and local government subrecipients are subject to the provisions of regulations implementing the grants management common rule, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Government,'' codified at 7 CFR part 3016.

I89Purpose.
I11Sections 3019.11 through 3019.17 prescribe forms and instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying for Federal awards. 

I80�1A3019.11
I89Pre-award policies.
I11(a) T3Use of grants and cooperative agreements, and contracts.G1T1 In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301�0908) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for �172�choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, ``substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.'' Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.
I11(b) T3Public notice and priority setting.G1T1 Federal awarding agencies shall notify the public of its intended funding priorities for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute.

I80�1A3019.12
I89Forms for applying for Federal assistance.
I11(a) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, ``Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public,'' with regard to all forms used by the Federal awarding agency in place of or as a supplement to the Standard Form 424 (SF�09424) series.
I11(b) Applicants shall use the SF�09424 series or those forms and instructions prescribed by the Federal awarding agency.
I11(c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' the applicant shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF�09424 (Application for Federal Assistance) indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for a particular State can be obtained from the Federal awarding agency or the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State for review. The U.S. Department of Agriculture procedures implementing E.O. 12372 are found at CFR part 3015.
I11(d) Federal awarding agencies that do not use the SF�09424 form should indicate whether the application is subject to review by the State under E.O. 12372.

I80�1A3019.13
I89Debarment and suspension.
I11Federal awarding agencies and recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12669, ``Debarment and Suspension,'' codified at 7 CFR 3017. This common rule restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.

I80�1A3019.14
I89Special award conditions.
I11If an applicant or recipient.
I11(a) Has a history of poor performance,
I11(b) Is not financially stable,
I11(c) Has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this part,
I11(d) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or
I11(e) Is not otherwise responsible,
Q02I10Federal awarding agencies may impose additional requirements as needed, provided that such applicant or recipient is notified in writing as to: the nature of the additional requirements, the reason why the additional requirements are being imposed, the nature of the corrective action needed, the time allowed for completing the corrective actions, and the method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed. Any special conditions shall be promptly removed once the conditions that prompted them have been corrected.

I80�1A3019.15
I89Metric system of measurement.
I11The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where the use of the system is initially �173�impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, ``Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.''

I80�1A3019.16
I89Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
I11Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94�09580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247�09254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

I80�1A3019.17
I89Certifications and representations.
I11Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal awarding agency is authorized and encouraged to allow recipients to submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive order, or regulation on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications and representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the pertinent requirements.

I84Financial and Program Management

I80�1A3019.20 
I89Purpose of financial and program management.
I11Sections 3019.21 through 3019.28 prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making payments and rules for: satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.

I80�1A3019.21 
I89Standards for financial management systems.
I11(a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical.
I11(b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following.
I11(1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in �1A3019.52. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.
I11(2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.
I11(3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.
I11(4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data.
I11(5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101�09453) govern, payment methods of State �174�agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, ``Withdrawal of Cash From the Treasury for Advances Under Federal Grant and Other Programs.''
I11(6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.
I11(7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation.
I11(c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal USDA awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.
I11(d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.
I11(e) Where bonds are required in the situations described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business With the United States.''

I80�1A3019.22 
I89Payment.
I11(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205.
I11(b) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain: written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in �1A3019.21. Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.
I11(c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding agency to the recipient.
I11(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.
I11(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.
I11(3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.
I11(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF�09270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.
I11(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project.
I11(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.
�175�I11(2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used.
I11(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.
I11(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.
I11(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section apply.
I11(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements.
I11(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the Untied States as defined in OMB Circular A�09129, ``Managing Federal Credit Programs.''
I11(3) Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.
I11(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows.
I11(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, Federal awarding agencies shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.
I11(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.
I11(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).
I11(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraphs (k)(1), (k)(2) or (k)(3) of this section apply.
I11(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.
I11(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.
I11(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.
I11(l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. In keeping with the Electronic Funds Transfer rules, (31 CFR Part 206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIRE Deposit system. Recipients which do not have this capability should use a check. �176�State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.
I11(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.
I11(1) SF�09270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF�09270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF�09271, ``Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.''
I11(2) SF�09271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF�09271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF�09270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.

I80�1A3019.23 
I89Cost sharing or matching.
I11(a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria.
I11(1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.
I11(2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.
I11(3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.
I11(4) Are allowable under the applicable costs principles.
I11(5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching.
I11(6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency.
I11(7) Conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.
I11(b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.
I11(c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section.
I11(1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.
I11(2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project.
I11(d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.
I11(e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits �177�that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.
I11(f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.
I11(g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraphs (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section apply.
I11(1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.
I11(2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved the charges.
I11(h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following qualifications.
I11(1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient.
I11(2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.
I11(3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.
I11(4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value.
I11(5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third parties.
I11(i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its own employees.
I11(ii) The basis for determining the valuation of personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.

I80�1A3019.24 
I89Program income.
I11(a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards set forth in this section in requiring recipient organizations to account for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.
I11(b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one or more of the ways listed in the following.
I11(1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding agency and recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.
I11(2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.
I11(3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs is based.
I11(c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
I11(d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) of this section �178�shall apply automatically unless the awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in �1A3019.14.
I11(e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.
I11(f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.
I11(g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See �1A3019.30 through 3019.37).
I11(h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award.

I80�1A3019.25
I89Revision of budget and program plans.
I11(a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It may include either the Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon Federal awarding agency requirements. It shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.
I11(b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.
I11(c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for one or more of the following program or budget related reasons.

I11(8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.
I11(d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.
I11(e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, Federal awarding agencies are authorized, at their option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this part and OMB Circulars A�0921 and A�09122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following.
�179�I11(1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Federal awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).
I11(2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances.
I11(i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.
I11(ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.
I11(iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.
I11(3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods.
I11(4) For awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in this paragraph (e) are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies.
I11(f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.
I11(g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j) of this section, do not require prior approval.
I11(h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions whenever paragraphs (h)(1), (h)(2) or (h)(3) of this section apply.

This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award.
I11(l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.
I11(m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of �180�30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

I89Non-Federal audits.


I11(a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations (including hospitals) shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501�097507) and revised OMB Circular A�09133, ``Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.''

I11(b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501�097507) and revised OMB Circular A�09133, ``Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.''

I80�1A3019.27
I89Allowable costs.
I11For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A�0987, ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.'' The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A�09122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A�0921, ``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A�09122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.

I80�1A3019.28
I89Period of availability of funds.
I11Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal awarding agency.
I84Property Standards

I80�1A3019.30
I89Purpose of property standards.
I11Sections 3019.31 through 3019.37 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes the provisions of �1A3019.31 through 3019.37.

I80�1A3019.31
I89Insurance coverage.
I11Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the award.

�181�I80�1A3019.32
I89Real property.
I11Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain the following.
I11(a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency.
I11(b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the Federal awarding agency.
I11(c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b), the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more of the following disposition instructions.
I11(1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.
I11(2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
I11(3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.

I80�1A3019.33 
I89Federally-owned and exempt property.
I11(a) T3Federally-owned property.G1T1 (1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency utilization.
I11(2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, ``Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals''). Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency.
I11(b) T3Exempt property.G1T1 When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is ``exempt property.'' Should a Federal awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.

�182�I80�1A3019.34 
I89Equipment.
I11(a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.
I11(b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.
I11(c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:
I11(1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded the original project, then
I11(2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.
I11(d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income.
I11(e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Federal awarding agency.
I11(f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include all of the following.
I11(1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.
I11(i) A description of the equipment.
I11(ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.
I11(iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.
I11(iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.
I11(v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.
I11(vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).
I11(vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.
I11(viii) Unit acquisition cost.
I11(ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.
I11(2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.
I11(3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.
I11(4) A control system shall be in effect to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was �183�owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.
I11(5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.
I11(6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.
I11(g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the Federal awarding agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.
I11(1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.
I11(2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.
I11(3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition. 
I11(4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards.
I11(i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.
I11(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate.
I11(iii) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned equipment.

I80�1A3019.35 
I89Supplies and other expendable property.
I11(a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, �184�the recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment. 
I11(b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.

I80�1A3019.36 
I89Intangible property.
I11(a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under an award. The Federal awarding agency(ies) reserve a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.
I11(b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including government-wide regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''
I11(c) Unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, the Federal Government has the right to:
I11(1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the date first produced under an award, and 
I11(2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.
I11(d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of �1A3019.34(g).

I80�1A3019.37 
I89Property trust relationship.
I11Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. Agencies may require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.
I84Procurement Standards

I80�1A3019.40 
I89Purpose of procurement standards.
I11Sections 3019.41 through 3019.48 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or approved by OMB.

I80�1A3019.41 
I89Recipient responsibilities.
I11The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction. 

�185�I80�1A3019.42 
I89Codes of conduct.
I11The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

I80�1A3019.43 
I89Competition.
I11All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interests as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.

I80�1A3019.44 
I89Procurement procedures.
I11(a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section apply.
I11(1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items.
I11(2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government.
I11(3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following:
I11(i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.
I11(ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.
I11(iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.
I11(iv) The specific features of ``brand name or equal'' descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the solicitation.
I11(v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of measurement.
I11(vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.
I11(b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further this goal.
�186�I11(1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.
I11(2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange time frames for purchases and contracts to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
I11(3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.
I11(4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.
I11(5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.
I11(c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The ``cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost'' or ``percentage of construction cost'' methods of contracting shall not be used.
I11(d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the term and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.''
I11(e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.
I11(1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in the Federal awarding agency's implementation of this part.
I11(2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently $25,000) and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.
I11(3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a ``brand name'' product.
I11(4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement.
I11(5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small purchase threshold.

I80�1A3019.45
I89Cost and price analysis.
I11Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability.

I80�1A3019.46
I89Procurement records.
I11Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following at a minimum:
I11(a) Basis for contractor selection,
I11(b) Justification for lack of competition bids or offers are not obtained, and
I11(c) Basis for award cost or price.

I80�1A3019.47
I89Contract administration.
I11A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, �187�conditions and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract.

I80�1A3019.48
I89Contract provisions.
I11The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.
I11(a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.
I11(b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.
I11(c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,00. For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.
I11(1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.
I11(2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.
I11(3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.
I11(4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.''
I11(d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to the effect that the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.
I11(e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of Appendix A to this part, as applicable.
I84Reports and Records 

I80�1A3019.50 
I89Purpose of reports and records. 
I11Sections 3019.51 through 3019.53 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. �188�They also set forth record retention requirements.

I80�1A3019.51 
I89Monitoring and reporting program performance.
I11(a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function or activity supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements as delineated in Section 3019.26.
I11(b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple years awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award.
I11(c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.
I11(d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following.
I11(1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. 
I11(2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.
I11(3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.
I11(e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.
I11(f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.

I11(a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients.
I11(1) SF�09269 or SF�09269A, Financial Status Report.
I11(i) Each Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF�09269 or SF�09269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF�09269 or SF�09269A when the SF�09270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF�09272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provided adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF�09269 or SF�09269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF�09270 is used only for advances.
I11(ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.
I11(iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report �189�shall be required at the completion of the agreement.
I11(iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF�09269 or SF�09269A (an original and no more than two copies no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semi- 
Q02I10annual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the Federal awarding agency upon request of the recipient.
I11(2) SF�09272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions.
I11(i) When funds are advanced to recipients the Federal awarding agency shall require each recipient to submit the SF�09272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF�09272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.
I11(ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the ``Remarks'' section of the report.
I11(iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to report in the ``Remarks'' section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.
I11(iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF�09272 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.
I11(v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF�09272 for any one of the following reasons:
I11(A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section;
I11(B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or
I11(C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.
I11(b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.
I11(1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the ``Remarks'' section of the reports.
I11(2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in �1A3019.21, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.
I11(3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.
I11(4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.
I11(5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes to the accuracy of reporting.

I80�1A3019.53 
I89Retention and access requirements for records.
I11(a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. Federal awarding agencies shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients. 
I11(b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or �190�annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as authorized by the Federal awarding agency. The only exceptions are the following.
I11(1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.
I11(2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.
I11(3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.
I11(4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. as specified in paragraph (g) of this section.
I11(c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.
I11(d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal awarding agency may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.
I11(e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.
I11(f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall place restrictions on receipts that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency.
I11(g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).
I11(1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.
I11(2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.
I84Termination and Enforcement

I80�1A3019.60 
I89Purpose of termination and enforcement.
I11Sections 3019.61 and 3019.62 set forth uniform suspension, termination and enforcement procedures.

I80�1A3019.61 
I89Termination.
I11(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section apply.
�191�I11(1) By the Federal awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.
I11(2) By the Federal awarding agency with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.
I11(3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section.
I11(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in �1A3019.71(a), including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.

I80�1A3019.62 
I89Enforcement.
I11(a) T3Remedies for noncompliance.G1T1 If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the Federal awarding agency may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in �1A3019.14, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.
I11(1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the Federal awarding agency.
I11(2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.
I11(3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.
I11(4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.
I11(5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.
I11(b) T3Hearings and appeals.G1T1 In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.
I11(c) T3Effects of suspension and termination.G1T1 Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension of termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section apply.
I11(1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.
I11(2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.
I11(d) T3Relationship to debarment and suspension.G1T1 The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding agency implementing regulations (see �1A3019.13).

I56Subpart D_After-the-Award Requirements

I11(g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, the Federal awarding agency shall retain the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.

I80�1A3019.72 
I89Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

I11(5) Records retention as required in �1A3019.53.
I11(b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of the Federal awarding agency and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in �1A3019.73(a), including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.

I80�1A3019.73 
I89Collection of amounts due.
I11(a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, the Federal awarding agency may reduce the debt by:
I11(1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursements.
I11(2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient.
I11(3) Taking other action permitted by statute.
I11(b) Except as otherwise provided by law, the Federal awarding agency shall charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR Chapter II, ``Federal Claims Collection Standards.''

When designating an ``other cluster,'' a State shall identify the Federal awards included in the cluster and advise the subrecipients of compliance requirements applicable to the cluster, consistent with �1A3052.400(d)(1) and �1A3052.400(d)(2), respectively. A cluster of programs shall be considered as one program for determining major programs, as described in �1A3052.520, and, with the exception of R&D as described in �1A3052.200(c), whether a program-specific audit may be elected.

I89Audit requirements.  
I11(a) T3Audit required.G1T1 Non-Federal entities that expend $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part. Guidance on determining Federal awards expended is provided in �1A3052.205. 
I11(b) T3Single audit.G1T1 Non-Federal entities that expend $300,000 or more in a year in Federal awards shall have a single audit conducted in accordance with �1A3052.500 except when they elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.  
I11(c) T3Program-specific audit election.G1T1 When an auditee expends Federal awards under only one Federal program (excluding R&D) and the Federal program's laws, regulations, or grant agreements do not require a financial statement audit of the auditee, the auditee may elect to have a program-specific audit conducted in accordance with �1A3052.235. A program-specific audit may not be elected for R&D unless all of the Federal awards expended were received from the same Federal agency, or the same Federal agency and the same pass-through entity, and that Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, approves in advance a program-specific audit.  
I11(d) T3Exemption when Federal awards expended are less than $300,000.G1T1 Non-Federal entities that expend less than $300,000 a year in Federal awards are exempt from Federal audit requirements for that year, except as noted in �1A3052.215(a), but records must be available for review or audit by appropriate officials of the Federal agency, pass-through entity, and General Accounting Office (GAO).  
I11(e) T3Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC).G1T1 Management of an auditee that owns or operates a FFRDC may elect to treat the FFRDC as a separate entity for purposes of this part.  


�198�I80�1A3052.205 
I89Basis for determining Federal awards expended.  
I11(a) T3Determining Federal awards expended.G1T1 The determination of when an award is expended should be based on when the activity related to the award occurs. Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the non-Federal entity to comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, such as: expenditure/expense transactions associated with grants, cost-reimbursement contracts, cooperative agreements, and direct appropriations; the disbursement of funds passed through to subrecipients; the use of loan proceeds under loan and loan guarantee programs; the receipt of property; the receipt of surplus property; the receipt or use of program income; the distribution or consumption of food commodities; the disbursement of amounts entitling the non-Federal entity to an interest subsidy; and, the period when insurance is in force.  
I11(b) T3Loan and loan guarantees (loans).G1T1 Since the Federal Government is at risk for loans until the debt is repaid, the following guidelines shall be used to calculate the value of Federal awards expended under loan programs, except as noted in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section:  
I11(1) Value of new loans made or received during the fiscal year; plus  
I11(2) Balance of loans from previous years for which the Federal Government imposes continuing compliance requirements; plus  
I11(3) Any interest subsidy, cash, or administrative cost allowance received.  
I11(c) T3Loan and loan guarantees (loans) at institutions of higher education.G1T1 When loans are made to students of an institution of higher education but the institution does not make the loans, then only the value of loans made during the year shall be considered Federal awards expended in that year. The balance of loans for previous years is not included as Federal awards expended because the lender accounts for the prior balances.  
I11(d) T3Prior loan and loan guarantees (loans).G1T1 Loans, the proceeds of which were received and expended in prior-years, are not considered Federal awards expended under this part when the laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements pertaining to such loans impose no continuing compliance requirements other than to repay the loans.  
I11(e) T3Endowment funds.G1T1 The cumulative balance of Federal awards for endowment funds which are federally restricted are considered awards expended in each year in which the funds are still restricted. 

I11(f) T3Free rent.G1T1 Free rent received by itself is not considered a Federal award expended under this part. However, free rent received as part of an award to carry out a Federal program shall be included in determining Federal awards expended and subject to audit under this part. 
I11(g) T3Valuing non-cash assistance.G1T1 Federal non-cash assistance, such as free rent, food stamps, food commodities, donated property, or donated surplus property, shall be valued at fair market value at the time of receipt or the assessed value provided by the Federal agency. 
I11(h) T3Medicare.G1T1 Medicare payments to a non-Federal entity for providing patient care services to Medicare eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part. 
I11(i) T3Medicaid.G1T1 Medicaid payments to a subrecipient for providing patient care services to Medicaid eligible individuals are not considered Federal awards expended under this part unless a State requires the funds to be treated as Federal awards expended because reimbursement is on a cost-reimbursement basis. 
I11(j) T3Certain loans provided by the National Credit Union Administration.G1T1 For purposes of this part, loans made from the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and the Central Liquidity Facility that are funded by contributions from insured institutions are not considered Federal awards expended. 


I80�1A3052.210 
I89Subrecipient and vendor determinations. 
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 An auditee may be a recipient, a subrecipient, and a vendor. Federal awards expended as a recipient or a subrecipient would be subject to audit under this part. The payments received for goods or services provided as a vendor would not be considered �199�Federal awards. The guidance in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section should be considered in determining whether payments constitute a Federal award or a payment for goods and services. 
I11(b) T3Federal award.G1T1 Characteristics indicative of a Federal award received by a subrecipient are when the organization: 
I11(1) Determines who is eligible to receive what Federal financial assistance; 
I11(2) Has its performance measured against whether the objectives of the Federal program are met; 
I11(3) Has responsibility for programmatic decision making; 
I11(4) Has responsibility for adherence to applicable Federal program compliance requirements; and 
I11(5) Uses the Federal funds to carry out a program of the organization as compared to providing goods or services for a program of the pass-through entity. 
I11(c) T3Payment for goods and services.G1T1 Characteristics indicative of a payment for goods and services received by a vendor are when the organization: 
I11(1) Provides the goods and services within normal business operations; 
I11(2) Provides similar goods or services to many different purchasers; 
I11(3) Operates in a competitive environment; 
I11(4) Provides goods or services that are ancillary to the operation of the Federal program; and 
I11(5) Is not subject to compliance requirements of the Federal program. 
I11(d) T3Use of judgment in making determination.G1T1 There may be unusual circumstances or exceptions to the listed characteristics. In making the determination of whether a subrecipient or vendor relationship exists, the substance of the relationship is more important than the form of the agreement. It is not expected that all of the characteristics will be present and judgment should be used in determining whether an entity is a subrecipient or vendor. 
I11(e) T3For-profit subrecipient.G1T1 Since this part does not apply to for-profit subrecipients, the pass-through entity is responsible for establishing requirements, as necessary, to ensure compliance by for-profit subrecipients. The contract with the for-profit subrecipient should describe applicable compliance requirements and the for-profit subrecipient's compliance responsibility. Methods to ensure compliance for Federal awards made to for-profit subrecipients may include pre-award audits, monitoring during the contract, and post-award audits. 
I11(f) T3Compliance responsibility for vendors.G1T1 In most cases, the auditee's compliance responsibility for vendors is only to ensure that the procurement, receipt, and payment for goods and services comply with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements. Program compliance requirements normally do not pass through to vendors. However, the auditee is responsible for ensuring compliance for vendor transactions which are structured such that the vendor is responsible for program compliance or the vendor's records must be reviewed to determine program compliance. Also, when these vendor transactions relate to a major program, the scope of the audit shall include determining whether these transactions are in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements. 



I80�1A3052.215 
I89Relation to other audit requirements. 
I11(a) T3Audit under this part in lieu of other audits.G1T1 An audit made in accordance with this part shall be in lieu of any financial audit required under individual Federal awards. To the extent this audit meets a Federal agency's needs, it shall rely upon and use such audits. The provisions of this part neither limit the authority of Federal agencies, including their Inspectors General, or GAO to conduct or arrange for additional audits (e.g., financial audits, performance audits, evaluations, inspections, or reviews) nor authorize any auditee to constrain Federal agencies from carrying out additional audits. Any additional audits shall be planned and performed in such a way as to build upon work performed by other auditors. 
I11(b) T3Federal agency to pay for additional audits.G1T1 A Federal agency that conducts or contracts for additional audits shall, consistent with other applicable laws �200�and regulations, arrange for funding the full cost of such additional audits. 
I11(c) T3Request for a program to be audited as a major program.G1T1 A Federal agency may request an auditee to have a particular Federal program audited as a major program in lieu of the Federal agency conducting or arranging for the additional audits. To allow for planning, such requests should be made at least 180 days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited. The auditee, after consultation with its auditor, should promptly respond to such request by informing the Federal agency whether the program would otherwise be audited as a major program using the risk-based audit approach described in �1A3052.520 and, if not, the estimated incremental cost. The Federal agency shall then promptly confirm to the auditee whether it wants the program audited as a major program. If the program is to be audited as a major program based upon this Federal agency request, and the Federal agency agrees to pay the full incremental costs, then the auditee shall have the program audited as a major program. A pass-through entity may use the provisions of this paragraph for a subrecipient. 


I80�1A3052.220 
I89Frequency of audits. 
I11Except for the provisions for biennial audits provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, audits required by this part shall be performed annually. Any biennial audit shall cover both years within the biennial period. 
I11(a) A State or local government that is required by constitution or statute, in effect on January 1, 1987, to undergo its audits less frequently than annually, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially. This requirement must still be in effect for the biennial period under audit. 
I11(b) Any non-profit organization that had biennial audits for all biennial periods ending between July 1, 1992, and January 1, 1995, is permitted to undergo its audits pursuant to this part biennially. 


I80�1A3052.225 
I89Sanctions.  
I11No audit costs may be charged to Federal awards when audits required by this part have not been made or have been made but not in accordance with this part. In cases of continued inability or unwillingness to have an audit conducted in accordance with this part, Federal agencies and pass-through entities shall take appropriate action using sanctions such as:  
I11(a) Withholding a percentage of Federal awards until the audit is completed satisfactorily;  
I11(b) Withholding or disallowing overhead costs;  
I11(c) Suspending Federal awards until the audit is conducted; or  
I11(d) Terminating the Federal award.  


I80�1A3052.230 
I89Audit costs.  
I11(a) T3Allowable costs.G1T1 Unless prohibited by law, the cost of audits made in accordance with the provisions of this part are allowable charges to Federal awards. The charges may be considered a direct cost or an allocated indirect cost, as determined in accordance with the provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR parts 30 and 31), or other applicable cost principles or regulations.  
I11(b) T3Unallowable costs.G1T1 A non-Federal entity shall not charge the following to a Federal award:  
I11(1) The cost of any audit under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501 T3et seq.G1T1) not conducted in accordance with this part.  
I11(2) The cost of auditing a non-Federal entity which has Federal awards expended of less than $300,000 per year and is thereby exempted under �1A3052.200(d) from having an audit conducted under this part. However, this does not prohibit a pass-through entity from charging Federal awards for the cost of limited scope audits to monitor its subrecipients in accordance with �1A3052.400(d)(3), provided the subrecipient does not have a single audit. For purposes of this part, limited scope audits only include agreed-upon procedures engagements conducted in accordance with either the AICPA's generally accepted auditing standards or attestation standards, that are paid for and arranged by a pass-through entity and address only one or more of the following types of compliance requirements: activities allowed or unallowed; �201�allowable costs/cost principles; eligibility; matching, level of effort, earmarking; and, reporting.  


I80�1A3052.235 
I89Program-specific audits.  
I11(a) T3Program-specific audit guide available.G1T1 In many cases, a program-specific audit guide will be available to provide specific guidance to the auditor with respect to internal control, compliance requirements, suggested audit procedures, and audit reporting requirements. The auditor should contact the Office of Inspector General of the Federal agency to determine whether such a guide is available. When a current program-specific audit guide is available, the auditor shall follow GAGAS and the guide when performing a program-specific audit.  
I11(b) T3Program-specific audit guide not available.G1T1 (1) When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the auditee and auditor shall have basically the same responsibilities for the Federal program as they would have for an audit of a major program in a single audit.  
I11(2) The auditee shall prepare the financial statement(s) for the Federal program that includes, at a minimum, a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the program and notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule, a summary schedule of prior audit findings consistent with the requirements of �1A3052.315(b), and a corrective action plan consistent with the requirements of �1A3052.315(c). 
I11(3) The auditor shall:  
I11(i) Perform an audit of the financial statement(s) for the Federal program in accordance with GAGAS; 
I11(ii) Obtain an understanding of internal control and perform tests of internal control over the Federal program consistent with the requirements of �1A3052.500(c) for a major program;  
I11(iii) Perform procedures to determine whether the auditee has complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program consistent with the requirements of �1A3052.500(d) for a major program; and  
I11(iv) Follow up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee, and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding in accordance with the requirements of �1A3052.500(e).  
I11(4) The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) shall state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:  
I11(i) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statement(s) of the Federal program is presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with the stated accounting policies;  
I11(ii) A report on internal control related to the Federal program, which shall describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests;  
I11(iii) A report on compliance which includes an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements which could have a direct and material effect on the Federal program; and  
I11(iv) A schedule of findings and questioned costs for the Federal program that includes a summary of the auditor's results relative to the Federal program in a format consistent with �1A3052.505(d)(1) and findings and questioned costs consistent with the requirements of �1A3052.505(d)(3).  
I11(c) T3Report submission for program-specific audits.G1T1 (1) The audit shall be completed and the reporting required by paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section submitted within the earlier of 30 days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end of the audit period, unless a longer period is agreed to in advance by the Federal agency that provided the funding or a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide. (However, for fiscal years beginning on or before June 30, 1988, the audit shall be completed and the required reporting shall �202�be submitted within the earlier of 30 days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or 13 months after the end of the audit period, unless a different period is specified in a program-specific audit guide.) Unless restricted by law or regulation, the auditee shall make report copies available for public inspection.  
I11(2) When a program-specific audit guide is available, the auditee shall submit to the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB the data collection form prepared in accordance with �1A3052.320(b), as applicable to a program-specific audit, and the reporting required by the program-specific audit guide to be retained as an archival copy. Also, the auditee shall submit to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity the reporting required by the program-specific audit guide.  
I11(3) When a program-specific audit guide is not available, the reporting package for a program-specific audit shall consist of the financial statement(s) of the Federal program, a summary schedule of prior audit findings, and a corrective action plan as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and the auditor's report(s) described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. The data collection form prepared in accordance with �1A3052.320(b), as applicable to a program-specific audit, and one copy of this reporting package shall be submitted to the Federal clearinghouse designated by OMB to be retained as an archival copy. Also, when the schedule of findings and questioned costs disclosed audit findings or the summary schedule of prior audit findings reported the status of any audit findings, the auditee shall submit one copy of the reporting package to the Federal clearinghouse on behalf of the Federal awarding agency, or directly to the pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient. Instead of submitting the reporting package to the pass-through entity, when a subrecipient is not required to submit a reporting package to the pass-through entity, the subrecipient shall provide written notification to the pass-through entity, consistent with the requirements of �1A3052.320(e)(2). A subrecipient may submit a copy of the reporting package to the pass-through entity to comply with this notification requirement.  
I11(d) T3Other sections of this part may apply.G1T1 Program-specific audits are subject to �1A3052.100 through �1A3052.215(b), �1A3052.220 through �1A3052.230, �1A3052.300 through �1A3052.305, �1A3052.315, �1A3052.320(f) through �1A3052.320(j), �1A3052.400 through �1A3052.405, �1A3052.510 through �1A3052.515, and other referenced provisions of this part unless contrary to the provisions of this section, a program-specific audit guide, or program laws and regulations.

I11(a) T3Auditor procurement.G1T1 In procuring audit services, auditees shall follow the procurement standards prescribed by the Grants Management Common Rule (hereinafter referred to as the ``A�09102 Common Rule'') 7 CFR Part 3016, Circular A�09110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-Profit Organizations,'' or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable (OMB Circulars are available from the Office of Administration, Publications Office, Room 2200, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503). Whenever possible, auditees shall make positive efforts to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, in procuring audit services as stated in the A�09102 Common Rule, OMB Circular A�09110, or the FAR (48 CFR part 42), as applicable. In requesting proposals for audit services, the objectives and scope of the audit should be made clear. Factors to be considered in evaluating each proposal for audit services include the responsiveness to the request for proposal, relevant experience, availability of staff with professional qualifications and technical abilities, the results of external quality control reviews, and price.  
I11(b) T3Restriction on auditor preparing indirect cost proposals.G1T1 An auditor who prepares the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan may not also be selected to perform the audit required by this part when the indirect costs recovered by the auditee during the prior year exceeded $1 million. This restriction applies to the base year used in the preparation of the indirect cost proposal or cost allocation plan and any subsequent years in which the resulting indirect cost agreement or cost allocation plan is used to recover costs. To minimize any disruption in existing contracts for audit services, this paragraph applies to audits of fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1998.  
I11(c) T3Use of Federal auditors.G1T1 Federal auditors may perform all or part of the work required under this part if they comply fully with the requirements of this part.

I89Financial statements.  
I11(a) T3Financial statements.G1T1 The auditee shall prepare financial statements that reflect its financial position, results of operations or changes in net assets, and, where appropriate, cash flows for the fiscal year audited. The financial statements shall be for the same organizational unit and fiscal year that is chosen to meet the requirements of this part. However, organization-wide financial statements may also include departments, agencies, and other organizational units that have separate audits in accordance with �1A3052.500(a) and prepare separate financial statements.  
I11(b) T3Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards.G1T1 The auditee shall also prepare a schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements. While not required, the auditee may choose to provide information requested by Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities to make the schedule easier to use. For example, when a Federal program has multiple award years, the auditee may list the amount of Federal awards expended for each award year separately. At a minimum, the schedule shall:  
I11(1) List individual Federal programs by Federal agency. For Federal programs included in a cluster of programs, list individual Federal programs within a cluster of programs. For R&D, total Federal awards expended shall be shown either by individual award or by Federal agency and major subdivision within the Federal agency. For example, the National Institutes of Health is a major subdivision in the Department of Health and Human Services. 
I11(2) For Federal awards received as a subrecipient, the name of the pass-through entity and identifying number assigned by the pass-through entity shall be included.  
I11(3) Provide total Federal awards expended for each individual Federal program and the CFDA number or other identifying number when the CFDA information is not available.  
�204�I11(4) Include notes that describe the significant accounting policies used in preparing the schedule.  
I11(5) To the extent practical, pass-through entities should identify in the schedule the total amount provided to subrecipients from each Federal program.  
I11(6) Include, in either the schedule or a note to the schedule, the value of the Federal awards expended in the form of non-cash assistance, the amount of insurance in effect during the year, and loans or loan guarantees outstanding at year end. While not required, it is preferable to present this information in the schedule.

I89Audit findings follow-up.  
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 The auditee is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. As part of this responsibility, the auditee shall prepare a summary schedule of prior audit findings. The auditee shall also prepare a corrective action plan for current year audit findings. The summary schedule of prior audit findings and the corrective action plan shall include the reference numbers the auditor assigns to audit findings under �1A3052.510(c). Since the summary schedule may include audit findings from multiple years, it shall include the fiscal year in which the finding initially occurred.  
I11(b) T3Summary schedule of prior audit findings.G1T1 The summary schedule of prior audit findings shall report the status of all audit findings included in the prior audit's schedule of findings and questioned costs relative to Federal awards. The summary schedule shall also include audit findings reported in the prior audit's summary schedule of prior audit findings except audit findings listed as corrected in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or no longer valid or not warranting further action in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.  
I11(1) When audit findings were fully corrected, the summary schedule need only list the audit findings and state that corrective action was taken.  
I11(2) When audit findings were not corrected or were only partially corrected, the summary schedule shall describe the planned corrective action as well as any partial corrective action taken.  
I11(3) When corrective action taken is significantly different from corrective action previously reported in a corrective action plan or in the Federal agency's or pass-through entity's management decision, the summary schedule shall provide an explanation.  
I11(4) When the auditee believes the audit findings are no longer valid or do not warrant further action, the reasons for this position shall be described in the summary schedule. A valid reason for considering an audit finding as not warranting further action is that all of the following have occurred:  
I11(i) Two years have passed since the audit report in which the finding occurred was submitted to the Federal clearinghouse;  
I11(ii) The Federal agency or pass-through entity is not currently following up with the auditee on the audit finding; and  
I11(iii) A management decision was not issued.  
I11(c) T3Corrective action plan.G1T1 At the completion of the audit, the auditee shall prepare a corrective action plan to address each audit finding included in the current year auditor's reports. The corrective action plan shall provide the name(s) of the contact person(s) responsible for corrective action, the corrective action planned, and the anticipated completion date. If the auditee does not agree with the audit findings or believes corrective action is not required, then the corrective action plan shall include an explanation and specific reasons.

I89Responsibilities.  
I11(a) T3Cognizant agency for audit responsibilities.G1T1 Recipients expending more than $25 million a year in Federal awards shall have a cognizant agency for audit. The designated cognizant agency for audit shall be the Federal awarding agency that provides the predominant amount of direct funding to a recipient unless OMB makes a specific cognizant agency for audit assignment. To provide for continuity of cognizance, the determination of the predominant amount of direct funding shall be based upon direct Federal awards expended in the recipient's fiscal years ending in 1995, 2000, 2005, and every fifth year thereafter. For example, audit cognizance for periods ending in 1997 through 2000 will be determined based on Federal awards expended in 1995. (However, for States and local governments that expend more than $25 million a year in Federal awards and have previously assigned cognizant agencies for audit, the requirements of this paragraph are not effective until fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2000.) Notwithstanding the manner in which audit cognizance is determined, a Federal awarding agency with cognizance for an auditee may reassign cognizance to another Federal awarding agency which provides substantial direct funding and agrees to be the cognizant agency for audit. Within 30 days after any reassignment, both the old and the new cognizant agency for audit shall notify the auditee, and, if known, the auditor of the reassignment. The cognizant agency for audit shall:  
I11(1) Provide technical audit advice and liaison to auditees and auditors.  
I11(2) Consider auditee requests for extensions to the report submission due date required by �1A3052.320(a). The cognizant agency for audit may grant extensions for good cause.  
I11(3) Obtain or conduct quality control reviews of selected audits made by non-Federal auditors, and provide the results, when appropriate, to other interested organizations.  
I11(4) Promptly inform other affected Federal agencies and appropriate Federal law enforcement officials of any direct reporting by the auditee or its auditor of irregularities or illegal acts, as required by GAGAS or laws and regulations. 
I11(5) Advise the auditor and, where appropriate, the auditee of any deficiencies found in the audits when the deficiencies require corrective action by the auditor. When advised of deficiencies, the auditee shall work with the auditor to take corrective action. If corrective action is not taken, the cognizant agency for audit shall notify the auditor, the auditee, and applicable Federal awarding agencies and pass-through entities of the facts and make recommendations for follow-up action. Major inadequacies or repetitive substandard performance by auditors shall be referred to appropriate State licensing agencies and professional bodies for disciplinary action.  
I11(6) Coordinate, to the extent practical, audits or reviews made by or for Federal agencies that are in addition to the audits made pursuant to this part, so that the additional audits or reviews build upon audits performed in accordance with this part.  
I11(7) Coordinate a management decision for audit findings that affect the Federal programs of more than one agency.  
I11(8) Coordinate the audit work and reporting responsibilities among auditors �208�to achieve the most cost-effective audit.  
I11(9) For biennial audits permitted under �1A3052.220, consider auditee requests to qualify as a low-risk auditee under �1A3052.530(a).  
I11(b) T3Oversight agency for audit responsibilities.G1T1 An auditee which does not have a designated cognizant agency for audit will be under the general oversight of the Federal agency determined in accordance with �1A3052.105. The oversight agency for audit:  
I11(1) Shall provide technical advice to auditees and auditors as requested.  
I11(2) May assume all or some of the responsibilities normally performed by a cognizant agency for audit.  
I11(c) T3Federal awarding agency responsibilities.G1T1 The Federal awarding agency shall perform the following for the Federal awards it makes:  
I11(1) Identify Federal awards made by informing each recipient of the CFDA title and number, award name and number, award year, and if the award is for R&D. When some of this information is not available, the Federal agency shall provide information necessary to clearly describe the Federal award.  
I11(2) Advise recipients of requirements imposed on them by Federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements.  
I11(3) Ensure that audits are completed and reports are received in a timely manner and in accordance with the requirements of this part.  
I11(4) Provide technical advice and counsel to auditees and auditors as requested.  
I11(5) Issue a management decision on audit findings within six months after receipt of the audit report and ensure that the recipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action.  
I11(6) Assign a person responsible for providing annual updates of the compliance supplement to OMB.  
I11(d) T3Pass-through entity responsibilities.G1T1 A pass-through entity shall perform the following for the Federal awards it makes:  
I11(1) Identify Federal awards made by informing each subrecipient of CFDA title and number, award name and number, award year, if the award is R&D, and name of Federal agency. When some of this information is not available, the pass-through entity shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.  
I11(2) Advise subrecipients of requirements imposed on them by Federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements as well as any supplemental requirements imposed by the pass-through entity.  
I11(3) Monitor the activities of subrecipients as necessary to ensure that Federal awards are used for authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements and that performance goals are achieved.  
I11(4) Ensure that subrecipients expending $300,000 or more in Federal awards during the subrecipient's fiscal year have met the audit requirements of this part for that fiscal year.  
I11(5) Issue a management decision on audit findings within six months after receipt of the subrecipient's audit report and ensure that the subrecipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action.  
I11(6) Consider whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of the pass-through entity's own records.  
I11(7) Require each subrecipient to permit the pass-through entity and auditors to have access to the records and financial statements as necessary for the pass-through entity to comply with this part.  


I80�1A3052.405 
I89Management decision. 
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 The management decision shall clearly state whether or not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial adjustments, or take other action. If the auditee has not completed corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may request additional information or documentation from the auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee.  
I11(b) T3Federal agency.G1T1 As provided in �1A3052.400(a)(7), the cognizant agency for �209�audit shall be responsible for coordinating a management decision for audit findings that affect the programs of more than one Federal agency. As provided in �1A3052.400(c)(5), a Federal awarding agency is responsible for issuing a management decision for findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to recipients. Alternate arrangements may be made on a case-by-case basis by agreement among the Federal agencies concerned.  
I11(c) T3Pass-through entity.G1T1 As provided in �1A3052.400(d)(5), the pass-through entity shall be responsible for making the management decision for audit findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to subrecipients.  
I11(d) T3Time requirements.G1T1 The entity responsible for making the management decision shall do so within six months of receipt of the audit report. Corrective action should be initiated within six months after receipt of the audit report and proceed as rapidly as possible.  
I11(e) T3Reference numbers.G1T1 Management decisions shall include the reference numbers the auditor assigned to each audit finding in accordance with �1A3052.510(c).

I80�1A3052.500 
I89Scope of audit.  
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 The audit shall be conducted in accordance with GAGAS. The audit shall cover the entire operations of the auditee; or, at the option of the auditee, such audit shall include a series of audits that cover departments, agencies, and other organizational units which expended or otherwise administered Federal awards during such fiscal year, provided that each such audit shall encompass the financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards for each such department, agency, and other organizational unit, which shall be considered to be a non-Federal entity. The financial statements and schedule of expenditures of Federal awards shall be for the same fiscal year.  
I11(b) T3Financial statements.G1T1 The auditor shall determine whether the financial statements of the auditee are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The auditor shall also determine whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the auditee's financial statements taken as a whole.  
I11(c) T3Internal control.G1T1 (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor shall perform procedures to obtain an understanding of internal control over Federal programs sufficient to plan the audit to support a low assessed level of control risk for major programs.  
I11(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the auditor shall:  
I11(i) Plan the testing of internal control over major programs to support a low assessed level of control risk for the assertions relevant to the compliance requirements for each major program; and  
I11(ii) Perform testing of internal control as planned in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.  
I11(3) When internal control over some or all of the compliance requirements for a major program are likely to be ineffective in preventing or detecting noncompliance, the planning and performing of testing described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not required for those compliance requirements. However, the auditor shall report a reportable condition (including whether any such condition is a material weakness) in accordance with �1A3052.510, assess the related control risk at the maximum, and consider whether additional compliance tests are required because of ineffective internal control.  
I11(d) T3Compliance.G1T1 (1) In addition to the requirements of GAGAS, the auditor shall determine whether the auditee has complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements that may have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs. 
I11(2) The principal compliance requirements applicable to most Federal programs and the compliance requirements of the largest Federal programs are included in the compliance supplement.  
I11(3) For the compliance requirements related to Federal programs contained in the compliance supplement, an audit �210�of these compliance requirements will meet the requirements of this part. Where there have been changes to the compliance requirements and the changes are not reflected in the compliance supplement, the auditor shall determine the current compliance requirements and modify the audit procedures accordingly. For those Federal programs not covered in the compliance supplement, the auditor should use the types of compliance requirements contained in the compliance supplement as guidance for identifying the types of compliance requirements to test, and determine the requirements governing the Federal program by reviewing the provisions of contracts and grant agreements and the laws and regulations referred to in such contracts and grant agreements.  
I11(4) The compliance testing shall include tests of transactions and such other auditing procedures necessary to provide the auditor sufficient evidence to support an opinion on compliance.  
I11(e) T3Audit follow-up.G1T1 The auditor shall follow-up on prior audit findings, perform procedures to assess the reasonableness of the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with �1A3052.315(b), and report, as a current year audit finding, when the auditor concludes that the summary schedule of prior audit findings materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding. The auditor shall perform audit follow-up procedures regardless of whether a prior audit finding relates to a major program in the current year.  
I11(f) T3Data collection form.G1T1 As required in �1A3052.320(b)(3), the auditor shall complete and sign specified sections of the data collection form.

I89Audit reporting.  
I11The auditor's report(s) may be in the form of either combined or separate reports and may be organized differently from the manner presented in this section. The auditor's report(s) shall state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part and include the following:  
I11(a) An opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards is presented fairly in all material respects in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole.  
I11(b) A report on internal control related to the financial statements and major programs. This report shall describe the scope of testing of internal control and the results of the tests, and, where applicable, refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section.  
I11(c) A report on compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a material effect on the financial statements. This report shall also include an opinion (or disclaimer of opinion) as to whether the auditee complied with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements which could have a direct and material effect on each major program, and, where applicable, refer to the separate schedule of findings and questioned costs described in paragraph (d) of this section. 

I11(d) A schedule of findings and questioned costs which shall include the following three components:  
I11(1) A summary of the auditor's results which shall include:  
I11(i) The type of report the auditor issued on the financial statements of the auditee (i.e., unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);  
I11(ii) Where applicable, a statement that reportable conditions in internal control were disclosed by the audit of the financial statements and whether any such conditions were material weaknesses;  
I11(iii) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any noncompliance which is material to the financial statements of the auditee;  
I11(iv) Where applicable, a statement that reportable conditions in internal control over major programs were disclosed by the audit and whether any such conditions were material weaknesses;  
�211�I11(v) The type of report the auditor issued on compliance for major programs (i.e., unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, or disclaimer of opinion);  
I11(vi) A statement as to whether the audit disclosed any audit findings which the auditor is required to report under �1A3052.510(a);  
I11(vii) An identification of major programs; 
I11(viii) The dollar threshold used to distinguish between Type A and Type B programs, as described in �1A3052.520(b); and  
I11(ix) A statement as to whether the auditee qualified as a low-risk auditee under �1A3052.530.  
I11(2) Findings relating to the financial statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.  
I11(3) Findings and questioned costs for Federal awards which shall include audit findings as defined in �1A3052.510(a).  
I11(i) Audit findings (e.g., internal control findings, compliance findings, questioned costs, or fraud) which relate to the same issue should be presented as a single audit finding. Where practical, audit findings should be organized by Federal agency or pass-through entity.  
I11(ii) Audit findings which relate to both the financial statements and Federal awards, as reported under paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, respectively, should be reported in both sections of the schedule. However, the reporting in one section of the schedule may be in summary form with a reference to a detailed reporting in the other section of the schedule.  


I80�1A3052.510 
I89Audit findings.  
I11(a) T3Audit findings reported.G1T1 The auditor shall report the following as audit findings in a schedule of findings and questioned costs:  
I11(1) Reportable conditions in internal control over major programs. The auditor's determination of whether a deficiency in internal control is a reportable condition for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplement. The auditor shall identify reportable conditions which are individually or cumulatively material weaknesses.  
I11(2) Material noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements related to a major program. The auditor's determination of whether a noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements is material for the purpose of reporting an audit finding is in relation to a type of compliance requirement for a major program or an audit objective identified in the compliance supplement.  
I11(3) Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. Known questioned costs are those specifically identified by the auditor. In evaluating the effect of questioned costs on the opinion on compliance, the auditor considers the best estimate of total costs questioned (likely questioned costs), not just the questioned costs specifically identified (known questioned costs). The auditor shall also report known questioned costs when likely questioned costs are greater than $10,000 for a type of compliance requirement for a major program. In reporting questioned costs, the auditor shall include information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the questioned costs.  
I11(4) Known questioned costs which are greater than $10,000 for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program. Except for audit follow-up, the auditor is not required under this part to perform audit procedures for such a Federal program; therefore, the auditor will normally not find questioned costs for a program which is not audited as a major program. However, if the auditor does become aware of questioned costs for a Federal program which is not audited as a major program (e.g., as part of audit follow-up or other audit procedures) and the known questioned costs are greater than $10,000, then the auditor shall report this as an audit finding. 
I11(5) The circumstances concerning why the auditor's report on compliance for major programs is other than an unqualified opinion, unless such circumstances are otherwise reported as �212�audit findings in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards.  
I11(6) Known fraud affecting a Federal award, unless such fraud is otherwise reported as an audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs for Federal awards. This paragraph does not require the auditor to make an additional reporting when the auditor confirms that the fraud was reported outside of the auditor's reports under the direct reporting requirements of GAGAS.  
I11(7) Instances where the results of audit follow-up procedures disclosed that the summary schedule of prior audit findings prepared by the auditee in accordance with �1A3052.315(b) materially misrepresents the status of any prior audit finding.  
I11(b) T3Audit finding detail.G1T1 Audit findings shall be presented in sufficient detail for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action and for Federal agencies and pass-through entities to arrive at a management decision. The following specific information shall be included, as applicable, in audit findings:  
I11(1) Federal program and specific Federal award identification including the CFDA title and number, Federal award number and year, name of Federal agency, and name of the applicable pass-through entity. When information, such as the CFDA title and number or Federal award number, is not available, the auditor shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award.  
I11(2) The criteria or specific requirement upon which the audit finding is based, including statutory, regulatory, or other citation.  
I11(3) The condition found, including facts that support the deficiency identified in the audit finding.  
I11(4) Identification of questioned costs and how they were computed.  
I11(5) Information to provide proper perspective for judging the prevalence and consequences of the audit findings, such as whether the audit findings represent an isolated instance or a systemic problem. Where appropriate, instances identified shall be related to the universe and the number of cases examined and be quantified in terms of dollar value.  
I11(6) The possible asserted effect to provide sufficient information to the auditee and Federal agency, or pass-through entity in the case of a subrecipient, to permit them to determine the cause and effect to facilitate prompt and proper corrective action.  
I11(7) Recommendations to prevent future occurrences of the deficiency identified in the audit finding.  
I11(8) Views of responsible officials of the auditee when there is disagreement with the audit findings, to the extent practical.  
I11(c) T3Reference numbers.G1T1 Each audit finding in the schedule of findings and questioned costs shall include a reference number to allow for easy referencing of the audit findings during follow-up.  


I80�1A3052.515 
I89Audit working papers.  
I11(a) T3Retention of working papers.G1T1 The auditor shall retain working papers and reports for a minimum of three years after the date of issuance of the auditor's report(s) to the auditee, unless the auditor is notified in writing by the cognizant agency for audit, oversight agency for audit, or pass-through entity to extend the retention period. When the auditor is aware that the Federal awarding agency, pass-through entity, or auditee is contesting an audit finding, the auditor shall contact the parties contesting the audit finding for guidance prior to destruction of the working papers and reports.  
I11(b) T3Access to working papers.G1T1 Audit working papers shall be made available upon request to the cognizant or oversight agency for audit or its designee, a Federal agency providing direct or indirect funding, or GAO at the completion of the audit, as part of a quality review, to resolve audit findings, or to carry out oversight responsibilities consistent with the purposes of this part. Access to working papers includes the right of Federal agencies to obtain copies of working papers, as is reasonable and necessary.  


�213�I80�1A3052.520 
I89Major program determination.  
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 The auditor shall use a risk-based approach to determine which Federal programs are major programs. This risk-based approach shall include consideration of: Current and prior audit experience, oversight by Federal agencies and pass-through entities, and the inherent risk of the Federal program. The process in paragraphs (b) through (I) of this section shall be followed. 

I11(b) T3Step 1.G1T1 (1) The auditor shall identify the larger Federal programs, which shall be labeled Type A programs. Type A programs are defined as Federal programs with Federal awards expended during the audit period exceeding the larger of: 
I11(i) $300,000 or three percent (.03) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended equal or exceed $300,000 but are less than or equal to $100 million.  
I11(ii) $3 million or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended exceed $100 million but are less than or equal to $10 billion.  
I11(iii) $30 million or 15 hundredths of one percent (.0015) of total Federal awards expended in the case of an auditee for which total Federal awards expended exceed $10 billion.  
I11(2) Federal programs not labeled Type A under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be labeled Type B programs.  
I11(3) The inclusion of large loan and loan guarantees (loans) should not result in the exclusion of other programs as Type A programs. When a Federal program providing loans significantly affects the number or size of Type A programs, the auditor shall consider this Federal program as a Type A program and exclude its values in determining other Type A programs. 
I11(4) For biennial audits permitted under �1A3052.220, the determination of Type A and Type B programs shall be based upon the Federal awards expended during the two-year period.  
I11(c) T3Step 2.G1T1 (1) The auditor shall identify Type A programs which are low-risk. For a Type A program to be considered low-risk, it shall have been audited as a major program in at least one of the two most recent audit periods (in the most recent audit period in the case of a biennial audit), and, in the most recent audit period, it shall have had no audit findings under �1A3052.510(a). However, the auditor may use judgment and consider that audit findings from questioned costs under �1A3052.510(a)(3) and �1A3052.510(a)(4), fraud under �1A3052.510(a)(6), and audit follow-up for the summary schedule of prior audit findings under �1A3052.510(a)(7) do not preclude the Type A program from being low-risk. The auditor shall consider: the criteria in �1A3052.525(c), �1A3052.525(d)(1), �1A3052.525(d)(2), and �1A3052.525(d)(3); the results of audit follow-up; whether any changes in personnel or systems affecting a Type A program have significantly increased risk; and apply professional judgment in determining whether a Type A program is low-risk.  
I11(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, OMB may approve a Federal awarding agency's request that a Type A program at certain recipients may not be considered low-risk. For example, it may be necessary for a large Type A program to be audited as major each year at particular recipients to allow the Federal agency to comply with the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (31 U.S.C. 3515). The Federal agency shall notify the recipient and, if known, the auditor at least 180 days prior to the end of the fiscal year to be audited of OMB's approval.  
I11(d) T3Step 3.G1T1 (1) The auditor shall identify Type B programs which are high-risk using professional judgment and the criteria in �1A3052.525. However, should the auditor select Option 2 under Step 4 (paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section), the auditor is not required to identify more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs. Except for known reportable conditions in internal control or compliance problems as discussed in �1A3052.525(b)(1), �1A3052.525(b)(2), and �1A3052.525(c)(1), a single criteria in �1A3052.525 would seldom cause a Type B program to be considered high-risk.  
I11(2) The auditor is not expected to perform risk assessments on relatively �214�small Federal programs. Therefore, the auditor is only required to perform risk assessments on Type B programs that exceed the larger of:  
I11(i) $100,000 or three-tenths of one percent (.003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has less than or equal to $100 million in total Federal awards expended.  
I11(ii) $300,000 or three-hundredths of one percent (.0003) of total Federal awards expended when the auditee has more than $100 million in total Federal awards expended. 
I11(e) T3Step 4.G1T1 At a minimum, the auditor shall audit all of the following as major programs: 
I11(1) All Type A programs, except the auditor may exclude any Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2 (paragraph (c)(1) of this section). 
I11(2)(i) High-risk Type B programs as identified under either of the following two options:  
I11(A) T3Option 1.G1T1 At least one half of the Type B programs identified as high-risk under Step 3 (paragraph (d) of this section), except this paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) does not require the auditor to audit more high-risk Type B programs than the number of low-risk Type A programs identified as low-risk under Step 2.  
I11(B) T3Option 2.G1T1 One high-risk Type B program for each Type A program identified as low-risk under Step 2.  
I11(ii) When identifying which high-risk Type B programs to audit as major under either Option 1 or 2 in paragraph (e)(2)(i) (A) or (B), the auditor is encouraged to use an approach which provides an opportunity for different high-risk Type B programs to be audited as major over a period of time.  
I11(3) Such additional programs as may be necessary to comply with the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. This paragraph (e)(3) may require the auditor to audit more programs as major than the number of Type A programs.  
I11(f) T3Percentage of coverage rule.G1T1 The auditor shall audit as major programs Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, encompass at least 50 percent of total Federal awards expended. If the auditee meets the criteria in �1A3052.530 for a low-risk auditee, the auditor need only audit as major programs Federal programs with Federal awards expended that, in the aggregate, encompass at least 25 percent of total Federal awards expended.  
I11(g) T3Documentation of risk.G1T1 The auditor shall document in the working papers the risk analysis process used in determining major programs.  
I11(h) T3Auditor's judgment.G1T1 When the major program determination was performed and documented in accordance with this part, the auditor's judgment in applying the risk-based approach to determine major programs shall be presumed correct. Challenges by Federal agencies and pass-through entities shall only be for clearly improper use of the guidance in this part. However, Federal agencies and pass-through entities may provide auditors guidance about the risk of a particular Federal program and the auditor shall consider this guidance in determining major programs in audits not yet completed.  
I11(i) T3Deviation from use of risk criteria.G1T1 For first-year audits, the auditor may elect to determine major programs as all Type A programs plus any Type B programs as necessary to meet the percentage of coverage rule discussed in paragraph (f) of this section. Under this option, the auditor would not be required to perform the procedures discussed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.  
I11(1) A first-year audit is the first year the entity is audited under this part or the first year of a change of auditors.  
I11(2) To ensure that a frequent change of auditors would not preclude audit of high-risk Type B programs, this election for first-year audits may not be used by an auditee more than once in every three years.  


I80�1A3052.525 
I89Criteria for Federal program risk.  
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 The auditor's determination should be based on an overall evaluation of the risk of noncompliance occurring which could be material to the Federal program. The auditor shall use auditor judgment and consider criteria, such as described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, to identify risk in Federal programs. Also, as part of the risk analysis, the auditor may wish to discuss a particular Federal program �215�with auditee management and the Federal agency or pass-through entity.  
I11(b) T3Current and prior audit experience.G1T1 (1) Weaknesses in internal control over Federal programs would indicate higher risk. Consideration should be given to the control environment over Federal programs and such factors as the expectation of management's adherence to applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of contracts and grant agreements and the competence and experience of personnel who administer the Federal programs. 
I11(i) A Federal program administered under multiple internal control structures may have higher risk. When assessing risk in a large single audit, the auditor shall consider whether weaknesses are isolated in a single operating unit (e.g., one college campus) or pervasive throughout the entity.  
I11(ii) When significant parts of a Federal program are passed through to subrecipients, a weak system for monitoring subrecipients would indicate higher risk.  
I11(iii) The extent to which computer processing is used to administer Federal programs, as well as the complexity of that processing, should be considered by the auditor in assessing risk. New and recently modified computer systems may also indicate risk.  
I11(2) Prior audit findings would indicate higher risk, particularly when the situations identified in the audit findings could have a significant impact on a Federal program or have not been corrected.  
I11(3) Federal programs not recently audited as major programs may be of higher risk than Federal programs recently audited as major programs without audit findings.  
I11(c) T3Oversight exercised by Federal agencies and pass-through entities.G1T1 (1) Oversight exercised by Federal agencies or pass-through entities could indicate risk. For example, recent monitoring or other reviews performed by an oversight entity which disclosed no significant problems would indicate lower risk. However, monitoring which disclosed significant problems would indicate higher risk.  
I11(2) Federal agencies, with the concurrence of OMB, may identify Federal programs which are higher risk. OMB plans to provide this identification in the compliance supplement.  
I11(d) T3Inherent risk of the Federal program.G1T1 (1) The nature of a Federal program may indicate risk. Consideration should be given to the complexity of the program and the extent to which the Federal program contracts for goods and services. For example, Federal programs that disburse funds through third party contracts or have eligibility criteria may be of higher risk. Federal programs primarily involving staff payroll costs may have a high-risk for time and effort reporting, but otherwise be at low-risk.  
I11(2) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the Federal agency may indicate risk. For example, a new Federal program with new or interim regulations may have higher risk than an established program with time-tested regulations. Also, significant changes in Federal programs, laws, regulations, or the provisions of contracts or grant agreements may increase risk.  
I11(3) The phase of a Federal program in its life cycle at the auditee may indicate risk. For example, during the first and last years that an auditee participates in a Federal program, the risk may be higher due to start-up or closeout of program activities and staff.  
I11(4) Type B programs with larger Federal awards expended would be of higher risk than programs with substantially smaller Federal awards expended.  


I80�1A3052.530 
I89Criteria for a low-risk auditee.  
I11An auditee which meets all of the following conditions for each of the preceding two years (or, in the case of biennial audits, preceding two audit periods) shall qualify as a low-risk auditee and be eligible for reduced audit coverage in accordance with �1A3052.520:  
I11(a) Single audits were performed on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of this part. A non-Federal entity that has biennial audits does not qualify as a low-risk auditee, unless agreed to in advance by the cognizant or oversight agency for audit.  
I11(b) The auditor's opinions on the financial statements and the schedule of expenditures of Federal awards were unqualified. However, the cognizant or �216�oversight agency for audit may judge that an opinion qualification does not affect the management of Federal awards and provide a waiver.  
I11(c) There were no deficiencies in internal control which were identified as material weaknesses under the requirements of GAGAS. However, the cognizant or oversight agency for audit may judge that any identified material weaknesses do not affect the management of Federal awards and provide a waiver.  
I11(d) None of the Federal programs had audit findings from any of the following in either of the preceding two years (or, in the case of biennial audits, preceding two audit periods) in which they were classified as Type A programs:  
I11(1) Internal control deficiencies which were identified as material weaknesses;  
I11(2) Noncompliance with the provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grant agreements which have a material effect on the Type A program; or  
I11(3) Known or likely questioned costs that exceed five percent of the total Federal awards expended for a Type A program during the year.

I89Purpose.
I11(a) This subpart establishes USDA policy regarding the enhancement, protection, and management of the cultural environment.
I11(b) This subpart establishes procedures for implementing Executive Order 11593, and regulations promulgated by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) ``Protection of Historical and Cultural Properties'' in 36 CFR part 800 as required by �1A800.10 of those regulations.
I11(c) Direction is provided to the agencies of USDA for protection of the cultural environment.

I80�1A3100.41
I89Authorities.
I11These regulations are based upon and implement the following laws, regulations, and Presidential directives:
I11(a) T3Antiquities Act of 1906G1T1 (Pub. L. 59�09209; 34 Stat. 225; 16 U.S.C. 431 T3et seq.G1T1) which provides for the protection of historic or prehistoric remains or any object of antiquity on Federal lands; establishes criminal sanctions for unauthorized destruction or appropriation of antiquities; and authorizes scientific investigation of antiquities on Federal lands, subject to permit and regulations. Paleontological resources also are considered to fall within the authority of this Act.
I11(b) T3Historic Sites Act of 1935G1T1 (Pub. L. 74�09292; 49 Stat. 666; 16 U.S.C. 461 T3et seq.G1T1) which authorizes the establishment of National Historic Sites and otherwise authorizes the preservation of properties of national historical or archeological significance; authorizes the designation of National Historic Landmarks; establishes criminal sanctions for violation of regulations pursuant to the Act; authorizes interagency, intergovernmental, and interdisciplinary efforts for the preservation of cultural resources; and other provisions.
I11(c) T3Reservoir Salvage Act of 1960G1T1 (Pub. L. 86�09521; 74 Stat. 220; 16 U.S.C. 469�09469c.) which provides for the recovery and preservation of historical and archeological data, including relics and specimens, that might be lost or destroyed as a result of the construction of dams, reservoirs, and attendant facilities and activities.
I11(d) T3The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966G1T1 as amended (16 U.S.C. 470), which establishes positive national policy for the preservation of the cultural environment, and sets forth a mandate for protection in section 106. The purpose of section 106 is to protect properties on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places through review and comment by the ACHP of Federal undertakings that affect such properties. Properties are listed on the National Register or declared eligible for listing by the Secretary of the Interior. As developed through the ACHP's regulations, section 106 establishes a public interest process in which the Federal agency proposing an undertaking, the State Historic Preservation Officer, the ACHP, interested organizations and individuals participate. The process is designed to insure that properties, impacts on them, and effects to them are identified, and that alternatives to avoid or mitigate an adverse effect on property eligible for the National Register are adequately considered in the planning process.
I11(e) T3The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969G1T1 (NEPA) (Pub. L. 91�09190; 83 �220�Stat. 852; 42 U.S.C. 4321 T3et seq.G1T1) which declares that it is the policy of the Federal Government to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage. Compliance with NEPA requires consideration of all environmental concerns during project planning and execution.
I11(f) T3Executive Order 11593, ``Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment'',G1T1 which gives the Federal Government the responsibility for stewardship of our nation's heritage resources and charges Federal agencies with the task of inventorying historic and prehistoric sites on their lands. E.O. 11593 also charges agencies with the task of identifying and nominating all historic properties under their jurisdiction, and exercising caution to insure that they are not transferred, sold, demolished, or substantially altered.
I11(g) T3Historical and Archeological Data Preservation Act of 1974.G1T1 (Pub. L. 93�09291; 88 Stat. 174.) which amends the Reservoir Salvage Act of 1960 to extend its provisions beyond the construction of dams to any alteration of the terrain caused as a result of any Federal construction project or federally licensed activity or program. In addition, the Act provides a mechanism for funding the protection of historical and archeological data.
I11(h) T3Presidential memorandum of July 12, 1978, ``Environmental Quality and Water Resource Management''G1T1 which directs the ACHP to publish final regulations, implementing section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and further directs each agency with water and related land resources responsibilities to publish procedures implementing those regulations.
I11(i) T336 CFR part 800,G1T1 ``Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties'' which establishes procedures for the implementation of section 106 of the NHPA, and directs publication of agency implementing procedures.

I80�1A3100.42
I89Definitions.
I11All definitions are those which appear in 36 CFR part 800. In addition, the following apply in this rule:
I11T3Cultural resources (heritage resources)G1T1 are the remains or records of districts, sites, structures, buildings, networks, neighborhoods, objects, and events from the past. They may be historic, prehistoric, archeological, or architectural in nature. Cultural resources are an irreplaceable and nonrenewable aspect of our national heritage.
I11T3Cultural environmentG1T1 is that portion of the environment which includes reminders of the rich historic and prehistoric past of our nation.

I80�1A3100.43
I89Policy.
I11(a) The nonrenewable cultural environment of our country constitutes a valuable and treasured portion of the national heritage of the American people. The Department of Agriculture is committed to the management_identification, protection, preservation, interpretation, evaluation and nomination_of our prehistoric and historic cultural resources for the benefit of all people of this and future generations.
I11(b) The Department supports the cultural resource goals expressed in Federal legislation. Executive orders, and regulations.
I11(c) The Department supports the preservation and protection of farms, rural landscapes, and rural communities.
I11(d) The Department is committed to consideration of the needs of American �221�Indians, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians in the practice of their traditional religions. 
I11(e) The Department will aggressively implement these policies to meet goals for the positive management of the cultural environment.

I80�1A3100.44
I89Implementation.
I11(a) It is the intent of the Department to carry out its program of management of the cultural environment in the most effective and efficient manner possible. Implementation must consider natural resource utilization, must exemplify good government, and must constitute a noninflationary approach which makes the best use of tax dollars.
I11(b) The commitment to cultural resource protection is vital. That commitment will be balanced with the multiple departmental goals of food and fiber production, environmental protection, natural resource and energy conservation, and rural development. It is essential that all of these be managed to reduce conflicts between programs. Positive management of the cultural environment can contribute to achieving better land use, protection of rural communities and farm lands, conservation of energy, and more efficient use of resources.
I11(c) In reaching decisions, the long-term needs of society and the irreversible nature of an action must be considered. The Department must act to preserve future options; loss of important cultural resources must be avoided except in the face of overriding national interest where there are no reasonable alternatives.
I11(d) To assure the protection of Native American religious practices, traditional religious leaders and other native leaders (or their representatives) should be consulted about potential conflict areas in the management of the cultural environment and the means to reduce or eliminate such conflicts.

I80�1A3100.45
I89Direction to agencies.
I11(a) Each agency of the Department shall consult with OEQ to determine whether its programs and activities may affect the cultural environment. Then, if needed, the agency, in consultation with the OEQ, shall develop its own specific procedures for implementing section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, Executive Order 11593, the regulations of the ACHP (36 CFR part 800), the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 and other relevant legislation and regulations in accordance with the agency's programs, mission and authorities. Such implementing procedures shall be published as proposed and final procedures in the T4Federal Register,G1T1 and must be consistent with the requirements of 36 CFR part 800 and this subpart. Where applicable, each agency's procedures must contain mechanisms to insure:
I11(1) Compliance with section 106 of NHPA and mitigation of adverse effects to cultural properties on or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places;
I11(2) Clear definition of the kind and variety of sites and properties which should be managed;
I11(3) Development of a long-term program of management of the cultural environment on lands administered by USDA as well as direction for project-specific protection;
I11(4) Identification of all properties listed on or eligible for listing in the National Register that may be affected directly or indirectly by a proposed activity;
I11(5) Location, identification and nomination to the Register of all sites, buildings, objects, districts, neighborhoods, and networks under its management which appear to qualify (in compliance with E.O. 11593);
I11(6) The exercise of caution to assure that properties managed by USDA which may qualify for nomination are not transferred, sold, demolished, or substantially altered;
I11(7) Early consultation with, and involvement of, the State Historic Preservation Officer(s), the ACHP, Native American traditional religious leaders and appropriate tribal leaders, and others with appropriate interests or expertise;
I11(8) Early notification to insure substantive and meaningful involvement by the public in the agency's decisionmaking process as it relates to the cultural environment;
�222�I11(9) Identification and consideration of alternatives to a proposed undertaking that would mitigate or minimize adverse effects to a property identified under paragraph (a)(4) of this section;
I11(10) Funding of mitigation measures where required to minimize the potential for adverse effects on the cultural environment. Funds for mitigation shall be available and shall be spent when needed during the life of the project to mitigate the expected loss; and
I11(11) Development of plans to provide for the management, protection, maintenance and/or restoration of Register sites under its management.
I11(b) Each agency of the Department which conducts programs or activities that may have an effect on the cultural environment shall recruit, place, develop, or otherwise have available, professional expertise in anthropology, archeology, history, historic preservation, historic architecture, and/or cultural resource management (depending upon specific need). Such arrangements may include internal hiring, Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignments, memoranda of agreement with other agencies or Departments, or other mechanisms which insure a professionally directed program. Agencies should use Department of the Interior professional standards (36 CFR 61.5) as guidelines to insure Departmentwide competence and consistency.
I11(c) Compliance with cultural resource legislation is the responsibility of each individual agency. Consideration of cultural resource values must begin during the earliest planning stages of any undertaking. 
I11(d) Agency heads shall insure that cultural resource management activities meet professional standards as promulgated by the Department of the Interior (e.g., 36 CFR parts 60, 63, 66, 1208). 
I11(e) Cultural resource review requirements and compliance with section 106 of NHPA and Executive Order 11593 shall be integrated and run concurrently, rather than consecutively, with the other environmental considerations under NEPA regulations. As such, direct and indirect impacts on cultural resources must be addressed in the environmental assessment for every agency undertaking. In meeting these requirements, agencies shall be guided by regulations implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500�091508) and Department of Agriculture regulations (7 CFR part 3100, subpart B). 
I11(f) Each agency shall work closely with the appropriate State Historic Preservation Officer(s) in their preparation of State plans, determination of inventory needs, and collection of data relevant to general plans or specific undertakings in carrying out mutual cultural resource responsibilities. 
I11(g) Each agency shall, to the maximum extent possible, use existing historic structures for administrative purposes in compliance with Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 and Executive Order 12072, ``Federal Space Management''. 
I11(h) Each agency should consult with Native American traditional religious leaders or their representatives and other native leaders in the development and implementation of cultural resource programs which may affect their religious customs and practices. 

I80�1A3100.46 
I89Responsibilities of the Department of Agriculture. 
I11(a) Within the Department, the responsibility for the protection of the cultural environment is assigned to the Office of Environmental Quality (OEQ). The Office is responsible for reviewing the development and implementation of agency procedures and insuring Departmental commitment to cultural resource goals. 
I11(b) The Director of the OEQ is the Secretary's Designee to the ACHP. 
I11(c) In order to carry out cultural resource responsibilities, there will be professional expertise within the OEQ to advise agencies, aid the Department in meeting its cultural resource management goals, and to insure that all Departmental and agency undertakings comply with applicable cultural resource protection legislation and regulations. 
I11(d) The OEQ will be involved in individual compliance cases only where resolution cannot be reached at the agency level. Prior to the decision to refer a matter to the full Council of the �223�ACHP, the OEQ will review the case and make recommendations to the Secretary regarding the position of the Department. The agency also will consult with the OEQ before reaching a final decision in response to the Council's comments. Copies of correspondence relevant to compliance with Section 106 shall be made available to OEQ.

Q04I21T5Source: T163 FR 57234, Oct. 27, 1998, unless otherwise noted.




I80�1A3200.1
I89Purpose.
I11This Part sets forth the procedures to be utilized by Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the acquisition and transfer of excess property to the 1890 Land Grant Institutions (including Tuskegee University), 1994 Land Grant Institutions, and the Hispanic-Serving Institutions in support of research, educational, technical, and scientific activities or for related programs as authorized by 7 U.S.C. 2206a. Title to the personal property shall pass to the institution.


I80�1A3200.2
I89Eligibility.
I11Institutions that are eligible to receive Federal excess personal property pursuant to the provisions of this part are the 1890 Land Grant Institutions (including Tuskegee University), 1994 Land Grant Institutions, and the Hispanic-Serving Institutions conducting research, educational, technical, and scientific activities or related programs.


I80�1A3200.3
I89Definitions.
I11(a) T31890 Land grant institutionsG1T1_any college or university eligible to receive funds under the Act of August 30, 1890 (7 U.S.C. 321 et.seq.), including Tuskegee University.
I11(b) T31994 Land grant institutionsG1T1_any of the tribal colleges or universities as defined in section 532 of the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994 (7 U.S.C. 301 note).
I11(c) T3Hispanic-serving institutionsG1T1_institutions of higher education as defined in section 316(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1059c (b)).
I11(d) T3Property management officerG1T1_is an authorized USDA or institution official responsible for property management.
I11(e) T3ScreenerG1T1_is an individual designated by an eligible institution and authorized by the General Services Administration (GSA) to visit property sites for the purpose of inspecting personal property intended for use by the institution.
I11(f) T3Excess personal propertyG1T1_is any personal property under the control of a Federal agency that is no longer needed.
I11(g) T3CannibalizationG1T1_is the dismantling of equipment for parts to repair or enhance other equipment.


I80�1A3200.4
I89Procedures.
I11(a) To receive information concerning the availability of Federal excess personal property, an eligible institution's property management officer may contact their regional GSA, Area Utilization Officer. All property management officers of eligible institutions will be placed on the USDA mailing list for information on the availability of property. USDA excess property will first be screened by USDA agencies through the Departmental Excess Personal Property Coordinator (DEPPC) using the PMIS/PROP system.
I11(b) Excess property selected by screeners of eligible institutions should be inspected whenever possible, or the holding agency should be contacted to verify the condition of the items, because interpretation of condition codes varies among Federal agencies.
I11(c) If the condition of the item is acceptable, the institution should ``freeze'' (reserve) items by calling the appropriate GSA office or USDA Departmental Excess Personal Property Coordinator (DEPPC). Since GSA may have several ``freezes'' on a piece of equipment, it is critical that the paperwork be submitted as soon as possible. Further, while transfers of excess personal property normally will be approved by GSA on a first-come-first-serve basis, consideration will be given �228�to such factors as national defense requirements, emergency needs, preclusion of new procurement, energy conservation, equitable distribution, and retention of title in the Government.
I11(d) Eligible institutions may submit property requests by mail or fax on a Standard Form 122, ``Transfer Order Excess Personal Property,'' with a written justification statement (submitted by the recipient) explaining how the property will be used for research, educational, technical, or scientific activity or for related programs.
I11(e) The SF�09122 should be signed by the eligible institution's property management officer or authorized designee.
I11(1) The following information should also be provided:
I11(i) Date prepared.
I11(ii) GSA/DEPPC address.
I11(iii) Ordering Agency and address.
I11(iv) Holding Agency and address.
I11(v) Name and address of Institution.
I11(vi) Location of property.
I11(vii) Shipping instruction (including institution contact person and phone number).
I11(viii) Complete description of property including original acquisition cost, serial number, condition code, and quantity.


I11(2) This statement needs to be added following the property description but does not serve as a justification statement:

Q04



I21The property requested hereon is certified to be used in support of research, educational, technical, and scientific activities or for related programs. This transfer is requested pursuant to the provisions of section 923 of Pub. L. 104�09127 (7 U.S.C. 2206a).

Q04

I11(f) The SF�09122 should be forwarded to USDA for approval and signature by an authorized USDA official. As confirmation of approval, the eligible institution's property management officer will receive a stamped copy of the SF�09122. If the request is disapproved, it will be returned to the property management officer of the eligible institution with an appropriate explanation. All USDA approved SF�09122's will be forwarded to DEPPC or the appropriate GSA office for final approval.
I11(g) Once the excess personal property is physically received, the institution is required to immediately return a copy of the SF�09122 to USDA indicating receipt of requested items. Cancellations should also be reported to USDA.

Q04

I21T5Note: T1USDA shall send an informational copy of all SF�09122's transactions to GSA.


I80�1A3200.5
I89Dollar limitation.
I11There is no dollar limitation on excess personal property obtained under these procedures.


I80�1A3200.6
I89Restrictions.
I11(a) The authorized USDA official will approve the transfer of excess personal property in the following groups for the 1890 Land Grant Institutions (including Tuskegee University), 1994 Land Grant Institutions and the Hispanic-Serving Institutions in support of research, educational, technical, and scientific activities or for related programs:

Q04
I21T5Note to paragraph T1(a): Requests for items in Federal Supply Code Groups other than those listed in this paragraph shall be referred to the Director of OPPM for consideration and approval.

I11(b) Excess personal property may be transferred for the purpose of cannibalization, provided the eligible institution submits a supporting statement which clearly indicates that cannibalizing the requested property for secondary use has greater benefit than utilization of the item in its existing form.
I11(c) Use of the procedures in this part for the purpose of stockpiling of excess personal property for future cannibalization is prohibited. Transfer requests for the purpose of cannibalization will be considered, but are normally subordinate to requests for complete items.


I80�1A3200.7
I89Title.
I11Title to excess personal property obtained under Part 3200 will automatically pass to the 1890 Land Grant Institutions (including Tuskegee University), 1994 Land Grant Institutions, and the Hispanic-Serving Institutions once USDA receives the SF�09122 indicating that the institution has received the property. Note: When competing Federal claims are made for particular items of excess personal property held by agencies other than USDA, with or without payment of reimbursement, GSA will give preference to the Federal agency that will retain title in the Government.


I80�1A3200.8
I89Costs.
I11Excess personal property obtained under this part is provided free of charge. However, the institution must pay all costs associated with packaging and transportation. The institution should specify the method of shipment on the SF�09122.


I80�1A3200.9
I89Accountability and record keeping.
I11USDA requires that Federal excess personal property received by an eligible institution pursuant to this part shall be placed into use for a research, educational, technical, or scientific activity, or for a related purpose, within 1 year of receipt of the property, and used for such purpose for at least 1 year thereafter. The institution's property management officer must establish and maintain accountable records identifying the property's location, description, utilization and value. To ensure that the excess personal property is being used for its intended purpose under this part, compliance reviews will be conducted by an authorized representative of USDA. The review will include site visit inspections of the property and the accountability and record keeping systems.


�230�I80�1A3200.10
I89Disposal.
I11When the property is no longer needed by the institution, it may be used in support of other Federal projects or sold, and the proceeds used for research, educational, technical, and scientific activities, or for related programs of the recipient institution.


I80�1A3200.11
I89Liabilities and losses.
I11USDA assumes no liability with respect to accidents, bodily injury, illness, or any other damages or loss related to excess personal property transferred under this part.

I11(iii) T3Laboratory animal care.G1T1 The responsibility for the humane care and treatment of any laboratory animal, which has the same meaning as ``animal'' in section 2(g) of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2132(g)), used in any research project supported with Special Research Grants Program funds rests with the performing organization. In this regard, all key personnel identified in a proposal and all endorsing officials of �251�the proposed performing entity are required to comply with applicable provisions of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2131 T3et. seq.G1T1) and the regulation promulgated thereunder by the Secretary of Agriculture in 9 CFR parts 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the event that a project involving the use of a laboratory animal is recommended for award, the applicant will be required to submit a statement certifying such compliance. The Grant Application Kit, identified above in �1A3400.4(b), contains forms which are suitable of such certification.
I11(14) T3Current and pending support.G1T1 All proposals must list any other current public or private research support, in addition to the proposed project, to which key personnel listed in the proposal under consideration have committed portions of their time, whether or not salary support for the person(s) involved is included in the budgets of the various projects. This section must also contain analogous information for all projects underway and for pending research proposals which are currently being considered by, or which will be submitted in the near future to, other possible sponsors, including other Departmental programs or agencies. Concurrent submission of identical or similar projects to other possible sponsors will not prejudice its review or evaluation by the Administrator or experts or consultants engaged by the Administrator for this purpose. The Grant Application Kit, identified above in �1A3400.4(b), contains a form which is suitable for listing current and pending support.
I11(15) T3Additions to project description.G1T1 Each project description is expected by the Administrator, members of peer review groups, and the relevant program staff to be complete in itself. However, in those instances in which the inclusion of additional information is necessary, the number of copies submitted should match the number of copies of the application requested in the annual solicitation of proposals as indicated in �1A3400.4(a)(4). Each set of such materials must be identified with the title of the research project as it appears in the Grant Application and the name(s) of the principal investigator(s). Examples of additional materials may include photographs which do not reproduce well, reprints, and other pertinent materials which are deemed to be unsuitable for inclusion in the proposal.
I11(16) T3Organizational management information.G1T1 Specific management information relating to an applicant shall be submitted on a one-time basis prior to the award of a research project grant identified under this part if such information has not been provided previously under this or another program for which the sponsoring agency is responsible. Copies of forms recommended for use in fulfilling the requirements contained in this section will be provided by the agency specified in this part once a research project grant has been recommended for funding. 

I80�1A3400.5
I89Evaluation and disposition of applications.
I11(a) T3Evaluation.G1T1 All proposals received from eligible applicants in accordance with eligible research problem or program areas and deadlines established in the applicable request for proposals shall be evaluated by the Administrator through such officers, employees, and others as the Administrator determines are uniquely qualified in the areas of research represented by particular projects. To assist in equitably and objectively evaluating proposals and to obtain the best possible balance of viewpoints, the Administrator shall solicit the advice of peer scientists, T3ad hocG1T1 reviewers, or others who are recognized specialists in the research program areas covered by the applications received and whose general roles are defined in �1A3400.2(j) and 3400.2(k). Specific evaluations will be based upon the criteria established in subpart B �1A3400.15, unless CSREES determines that different criteria are necessary for the proper evaluation of proposals in one or more specific program areas, and announces such criteria and their relative importance in the annual program solicitation. The overriding purpose of such evaluations is to provide information upon which the Administrator can make informed judgments in selecting proposals for ultimate support. Incomplete, unclear, or poorly organized applications will work to the detriment of applicants during �252�the peer evaluation process. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, all applications should be written with the care and thoroughness accorded papers for publication.
I11(b) T3Disposition.G1T1 On the basis of the Administrator's evaluation of an application in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator will 
I11(1) Approve support using currently available funds, 
I11(2) Defer support due to lack of funds or a need for further evaluations, or 
I11(3) Disapprove support for the proposed project in whole or in part.
Q02I10With respect to approved projects, the Administrator will determine the project period (subject to extension as provided in �1A3400.7(c)) during which the project may be supported. Any deferral or disapproval of an application will not preclude its reconsideration or a reapplication during subsequent fiscal years.

I80�1A3400.6
I89Grant awards.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 Within the limit of funds available for such purpose, the awarding official shall make research project grants to those responsible, eligible applicants whose proposals are judged most meritorious in the announced program areas under the evaluation criteria and procedures set forth in this part. The date specified by the Administrator as the beginning of the project period shall be no later than September 30 of the Federal fiscal year in which the project is approved for support and funds are appropriated for such purpose, unless otherwise permitted by law. All funds granted under this part shall be expended solely for the purpose for which the funds are granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of the award, the applicable Federal cost principles, and the Department's ``Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations'' (part 3015 of this title).
I11(b) T3Grant award document and notice of grant award_G1T1(1) T3Grant award document.G1T1 The grant award document shall include at a minimum the following: 
I11(i) Legal name and address of performing organization or institution to whom the Administrator has awarded a special research project grant under the terms of this part;
I11(ii) Title of project;
I11(iii) Name(s) and address(es) of principal investigator(s) chosen to direct and control approved activities;
I11(iv) Identifying grant number assigned by the Department; 
I11(v) Project period, which specifies how long the Department intends to support the effort without requiring recompetition for funds;
I11(vi) Total amount of Departmental financial assistance approved by the Administrator during the project period;
I11(vii) Legal authority(ies) under which the research project grant is awarded to accomplish the purpose of the law;
I11(viii) Approved budget plan for categorizing allocable project funds to accomplish the stated purpose of the research project grant award; and
I11(ix) Other information or provisions deemed necessary by the Department to carry out its granting activities or to accomplish the purpose of a particular research project grant.
I11(2) T3Notice of grant award.G1T1 The notice of grant award, in the form of a letter, will be prepared and will provide pertinent instructions or information to the grantee that is not included in the grant award document.
I11(c) T3Categories of grant instruments.G1T1 The major categories of grant instruments shall be as follows:
I11(1) T3Standard grant.G1T1 This is a grant instrument by which the Department agrees to support a specified level of research effort for a predetermined project period without the announced intention of providing additional support at a future date. This type of research project grant is approved on the basis of peer review and recommendation and is funded for the entire project period at the time of award.
I11(2) T3Renewal grant.G1T1 This is a document by which the Department agrees to provide additional funding under a standard grant as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for a project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award, provided that the cumulative period does not exceed the statutory limitation. When a renewal application is submitted, it should include a summary of progress �253�to date under the previous grant instrument. Such a renewal shall be based upon new application, T3de novoG1T1 peer review and staff evaluation, new recommendation and approval, and a new award instrument.
I11(3) T3Continuation grant.G1T1 This is a grant instrument by which the Department agrees to support a specified level of effort for a predetermined period of time with a statement of intention to provide additional support at a future date, provided that performance has been satisfactory, appropriations are available for this purpose, and continued support would be in the best interests of the Federal Government and the public. It involves a long-term research project that is considered by peer reviewers and Departmental officers to have an unusually high degree of scientific merit, the results of which are expected to have a significant impact on the food and agricultural sciences, and it supports the efforts of experienced scientists with records of outstanding research accomplishments. This kind of document will normally be awarded for an initial one-year period and any subsequent continuation research project grants will also be awarded in one-year increments. The award of a continuation research project grant to fund an initial or succeeding budget period does not constitute an obligation to fund any subsequent budget period. A grantee must submit a separate application for continued support for each subsequent fiscal year. Requests for such continued support must be submitted in duplicate at least three months prior to the expiration date of the budget period currently being funded. Such requests must include: an interim progress report detailing all work performed to date; a Grant Application; a proposed budget for the ensuing period, including an estimate of funds anticipated to remain unobligated at the end of the current budget period; and current information regarding other extramural support for senior personnel. Decisions regarding continued support and the actual funding levels of such support in future years will usually be made administratively after consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices and within the context of available funds. Since initial peer reviews were based upon the full term and scope of the original special research grant application, additional evaluations of this type generally are not required prior to successive years' support. However, in unusual cases (e.g., when the nature of the project or key personnel change or when the amount of future support requested substantially exceeds the grant application originally reviewed and approved), additional reviews may be required prior to approving continued funding.
I11(4) T3Supplemental grant.G1T1 This is an instrument by which the Department agrees to provide small amounts of additional funding under a standard, renewal, or continuation grant as specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section and may involve a short-term (usually six months or less) extension of the project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award, but in no case may the cumulative period of the project, including short term extensions, exceed the statutory time limitation. A supplement is awarded only if required to assure adequate completion of the original scope of work and if there is sufficient justification of need to warrant such action. A request of this nature normally does not require additional peer review.
I11(d) T3Obligation of the Federal Government.G1T1 Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any research project grant shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any renewal, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application. 



I80�1A3400.7 
I89Use of funds; changes.

I11(a) T3Delegation of fiscal responsibility.G1T1 The grantee may not delegate or transfer in whole or in part, to another person, institution, or organization the responsibility for use or expenditure of grant funds.
I11(b) T3Change in project plans.G1T1 (1) The permissible changes by the grantee, principal investigator(s), or other key project personnel in the approved research project grant shall be limited to changes in methodology, techniques, or �254�other aspects of the project to expedite achievement of the projects' approved goals. If the grantee or the principal investigator(s) is uncertain as to whether a change complies with this provision, the question must be referred to the Administrator for a final determination.
I11(2) Changes in approved goals, or objectives, shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the Department prior to effecting such changes. In no event shall requests for such changes be approved which are outside the scope of the original approved project.
I11(3) Changes in approved project leadership or the replacement or reassignment of other key project personnel shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the Department prior to effecting such changes.
I11(4) Transfers of actual performance of the substantive programmatic work in whole or in part and provisions for payment of funds, whether or not Federal funds are involved, shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the Department prior to effecting such changes, except as may be allowed in the terms and conditions of the grant award.


I11(c) T3Changes in project period.G1T1 The project period determined pursuant to �1A3400.5(b) may be extended by the Administrator without additional financial support for such additional period(s) as the Administrator determines may be necessary to complete or fulfill the purposes of an approved project. Any extension, when combined with the originally approved or amended project period shall not exceed three (3) years (the limitation established by statute) and shall be further conditioned upon prior request by the grantee and approval in writing by the Department, unless prescribed otherwise in the terms and conditions of a grant award.


I11(d) T3Changes in approved budget.G1T1 The terms and conditions of a grant will prescribe circumstances under which written Departmental approval will be requested and obtained prior to instituting changes in an approved budget.

I11(4) Number of copies to be submitted;
I11(5) Forms required to be used when submitting proposals; and
I11(6) Special requirements.
I11(b) T3Application kitG1T1. An Application Kit will be made available to any potential grant applicant who requests a copy. This kit contains required forms, certifications, and instructions applicable to the submission of grant proposals.
I11(c) T3Format for research grant proposalsG1T1. Unless otherwise stated in the specific program solicitation, the following format applies:
I11(1) T3Application for fundingG1T1. All research grant proposals submitted by eligible applicants should contain an Application for Funding form, which must �260�be signed by the proposing principal investigator(s) and endorsed by the cognizant authorized organizational representative who possesses the necessary authority to commit the applicant's time and other relevant resources.
I11(2) T3Title of projectG1T1. The title of the project must be brief (80-character maximum), yet represent the major thrust of the research. This title will be used to provide information to the Congress and other interested parties who may be unfamiliar with scientific terms; therefore, highly technical words or phraseology should be avoided where possible. In addition, phrases such as ``investigation of'' or ``research on'' should not be used.
I11(3) T3ObjectivesG1T1. Clear, concise, complete, enumerated, and logically arranged statement(s) of the specific aims of the research must be included in all proposals.
I11(4) T3ProceduresG1T1. The procedures of methodology to be applied to the proposed research plan should be stated explicitly. This section should include but not necessarily be limited to:
I11(i) A description of the proposed investigations and/or experiments in the sequence in which it is planned to carry them out;
I11(ii) Techniques to be employed, including their feasibility;
I11(iii) Kinds of results expected;
I11(iv) Means by which data will be analyzed or interpreted;
I11(v) Pitfalls which might be encountered; and
I11(vi) Limitations to proposed procedures.
I11(5) T3JustificationG1T1. This section of the grant proposal should describe:
I11(i) The importance of the problem to the needs of the Department and to the Nation, including estimates of the magnitude of the problem;
I11(ii) The importance of starting the work during the current fiscal year; and
I11(iii) Reasons for having the work performed by the proposing organization.
I11(6) T3Literature reviewG1T1. A summary of pertinent publications with emphasis on their relationship to the research should be provided and should include all important and recent publications. The citations should be accurate, complete, written in acceptable journal format, and be appended to the proposal.
I11(7) T3Current researchG1T1. The relevancy of the proposed research to ongoing and, as yet, unpublished research of both the applicant and any other institutions should be described.
I11(8) T3Facilities and equipment.G1T1 All facilities, including laboratories, that are available for use or assignment to the proposed research project during the requested period of support, should be reported and described. Any materials, procedures, situations, or activities, whether or nor directly related to a particular phase of the proposed research, and which may be hazardous to personnel, must be explained fully, along with an outline of precautions to be exercised. All items of major instrumentation available for use or assignment to the proposed research project during the requested period of support should be itemized. In addition, items of nonexpendable equipment needed to conduct and bring the proposed project to a successful conclusion should be listed.
I11(9) T3Collaborative arrangements.G1T1 If the proposed project requires collaboration with other research scientists, corporations, organizations, agencies, or entities, such collaboration must be explained fully and justified. Evidence should be provided to assure peer reviewers that the collaborators involved agree with the arrangements. It should be specifically indicated whether or not such collaborative arrangements have the potential for any conflict(s) of interest. Proposals which indicate collaborative involvements must state which applicant is to receive any resulting grant award, since only one eligible applicant, as provided in �1A3401.3 may be the recipient of a research project grant under one proposal.
I11(10) T3Research timetable.G1T1 The applicant should outline all important research phases as a function of time, year by year.
I11(11) T3Personnel support.G1T1 All personnel who will be involved in the research effort must be identified clearly. For each scientist involved, the following should be included:
I11(i) An estimate of the time commitments necessary;
�261�I11(ii) Vitae of the principal investigator(s), senior associate(s), and other professional personnel to assist reviewers in evaluating the competence and experience of the project staff. This section should include curricula vitae of T3allG1T1 key persons who will work on the proposed research project, whether or not Federal funds are sought for their support. The vitae are to be no more than two pages each in length, excluding publication listings; and
I11(iii) A chronological listing of the most representative publications during the past five years shall be provided for each professional project member of whom a curriculum vitae appears under this section. Authors should be listed in the same order as they appear on each paper cited, along with the title and complete reference as these usually appear in journals.
I11(12) T3Budget.G1T1 A detailed budget is required for each year of requested support. In addition, a summary budget is required detailing requested support for the overall project period. A copy of the form which must be used for this purpose, along with instructions for completion, is included in the Application Kit identified under �1A3401.6(b) and may be reproduced as needed by applicants. Funds may be requested under any of the categories listed, provided that the item or service for which support is requested is allowable under applicable Federal cost principles and can be identified as necessary for successful conduct of the proposed research project. As stated in �1A3401.4 each grant recipient must match the Federal funds expended on a research project based on a formula of 50 percent Federal and 50 percent non-Federal funding. As stated in �1A3401.5, indirect costs and tuition remission costs are not allowable costs for purposes of this program and , thus, may not be used to satisfy the matching requirement set forth in �1A3401.4.
I11(13) T3Research involving special considerations.G1T1 A number of situations encountered in the conduct of research require special information and supporting documentation before funding can be approved for the project. If such situations are anticipated, the proposal must so indicate. It is expected that a significant number of rangeland grant proposals will involve the following:
I11(i) T3Recombinant DNA molecules.G1T1 All key personnel identified in a proposal and all endorsing officials of a proposed performing entity are required to comply with the guidelines establishing by the National Institutes of Health entitled, ``Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules,'' as revised. The Application Kit, identified above in �1A3401.6(b), contains a form which is suitable for such certification of compliance. In the event a project involving recombinant DNA and RNA molecules results in a grant award, the Institutional Biosafety Committee must approve the research before CSREES funds will be released.
I11(ii) T3Human subjects at risk.G1T1 Responsibility for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects used in any research project supported with grant funds provided by the Department rests with the performing entity. Regulations have been issued by the Department under 7 CFR part 1c, Protection of Human Subjects. In the event that a project involving human subjects at risk is recommended for award, the applicant will be required to submit a statement certifying that the research plan has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the proposing organization or institution. The Application Kit, identified above in �1A3401.6(b), contains a form which is suitable for such certification. In the event a project involving human subjects results in a grant award, funds will be released only after the Institutional Committee has approved the project.
I11(iii) T3Laboratory animal care.G1T1 The responsibility for the humane care and treatment of any laboratory animal, which has the same meaning as ``animal'' in section 2(g) of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2132(g)), used in any research project supported with Rangeland Research Grant Program funds rests with the performing organization. In this regard, all key personnel identified in a proposal and all endorsing officials of the proposed performing entity are required to comply with the applicable provisions of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2131 T3et seq.G1T1) �262�and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Secretary of Agriculture in 9 CFR parts 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the event that a project involving the use of a laboratory animal is recommended for award, the applicant will be required to submit a statement certifying such compliance. The Application Kit, identified above in �1A3401.6(b), contains a form which is suitable for such certification. In the event a project involving the use of living vertebrate animals results in a grant award, funds will be released only after the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee has approved the project.
I11(14) T3Current and pending support.G1T1 All proposals must list any other current public or private research support, in addition to the proposed project, to which key personnel listed in the proposal under consideration have committed portions of their time, whether or not salary support for the person(s) involved is included in the budgets of the various projects. This section must also contain analogous information for all projects underway and for pending research proposals which are currently being considered by, or which will be submitted in the near future to, other possible sponsors, including other Departmental programs or agencies. Concurrent submission of identical or similar projects to other possible sponsors will not prejudice its review or evaluation by the Administrator or experts or consultants engaged by the Administrator for this purpose. The Application Kit, identified above in �1A3401.6(b), contains a form which is suitable for listing current and pending support.
I11(15) T3Additions to project description.G1T1 Each project description is expected by the Administrator, members of peer review groups, and the relevant program staff to be complete in itself. However, in those instances in which the inclusion of additional information is necessary, the number of copies submitted should match the number of copies of the application requested in the annual solicitation of proposals as indicated in �1A3401.6(a)(4). Each set of such materials must be identified with the title of the research project as it appears in the Application for Funding and the name(s) of the principal investigator(s). Examples of additional materials may include photographs which do not reproduce well, reprints, and other pertinent materials which are deemed to be unsuitable for inclusion in the proposal.
I11(16) T3National Environmental Policy Act.G1T1 As outlined in CSREES's implementing regulations of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) at 7 CFR part 3407, environmental data or documentation for the proposed project is to be provided to CSREES in order to assist CSREES in carrying out its responsibilities under NEPA. These responsibilities include determining whether the project requires an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement or whether it can be excluded from this requirement on the basis of several categorical exclusions listed in 7 CFR part 3407. In this regard, the applicant should review the categories defined for exclusion to ascertain whether the proposed project may fall within one or more of the exclusions, and should indicate if it does so on the National Environmental Policy Act Exclusions Form (Form CSREES_1234) provided in the Application Kit. Even though the applicant considers that a proposed project may fall within a categorical exclusion, CSREES may determine that an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary for a proposed project should substantial controversy on environmental grounds exist or if other extraordinary conditions or circumstances are present that may cause such activity to have a significant environmental effect.
I11(17) T3Organizational management information.G1T1 Specific management information relating to an applicant shall be submitted on an T3one-time basis prior to the award of a research project grantG1T1 identified under this part if such information has not been provided previously under this or another program for which the sponsoring agency is responsible. Copies of forms recommended for use in fulfilling the requirements contained in this section will be provided by the agency specified in this part once a research project grant has been recommended for funding.

�263�I80�1A3401.7
I89Evaluation and disposition of applications.
I11(a) T3Evaluation.G1T1 All proposals received from eligible applicants in accordance with eligible research problem or program areas and deadlines established in the applicable request for proposals shall be evaluated by the Administrator through such officers, employees, and others as the Administrator determines are particularly qualified in the areas of research represented by particular projects. To assist in equitably and objectively evaluating proposals and to obtain the best possible balance of viewpoints, the Administrator may solicit the advice of peer scientists, T3ad hocG1T1 reviewers, or others who are recognized specialists in the research program areas covered by the applications received. Specific evaluations will be based upon the criteria established in subpart B of this part, �1A3401.17, unless CSREES determines that different criteria are necessary for the proper evaluation of proposals in one or more specific program areas, and announces such criteria and their relative importance in the annual program solicitation. The overriding purpose of such evaluations is to provide information upon which the Administrator can make informed judgments in selecting proposals for ultimate support. Incomplete, unclear, or poorly organized applications will work to the detriment of applicants during the peer evaluation process. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, all applications should be written with the care and thoroughness accorded papers for publication.
I11(b) T3Disposition.G1T1 On the basis of the Administrator's evaluation of an application in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator will approve using currently available funds, defer support due to lack of funds or a need for further evaluations, or disapprove support for the proposed project in whole or in part. With respect to approved projects, the Administrator will determine the project period (subject to extension as provided in �1A3401.9(c)) during which the project may be supported. Any deferral or disapproval of an application will not preclude its reconsideration or a reapplication during subsequent fiscal years.

I80�1A3401.8
I89Grant awards.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 Within the limit of funds available for such purpose, the awarding official shall make research project grants to those responsible, eligible applicants whose proposals are judged most meritorious in the announced program areas under the evaluation criteria and procedures set forth in this part. The date specified by the Administrator as the beginning of the project period shall be no later than September 30 of the Federal fiscal year in which the project is approved for support and funds are appropriated for such purpose, unless otherwise permitted by law. All funds granted under this part shall be expended solely for the purpose for which the funds are granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of the award, the applicable Federal cost principles, and the Department's ``Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations'' (parts 3015 and 3019 of this title).
I11(b) T3Grant award document and notice of grant awardG1T1_(1) T3Grant award documents.G1T1 The grant award document shall include at a minimum the following:
I11(i) Legal name and address of performing organization or institution to whom the Administrator has awarded a rangeland research project grant under the terms of this part;
I11(ii) Title of project;
I11(iii) Name(s) and address(es) of principal investigator(s) chosen to direct and control approved activities; 
I11(iv) Identifying grant number assigned by the Department;
I11(v) Project period, which specifies how long the Department intends to support the effort without requiring recompetition for funds;
I11(vi) Total amount of Departmental financial assistance approved by the Administrator during the project period;
I11(vii) Legal authority(ies) under which the research project grant is awarded to accomplish the purpose of the law; 
I11(viii) Approved budget plan for categorizing allocable project funds to accomplish the stated purpose of the research project grant award; and
�264�I11(ix) Other information or provisions deemed necessary by the Department to carry out its granting activities or to accomplish the purpose of a particular research project grant.
I11(2) T3Notice of grant award.G1T1 The notice of grant award, in the form of a letter, will be prepared and will provide pertinent instructions or information to the grantee that is not included in the grant award document.
I11(c) T3Categories of grant instruments.G1T1 The major categories of grant instruments by which the Department may provide support are as follows:
I11(1) T3Standard grant.G1T1 This is a grant instrument by which the Department agrees to support a specified level of research effort for a predetermined project period without the announced intention of providing additional support at a future date. This type of research project grant is approved on the basis of peer review and recommendation and is funded for the entire project period at the time of award.
I11(2) T3Renewal grant.G1T1 This is a document by which the Department agrees to provide additional funding under a standard grant as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for a project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award, provided that the cumulative period does not exceed the statutory limitation. When a renewal application is submitted, it should include a summary of progress to date under the previous grant instrument. Such a renewal shall be based upon new application, T3de novoG1T1 peer review and staff evaluation, new recommendation and approval, and a new award instrument.
I11(3) T3Continuation grant.G1T1 This is a grant instrument by which the Department agrees to support a specified level of effort for a predetermined period of time with a statement of intention to provide additional support at a future date, provided that performance has been satisfactory, appropriations are available for this purpose, and continued support would be in the best interests of the Federal government and the public. It involves a long-term research project that is considered by peer reviewers and Departmental officers to have an unusually high degree of scientific merit, the results of which are expected to have a significant impact on the productivity of the Nation's rangelands, and it supports the efforts of experienced scientists with records of outstanding research accomplishments. This kind of document normally will be awarded for an initial one-year period and any subsequent continuation research project grants also will be awarded in one-year increments, but in no case may the cumulative period of the project exceed the statutory limit. The award of a continuation research project grant to fund an initial or succeeding budget period does not constitute an obligation to fund any subsequent budget period. A grantee must submit a separate application for continued support for each subsequent fiscal year. Requests for such continued support must be submitted in duplicate at least three months prior to the expiration date of the budget period currently being funded. Such requests must include: an interim progress report detailing all work performed to date; an Application for Funding; a proposed budget for the enuring period, including an estimate of funds anticipated to remain unobligated at the end of the current budget period; and current information regarding other extramural support for senior personnel. Decisions regarding continued support and the actual funding levels of such support in future years usually will be made administratively after consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices and within the context of available funds. Since initial peer reviews were based upon the full term and scope of the original rangeland research application for funding, additional evaluations of this type generally are not required prior to successive years' support. However, in unusual cases (e.g., when the nature of the project or key personnel change or when the amount of future support requested substantially exceeds the application for funding originally reviewed and approved), additional reviews may be required prior to approval of continued funding.
I11(4) T3Supplemental grant.G1T1 This is an instrument by which the Department �265�agrees to provide small amounts of additional funding under a standard, renewal, or continuation grant as specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) of this section and may involve a short-term (usually six months or less) extension of the project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award, but in no case may the cumulative period of the project, including short term extensions, exceed the statutory time limitation. A supplement is awarded only if required to assure adequate completion of the original scope of work and if there is sufficient justification of need to warrant such action. A request of this nature normally does not require additional peer review.
I11(d) T3Obligation of the Federal government.G1T1 Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any research project grant shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any renewal, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.

I80�1A3401.9
I89Use of funds; changes.
I11(a) T3Delegation of fiscal responsibility.G1T1 The grantee may not delegate or transfer in whole or in part, to another person, institution, or organization the responsibility for use or expenditure of grant funds.
I11(b) T3Change in project plans.G1T1 (1) The permissible changes by the grantee, principal investigator(s), or other key project personnel in the approved research project grant shall be limited to changes in methodology, techniques, or other aspects of the project to expedite achievement of the projects' approved goals. If the grantee or the principal investigator(s) is uncertain as to whether a change complies with this provision, the question shall be referred to the Administrator for a final determination.
I11(2) Changes in approved goals, or objectives, shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the Department prior to effecting such changes. In no event shall requests for such changes be approved which are outside the scope of the original approved project.
I11(3) Changes in approved project leadership or the replacement or reassignment of other key project personnel shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the Department prior to effecting such changes.
I11(4) Transfers of actual performance of the substantive programmatic work in whole or in part and provisions for payment of funds, whether or not Federal funds are involved, shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the Department prior to effecting such changes, except as may be allowed in the terms and conditions of a grant award.
I11(c) T3Changes in project period.G1T1 The project period determined pursuant to �1A3401.7(b) may be extended by the Administrator without additional financial support, for such additional period(s) as the Administrator determines may be necessary to complete, or fulfill the purposes of, an approved project. Any extension, when combined with the originally approved or amended project period, shall be conditioned upon prior request by the grantee and approval in writing by the Department, unless prescribed otherwise in the terms and conditions of a grant award.
I11(d) T3Changes in approved budget.G1T1 The terms and conditions of a grant will prescribe circumstances under which written Departmental approval will be requested and obtained prior to instituting changes in an approved budget.

I11Proposals may be submitted by land-grant colleges and universities, by colleges and universities having significant minority enrollments and a demonstrable capacity to carry out the teaching of food and agricultural sciences, and by other colleges and universities having a demonstrable capacity to carry out the teaching of food and agricultural sciences. All applicants should be institutions that confer a graduate degree in at least one area of the food and agricultural sciences targeted for national needs fellowships, that have a significant ongoing commitment to the food and agricultural sciences generally, and that have a significant ongoing commitment to the specific subject area for which a grant application is made. It is the objective to award grants to colleges and universities which have notable teaching and research competencies in the food and agricultural sciences. The grants are specifically intended to support fellowship programs that encourage outstanding students to pursue and complete a graduate degree at such institutions in an area of the food and agricultural sciences for which there is a national need for the development of scientific and professional expertise. Therefore, institutions which currently have excellent programs of graduate study and research in the food and agricultural sciences dealing with targeted national needs are particularly encouraged to apply.

I56Subpart B_Program Description

I80�1A3402.4 
I89Food and agricultural sciences areas targeted for national needs graduate fellowship grants support.
I11Areas of the food and agricultural sciences appropriate for fellowship grant applications are those in which developing shortages of expertise have been determined and targeted by HEP for national needs fellowship grant support. When funds are available and HEP determines that a new competition is warranted, the specific areas and funds per area will be identified in a T4Federal RegisterG1T1 notice announcing the program and soliciting program applications.

I80�1A3402.5 
I89Overview of National Needs Graduate Fellowship Grants Program.
I11(a) The program will provide funds for a limited number of grants to support fixed graduate student stipends and fixed cost-of-education institutional allowances. These grants will be awarded competitively to eligible institutions. In order to encourage the development of special activities that are expected to contribute to Fellows' advanced degree objectives, the program will also provide competitive, special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowances for a limited number of USDA Graduate Fellows.
I11(b) Based on the amount of funds appropriated in any fiscal year, HEP will determine:
I11(1) Whether new competitions for graduate fellowships and/or special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowances will be held during that fiscal year;
�270�I11(2) The graduate degree level(s) to be supported_Master's and/or doctoral;
I11(3) The proportion of appropriations to be targeted for the fellowship stipends for each respective graduate degree level supported;
I11(4) The proportion of appropriations to be targeted for the cost-of-education institutional allowances for each respective graduate degree level supported;
I11(5) The proportion of appropriations to be targeted for the special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowances for each respective graduate degree level supported;
I11(6) The allowable stipend amount for each respective graduate degree level supported, the cost-of-education institutional allowance for each respective graduate degree level supported, and the maximum funds available for each special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance for each respective graduate degree level supported; and
I11(7) The maximum total funds that may be awarded to an institution under the program in a given fiscal year.
I11(c) HEP will also determine:
I11(1) The maximum number of national needs areas for which funding may be requested in a single proposal;
I11(2) The degree levels for which funding may be requested in a single proposal;
I11(3) The minimum and maximum number of fellowships for which an institution may apply in a single proposal; and
I11(4) The limits on the total number of proposals that can be submitted by an institution, college, school, or other administrative unit. 
I11(d) All of these determinations will be published as a part of the program announcement in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1.
I11(e) For each USDA Graduate Fellow who desires to be considered for a special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance, the project director must apply to HEP for a supplemental grant in accordance with instructions published in the program announcement in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1. Each application must include an ``Application for Funding'' (Form CSRS�09661) and a ``Budget'' (Form CSRS�0955).
I11(1) To provide HEP with sufficient information upon which to evaluate the merits of the requests for a special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance, each application for a supplemental grant must contain a narrative which provides the following:
I11(i) The specific destination(s) and duration of the travel;
I11(ii) The specific study or thesis/dissertation research activities in which the Fellow will be engaged;
I11(iii) How the international experience will contribute to the Fellow's program of study;
I11(iv) A budget narrative specifying and justifying the dollar amount requested for the travel;
I11(v) Summary credentials of the faculty or other professionals with whom the Fellow will be working during the international experience (summary credentials must not exceed three pages per person; ``Summary Vita_Teaching Proposal'' (Form CSRS�09708) may be used for this purpose);
I11(vi) A letter from the dean of the Fellow's college or equivalent administrative unit supporting the Fellow's travel request and certifying that the travel experience will not jeopardize the Fellow's satisfactory programs toward degree completion; and
I11(vii) A letter from the fellowship grant project director certifying the Fellow's eligibility, the accuracy of the Fellow's travel request, and the relevance of the travel to the Fellow's advanced degree objectives.
I11(2) The narrative portion of the application must not exceed 10 pages, excluding the summary vita/vitae.
I11(f) All complete requests will be evaluated by professional staff from USDA or other Federal agencies, as appropriate. Evaluation criteria will be published in the program announcement in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1. Awards will be made to the extent possible based on availability of funds.
I11(g) Any current fellow with sufficient time to complete the international experience before the termination date of �271�the grant under which he/she is supported is eligible for a special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance. Before the international study or thesis/dissertation research travel may commence, a Fellow must have completed one academic year of full-time study, as defined by the institution, under the fellowship appointment and arrangements must have been formalized for the Fellow to study and/or conduct research in the foreign location(s).

I80�1A3402.6
I89Fellowship appointments.
I11(a)(1) Fellows must be identified and fellowships must be awarded within 15 months of the effective date of a grant. Institutions failing to meet this deadline will be required to refund monies associated with any unawarded fellowship(s). Fellowship appointments may be held only by persons who enroll and pursue full-time study in a graduate degree program in the national need area and at the degree level supported by the grant.
I11(2) In addition, fellows:
I11(i) must be newly recruited;
I11(ii) must not have been enrolled previously in the academic program at the same degree level; 
I11(iii) must be citizens of nationals of the United States as determined in accordance with Federal law; and
I11(iv) must have strong interest, as judged by the institution, in pursuing a degree in a targeted national need area and in preparing for a career as a food or agricultural scientist or professional.
I11(3) It will be the responsibility of the grantee institution to award fellowships to students of superior academic ability.
I11(4) A doctoral Fellow who maintains satisfactory progress in his or her course of study is eligible for support for a maximum of 36 months within a 45-month period. Master's level Fellows, maintaining satisfactory progress, are eligible for support for a maximum of 24 months during a 33-month period. However, it is the intent of this program that Fellows pursue full-time uninterrupted study or thesis/dissertation research, including time spent pursuing USDA-funded special international study or thesis/dissertation research activities. For Fellows requiring additional time to complete a degree, it is expected that the institution will endeavor to continue supporting individuals originally appointed to fellowships through such other institutional means as teaching assistantships and research assistantships. For Fellows who complete the program of study early (less than 24 hours for Master's degree or 36 months for doctoral degree), the institution must refund any unexpended monies to the granting agency.
I11(b) Within the framework of the regulations in this part, all decisions with respect to the appointment of Fellows will be made by the institution. However, institutions are urged to take maximum advantage of opportunities for awarding fellowships to members of underrepresented groups at the graduate level in the food and agricultural sciences, particularly minorities and women. Throughout a Fellow's tenure, the institution should satisfy itself that the Fellow is making satisfactory academic progress, and carrying out, or planning to carry out, national needs related research. If an institution finds it necessary to terminate support of a Fellow for insufficient academic progress or by decision on the part of the Fellow, the Fellow becomes ineligible for future assistance under the program. If a Fellow finds it necessary to interrupt his or her program of study because of health, personal reasons, outside employment, or acceptance of an assistantship, the institution must reserve the funds for the purpose of allowing the Fellow to resume funded study any time within a 9-month period. However, a Fellow who finds it necessary to interrupt his or her program of study more than one time cannot exceed a total of 9 months' cumulative leave status without forfeiting eligibility. For fellowships terminated because of insufficient academic progress, a decision on the part of the Fellow, or reserved due to an interrupted program of study but not resumed within the required time period, unexpended monies must be refunded. Institutions may not use unexpended monies associated with a terminated fellowship to recruit and support a ``replacement'' Fellow.
�272�I11(c) Only Fellows enrolled in Master's programs of study may be supported under a Master's fellowship grant. Only Fellows enrolled in doctoral programs of study may be supported under a doctoral fellowship grant.

I80�1A3402.7 
I89Fellowship activities.
I11A Fellow must be enrolled as a full-time graduate student, as defined by the institution, at all times during the tenure of the fellowship in the national need area and at the degree level supported by the grant. This includes the time used for special international study or thesis/dissertation research if the international travel is funded through a special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance under this grant program. However, the normal requirement of formal registration during part of this tenure may be waived if permitted by the policy of the fellowship institution, provided that the fellow is making satisfactory progress toward degree completion and remains engaged in appropriate full-time fellowship activities such as thesis/dissertation research. Fellows in academic institutions are not entitled to vacations as such. They are entitled to the short normal student holidays observed by the institution. The time between academic semesters or quarters is to be utilized as an active part of the grant period. During the period of support, a Fellow may not accept employment by the institution or any other agency. However, a grant supporting research costs of the Fellow is acceptable, exclusive of salary or wages and fringe benefits for the Fellow.

I80�1A3402.8 
I89Financial provisions.
I11The basis fellowship stipend, cost-of-education institutional allowance, and special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance that may be paid from grant funds will be determined by HEP contingent upon appropriations. The amount of the stipend, cost-of-education institution allowance, and special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowance will be cited in the program announcement in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1. An institution may elect to apply the cost-of-education institutional allowance to a Fellow's tuition and fees; however, such is not required. The allowance also may be used by an institution to defray other program expenses (e.g., recruitment, travel, publications, or salaries of project personnel). Tuition and fees are the responsibility of the Fellow unless an institution elects to use its cost-of-education institutional allowance for this purpose or elects to pay such costs out of other non-USDA monies. No dependency allowances are provided for Fellows. Stipend payments and special international study or thesis/dissertation research travel allowances will be made to Fellows by the institution, according to standard institutional procedures for fellowships and assistantships.

I80�1A3402.23
I89Confidential aspects of proposals and awards.
I11When a proposal results in a grant, it becomes a part of the record of the Agency's transactions, available to the public upon specific request. Information that the Agency and the grantee mutually agree to be of a privileged nature will be held in confidence to the extent permitted by law. Therefore, any information that the applicant wishes to have considered as privileged should be clearly marked as such and sent in a separate statement, two copies of which should accompany the proposal. The original copy of a proposal that does not result in a grant will be retained by the Agency for a period of one year. Other copies will be destroyed. Such a proposal will be released only with the consent of the applicant or to the extent required by law. A proposal may be withdrawn at any time prior to the final action thereon.

I80�1A3402.24 
I89Access to peer review information.
I11After final decisions have been announced, HEP will, upon request, inform the project director of the reasons for its decision on a proposal. Verbatim copies of summary reviews, not including the identity of the reviewers, will be made available to respective project directors upon specific request.

I80�1A3402.25 
I89Documentation of progress on funded projects.
I11(a) A Fellowship Appointment Documentation form (Form CSRS�09707) is included in the application package. Upon request by HEP, project directors awarded grants under the program will be required to complete and submit this form. Follow-up progress reports will focus on assessing continuing progress of Fellows through their graduate programs of study (including activities supported by any special international study or thesis/dissertation research allowance) and on institution adherence to program guidelines.
I11(b) A Graduate Fellow Exit Report (Form CSRS�09709) is included in the application package. This form should be completed and submitted to HEP by the project director for each Fellow supported by a grant as soon as a Fellow either: graduates; is officially terminated from the fellowship or the academic program due to unsatisfactory academic progress; or voluntarily withdraws from the fellowship or the academic program. If a Fellow has not completed all degree requirements at the end of the five-year grant duration, HEP may request a preliminary exit report. In such a case, a final exit report will be required at a later date. When a final exit report for each Fellow supported by a grant has been accepted by USDA, the grantee institution will have satisfied the requirement of a final performance report for the grant. Additional follow-up reports to track the Fellows' career patterns may be requested.
I11(c) A Final Report must be completed and returned within 90 days after the expiration date of the project. The Final Report must be submitted to the program contact person and must contain proper data and information as specified in the ``Special Terms and Conditions'' of the award. Generally, the Final Report should include a summary of: recruitment strategies that were effective; successful mentoring �277�procedures or activities; enrichment activities the fellows were afforded; barriers faced in recruiting and graduating fellows; and the impact of the fellowship grant on the overall quality of the educational programs of the institution.

I80�1A3402.26 
I89Evaluation of program.
I11Grantees should be aware that HEP may, as a part of its own program evaluation activities, carry out in-depth evaluations of assisted activities through independent third parties. Thus, grantees should be prepared to cooperate with evaluators retained by HEP to analyze both the institutional context and the impact of any supported project.

I80�1A3403.3
I89Eligibility requirements.
I11(a) T3Eligibility of organization.G1T1 (1) Each organization submitting a proposal must qualify as a small business concern for research purposes, as defined in �1A3403.2. Joint ventures and limited partnerships are eligible to apply for and to receive research grants under this program, provided that the entity created qualifies as a small business concern in accordance with section 2(3) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) and as defined in �1A3403.2. For both phase I and phase II the research must be performed in the United States.
I11(2) A minimum of two-thirds of the research or analytical work, as determined by budget expenditures, must be performed by the proposing organization under phase I grants. For phase II awards, a minimum of one-half of the research or analytical effort must be conducted by the proposing organization. The space used by the SBIR awardee to conduct the research must be space over which it has exclusive control for the period of the grant.
I11(b) T3Eligibility of principal investigator.G1T1 (1) It is strongly suggested that the individual responsible for the scientific or technical direction of the project be designated as the principal investigator. In addition, the primary employment of the principal investigator must be with the proposing small business concern at the time of award and during the conduct of the proposed research. Primary employment means that more than one-half of the principal investigator's time is spent in the �280�employ of the small business concern. Primary employment with the small business applicant precludes full-time employment with another organization.
I11(2) If the proposed principal investigator is employed by another organization (e.g., university or another company) at the time of submission of the application, documentation must be submitted with the proposal from the principal investigator's current employer verifying that, in the event of an SBIR award, he/she will become a less-than half-time employee of such organization and will remain so for the duration of the SBIR project.
I56Subpart B_Program Description


I80�1A3403.4
I89Three-phase program.
I11The Small Business Innovation Research Grants Program will be carried out in three separate phases described in this section. The first two phases are designed to assist USDA in meeting its research and development objectives and will be supported with SBIR funds. The purpose of the third phase is to pursue the commercial applications or objectives of the research carried out in phases I and II through the use of private or Federal non-SBIR funds.

I11(a) Phase I is the initial stage in which the scientific and technical merit and feasibility of an idea related to one of the research areas described in the program solicitation is evaluated, normally for a period not to exceed 6 months. In special cases, however, where a proposed research project requires more than 6 months to complete, a longer grant period may be considered. A proposer of a phase I project with an anticipated duration beyond 6 months should specify the length and duration in the proposal at the time of its submission to USDA in order for it to be considered at the time of award. (See �1A3403.14(c) for changes in project period subsequent to award).
I11(b) Phase II is the principal research or research and development effort in which the results from Phase I are expanded upon and further pursued, normally for a period not to exceed 24 months. Only those small businesses previously receiving phase I awards are eligible to submit phase II proposals. For each phase I project funded the awardee may apply for a phase II award only once. Phase I awardees who for valid reasons cannot apply for phase II support in the next fiscal year funding cycle may apply for support not later than the second fiscal year funding cycle.
I11(c) Phase III is to stimulate technological innovation and the national return on investment from research through the pursuit of commercial objectives resulting from the work supported by SBIR funding carried out in phases I and II. This portion of the project is performed by the small business concern and privately funded or Federally funded by a non-SBIR source through the use of a follow-on funding commitment. A follow-on funding commitment is an agreement between the small business concern and a provider of follow-on capital for a specified amount of funds to be made available to the small business concern for further development of their effort upon achieving certain mutually agreed upon technical objectives during phase II.
I56Subpart C_Preparation and Submission of Proposals


I80�1A3403.5
I89Requests for proposals.
I11(a) T3Phase I.G1T1 A program solicitation requesting phase I proposals will be prepared each fiscal year in which funds are made available for this purpose. The solicitation will contain information sufficient to enable eligible applicants to prepare grant proposals and will include descriptions of specific research topic areas which the Department will support during the fiscal year involved, forms to be completed and submitted with proposals, and special requirements. A notice will be published in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1 informing the public of the availability of the program solicitation.
I11(b) T3Phase II.G1T1 For each fiscal year in which funds are made available for this purpose, the Department will send a letter requesting phase II proposals from the phase I grantees eligible to apply for phase II funding in that fiscal year. The letter will be accompanied by �281�the solicitation which contains information sufficient to enable eligible applicants to prepare grant proposals and includes forms to be submitted with proposals as well as special requirements.


I80�1A3403.6
I89General content of proposals.
I11(a) The proposed research must be responsive to one of the USDA program interests stated in the research topic descriptions of the program solicitation.
I11(b) Proposals must cover only scientific/technological research activities. A small business concern must not propose product development, technical assistance, demonstration projects, classified research, or patent applications. Many of the research projects supported by the SBIR program lead to the development of new products based upon the research results obtained during the project. However, projects that seek funding solely for product development where no research is involved, i.e. the funds are needed to permit the development of a project based on previously completed research, will not be accepted. Literature surveys should be conducted prior to preparing proposals for submission and must not be proposed as a part of the SBIR phase I or phase II effort. Proposals principally for the development of proven concepts toward commercialization or for market research should not be submitted since such efforts are considered the responsibility of the private sector and therefore are not supported by USDA.
I11(c) A proposal must be limited to only one topic. The same proposal may not be submitted under more than one topic. However, an organization may submit separate proposals on the same topic. Where similar research is discussed under more than one topic, the proposer should choose that topic whose description appears most relevant to the proposer's research concept. Duplicate proposals will be returned to the applicant without review.
I11(d) The limitation on the length of phase I and phase II proposals, text instructions, and the formatting instructions will be identified in the annual solicitation.


I80�1A3403.7
I89Proposal format for phase I applications.
I11(a) The following items relate to phase I applications. Further instructions or descriptions for these items as well as any additional items to be included will be provided in the annual solicitation, as necessary.
I11(1) T3Proposal cover sheet.G1T1 Photocopy and complete Form CSREES�09667 in the program solicitation. The original of the proposal cover sheet must at a minimum contain the pen-and-ink signatures of the proposed principal investigator(s) and the authorized organizational official.
I11(2) T3Project summary.G1T1 Photocopy and complete Form CSREES�09668 in the program solicitation. The technical abstract should include a brief description of the problem or opportunity, project objectives, and a description of the effort. Anticipated results and potential commercial applications of the proposed research also should be summarized in the space provided. Keywords, to be provided in the last block on the page, should characterize the most important aspects of the project. The project summary of successful proposals may be published by USDA and, therefore, should not contain proprietary information.
I11(3) T3Technical content.G1T1 The main body of the proposal should include:
I11(i) Identification and significance of the problem or opportunity.
I11(ii) Background and rationale.
I11(iii) Relationship with future research or research and development.
I11(iv) Phase I technical objectives.
I11(v) Phase I work plan.
I11(vi) Related research or research and development.
I11(4) T3Key personnel and bibliography.G1T1 Identify key personnel involved in the effort, including information on their directly related education and experience.
I11(5) T3Facilities and equipment.G1T1 Describe the types, location, and availability of instrumentation and physical facilities necessary to carry out the work proposed. Items of equipment to be purchased must be fully justified under this section.
I11(6) T3Consultants.G1T1 Involvement of university or other consultants in the planning and research stages of the �282�project is permitted and may be particularly helpful to small firms which have not previously received Federal research awards. If such involvement is intended, it should be described in detail.
I11(7) T3Potential post application.G1T1 Briefly describe:
I11(i) Whether and by what means the proposed research appears to have potential commercial application;
I11(ii) Whether and by what means the proposed research appears to have potential use by the Federal Government; and
I11(iii) Whether and by what means the proposed research will satisfy the public interest.
I11(8) T3Current and pending support.G1T1 If a proposal, substantially the same as the one being submitted, has been previously funded or is currently funded, pending, or about to be submitted to another Federal agency or to USDA in a separate action, the proposer must provide the following information:
I11(i) Name and address of the agency(s) to which a proposal was submitted, or will be submitted, or from which an award is expected or has been received.
I11(ii) Date of actual or anticipated proposal submission or date of award, as appropriate.
I11(iii) Title of proposal or award, identifying number assigned by the agency involved, and the date of program solicitation under which the proposal was submitted or the award was received.
I11(iv) Applicable research topic area for each proposal submitted or award received.
I11(v) Title of research project.
I11(vi) Name and title of principal investigator for each proposal submitted or award received. USDA will not make awards that duplicate research funded (or to be funded) by other Federal agencies.
I11(9) T3Cost breakdown on proposal budget.G1T1 Photocopy and complete the budget form in the program solicitation only for the phase under which you are currently applying. (An applicant for phase I funding should not submit both phase I and II budgets.)
I11(10) T3Research involving special considerations.G1T1 If the proposed research will involve recombinant DNA molecules, human subjects at risk, or laboratory animal care, the proposal must so indicate and include an assurance statement (Form CSREES�09662) as the last page of the proposal. The original of the assurance statement must at a minimum contain the pen-and-ink signature of the authorized organizational official. In order to complete the assurance statement, the proposer may be required to have the research plan reviewed and approved by an appropriate ``Institutional Review Board'' (IRB) prior to commencing actual substantive work. If an IRB review is required, USDA will not release funds for an award until proper documentation of the IRB approval is submitted to and accepted by USDA. It is suggested that proposers contact local universities, colleges, or nonprofit research organizations which have established such reviewing mechanisms to have this service performed.
I11(11) T3Proprietary information.G1T1 (i) If a proposal contains proprietary information that constitutes a trade secret, proprietary commercial or financial information, confidential personal information, or data affecting the national security, it will be treated in confidence to the extent permitted by law, provided the information is clearly marked by the proposer with the term ``confidential proprietary information'' and provided the following legend appears in the designated area at the bottom of the proposal cover sheet (Form CSREES�09667):

Q04


I21T3The following pages (specify) contain proprietary information which (name of proposing organization) requests not be released to persons outside the Government, except for purposes of evaluation.G1T1

Q04
I11(ii) USDA by law is required to make the final decision as to whether the information is required to be kept in confidence. Information contained in unsuccessful proposals will remain the property of the proposer. However, USDA will retain for one year one file copy of all proposals received; extra copies will be destroyed. Public release of information for any proposal submitted will be subject to existing statutory and regulatory requirements. Any proposal which is funded will be considered an integral part of the award and normally will be made available to the public upon request except �283�for designated proprietary information that is determined by USDA to be proprietary information.
I11(iii) The inclusion of proprietary information is discouraged unless it is necessary for the proper evaluation of the proposal. If proprietary information is to be included, it should be limited, set apart from other text on a separate page, and keyed to the text by numbers. It should be confined to a few critical technical items which, if disclosed, could jeopardize the obtaining of foreign or domestic patents. Trade secrets, salaries, or other information which could jeopardize commercial competitiveness should be similarly keyed and presented on a separate page. Proposals or reports which attempt to restrict dissemination of large amounts of information may be found unacceptable by USDA. Any other legend than that listed in paragraph (a)(11)(i) of this section may be unacceptable to USDA and may constitute grounds for return of the proposal without further consideration. Without assuming any liability for inadvertent disclosure, USDA will limit dissemination of such information to its employees and, where necessary for the evaluation of the proposal, to outside reviewers on a confidential basis.
I11(12) T3Rights in data developed under SBIR funding agreement.G1T1 The SBIR legislation provides for ``retention of rights in data generated in the performance of the contract by the small business concern.''
I11(i) The legislative history clarifies that the intent of the statute is to provide authority for the participating agency to protect technical data generated under the funding agreement, and to refrain from disclosing such data to competitors of the small business concern or from using the information to produce future technical procurement specifications that could harm the small business concern that discovered and developed the innovation until the small business concern has a reasonable chance to seek patent protection, if appropriate.
I11(ii) Therefore, except for program evaluation, participating agencies shall protect such technical data for a period of not less than T34 yearsG1T1 from the completion of the project from which the data were generated unless the agencies obtain permission to disclose such data from the contractor or grantee. The government shall retain a royalty-free license for government use of any technical data delivered under an SBIR funding agreement whether patented or not.
I11(13) T3Organizational management information.G1T1 Before the award of an SBIR funding agreement, USDA requires the submission of certain organizational management, personnel and financial information to assure the responsibility of the proposer. This information is not required unless a project is recommended for funding, and then it is submitted on a one-time basis only. However, new information should be submitted if a small business concern has undergone significant changes in organization, personnel, finance, or policies including those relating to civil rights.

I89Proposal format for phase II applications.
I11(a) The following items relate to phase II applications. Further instructions or descriptions for these items as well as any additional items to be included will be identified in the annual solicitation, as necessary.
I11(1) T3Proposal cover sheet.G1T1 Follow instructions found in �1A3403.7(a)(1).
I11(2) T3Project summary.G1T1 Follow instructions found in �1A3403.7(a)(2).
I11(3) T3Phase I results.G1T1 The proposal should contain an extensive section that lists the phase I objectives and makes detailed presentation of the phase I results. This section should establish the degree to which phase I objectives were met and feasibility of the proposed research project was established.
I11(4) T3Proposal.G1T1 Since phase II is the principal research and development effort, proposals should be more comprehensive than those submitted under phase I. However, the outline contained in �1A3403.7(a)(3) should be followed, tailoring the information requested to the phase II project.
I11(5) T3Cost breakdown on proposal budget.G1T1 For phase II, a detailed budget is required for each year of requested support. In addition, a summary budget is �284�required detailing the requested support for the overall project period.
I11(6) T3Organizational management information.G1T1 Each phase II awardee will be asked to submit an updated statement of financial condition (such as the latest audit report, financial statements or balance sheet).
I11(7) T3Follow-on funding commitment.G1T1 If the proposer has obtained a contingent commitment for phase III follow-on funding, it should be forwarded with the phase II application.
I11(8) T3Documentation of multiple phase II awards.G1T1 (i) An applicant that submits a proposal for a funding agreement for phase I and has received more than 15 phase II awards during the preceding 5 fiscal years, must document the extent to which it was able to secure phase III funding to develop concepts resulting from previous phase II awards. This documentation should include the name of the awarding agency, date of award, funding agreement number, topic or subtopic title, amount and date of phase II funding and commercialization status for each phase II award.
I11(ii) USDA shall collect and retain the information submitted under paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section at least until the General Accounting Office submits the report required under section 106 of the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992.
I11(b) [Reserved]

I56Subpart D_Proposal Review and Evaluation


I80�1A3403.10
I89Proposal review.
I11(a) All research grant applications will be acknowledged.
I11(b) Phase I and phase II proposals will be judged competitively in a two-stage process, based primarily upon scientific or technical merit. First, each proposal will be screened by USDA scientists to ensure that it is responsive to stated requirements contained in the program solicitation. Proposals found to be responsive will be technically evaluated by peer scientists knowledgeable in the appropriate scientific field using the criteria identified in the annual solicitation, as appropriate. Proposals found to be nonresponsive will be returned to the proposing firm without review.
I11(c) Both internal and external peer reviewers may be used during the technical evaluation stage of this process. Selections will be made from among recognized specialists who are uniquely qualified by training and experience in their respective fields to render expert advice on the merit of proposals received. It is anticipated that such experts will include those located in universities, Government, and non-profit research organizations. If possible, USDA intends that peer review groups shall be balanced with minority and female representation and with an equitable age distribution.
I11(d) Technical reviewers will base their conclusions and recommendations on information contained in the phase I or phase II proposal. It cannot be assumed that reviewers are acquainted with any experiments referred to within a proposal, with key individuals, or with the firm itself. Therefore, the proposal should be self-contained and written with the care and thoroughness accorded papers for publication.
I11(e) Final decisions will be made by USDA based upon the ratings assigned by reviewers and consideration of other factors, including the potential commercial application, possible duplication of other research, any critical USDA requirements, and budget limitation. In addition, the follow-on funding commitment will be a consideration for phase II proposals. In the event that two or more phase II proposals are of approximately equal technical merit, the follow-on funding commitment for continued development in phase III will be an important consideration. The value of the commitment will depend upon the degree of commitment made by non-Federal investors, with the maximum value resulting �285�from a signed agreement with reasonable terms for an amount at least equal to the funding requested from USDA in phase II.

I89Terms and conditions of grant awards.
I11Within the limit of funds available for such purpose, the awarding official shall make research project grants to those responsible, eligible applicants whose proposals are judged most meritorious in the announced program areas under the evaluation criteria and procedures set forth in the annual solicitation. The beginning of the project period shall be no later than September 30 of the Federal fiscal year in which the project is approved for support. All funds granted under this part shall be expended solely for the purpose for which the funds are granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of the award, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR part 31), and the Department's Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations (7 CFR part 3015).


I80�1A3403.13
I89 Notice of grant awards.
I11(a) The grant award document shall include, at a minimum, the following:
I11(1) Legal name and address of performing organization.
I11(2) Title of project.
I11(3) Name(s) and address(es) of the Principal Investigator(s).
I11(4) Identifying grant number assigned by the Department.
I11(5) Project period, which specifies how long the Department intends to support the effort.
I11(6) Total amount of Federal financial assistance approved for the project period.
I11(7) Legal authorities under which the grant is awarded.
I11(8) Approved budget plan for categorizing project funds to accomplish the stated purpose of the grant award.
I11(9) Other information or provisions deemed necessary by the Department to carry out its granting activities or to accomplish the purpose of a particular research project grant.
I11(b) The notice of grant award, in the form of a letter, will provide pertinent instructions and information to the grantee which are not included in the grant award document described in paragraph (a) of this section.


I80�1A3403.14
I89Use of funds; changes.
I11(a) T3Delegation of fiscal responsibility.G1T1 The grantee may not in whole or in part delegate or transfer to another person, institution, or organization the responsibility for use or expenditure of grant funds.
I11(b) T3Change in project plans.G1T1 (1) The permissible changes by the grantee, principal investigator(s), or other key project personnel in the approved research project grant shall be limited to changes in methodology, techniques, or other aspects of the project to expedite achievement of the project's approved goals. If the grantee and/or the principal investigator(s) are uncertain as to whether a change complies with this paragraph, the question must be referred to the Authorized Departmental Officer (ADO) for a final determination.
I11(2) Changes in approved goals, or objectives, shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the ADO prior to effecting such changes. In no event shall requests for such changes be approved which are outside the scope of the original approved project.
I11(3) Changes in approved project leadership or the replacement or reassignment of other key project personnel shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the ADO prior to effecting such changes.
I11(4) Transfers of actual performance of the substantive programmatic work in �286�whole or in part and provisions for payment of funds, whether or not Federal funds are involved, shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the ADO prior to effecting such transfers.
I11(c) T3Changes in project period.G1T1 The project period may be extended by the ADO to complete or fulfill the purposes of an approved project provided Federal funds remain. The extension shall be conditioned upon a prior request by the grantee and approval in writing by the ADO. In such cases the extension will not normally exceed 12 months, the phase I award will still be limited to the approved award amount, and the submission of a Phase II proposal will be delayed by one year. The extension allows the grantee to continue expending the remaining Federal funds for the intended purpose over the extension period. In instances where no Federal funds remain, it is unnecessary to approve an extension since the purpose of the extension is to continue using Federal funds. The grantee may opt to continue the Phase I project after the grant's termination and closeout, however, the grantee would have to do so without additional Federal funds. In the latter case, no communication with USDA is necessary. However, the maximum delay for submission of a Phase II proposal remains as specified in �1A3403.4(b).
I11(d) T3Changes in approved budget.G1T1 Changes in an approved budget shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the ADO prior to instituting such changes if the revision will:
I11(1) Involve transfers of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb an increase in direct costs;
I11(2) Involve transfers of amounts budgeted for direct costs to accommodate changes in indirect cost rates negotiated during a budget period and not approved when a grant was awarded;
I11(3) Result in a need or claim for the award of additional funds; or
I11(4) Involve transfers or expenditures of amounts requiring prior approval as set forth in the Departmental regulations or in the grant award.

I56Subpart A_General Information  


I80�1A3405.1 
I89Applicability of regulations.  
I11(a) The regulations of this part only apply to competitive Higher Education Challenge Grants awarded under the provisions of section 1417(b)(1) of the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977, as amended (NARETPA)(7 U.S.C. 3152(b)(1)), to strengthen institutional capacities, including curriculum, faculty, scientific instrumentation, instruction delivery systems, and student recruitment and retention. Section 1405 of NARETPA (7 U.S.C. 3121) designates the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as the lead Federal agency for agricultural research, extension, and teaching in the food and agricultural sciences. Section 1417 of NARETPA (7 U.S.C. 3152) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, who has delegated the authority to the Administrator of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES), to make competitive grants to land-grant colleges and universities, to colleges and universities having significant minority enrollments and a demonstrable capacity to carry out the teaching of food and agricultural sciences, and to other colleges and universities having a demonstrable capacity to carry out the teaching of food and agricultural sciences, for a period not to exceed 5 years, to administer and conduct programs to respond to identified State, regional, national, or international educational needs in the food and agricultural sciences.  
I11(b) To the extent that funds are available, each year CSREES will publish a T4Federal RegisterG1T1 notice announcing the program and soliciting grant applications.  
I11(c)(1) Based on the amount of funds appropriated in any fiscal year, CSREES will determine and cite in the program announcement:  
I11(i) The targeted need area(s) to be supported or, if the entire scope of a particular targeted need area is not to be supported, the specific special interest(s) within that targeted need area to be supported;  
I11(ii) The degree level(s) to be supported;  
I11(iii) The maximum project period a proposal may request;  
I11(iv) The maximum amount of funds that may be requested by an institution under a regular, complementary, or joint project proposal; and  
I11(v) The maximum total funds that may be awarded to an institution under the program in a given fiscal year, including how funds awarded for complementary and for joint project proposals will be counted toward the institutional maximum.  
I11(2) The program announcement will also specify the deadline date for proposal submission, the number of copies of each proposal that must be submitted, the address to which a proposal must be submitted, and whether or not Form CSREES�09711, ``Intent to Submit a Proposal,'' is requested.  
I11(d)(1) If it is deemed by CSREES that, for a given fiscal year, additional determinations are necessary, each, as relevant, will be stated in the program announcement. Such determinations may include:  
I11(i) Limits on the subject matter/emphasis areas to be supported;  
I11(ii) The maximum number of proposals that may be submitted on behalf of the same school, college, or equivalent administrative unit within an institution;  
I11(iii) The maximum total number of proposals that may be submitted by an institution;  
�289�I11(iv) The minimum project period a proposal may request;  
I11(v) The minimum amount of funds that may be requested by an institution under a regular, complementary, or joint project proposal;  
I11(vi) The proportion of the appropriation reserved for, or available to, regular, complementary, and joint project proposals;  
I11(vii) The proportion of the appropriation reserved for, or available to, projects in each announced targeted need area; 
I11(viii) The proportion of the appropriation reserved for, or available to, each subject matter/emphasis area;  
I11(ix) The maximum number of grants that may be awarded to an institution under the program in a given fiscal year; and  
I11(x) Limits on the use of grant funds for travel or to purchase equipment, if any.  

I11(2) The program announcement also will contain any other limitations deemed necessary by CSREES for proper conduct of the program in the applicable year.  
I11(e) The regulations of this part do not apply to grants awarded by the Department of Agriculture under any other authority.

I56Subpart B_Program Description  


I80�1A3405.4
I89Purpose of the program.  
I11The Department of Agriculture is designated as the lead Federal agency for higher education in the food and agricultural sciences. In this context, CSREES has specific responsibility to initiate and support projects to strengthen college and university teaching programs in the food and agricultural sciences. One national initiative for carrying out this responsibility is the competitive Higher Education Challenge Grants Program. A primary goal of the program is to attract and ensure a continual flow of outstanding students into food and agricultural sciences higher education programs and to provide them with an education of the highest quality available anywhere in the world and which reflects the unique needs of the Nation. It is designed to stimulate and enable colleges and universities to provide the quality of education necessary to produce baccalaureate or higher degree level graduates capable of strengthening the Nation's food and agricultural scientific and professional work force. It is intended that projects supported by the program will:  
I11(a) Address a State, regional, national, or international educational need;  
I11(b) Involve a creative or nontraditional approach toward addressing that need which can serve as a model to others;  
I11(c) Encourage and facilitate better working relationships in the university science and education community, as well as between universities and the private sector, to enhance program quality and supplement available resources; and  
I11(d) Result in benefits which will likely transcend the project duration and USDA support.  


I80�1A3405.5
I89Matching funds.  
I11Each application must provide for matching support from a non-Federal source. CSREES will cite in the program announcement the required percentage of institutional cost sharing.  


I80�1A3405.6
I89Scope of program.  
I11This program supports projects related to strengthening undergraduate or graduate teaching programs as specified in the annual program announcement. Only proposals addressing one or more of the specific targeted need areas(s) identified in the program announcement will be funded. Proposals may focus on any subject matter area(s) in the food and agricultural sciences unless limited by determinations as specified in the annual program announcement. A proposal may address a single targeted need area or multiple targeted need areas, and may be focused on a single subject matter area or multiple subject matter areas, in any combination (e.g., curriculum development in horticulture; curriculum development, faculty enhancement, and student experiential learning in animal science; faculty enhancement in food science and agribusiness management; or instruction delivery systems and student experiential learning in plant science, horticulture, and entomology). Targeted need areas will consist of one or more of the following:  
I11(a) T3Curricula design and materials development.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this initiative is to promote new and improved curricula and materials to increase the quality of, and continuously renew, the Nation's academic programs in the food and agricultural sciences. The �292�overall objective is to stimulate the development and facilitate the use of exemplary education models and materials that incorporate the most recent advances in subject matter, research on teaching and learning theory, and instructional technology. Proposals may emphasize: the development of courses of study, degree programs, and instructional materials; the use of new approaches to the study of traditional subjects; or the introduction of new subjects, or new applications of knowledge, pertaining to the food and agricultural sciences.  

I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to, curricula and materials that promote:  
I11(i) Raising the level of scholastic achievement of the Nation's graduates in the food and agricultural sciences.  
I11(ii) Addressing the special needs of particular groups of students, such as minorities, gifted and talented, or those with educational backgrounds that warrant enrichment.  
I11(iii) Using alternative instructional strategies or methodologies, including computer-assisted instruction or simulation modeling, media programs that reach large audiences efficiently and effectively, activities that provide hands-on learning experiences, and educational programs that extend learning beyond the classroom.  
I11(iv) Using sound pedagogy, particularly with regard to recent research on how to motivate students to learn, retain, apply, and transfer knowledge, skills, and competencies.  
I11(v) Building student competencies to integrate and synthesize knowledge from several disciplines.  
I11(b) T3Faculty preparation and enhancement for teaching.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this initiative is to advance faculty development in the areas of teaching competency, subject matter expertise, or student recruitment and advising skills. Teachers are central to education. They serve as models, motivators, and mentors_the catalysts of the learning process. Moreover, teachers are agents for developing, replicating, and exchanging effective teaching materials and methods. For these reasons, education can be strengthened only when teachers are adequately prepared, highly motivated, and appropriately recognized and rewarded.  
I11(2) Each faculty recipient of support for developmental activities under �1A3405.6(b) must be an ``eligible participant'' as defined in �1A3405.2(j) of this part.  
I11(3) Examples of developmental activities include, but are not limited to, those which enable teaching faculty to:  
I11(i) Gain experience with recent developments or innovative technology relevant to their teaching responsibilities.  
I11(ii) Work under the guidance and direction of experts who have substantial expertise in an area related to the developmental goals of the project.  
I11(iii) Work with scientists or professionals in government, industry, or other colleges or universities to learn new applications in a field.  
I11(iv) Obtain personal experience working with new ideas and techniques.  
I11(v) Expand competence with new methods of information delivery, such as computer-assisted or televised instruction.  
I11(vi) Increase understanding of the special needs of non-traditional students or students from groups that are underrepresented in the food and agricultural sciences workforce.  
I11(c) T3Instruction delivery systems.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this initiative is to encourage the use of alternative methods of delivering instruction to enhance the quality, effectiveness, and cost efficiency of teaching programs. The importance of this initiative is evidenced by advances in educational research which have substantiated the theory that differences in the learning styles of students often require alternative instructional methodologies. Also, the rising costs of higher education strongly suggest that colleges and universities undertake more efforts of a collaborative nature in order to deliver instruction which maximizes program quality and reduces unnecessary duplication. At the same time, advancements in knowledge and technology continue to introduce new subject matter areas which warrant consideration and implementation of innovative instruction techniques, methodologies, and delivery systems.  

�293�I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to:
I11(i) Use of computers.
I11(ii) Teleconferencing.
I11(iii) Networking via satellite communications.
I11(iv) Regionalization of academic programs.
I11(v) Mobile classrooms and laboratories.
I11(vi) Individualized learning centers.
I11(vii) Symposia, forums, regional or national workshops, etc.
I11(d) T3Scientific instrumentation for teaching.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this initiative is to provide students in science-oriented courses the necessary experience with suitable, up-to-date equipment in order to involve them in work central to scientific understanding and progress. This program initiative will support the acquisition of instructional laboratory and classroom equipment to assure the achievement and maintenance of outstanding food and agricultural sciences higher education programs. A proposal may request support for acquiring new, state-of-the-art instructional scientific equipment, upgrading existing equipment, or replacing non-functional or clearly obsolete equipment.
I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to:
I11(i) Rental or purchase of modern instruments to improve student learning experiences in courses, laboratories, and field work.
I11(ii) Development of new ways of using instrumentation to extend instructional capabilities.
I11(iii) Establishment of equipment-sharing capability via consortia or centers that develop innovative opportunities, such as mobile laboratories or satellite access to industry or government laboratories.
I11(e) T3Student experiential learning.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this initiative is to further the development of student scientific and professional competencies through experiential learning programs which provide students with opportunities to solve complex problems in the context of real-world situations. Effective experiential learning is essential in preparing future graduates to advance knowledge and technology, enhance quality of life, conserve resources, and revitalize the Nation's economic competitiveness. Such experiential learning opportunities are most effective when they serve to advance decision-making and communication skills as well as technological expertise.
I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to, projects which:
I11(i) Provide opportunities for students to participate in research projects, either as a part of an ongoing research project or in a project designed especially for this program.
I11(ii) Provide opportunities for students to complete apprenticeships, internships, or similar participatory learning experiences.
I11(iii) Expand and enrich courses which are of a practicum nature.
I11(iv) Provide career mentoring experiences that link students with outstanding professionals.
I11(f) T3Student recruitment and retention.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this initiative is to strengthen student recruitment and retention programs in order to promote the future strength of the Nation's scientific and professional work force. The Nation's economic competitiveness and quality of life rest upon the availability of a cadre of outstanding research scientists, university faculty, and other professionals in the food and agricultural sciences. A substantial need exists to supplement efforts to attract increased numbers of academically outstanding students to prepare for careers as food and agricultural scientists and professionals. It is particularly important to augment the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of the student body in order to promote a robust exchange of ideas and a more effective use of the full breadth of the Nation's intellectual resources.

I11(2) Each student recipient of monetary support for education costs or developmental purposes under �1A3405.6(f) must be enrolled at an eligible institution and meet the requirement of an ``eligible participant'' as defined in �1A3405.2(j) of this part.
I11(3) Examples include, but are not limited to:
I11(i) Special outreach programs for elementary and secondary students as well as parents, counselors, and the general public to broaden awareness of �294�the extensive nature and diversity of career opportunities for graduates in the food and agricultural sciences.
I11(ii) Special activities and materials to establish more effective linkages with high school science classes.
I11(iii) Unique or innovative student recruitment activities, materials, and personnel.
I11(iv) Special retention programs to assure student progression through and completion of an educational program.
I11(v) Development and dissemination of stimulating career information materials.
I11(vi) Use of regional or national media to promote food and agricultural sciences higher education.
I11(vii) Providing financial incentives to enable and encourage students to pursue and complete an undergraduate or graduate degree in an area of the food and agricultural sciences. 
I11(viii) Special recruitment programs to increase the participation of students from non-traditional or underrepresented groups in courses of study in the food and agricultural sciences.

The Project Summary should be written so that a technically literate reader can evaluate the use of Federal funds in support of the project.  

I11(d) T3Resubmission of a proposalG1T1_(1)T3 Resubmission of previously unfunded proposals.G1T1 If a proposal has been submitted previously, but was not funded, such should be indicated in block 13. on Form CSREES�09712, ``Higher Education Proposal Cover Page,'' and the following information should be included in the proposal: The fiscal year(s) in which the proposal was submitted previously; a summary of the peer reviewers' comments; and how these comments have been addressed in the current proposal, including the page numbers in the current proposal where the peer reviewers' comments have been addressed. This information may be provided as a section of the proposal following the Project Summary and preceding the proposal narrative or it �296�may be placed in the Appendix (see �1A3405.11(i)). In either case, the location of this information should be indicated in the Table of Contents. Further, when possible, the information should be presented in tabular format. Applicants who choose to resubmit proposals that were previously submitted, but not funded, should note that resubmitted proposals must compete equally with newly submitted proposals. Submitting a proposal that has been revised based on a previous peer review panel's critique of the proposal does not guarantee the success of the resubmitted proposal.  
I11(2) T3Resubmission of previously funded proposals.G1T1 The Higher Education Challenge Grants Program is not designed to support activities that essentially are repetitive in nature over multiple grant awards. Project directors who have had their projects funded previously are discouraged from resubmitting relatively identical proposals for further funding. Proposals that are sequential continuations or new stages of previously funded Challenge Grants Program projects must compete with first-time proposals. Therefore, project directors should thoroughly demonstrate how the project proposed in the current application expands substantially upon a previously funded project (i.e., demonstrate how the new project will advance the former project to the next level of attainment or will achieve expanded goals). The proposal must also show the degree to which the new phase promotes innovativeness and creativity beyond the scope of the previously funded project.  
I11(e)T3 Narrative of a proposal.G1T1 The narrative portion of the proposal is limited to 20 pages in length. The one-page Project Summary is not included in the 20-page limitation. The narrative must be typed on one side of the page only, using a font no smaller than 12 point, and double-spaced. All margins must be at least one inch. All pages following the Table of Contents must be paginated. It should be noted that peer reviewers will not be required to read beyond 20 pages of the narrative to evaluate the proposal. The narrative should contain the following sections:

I11(3) T3Institutional commitment and resourcesG1T1_(i) T3Institutional commitment.G1T1 Discuss the institution's commitment to the project. For example, substantiate that the institution attributes a high priority to the project, discuss how the project will contribute to the achievement of the institution's long-term (five-to ten-year) goals, explain how the project will help satisfy the institution's high-priority objectives, or show how this project is linked to and supported by the institution's strategic plan.  
I11(ii) T3Institutional resources.G1T1 Document the commitment of institutional resources to the project, and show that the institutional resources to be made available to the project, when combined with the support requested from USDA, will be adequate to carry out the activities of the project. Discuss institutional facilities, equipment, computer services, and other appropriate resources available to the project.  
I11(f) T3Key personnel.G1T1 A Form CSREES�09708, ``Summary Vita_Teaching Proposal,'' should be included for each key person associated with the project.  
I11(g) T3Budget and cost-effectivenessG1T1_(1) T3Budget form.G1T1 (i) Prepare Form CSREES�09713, ``Higher Education Budget,'' in accordance with instructions provided with the form. Proposals may request support for a period to be identified in each year's program announcement. A budget form is required for each year of requested support. In addition, a summary budget is required detailing the requested total support for the overall project period. Form CSREES�09713 may be reproduced as needed by proposers. Funds may be requested under any of the categories listed on the form, provided that the �298�item or service for which support is requested is allowable under the authorizing legislation, the applicable Federal cost principles, and these administrative provisions, and can be justified as necessary for the successful conduct of the proposed project.  
I11(ii) The approved negotiated instruction rate or the rate allowed by law should be used when computing indirect costs. If a reduced rate of indirect costs is voluntarily requested from USDA, the remaining allowable indirect costs may be used as matching funds.  
I11(2) T3Matching funds.G1T1 When documenting matching contributions, use the following guidelines:  
I11(i) When preparing the column of Form CSREES�09713 entitled ``Applicant Contributions To Matching Funds,'' only those costs to be contributed by the applicant for the purposes of matching should be shown. The total amount of this column should be indicated in item M.  
I11(ii) In item N of Form CSREES�09713, show a total dollar amount for Cash Contributions from both the applicant and any third parties; also show a total dollar amount (based on current fair market value) for Non-cash Contributions from both the applicant and any third parties.  

I11(iii) To be counted toward the matching requirements stated in �1A3405.5 of this part, proposals must include written verification of any actual commitments of matching support (including both cash and non-cash contributions) from third parties. Written verification means_  
I11(A) For any third party cash contributions, a separate pledge agreement for each donation, signed by the authorized organizational representative(s) of the donor organization and the applicant institution, which must include: 
I11(T31G1T1) The name, address, and telephone number of the donor;
I11(T32G1T1) The name of the applicant institution;
I11(T33G1T1) The title of the project for which the donation is made;
I11(T34G1T1) The dollar amount of the cash donation; and
I11(T35G1T1) A statement that the donor will pay the cash contribution during the grant period; and  
I11(B) For any third party non-cash contributions, a separate pledge agreement for each contribution, signed by the authorized organizational representative(s) of the donor organization and the applicant institution, which must include:
I11(T31G1T1) The name, address, and telephone number of the donor;
I11(T32G1T1) The name of the applicant institution;
I11(T33G1T1) The title of the project for which the donation is made;
I11(T34G1T1) A good faith estimate of the current fair market value of the non-cash contribution; and
I11(T35G1T1) A statement that the donor will make the contribution during the grant period.  
I11(iv) All pledge agreements referenced in �1A3405.11(g)(2)(iii) (A) and (B) must be placed in the proposal immediately following Form CSREES�09713. The sources and amounts of all matching support from outside the applicant institution should be summarized in the Budget Narrative section of the proposal.  
I11(v) Applicants should refer to OMB Circulars A�09110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-profit Organizations,'' and A�0921, ``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions,'' for further guidance and other requirements relating to matching and allowable costs.  
I11(3) T3Chart on shared budget for joint project proposal.G1T1 For a joint project proposal, a plan must be provided indicating how funds will be distributed to the participating institutions. The budget section of a joint project proposal should include a chart indicating: The names of the participating institutions; the amount of funds to be disbursed to those institutions; and the way in which such funds will be used in accordance with items A through L of Form CSREES�09713, ``Higher Education Budget.'' If a proposal is not for a joint project, such a chart is not required.  
I11(4) T3Budget narrative.G1T1 (i) Discuss how the budget specifically supports the proposed project activities. Explain how such budget items as professional �299�or technical staff, travel, equipment, etc., are essential to achieving project objectives.  
I11(ii) Justify that the total budget, including funds requested from USDA and any matching support provided, will be adequate to carry out the activities of the project. Provide a summary of sources and amounts of all third party matching support.  
I11(iii) Justify the project's cost-effectiveness. Show how the project maximizes the use of limited resources, optimizes educational value for the dollar, achieves economies of scale, or leverages additional funds. For example, discuss how the project has the potential to generate a critical mass of expertise and activity focused on a targeted need area, or to promote coalition building that could lead to future ventures.  
I11(iv) Include the percentage of time key personnel will work on the project, both during the academic year and summer. When salaries of university personnel will be paid by a combination of USDA and institutional funds, the total compensation must not exceed the faculty member's regular annual compensation. In addition, the total commitment of time devoted to the project, when combined with time for teaching and research duties, other sponsored agreements, and other employment obligations to the institution, must not exceed 100 percent of the normal workload for which the employee is compensated, in accordance with established university policies and applicable Federal cost principles.  
I11(v) If the proposal addresses more than one targeted need area (e.g., student experiential learning and instruction delivery systems), estimate the proportion of the funds requested from USDA that will support each respective targeted need area.  
I11(h) T3Current and pending support.G1T1 Each applicant must complete Form CSREES�09663, ``Current and Pending Support,'' identifying any other current public- or private-sponsored projects, in addition to the proposed project, to which key personnel listed in the proposal under consideration have committed portions of their time, whether or not salary support for the person(s) involved is included in the budgets of the various projects. This information should also be provided for any pending proposals which are currently being considered by, or which will be submitted in the near future to other possible sponsors, including other USDA programs or agencies. Concurrent submission of identical or similar projects to other possible sponsors will not prejudice the review or evaluation of a project under this program.  

I11(i) T3Appendix.G1T1 Each project narrative is expected to be complete in itself and to meet the 20-page limitation. Inclusion of material in an Appendix should not be used to circumvent the 20-page limitation of the proposal narrative. However, in those instances where inclusion of supplemental information is necessary to guarantee the peer review panel's complete understanding of a proposal or to illustrate the integrity of the design or a main thesis of the proposal, such information may be included in an Appendix. Examples of supplemental material are photographs, journal reprints, brochures and other pertinent materials which are deemed to be illustrative of major points in the narrative but unsuitable for inclusion in the proposal narrative itself. Information on previously submitted proposals may also be presented in the Appendix (refer to �1A3405.11(d)). When possible, information in the Appendix should be presented in tabular format. A complete set of the Appendix material must be attached to each copy of the grant application submitted. The Appendix must be identified with the title of the project as it appears on Form CSREES�09712 of the proposal and the name(s) of the project director(s). The Appendix must be referenced in the proposal narrative.

I89Scope of a teaching proposal.

I11The teaching component of the program will support the targeted need area(s) related to strengthening teaching programs as specified in the annual program announcement. Proposals may focus on any subject matter area(s) in the food and agricultural sciences unless limited by determinations as specified in the annual program announcement. A proposal may address a single targeted need area or multiple targeted need areas, and may be focused on a single subject matter area or multiple subject matter areas, in any combination (e.g., curriculum development in horticulture; curriculum development, faculty enhancement, and student experiential learning in animal science; faculty enhancement in food science and agribusiness management; or instruction delivery systems and student experiential learning in plant science, horticulture, and entomology). Applicants are also encouraged to include a library enhancement component related to the teaching project in their proposals. A proposal may be directed toward the undergraduate or graduate level of study as specified in the annual program announcement. Targeted need areas for teaching programs will consist of one or more of the following:
I11(a) T3Curricula design and materials development.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this need area is to promote new and improved curricula and materials to increase the quality of, and continuously renew, the Nation's academic programs in the food and agricultural sciences. The overall objective is to stimulate the development and facilitate the use of exemplary education models and materials that incorporate the most recent advances in subject matter, research on teaching and learning theory, and instructional technology. Proposals may emphasize: The development of courses of study, degree programs, and instructional materials; the use of new approaches to the study of traditional subjects; or the introduction of new subjects, or new applications of knowledge, pertaining to the food and agricultural sciences.
I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to, curricula and materials that promote:
I11(i) Raising the level of scholastic achievement of the Nation's graduates in the food and agricultural sciences.
I11(ii) Addressing the special needs of particular groups of students, such as minorities, gifted and talented, or those with educational backgrounds that warrant enrichment.
I11(iii) Using alternative instructional strategies or methodologies, including computer-assisted instruction or simulation modeling, media programs that reach large audiences efficiently and effectively, activities that provide hands-on learning experiences, and educational programs that extend learning beyond the classroom.
I11(iv) Using sound pedagogy, particularly with regard to recent research on how to motivate students to learn, retain, apply, and transfer knowledge, skills, and competencies.
I11(v) Building student competencies to integrate and synthesize knowledge from several disciplines.
I11(b) T3Faculty preparation and enhancement for teaching.G1T1 (1) The purpose of �311�this need area is to advance faculty development in the areas of teaching competency, subject matter expertise, or student recruitment and advising skills. Teachers are central to education. They serve as models, motivators, and mentors_the catalysts of the learning process. Moreover, teachers are agents for developing, replicating, and exchanging effective teaching materials and methods. For these reasons, education can be strengthened only when teachers are adequately prepared, highly motivated, and appropriately recognized and rewarded.
I11(2) Each faculty recipient of support for developmental activities under �1A3406.11(b) must be an ``eligible participant'' as defined in �1A3406.2 of this part.
I11(3) Examples of developmental activities include, but are not limited to, those which enable teaching faculty to:
I11(i) Gain experience with recent developments or innovative technology relevant to their teaching responsibilities.

I11(ii) Work under the guidance and direction of experts who have substantial expertise in an area related to the developmental goals of the project.  
I11(iii) Work with scientists or professionals in government, industry, or other colleges or universities to learn new applications in a field.  
I11(iv) Obtain personal experience working with new ideas and techniques.  
I11(v) Expand competence with new methods of information delivery, such as computer-assisted or televised instruction.  
I11(c) T3Instruction delivery systems.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this need area is to encourage the use of alternative methods of delivering instruction to enhance the quality, effectiveness, and cost efficiency of teaching programs. The importance of this initiative is evidenced by advances in educational research which have substantiated the theory that differences in the learning styles of students often require alternative instructional methodologies. Also, the rising costs of higher education strongly suggest that colleges and universities undertake more efforts of a collaborative nature in order to deliver instruction which maximizes program quality and reduces unnecessary duplication. At the same time, advancements in knowledge and technology continue to introduce new subject matter areas which warrant consideration and implementation of innovative instruction techniques, methodologies, and delivery systems.  
I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to:  
I11(i) Use of computers.  
I11(ii) Teleconferencing.  
I11(iii) Networking via satellite communications.  
I11(iv) Regionalization of academic programs.  
I11(v) Mobile classrooms and laboratories.  
I11(vi) Individualized learning centers.  
I11(vii) Symposia, forums, regional or national workshops, etc.  
I11(d) T3Scientific Instrumentation for teaching.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this need area is to provide students in science-oriented courses the necessary experience with suitable, up-to-date equipment in order to involve them in work central to scientific understanding and progress.

A proposal may request support for acquiring new, state-of-the-art instructional scientific equipment, upgrading existing equipment, or replacing non-functional or clearly obsolete equipment.  
I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to:  
I11(i) Rental or purchase of modern instruments to improve student learning experiences in courses, laboratories, and field work.  
I11(ii) Development of new ways of using instrumentation to extend instructional capabilities.  
I11(iii) Establishment of equipment-sharing capability via consortia or centers that develop innovative opportunities, such as mobile laboratories or satellite access to industry or government laboratories.  
I11(e) T3Student experiential learning.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this need area is to further the development of student scientific and professional competencies through experiential learning programs �312�which provide students with opportunities to solve complex problems in the context of real-world situations. Effective experiential learning is essential in preparing future graduates to advance knowledge and technology, enhance quality of life, conserve resources, and revitalize the Nation's economic competitiveness. Such experiential learning opportunities are most effective when they serve to advance decision-making and communication skills as well as technological expertise.  
I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to, projects which:  
I11(i) Provide opportunities for students to participate in research projects, either as a part of an ongoing research project or in a project designed especially for this program.  
I11(ii) Provide opportunities for students to complete apprenticeships, internships, or similar participatory learning experiences.  
I11(iii) Expand and enrich courses which are of a practicum nature.  
I11(iv) Provide career mentoring experiences that link students with outstanding professionals.  
I11(f) T3Student recruitment and retention.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this need area is to strengthen student recruitment and retention programs in order to promote the future strength of the Nation's scientific and professional work force. The Nation's economic competitiveness and quality of life rest upon the availability of a cadre of outstanding research scientists, university faculty, and other professionals in the food and agricultural sciences. A substantial need exists to supplement efforts to attract increased numbers of academically outstanding students to prepare for careers as food and agricultural scientists and professionals. It is particularly important to augment the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of the student body in order to promote a robust exchange of ideas and a more effective use of the full breadth of the Nation's intellectual resources.  

I11(2) Each student recipient of monetary support for education costs or developmental purposes under �1A3406.11(f) must be enrolled at an eligible institution and meet the requirement of an ``eligible participant'' as defined in �1A3406.2 of this part.

I11(2) A detailed discussion of these partnership arrangements should be provided in the narrative portion of the proposal, as outlined in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section. 
�314�I11(3) Additional documentation, including letters of support or cooperation, may be provided in the Appendix. 
I11(d) T3Project summaryG1T1. (1) A Project Summary should immediately follow the summary documentation of USDA agency cooperation section. The information provided in the Project Summary will be used by the program staff for a variety of purposes, including the proper assignment of proposals to reviewers and providing information to reviewers prior to the peer panel meeting. The name of the institution, the targeted need area(s), and the title of the proposal must be identified exactly as shown on the ``Higher Education Proposal Cover Page.'' 
I11(2) If the proposal is a complementary project proposal, as defined in �1A3406.2 of this part, indicate such and identify the other complementary project(s) by citing the name of the submitting institution, the title of the project, the project director, and the grant number (if funded in a previous year) exactly as shown on the cover page of the complementary project so that appropriate consideration can be given to the interrelatedness of the proposals in the evaluation process. 
I11(3) If the proposal is a joint project proposal, as defined in �1A3406.2 of this part, indicate such and identify the other participating institutions and the key faculty member or other individual responsible for coordinating the project at each institution. 
I11(4) The Project Summary should be a concise description of the proposed activity suitable for publication by the Department to inform the general public about awards under the program. The text must not exceed one page, single-spaced. The Project Summary should be a self-contained description of the activity which would result if the proposal is funded by USDA. It should include: The objectives of the project; a synopsis of the plan of operation; a statement of how the project will enhance the teaching capacity of the institution; a description of how the project will strengthen higher education in the food and agricultural sciences in the United States; a description of the partnership efforts between, and the expected benefits for, the USDA agency cooperator(s) and the 1890 Institution; and the plans for disseminating project results. The Project Summary should be written so that a technically literate reader can evaluate the use of Federal funds in support of the project. 
I11(e) T3Resubmission of a proposalG1T1_(1) T3Resubmission of previously unfunded proposalsG1T1. (i) If a proposal has been submitted previously, but was not funded, such should be indicated in block 13. on Form CSREES�09712, ``Higher Education Proposal Cover Page,'' and the following information should be included in the proposal: 
I11(A) The fiscal year(s) in which the proposal was submitted previously; 
I11(B) A summary of the peer reviewers' comments; and 
I11(C) How these comments have been addressed in the current proposal, including the page numbers in the current proposal where the peer reviewers' comments have been addressed. 

I11(ii) This information may be provided as a section of the proposal following the Project Summary and preceding the proposal narrative or it may be placed in the Appendix (see paragraph (j) of this section). In either case, the location of this information should be indicated in the Table of Contents, and the fact that the proposal is a resubmitted proposal should be stated in the proposal narrative. Further, when possible, the information should be presented in tabular format. Applicants who choose to resubmit proposals that were previously submitted, but not funded, should note that resubmitted proposals must compete equally with newly submitted proposals. Submitting a proposal that has been revised based on a previous peer review panel's critique of the proposal does not guarantee the success of the resubmitted proposal. 
I11(2) T3Resubmission of previously funded proposalsG1T1. Recognizing that capacity building is a long-term ongoing process, the 1890 Institution Capacity Building Grants Program is interested in funding subsequent phases of previously funded projects in order to build institutional capacity, and institutions are encouraged to build on a theme over several grant awards. However, proposals that are sequential continuations or new stages of previously �315�funded Capacity Building Grants must compete with first-time proposals. Therefore, project directors should thoroughly demonstrate how the project proposed in the current application expands substantially upon a previously funded project (i.e., demonstrate how the new project will advance the former project to the next level of attainment or will achieve expanded goals). The proposal must also show the degree to which the new phase promotes innovativeness and creativity beyond the scope of the previously funded project. Please note that the 1890 Institution Capacity Building Grants Program is not designed to support activities that are essentially repetitive in nature over multiple grant awards. Project directors who have had their projects funded previously are discouraged from resubmitting relatively identical proposals for further funding. 
I11(f) T3Narrative of a teaching proposalG1T1. The narrative portion of the proposal is limited to 20 pages in length. The one-page Project Summary is not included in the 20-page limitation. The narrative must be typed on one side of the page only, using a font no smaller than 12 point, and double-spaced. All margins must be at least one inch. All pages following the summary documentation of USDA agency cooperation must be paginated. It should be noted that peer reviewers will not be required to read beyond 20 pages of the narrative to evaluate the proposal. The narrative should contain the following sections: 
I11(1) T3Potential for advancing the quality of educationG1T1_(i) T3Impact.G1T1 (A) Identify the targeted need area(s). 
I11(B) Clearly state the specific instructional problem or opportunity to be addressed. 
I11(C) Describe how and by whom the focus and scope of the project were determined. Summarize the body of knowledge which substantiates the need for the proposed project. 
I11(D) Describe ongoing or recently completed significant activities related to the proposed project for which previous funding was received under this program. 
I11(E) Discuss how the project will be of value at the State, regional, national, or international level(s). 
I11(F) Discuss how the benefits to be derived from the project will transcend the proposing institution or the grant period. Also discuss the probabilities of its adaptation by other institutions. For example, can the project serve as a model for others? 
I11(ii) T3Continuation plans.G1T1 Discuss the likelihood of, or plans for, continuation or expansion of the project beyond USDA support. For example, does the institution's long-range budget or academic plan provide for the realistic continuation or expansion of the initiative undertaken by this project after the end of the grant period, are plans for eventual self-support built into the project, are plans being made to institutionalize the program if it meets with success, and are there indications of other continuing non-Federal support? 
I11(iii) T3InnovationG1T1. Describe the degree to which the proposal reflects an innovative or non-traditional approach to solving a higher education problem or strengthening the quality of higher education in the food and agricultural sciences. 
I11(iv) T3Products and resultsG1T1. Explain the kinds of results and products expected and their impact on strengthening food and agricultural sciences higher education in the United States, including attracting academically outstanding students and increasing the ethnic, racial, and gender diversity of the Nation's food and agricultural scientific and professional expertise base. 
I11(2) T3Overall approach and cooperative linkagesG1T1_(i) T3Proposed approachG1T1_(A) T3ObjectivesG1T1. Cite and discuss the specific objectives to be accomplished under the project. 
I11(B) T3Plan of operationG1T1. (T31G1T1) Describe procedures for accomplishing the objectives of the project. 
I11(T32G1T1) Describe plans for management of the project to enhance its proper and efficient administration. 

I11(T33G1T1) Describe the way in which resources and personnel will be used to conduct the project.  
I11(C) T3Timetable.G1T1 Provide a timetable for conducting the project. Identify all important project milestones and dates as �316�they relate to project start-up, execution, dissemination, evaluation, and close-out.  
I11(ii) T3Evaluation plans.G1T1 (A) Provide a plan for evaluating the accomplishment of stated objectives during the conduct of the project. Indicate the criteria, and corresponding weight of each, to be used in the evaluation process, describe any data to be collected and analyzed, and explain the methodology that will be used to determine the extent to which the needs underlying the project are met. 
I11(B) Provide a plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the end results upon conclusion of the project. Include the same kinds of information requested in paragraph (f) (2)(ii)(A) of this section.  
I11(iii) T3Dissemination plans.G1T1 Discuss plans to disseminate project results and products. Identify target audiences and explain methods of communication. 
I11(iv) T3Partnerships and collaborative efforts.G1T1 (A) Explain how the project will maximize partnership ventures and collaborative efforts to strengthen food and agricultural sciences higher education (e.g., involvement of faculty in related disciplines at the same institution, joint projects with other colleges or universities, or cooperative activities with business or industry). Also explain how it will stimulate academia, the States, or the private sector to join with the Federal partner in enhancing food and agricultural sciences higher education.  
I11(B) Provide evidence, via letters from the parties involved, that arrangements necessary for collaborative partnerships or joint initiatives have been discussed and realistically can be expected to come to fruition, or actually have been finalized contingent on an award under this program. Letters must be signed by an official who has the authority to commit the resources of the organization. Such letters should be referenced in the plan of operation, but the actual letters should be included in the Appendix section of the proposal. Any potential conflict(s) of interest that might result from the proposed collaborative arrangements must be discussed in detail. Proposals which indicate joint projects with other institutions must state which proposer is to receive any resulting grant award, since only one submitting institution can be the recipient of a project grant under one proposal.  
I11(C) Explain how the project will create a new or enhance an existing partnership between the USDA agency cooperator(s) and the 1890 Institution(s). This section should expand upon the summary information provided in the documentation of USDA agency cooperation section, as outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This is particularly important because the focal point of attention in the peer review process is the proposal narrative. Therefore, a comprehensive discussion of the partnership effort between USDA and the 1890 Institution should be provided.  
I11(3) T3Institutional capacity buildingG1T1_(i) T3Institutional enhancement.G1T1 Explain how the proposed project will strengthen the teaching capacity, as defined in �1A3406.2 of this part, of the applicant institution and, if applicable, any other institutions assuming a major role in the conduct of the project. For example, describe how the proposed project is intended to strengthen the institution's academic infrastructure by expanding the current faculty's expertise base, advancing the scholarly quality of the institution's academic programs, enriching the racial, ethnic, or gender diversity of the student body, helping the institution establish itself as a center of excellence in a particular field of education, helping the institution maintain or acquire state-of-the-art scientific instrumentation or library collections for teaching, or enabling the institution to provide more meaningful student experiential learning opportunities.  

I11(ii) T3Institutional commitmentG1T1. (A) Discuss the institution's commitment to the project and its successful completion. Provide, as relevant, appropriate documentation in the Appendix. Substantiate that the institution attributes a high priority to the project.  
I11(B) Discuss how the project will contribute to the achievement of the institution's long-term (five- to ten-year) goals and how the project will help satisfy the institution's high-priority objectives. Show how this project is �317�linked to and supported by the institution's strategic plan.  
I11(C) Discuss the commitment of institutional resources to the project. Show that the institutional resources to be made available to the project will be adequate, when combined with the support requested from USDA, to carry out the activities of the project and represent a sound commitment by the institution. Discuss institutional facilities, equipment, computer services, and other appropriate resources available to the project.  
I11(g) T3Key personnel.G1T1 A Form CSREES�09708, ``Summary Vita_Teaching Proposal,'' should be included for each key person associated with the project.  
I11(h) T3Budget and cost-effectivenessG1T1_(1) T3Budget form.G1T1 (i) Prepare Form CSREES�09713, ``Higher Education Budget,'' in accordance with instructions provided with the form. Proposals may request support for a period to be identified in each year's program announcement. A budget form is required for each year of requested support. In addition, a summary budget is required detailing the requested total support for the overall project period. Form CSREES�09713 may be reproduced as needed by proposers. Funds may be requested under any of the categories listed on the form, provided that the item or service for which support is requested is allowable under the authorizing legislation, the applicable Federal cost principles, the administrative provisions in this part, and can be justified as necessary for the successful conduct of the proposed project.  
I11(ii) The approved negotiated instruction rate or the maximum rate allowed by law should be used when computing indirect costs. If a reduced rate of indirect costs is voluntarily requested from USDA, the remaining allowable indirect costs may be used as matching funds.  
I11(2) T3Matching funds.G1T1 When documenting matching contributions, use the following guidelines:  
I11(i) When preparing the column entitled ``Applicant Contributions To Matching Funds'' of Form CSREES�09713, only those costs to be contributed by the applicant for the purposes of matching should be shown. The total amount of this column should be indicated in item M.  
I11(ii) In item N of Form CSREES�09713, show a total dollar amount for Cash Contributions from both the applicant and any third parties; also show a total dollar amount (based on current fair market value) for Non-cash Contributions from both the applicant and any third parties.  
I11(iii) To qualify for any incentive benefits stemming from matching support or to satisfy any cost sharing requirements, proposals must include written verification of any actual commitments of matching support (including both cash and non-cash contributions) from third parties. Written verification means_ 
I11(A) For any third party cash contributions, a separate pledge agreement for each donation, signed by the authorized organizational representative(s) of the donor organization (or by the donor if the gift is from an individual) and the applicant institution, which must include: 
I11(T31G1T1) The name, address, and telephone number of the donor; 
I11(T32G1T1) The name of the applicant institution; 
I11(T33G1T1) The title of the project for which the donation is made; 
I11(T34G1T1) The dollar amount of the cash donation; and 
I11(T35G1T1) A statement that the donor will pay the cash contribution during the grant period; and  
I11(B) For any third party non-cash contributions, a separate pledge agreement for each contribution, signed by the authorized organizational representative(s) of the donor organization (or by the donor if the gift is from an individual) and the applicant institution, which must include: 
I11(T31G1T1) The name, address, and telephone number of the donor; 
I11(T32G1T1) The name of the applicant institution; 
I11(T33G1T1) The title of the project for which the donation is made; 
I11(T34G1T1) A good faith estimate of the current fair market value of the non-cash contribution; and 
I11(T35G1T1) A statement that the donor will make the contribution during the grant period.  
�318�I11(iv) All pledge agreements must be placed in the proposal immediately following Form CSREES�09713. The sources and amounts of all matching support from outside the applicant institution should be summarized in the Budget Narrative section of the proposal.  
I11(v) Applicants should refer to OMB Circulars A�09110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-profit Organizations,'' and A�0921, ``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions,'' for further guidance and other requirements relating to matching and allowable costs.  
I11(3) T3Chart on shared budget for joint project proposal.G1T1 (i) For a joint project proposal, a plan must be provided indicating how funds will be distributed to the participating institutions. The budget section of a joint project proposal should include a chart indicating: 

I11(A) The names of the participating institutions; 
I11(B) the amount of funds to be disbursed to those institutions; and 
I11(C) the way in which such funds will be used in accordance with items A through L of Form CSREES�09713, ``Higher Education Budget.''  
I11(ii) If a proposal is not for a joint project, such a chart is not required.  
I11(4) T3Budget narrative.G1T1 (i) Discuss how the budget specifically supports the proposed project activities. Explain how each budget item (such as salaries and wages for professional and technical staff, student stipends/scholarships, travel, equipment, etc.) is essential to achieving project objectives.  
I11(ii) Justify that the total budget, including funds requested from USDA and any matching support provided, will be adequate to carry out the activities of the project. Provide a summary of sources and amounts of all third party matching support.  
I11(iii) Justify the project's cost-effectiveness. Show how the project maximizes the use of limited resources, optimizes educational value for the dollar, achieves economies of scale, or leverages additional funds. For example, discuss how the project has the potential to generate a critical mass of expertise and activity focused on a targeted need area or promote coalition building that could lead to future ventures.  
I11(iv) Include the percentage of time key personnel will work on the project, both during the academic year and summer. When salaries of university project personnel will be paid by a combination of USDA and institutional funds, the total compensation must not exceed the faculty member's regular annual compensation. In addition, the total commitment of time devoted to the project, when combined with time for teaching and research duties, other sponsored agreements, and other employment obligations to the institution, must not exceed 100 percent of the normal workload for which the employee is compensated, in accordance with established university policies and applicable Federal cost principles.  
I11(v) If the proposal addresses more than one targeted need area (e.g., student experiential learning and instruction delivery systems), estimate the proportion of the funds requested from USDA that will support each respective targeted need area.  
I11(i) T3Current and pending support.G1T1 Each applicant must complete Form CSREES�09663, ``Current and Pending Support,'' identifying any other current public- or private-sponsored projects, in addition to the proposed project, to which key personnel listed in the proposal under consideration have committed portions of their time, whether or not salary support for the person(s) involved is included in the budgets of the various projects. This information should also be provided for any pending proposals which are currently being considered by, or which will be submitted in the near future to, other possible sponsors, including other USDA programs or agencies. Concurrent submission of identical or similar projects to other possible sponsors will not prejudice the review or evaluation of a project under this program.  
I11(j) T3Appendix.G1T1 Each project narrative is expected to be complete in itself and to meet the 20-page limitation. Inclusion of material in an Appendix should not be used to circumvent the 20-page limitation of the proposal narrative. However, in those instances where inclusion of supplemental information is �319�necessary to guarantee the peer review panel's complete understanding of a proposal or to illustrate the integrity of the design or a main thesis of the proposal, such information may be included in an Appendix. Examples of supplemental material are photographs, journal reprints, brochures and other pertinent materials which are deemed to be illustrative of major points in the narrative but unsuitable for inclusion in the proposal narrative itself. Information on previously submitted proposals may also be presented in the Appendix (refer to paragraph(e) of this section). When possible, information in the Appendix should be presented in tabular format. A complete set of the Appendix material must be attached to each copy of the grant application submitted. The Appendix must be identified with the title of the project as it appears on Form CSREES�09712 of the proposal and the name(s) of the project director(s). The Appendix must be referenced in the proposal narrative.

I89Scope of a research proposal.
I11The research component of the program will support projects that address high-priority research initiatives in areas such as those illustrated in this section where there is a present or anticipated need for increased knowledge or capabilities or in which it is feasible for applicants to develop programs recognized for their excellence. Applicants are also encouraged to include in their proposals a library enhancement component related to the initiative(s) for which they have prepared their proposals.
I11(a) T3Studies and experimentation in food and agricultural sciences.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this initiative is to advance the body of knowledge in those basic and applied natural and social sciences that comprise the food and agricultural sciences.
I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to:
I11(i) Conduct plant or animal breeding programs to develop better crops, forests, or livestock (e.g., more disease resistant, more productive, yielding higher quality products).
�321�I11(ii) Conceive, design, and evaluate new bioprocessing techniques for eliminating undesirable constituents from or adding desirable ones to food products.
I11(iii) Propose and evaluate ways to enhance utilization of the capabilities and resources of food and agricultural institutions to promote rural development (e.g., exploitation of new technologies by small rural businesses).
I11(iv) Identify control factors influencing consumer demand for agricultural products.
I11(v) Analyze social, economic, and physiological aspects of nutrition, housing, and life-style choices, and of community strategies for meeting the changing needs of different population groups.
I11(vi) Other high-priority areas such as human nutrition, sustainable agriculture, biotechnology, agribusiness management and marketing, and aquaculture.
I11(b) T3Centralized research support systems.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this initiative is to establish centralized support systems to meet national needs or serve regions or clientele that cannot otherwise afford or have ready access to the support in question, or to provide such support more economically thereby freeing up resources for other research uses.
I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to:
I11(i) Storage, maintenance, characterization, evaluation and enhancement of germplasm for use by animal and plant breeders, including those using the techniques of biotechnology.
I11(ii) Computerized data banks of important scientific information (e.g., epidemiological, demographic, nutrition, weather, economic, crop yields, etc.).
I11(iii) Expert service centers for sophisticated and highly specialized methodologies (e.g., evaluation of organoleptic and nutritional quality of foods, toxicology, taxonomic identifications, consumer preferences, demographics, etc.).
I11(c) T3Technology delivery systems.G1T1 (1) The purpose of this initiative is to promote innovations and improvements in the delivery of benefits of food and agricultural sciences to producers and consumers, particularly those who are currently disproportionately low in receipt of such benefits.
I11(2) Examples include, but are not limited to:
I11(i) Computer-based decision support systems to assist small-scale farmers to take advantage of relevant technologies, programs, policies, etc.
I11(ii) Efficacious delivery systems for nutrition information or for resource management assistance for low-income families and individuals.
I11(d) T3Other creative proposals.G1T1 The purpose of this initiative is to encourage other creative proposals, outside the areas previously outlined, that are designed to provide needed enhancement of the Nation's food and agricultural research system.

I89Content of a research proposal.
I11(a) T3Proposal cover page.G1T1 (1) Form CSREES�09712, ``Higher Education Proposal Cover Page,'' must be completed in its entirety. Note that providing a Social Security Number is voluntary, but is an integral part of the CSREES information system and will assist in the processing of the proposal.
I11(2) One copy of Form CSREES�09712 must contain the pen-and-ink signatures of the principal investigator(s) and Authorized Organizational Representative for the applicant institution.
I11(3) The title of the research project shown on the ``Higher Education Proposal Cover Page'' must be brief (80-character maximum) yet represent the major thrust of the project. This information will be used by the Department to provide information to the Congress and other interested parties.
I11(4) In block 7. of Form CSREES�09712, enter ``Capacity Building Grants Program.''
�322�I11(5) In block 8.a. of Form CSREES�09712, enter ``Research.'' In block 8.b. identify the code of the targeted need area(s) as found on the reverse of the form. If a proposal focuses on multiple targeted need areas, enter each code associated with the project. In block 8.c. identify the major area(s) of emphasis as found on the reverse of the form. If a proposal focuses on multiple areas of emphasis, enter each code associated with the project; however, please limit your selection to three areas. This information will be used by the program staff for the proper assignment of proposals to reviewers.
I11(6) In block 9. of Form CSREES�09712, indicate if the proposal is a complementary project proposal or joint project proposal as defined in �1A3406.2 of this part. If it is not a complementary project proposal or a joint project proposal, identify it as a regular proposal.
I11(7) In block 13. of Form CSREES�09712, indicate if the proposal is a new, first-time submission or if the proposal is a resubmission of a proposal that has been submitted to, but not funded under the 1890 Institution Capacity Building Grants Program in a previous competition.
I11(b) T3Table of contents.G1T1 For ease of locating information, each proposal must contain a detailed table of contents just after the Proposal Cover Page. The Table of Contents should include page numbers for each component of the proposal. Pagination should begin immediately following the summary documentation of USDA agency cooperation.
I11(c) T3USDA agency cooperator.G1T1 To be considered for funding, each proposal must include documentation of cooperation with at least one USDA agency or office. If multiple agencies are involved as cooperators, documentation must be included from each agency. When documenting cooperative arrangements, the following guidelines should be used:
I11(1) A summary of the cooperative arrangements must immediately follow the Table of Contents. This summary should:
I11(i) Bear the signatures of the Agency Head (or his/her designated authorized representative) and the university project director;
I11(ii) Indicate the agency's willingness to commit support for the project;
I11(iii) Identify the person(s) at the USDA agency who will serve as the liaison or technical contact for the project;
I11(iv) Describe the degree and nature of the USDA agency's involvement in the proposed project, as outlined in �1A3406.6(a) of this part, including its role in:
I11(A) Identifying the need for the project;
I11(B) Developing a conceptual approach;
I11(C) Assisting with project design;

I11(K) Seeking other innovative ways to ensure the success of the project and advance the needs of the institution or the agency; and
I11(v) Describe the expected benefits of the partnership venture for the USDA agency and for the 1890 Institution.
I11(2) A detailed discussion of these partnership arrangements should be provided in the narrative portion of the proposal, as outlined in paragraph (f)(2)(iv)(C) of this section.
I11(3) Additional documentation, including letters of support or cooperation, may be provided in the Appendix.
I11(d) T3Project summary.G1T1 (1) A Project Summary should immediately follow the summary documentation of USDA agency cooperation. The information provided in the Project Summary will be used by the program staff for a variety of purposes, including the proper assignment of proposals to peer reviewers and providing information to peer �323�reviewers prior to the peer panel meeting. The name of the institution, the targeted need area(s), and the title of the proposal must be identified exactly as shown on the ``Higher Education Proposal Cover Page.''

I11(2) If the proposal is a complementary project proposal, as defined in �1A3406.2 of this part, clearly state this fact and identify the other complementary project(s) by citing the name of the submitting institution, the title of the project, the principal investigator, and the grant number (if funded in a previous year) exactly as shown on the cover page of the complementary project so that appropriate consideration can be given to the interrelatedness of the proposals in the evaluation process.  
I11(3) If the proposal is a joint project proposal, as defined in �1A3406.2 of this part, indicate such and identify the other participating institutions and the key person responsible for coordinating the project at each institution.  
I11(4) The Project Summary should be a concise description of the proposed activity suitable for publication by the Department to inform the general public about awards under the program. The text should not exceed one page, single-spaced. The Project Summary should be a self-contained description of the activity which would result if the proposal is funded by USDA. It should include: The objective of the project, a synopsis of the plan of operation, a statement of how the project will enhance the research capacity of the institution, a description of how the project will enhance research in the food and agricultural sciences, and a description of the partnership efforts between, and the expected benefits for, the USDA agency cooperator(s) and the 1890 Institution and the plans for disseminating project results. The Project Summary should be written so that a technically literate reader can evaluate the use of Federal funds in support of the project.  
I11(e) T3Resubmission of a proposalG1T1_(1) T3Resubmission of previously unfunded proposals.G1T1 (i) If the proposal has been submitted previously, but was not funded, such should be indicated in block 13. on Form CSREES�09712, ``Higher Education Proposal Cover Page,'' and the following information should be included in the proposal: 
I11(A) The fiscal year(s) in which the proposal was submitted previously; 
I11(B) A summary of the peer reviewers' comments; and 
I11(C) How these comments have been addressed in the current proposal, including the page numbers in the current proposal where the peer reviewers' comments have been addressed.  
I11(ii) This information may be provided as a section of the proposal following the Project Summary and preceding the proposal narrative or it may be placed in the Appendix (see paragraph (j) of this section). In either case, the location of this information should be indicated in the Table of Contents, and the fact that the proposal is a resubmitted proposal should be stated in the proposal narrative. Further, when possible, the information should be presented in a tabular format. Applicants who choose to resubmit proposals that were previously submitted, but not funded, should note that resubmitted proposals must compete equally with newly submitted proposals. Submitting a proposal that has been revised based on a previous peer review panel's critique of the proposal does not guarantee the success of the resubmitted proposal.  
I11(2) T3Resubmission of previously funded proposals.G1T1 Recognizing that capacity building is a long-term ongoing process, the 1890 Institution Capacity Building Grants Program is interested in funding subsequent phases of previously funded projects in order to build institutional capacity, and institutions are encouraged to build on a theme over several grant awards. However, proposals that are sequential continuations or new stages of previously funded Capacity Building Grants must compete with first-time proposals. Therefore, principal investigators should thoroughly demonstrate how the project proposed in the current application expands substantially upon a previously funded project (i.e., demonstrate how the new project will advance the former project to the next level of attainment or will achieve expanded goals). The proposal must also show the degree to which the new �324�phase promotes innovativeness and creativity beyond the scope of the previously funded project. Please note that the 1890 Institution Capacity Building Grants Program is not designed to support activities that are essentially repetitive in nature over multiple grant awards. Principal investigators who have had their projects funded previously are discouraged from resubmitting relatively identical proposals for future funding. 
I11(f) T3Narrative of a research proposal.G1T1 The narrative portion of the proposal is limited to 20 pages in length. The one-page Project Summary is not included in the 20-page limitation. The narrative must be typed on one side of the page only, using a font no smaller than 12 point, and double-spaced. All margins must be at least one inch. All pages following the summary documentation of USDA agency cooperation must be paginated. It should be noted that peer reviewers will not be required to read beyond 20 pages of the narrative to evaluate the proposal. The narrative should contain the following sections:  
I11(1) T3Significance of the problemG1T1_(i) T3ImpactG1T1_(A) T3Identification of the problem or opportunity.G1T1 Clearly identify the specific problem or opportunity to be addressed and present any research questions or hypotheses to be examined.  

I11(B) T3Rationale.G1T1 Provide a rationale for the proposed approach to the problem or opportunity and indicate the part that the proposed project will play in advancing food and agricultural research and knowledge. Discuss how the project will be of value and importance at the State, regional, national, or international level(s). Also discuss how the benefits to be derived from the project will transcend the proposing institution or the grant period.  
I11(C) T3Literature review.G1T1 Include a comprehensive summary of the pertinent scientific literature. Citations may be footnoted to a bibliography in the Appendix. Citations should be accurate, complete, and adhere to an acceptable journal format. Explain how such knowledge (or previous findings) is related to the proposed project.  
I11(D) T3Current research and related activities.G1T1 Describe the relevancy of the proposed project to current research or significant research support activities at the proposing institution and any other institution participating in the project, including research which may be as yet unpublished.  
I11(ii) T3Continuation plans.G1T1 Discuss the likelihood or plans for continuation or expansion of the project beyond USDA support. Discuss, as applicable, how the institution's long-range budget, and administrative and academic plans, provide for the realistic continuation or expansion of the line of research or research support activity undertaken by this project after the end of the grant period. For example, are there plans for securing non-Federal support for the project? Is there any potential for income from patents, technology transfer or university-business enterprises resulting from the project? Also discuss the probabilities of the proposed activity or line of inquiry being pursued by researchers at other institutions.  
I11(iii) T3Innovation.G1T1 Describe the degree to which the proposal reflects an innovative or non-traditional approach to a food and agricultural research initiative.  
I11(iv) T3Products and results.G1T1 Explain the kinds of products and results expected and their impact on strengthening food and agricultural sciences higher education in the United States, including attracting academically outstanding students or increasing the ethnic, racial, and gender diversity of the Nation's food and agricultural scientific and professional expertise base.  
I11(2) T3Overall approach and cooperative linkagesG1T1_(i) T3ApproachG1T1_(A) T3Objectives.G1T1 Cite and discuss the specific objectives to be accomplished under the project.  
I11(B) T3Plan of operation.G1T1 The procedures or methodologies to be applied to the proposed project should be explicitly stated. This section should include, but not necessarily be limited to a description of:  
I11(T31G1T1) The proposed investigations, experiments, or research support enhancements in the sequence in which they will be carried out.  
I11(T32G1T1) Procedures and techniques to be employed, including their feasibility.  
I11(T33G1T1) Means by which data will be collected and analyzed.  
�325�I11(T34G1T1) Pitfalls that might be encountered.  
I11(T35G1T1) Limitations to proposed procedures.  
I11(C) T3Timetable.G1T1 Provide a timetable for execution of the project. Identify all important research milestones and dates as they relate to project start-up, execution, dissemination, evaluation, and close-out.  
I11(ii) T3Evaluation plans.G1T1 (A) Provide a plan for evaluating the accomplishment of stated objectives during the conduct of the project. Indicate the criteria, and corresponding weight of each, to be used in the evaluation process, describe any performance data to be collected and analyzed, and explain the methodologies that will be used to determine the extent to which the needs underlying the project are being met.  

I11(B) Provide a plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the end results upon conclusion of the project. Include the same kinds of information requested in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. 
I11(iii) Dissemination plans. Provide plans for disseminating project results and products including the possibilities for publications. Identify target audiences and explain methods of communication. 
I11(iv) T3Partnerships and collaborative efforts.G1T1 (A) Explain how the project will maximize partnership ventures and collaborative efforts to strengthen food and agricultural sciences higher education (e.g., involvement of faculty in related disciplines at the same institution, joint projects with other colleges or universities, or cooperative activities with business or industry). Also explain how it will stimulate academia, the States, or the private sector to join with the Federal partner in enhancing food and agricultural sciences higher education. 
I11(B) Provide evidence, via letters from the parties involved, that arrangements necessary for collaborative partnerships or joint initiatives have been discussed and realistically can be expected to come to fruition, or actually have been finalized contingent on an award under this program. Letters must be signed by an official who has the authority to commit the resources of the organization. Such letters should be referenced in the plan of operation, but the actual letters should be included in the Appendix section of the proposal. Any potential conflict(s) of interest that might result from the proposed collaborative arrangements must be discussed in detail. Proposals which indicate joint projects with other institutions must state which proposer is to receive any resulting grant award, since only one submitting institution can be the recipient of a project grant under one proposal. 
I11(C) Explain how the project will create a new or enhance an existing partnership between the USDA agency cooperator(s) and the 1890 Institution(s). This section should expand upon the summary information provided in the documentation of USDA agency cooperation section, as outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This is particularly important because the focal point of attention in the peer review process is the proposal narrative. Therefore, a comprehensive discussion of the partnership effort between USDA and the 1890 Institution should be provided. 
I11(3) T3Institutional capacity buildingG1T1_(i) T3Institutional enhancement.G1T1 Explain how the proposed project will strengthen the research capacity, as defined in �1A3406.2 of this part, of the applicant institution and, if applicable, any other institutions assuming a major role in the conduct of the project. For example, describe how the proposed project is intended to strengthen the institution's research infrastructure by advancing the expertise of the current faculty in the natural or social sciences; providing a better research environment, state-of-the-art equipment, or supplies; enhancing library collections; or enabling the institution to provide efficacious organizational structures and reward systems to attract and retain first-rate research faculty and students_particularly those from underrepresented groups. 
I11(ii) T3Institutional commitment.G1T1 (A) Discuss the institution's commitment to the project and its successful completion. Provide, as relevant, appropriate documentation in the Appendix. Substantiate that the institution attributes a high priority to the project. 
�326�I11(B) Discuss how the project will contribute to the achievement of the institution's long-term (five- to ten-year) goals and how the project will help satisfy the institution's high-priority objectives. Show how this project is linked to and supported by the institution's strategic plan. 
I11(C) Discuss the commitment of institutional resources to the project. Show that the institutional resources to be made available to the project will be adequate, when combined with the support requested from USDA, to carry out the activities of the project and represent a sound commitment by the institution. Discuss institutional facilities, equipment, computer services, and other appropriate resources available to the project. 
I11(g) T3Key personnel.G1T1 A Form CSREES�09710, ``Summary Vita_Research Proposal,'' should be included for each key person associated with the project. 
I11(h) T3Budget and cost-effectivenessG1T1_(1) T3Budget form.G1T1 (i) Prepare Form CSREES�09713, ``Higher Education Budget,'' in accordance with instructions provided with the form. Proposals may request support for a period to be identified in each year's program announcement. A budget form is required for each year of requested support. In addition, a summary budget is required detailing the requested total support for the overall project period. Form CSREES�09713 may be reproduced as needed by proposers. Funds may be requested under any of the categories listed on the form, provided that the item or service for which support is requested is allowable under the authorizing legislation, the applicable Federal cost principles, the administrative provisions in this part, and can be justified as necessary for the successful conduct of the proposed project. 

I11(ii) The approved negotiated research rate or the maximum rate allowed by law should be used when computing indirect costs. If a reduced rate of indirect costs is voluntarily requested from USDA, the remaining allowable indirect costs may be used as matching funds. In the event that a proposal reflects an incorrect indirect cost rate and is recommended for funding, the correct rate will be applied to the approved budget in the grant award. 
I11(2) T3Matching funds.G1T1 When documenting matching contributions, use the following guidelines: 
I11(i) When preparing the column entitled ``Applicant Contributions To Matching Funds'' of Form CSREES�09713, only those costs to be contributed by the applicant for the purposes of matching should be shown. The total amount of this column should be indicated in item M. 
I11(ii) In item N of Form CSREES�09713, show a total dollar amount for Cash Contributions from both the applicant and any third parties; also show a total dollar amount (based on current fair market value) for Non-cash Contributions from both the applicant and any third parties. 
I11(iii) To qualify for any incentive benefits stemming from matching support or to satisfy any cost sharing requirements, proposals must include written verification of any actual commitments of matching support (including both cash and non-cash contributions) from third parties. Written verification means_ 
I11(A) For any third party cash contributions, a separate pledge agreement for each donation, signed by the authorized organizational representative(s) of the donor organization (or by the donor if the gift is from an individual) and the applicant institution, which must include: 
I11(T31G1T1) The name, address, and telephone number of the donor; 
I11(T32G1T1) The name of the applicant institution; 
I11(T33G1T1) The title of the project for which the donation is made; 
I11(T34G1T1) The dollar amount of the cash donation; and 
I11(T35G1T1) A statement that the donor will pay the cash contribution during the grant period; and 
I11(B) For any third party non-cash contributions, a separate pledge agreement for each contribution, signed by the authorized organizational representative(s) of the donor organization (or by the donor if the gift is from an individual) and the applicant institution, which must include: 
I11(T31G1T1) The name, address, and telephone number of the donor; 
I11(T32G1T1) The name of the applicant institution; 
�327�I11(T33G1T1) The title of the project for which the donation is made; 
I11(T34G1T1) A good faith estimate of the current fair market value of the non-cash contribution; and 
I11(T35G1T1) A statement that the donor will make the contribution during the grant period. 
I11(iv) All pledge agreements must be placed in the proposal immediately following Form CSREES�09713. The sources and amounts of all matching support from outside the applicant institution should be summarized in the Budget Narrative section of the proposal. 
I11(v) Applicants should refer to OMB Circulars A�09110, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and Other Non-profit Organizations,'' and A�0921, ``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions,'' for further guidance and other requirements relating to matching and allowable costs. 
I11(3) T3Chart on shared budget for joint project proposal.G1T1 (i) For a joint project proposal, a plan must be provided indicating how funds will be distributed to the participating institutions. The budget section of a joint project proposal should include a chart indicating: 
I11(A) The names of the participating institutions; 
I11(B) the amount of funds to be disbursed to those institutions; and 
I11(C) the way in which such funds will be used in accordance with items A through L of Form CSREES�09713, ``Higher Education Budget.'' 
I11(ii) If a proposal is not for a joint project, such a chart is not required. 
I11(4) T3Budget narrative.G1T1 (i) Discuss how the budget specifically supports the proposed project activities. Explain how each budget item (such as salaries and wages for professional and technical staff, student workers, travel, equipment, etc.) is essential to achieving project objectives. 
I11(ii) Justify that the total budget, including funds requested from USDA and any matching support provided, will be adequate to carry out the activities of the project. Provide a summary of sources and amounts of all third party matching support. 
I11(iii) Justify the project's cost-effectiveness. Show how the project maximizes the use of limited resources, optimizes research value for the dollar, achieves economies of scale, or leverages additional funds. For example, discuss how the project has the potential to generate a critical mass of expertise and activity focused on a high-priority research initiative(s) or promote coalition building that could lead to future ventures. 
I11(iv) Include the percentage of time key personnel will work on the project, both during the academic year and summer. When salaries of university project personnel will be paid by a combination of USDA and institutional funds, the total compensation must not exceed the faculty member's regular annual compensation. In addition, the total commitment of time devoted to the project, when combined with time for teaching and research duties, other sponsored agreements, and other employment obligations to the institution, must not exceed 100 percent of the normal workload for which the employee is compensated, in accordance with established university policies and applicable Federal cost principles. 

I11(v) If the proposal addresses more than one targeted need area, estimate the proportion of the funds requested from USDA that will support each respective targeted need area.  
I11(i) T3Current and pending support.G1T1 Each applicant must complete Form CSREES�09663, ``Current and Pending Support,'' identifying any other current public- or private-sponsored projects, in addition to the proposed project, to which key personnel listed in the proposal under consideration have committed portions of their time, whether or not salary support for the person(s) involved is included in the budgets of the various projects. This information should also be provided for any pending proposals which are currently being considered by, or which will be submitted in the near future to, other possible sponsors, including other USDA programs or agencies. Concurrent submission of identical or similar projects to other possible sponsors will not prejudice the review or evaluation of a project under this program.  
I11(j) T3Appendix.G1T1 Each project narrative is expected to be complete in itself and �328�to meet the 20-page limitation. Inclusion of material in the Appendix should not be used to circumvent the 20-page limitation of the proposal narrative. However, in those instances where inclusion of supplemental information is necessary to guarantee the peer review panel's complete understanding of a proposal or to illustrate the integrity of the design or a main thesis of the proposal, such information may be included in the Appendix. Examples of supplemental material are photographs, journal reprints, brochures and other pertinent materials which are deemed to be illustrative of major points in the narrative but unsuitable for inclusion in the proposal narrative itself. Information on previously submitted proposals may also be presented in the Appendix (refer to paragraph (e) of this section). When possible, information in the Appendix should be presented in tabular format. A complete set of the Appendix material must be attached to each copy of the grant application submitted. The Appendix must be identified with the title of the project as it appears on Form CSREES�09712 of the proposal and the name(s) of the principal investigator(s). The Appendix must be referenced in the proposal narrative.  
I11(k) T3Special considerations.G1T1 A number of situations encountered in the conduct of research require special information or supporting documentation before funding can be approved for the project. If such situations are anticipated, proposals must so indicate via completion of Form CSREES�09662, ``Assurance Statement(s).'' It is expected that some applications submitted in response to these guidelines will involve the following:  
I11(1) T3Recombinant DNA research.G1T1 All key personnel identified in the proposal and all endorsing officials of the proposing organization are required to comply with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health entitled ``Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules,'' as revised. All applicants proposing to use recombinant DNA techniques must so indicate by checking the appropriate box on Form CSREES�09712, ``Higher Education Proposal Cover Page,'' and by completing the applicable section of Form CSREES�09662. In the event a project involving recombinant DNA or RNA molecules results in a grant award, the Institutional Biosafety Committee of the proposing institution must approve the research plan before CSREES will release grant funds.  
I11(2) T3Protection of human subjects.G1T1 Responsibility for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects used in any grant project supported with funds provided by CSREES rests with the performing organization. Guidance on this is contained in Department of Agriculture regulations under 7 CFR part 1c. All applicants who propose to use human subjects for experimental purposes must indicate their intention by checking the appropriate block on Form CSREES�09712, ``Higher Education Proposal Cover Page,'' and by completing the appropriate portion of Form CSREES�09662. In the event a project involving human subjects results in a grant award, the Institutional Review Board of the proposing institution must approve the research plan before CSREES will release grant funds.  

I11(3) T3Laboratory animal care.G1T1 Responsibility for the humane care and treatment of laboratory animals used in any grant project supported with funds provided by CSREES rests with the performing organization. All key project personnel and all endorsing officials of the proposing organization are required to comply with the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2131 T3et seq.G1T1), and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Secretary of Agriculture in 9 CFR parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 pertaining to the care, handling, and treatment of laboratory animals. All applicants proposing a project which involves the use of laboratory animals must indicate their intention by checking the appropriate block on Form CSREES�09712, ``Higher Education Proposal Cover Page,'' and by completing the appropriate portion of Form CSREES�09662. In the event a project involving the use of living vertebrate animals results in a grant award, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the proposing institution must approve the research plan before CSREES will release grant funds.  
�329�I11(l) T3Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).G1T1 As outlined in 7 CFR Part 3407 (the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service regulations implementing NEPA), the environmental data for any proposed project is to be provided to CSREES so that CSREES may determine whether any further action is needed. In some cases, however, the preparation of environmental data may not be required. Certain categories of actions are excluded from the requirements of NEPA.  
I11(1) T3NEPA determination.G1T1 In order for CSREES to determine whether any further action is needed with respect to NEPA, pertinent information regarding the possible environmental impacts of a particular project is necessary; therefore, Form CSREES�091234, ``NEPA Exclusions Form,''ust be included in the proposal indicating whether the applicant is of the opinion that the project falls within a categorical exclusion and the reasons therefor. If it is the applicant's opinion that the proposed project falls within the categorical exclusions, the specific exclusion must be identified. Form CSREES�091234 and any supporting documentation should be placed at the end of the proposal and identified in the Table of Contents.  
I11(2) T3Exceptions to categorical exclusions.G1T1 Even though a project may fall within the categorical exclusions, CSREES may determine that an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary for an activity, if substantial controversy on environmental grounds exists or if other extraordinary conditions or circumstances are present which may cause such activity to have a significant environmental effect.

Q04I21T5Source:  T156 FR 49245, Sept. 27, 1991, unless otherwise noted.

I80�1A3407.1 
I89Background and purpose.
I11(a) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 T3et seq.G1T1) establishes national policies and goals for the protection of the human environment. Section 102(2) of NEPA directs all Federal agencies to give appropriate consideration to the environmental consequences of proposed actions in their decisionmaking and to prepare detailed environmental statements on major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
I11(b) The purpose of this regulation is to supplement the regulations for implementation of NEPA established by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and codified at 40 CFR parts 1500�091508, as adopted by USDA in 7 CFR part 1b.
I11(c) Unless otherwise noted, parenthetical citations throughout this part refer to the CEQ regulations.

I80�1A3407.2 
I89Definitions.
I11(a) T3Authorized Departmental OfficerG1T1 means the CSREES official, acting within the scope of delegated authority, who is responsible for awarding and administering project grants on behalf of USDA and for carrying out NEPA responsibilities as outlined in �1A3407.4(d) of this part. The Authorized Departmental Officer's responsibilities do not include the review, approval, management, or similar activity relating to programs or projects funded by CSREES on the basis of statutory formula and also do not include parallel responsibilities relating to the management or administration of cooperative agreements awarded by CSREES.
I11(b) Other terms used in this regulation have the same meaning as they have in the CEQ regulations.

I80�1A3407.3 
I89Policy.
I11(a) It is CSREES policy to comply with the provisions of NEPA and related laws and policies and with the implementing regulations cited in �1A3407.1(b) of this part.
I11(b) Environmental documents should be concise, written in plain language, and address the issues pertinent to the decision being made.
I11(c) Environmental documents may be substituted for or combined with other reports which serve to facilitate decisionmaking (40 CFR 1506.4).
I11(d) CSREES personnel will cooperate with other Federal and State agencies or units thereof, as well as with grantees, contractors, and other cooperating individuals or entities undertaking activities funded or recommended for �335�funding by CSREES to assure that NEPA considerations are addressed early in the planning process to avoid delays and conflicts (40 CFR 1501.2).
I11(e) CSREES reserves the right to require project participants outside of CSREES to furnish environmental data or documentation to assist CSREES in carrying out its responsibilities under NEPA. When an applicant, grantee, or other cooperating individual or organization is required to submit environmental data to CSREES, including preparation of an environmental assessment (EA), or when a contractor hired by a grantee or other cooperating party prepares environmental data or documentation, CSREES shall provide advance instructions to the applicant, grantee, or other cooperator relating to the preparation and submission of the required information. All information supplied by external project participants shall be subject to verification by CSREES (40 CFR 1506.5).
I11(f) When possible, costs of analyses and development of required environmental documents shall be planned for during the budgetary process relating to the plan or program. Where the nature of particular program agreements (e.g., grants, cooperative agreements, formula projects) are determined by CSREES to require environmental documentation, the cost of preparing such documentation and of reasonable mitigation efforts shall be considered allowable costs and may be charged to the project as a portion of the Federal or the non-Federal share of project costs. However, CSREES funds above those authorized for the program award will not be made available to recipients to cover such costs.
I11(g) Final environmental documents, decision notices, and records of decision shall be available to the public for review. There shall be an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed during environmental analysis (40 CFR 1501.7).
I11(h) The concept of tiering to eliminate repetitive discussions applicable to EISs (40 CFR part 1502) is applicable to EAs also.
I11(i) CSREES officials may adopt an existing Federal EA or EIS when a proposed action is substantially the same as the action for which an existing EA or EIS was prepared (40 CFR 1506.3), provided that the EA or EIS or portion thereof meets the standards for an adequate EA or EIS under these regulations.
I11(j) Existing environmental documents may be incorporated by reference to reduce the bulk of an EA or EIS (40 CFR 1502.21).
I11(k) After prior consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality, CSREES personnel may, in emergency situations, implement alternative arrangements for compliance with these procedures in accordance with 40 CFR 1506.11.

I80�1A3407.4 
I89Responsibilities.

I80�1A3407.5 
I89Classes of action.
I11The following describes typical classes of action associated with CSREES programs and related activities:
I11(a) Actions which normally do not require the preparation of an EA or an EIS are those actions which ordinarily do not have significant individual or cumulative effect on the quality of the human environment. These include those activities described in �1A3407.6 (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this part.
I11(b) Actions normally requiring an EA, but not necessarily an EIS, are those projects in which at least some level of uncertainty exists regarding individual or cumulative effects on the quality of the human environment. Such actions generally include those identified in �1A3407.6(b) and 3407.7 of this part.
I11(c) Actions normally requiring an EIS are projects which are determined to have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment or which will be performed under extraordinary circumstances. These types of actions are identified in �1A3407.6(b) and 3407.8 of this part.

I80�1A3407.6 
I89Categorical exclusions.
I11(a) All CSREES actions will be analyzed by the appropriate CSREES official specified in �1A3407.4(c) to determine whether the project under consideration will have a significant environmental effect prior to recommending to the official responsible for approving a formula project in the case of formula grants, or the official responsible for awarding a grant or cooperative agreement in the case of a grant or cooperative agreement that the action be undertaken. Unless otherwise determined to be necessary under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, however, the preparation of an EA or EIS is not required for the following categories of actions:
I11(1) T3Department of Agriculture Categorical Exclusions (7 CFR 1b.3).G1T1 (i) Policy development, planning and implementation which are related to routine activities such as personnel, organizational changes, or similar administrative functions; 
I11(ii) Activities which deal solely with the functions of programs, such as program budget proposals, disbursement, and transfer or reprogramming of funds; 
I11(iii) Inventories, research activities and studies, such as resource inventories and routine data collection when such actions are clearly limited in context and intensity; 
I11(iv) Educational and informational programs and activities; 
I11(v) Civil and criminal law enforcement and investigative activities; 
I11(vi) Activities which are advisory and consultative to other agencies and public and private entities; and 
I11(vii) Activities related to trade representation and market development activities abroad. 
I11(2) T3CSREES categorical exclusions.G1T1 Based on previous experience, the following categories of CSREES actions are excluded because they have been found to have limited scope and intensity and to have no significant individual or cumulative impacts on the quality of the human environment: 
I11(i) The following categories of research programs or projects of limited size and magnitude or with only short-term effects on the environment: 
�337�I11(A) Research conducted within any laboratory, greenhouse, or other contained facility where research practices and safeguards prevent environmental impacts; 
I11(B) Surveys, inventories, and similar studies that have limited context and minimal intensity in terms of changes in the environment; and 
I11(C) Testing outside of the laboratory, such as in small isolated field plots, which involves the routine use of familiar chemicals or biological materials. 
I11(ii) Routine renovation, rehabilitation, or revitalization of physical facilities, including the acquisition and installation of equipment, where such activity is limited in scope and intensity. 
I11(b) Exceptions to categorical exclusions. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an EA or EIS shall be prepared for an activity which is normally within the purview of categorical exclusion where it is determined by CSREES that substantial controversy on environmental grounds exists or that other extraordinary conditions or circumstances are present which may cause such activity to have a significant environmental effect. 

I80�1A3407.7 
I89Actions normally requiring an environmental assessment. 
I11The following actions normally will require an EA: 
I11(a) Programs supported in whole or in part by CSREES which may result in a particular technology's moving from the field evaluation stage to large-scale demonstration or simulated commercial phase. 
I11(b) Field work that is expected to have an effect on the human environment such as large-scale excavations or the use of explosives. 
I11(c) Projects for the construction or renovation of physical facilities, unless categorically excluded under �1A3407.6(a)(2)(ii). 
I11(d) Activities specified in �1A3407.6(b). 

I80�1A3407.8 
I89Actions normally requiring an environmental impact statement. 
I11An EIS normally will be required for major actions where it is determined by CSREES that such activity will significantly affect the quality of the human environment, including those specified in �1A3407.6(b). 

I80�1A3407.9 
I89Use of environmental documents in decisionmaking. 
I11In carrying out agency responsibilities under NEPA, CSREES officials shall: 
I11(a) Consider all relevant environmental documents in evaluating programs, proposals, or projects for final agency action.
I11(b) Make all relevant final environmental documents, comments, and responses part of the record in rulemaking and adjudicatory proceedings.
I11(c) Ensure that all relevant final environmental documents, comments, and responses are submitted to CSREES in a timely fashion, are subjected to normal agency review processes, and are made a part of the official record.
I11(d) Consider only those alternatives encompassed by the range of alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when evaluating plans, programs, or proposals for agency action.

I80�1A3407.10 
I89Preparation of environmental assessments.
I11(a) T3Format and content.G1T1 An EA may be prepared in any format provided that it covers, in a logical and succinct fashion, the information necessary for determining whether a proposed CSREES action may have a significant environmental impact and thus warrant preparation of an EIS. The information must include brief discussions on the need for the project, alternatives to the proposed action, environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons consulted (40 CFR 1508.9). Where possible, EAs should be limited to 10�0915 pages. NOTE: It is the scope and complexity of the environmental issues, rather than the size of the project, that should be used to determine the length of the EA
I11(b) T3Supplements to environmental assessments.G1T1 Where substantial changes occur in a project or activity for which an EA has been prepared and it is determined by a responsible CSREES official specified in �1A3407.4(b) that the �338�changes are pertinent to environmental concerns, a supplement to the EA may be required. Supplements to EAs shall be evaluated and processed as stated in paragraph (c) of this section.
I11(c) T3Decision notice.G1T1 Upon completion of an EA and any supplement thereto, the responsible CSREES official will evaluate the information it contains, determine whether an EIS is required or whether no significant environmental impact is likely to occur, and will document the decision and the reasons upon which it is based (40 CFR 1508.13). The EA shall be available to the public. 

I80�1A3407.11 
I89Preparation of environmental impact statements.
I11(a) T3Actions involving more than one agency.G1T1 If more than one Federal agency participates in a program activity, a lead agency shall be selected in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.5(c). The lead agency, in full cooperation with all participating agencies, shall assume responsibility for involving the public as required in 40 CFR 1501.4(b) and shall prepare the EIS or shall cause the EIS to be prepared as provided in 40 CFR 1501.5.
I11(b) T3Notice of intent.G1T1 If a responsible CSREES official designated in �1A3407.4(b) of this part recommends the preparation of an EIS, the public shall be apprised of the decision. This notice shall be prepared according to 40 CFR 1508.2.
I11(c) T3Draft and Final EIS.G1T1 The process of preparing the draft and final EIS, as well as the format of the document, shall comply with the provisions of 40 CFR parts 1502�091506.
I11(d) T3Supplemental statements.G1T1 Where substantial changes occur or new information becomes available under a project or activity for which an EIS or draft EIS has been prepared and it is determined by a responsible CSREES official specified in �1A3407.4(b) that the changes are pertinent to environmental concerns, a supplement to the EIS or draft EIS may be required. The supplement shall be evaluated and processed in accordance with 40 CFR 1502.9(c).
I11(e) T3Decisionmaking and implementation.G1T1 A responsible CSREES official designated in �1A3407.4(b) may make a decision no sooner than thirty days after the notice of availability of the final EIS has been published in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1 by the Environmental Protection Agency (40 CFR 1506.10). The decision will be documented in a record of decision as required by 40 CFR 1505.2, and monitoring and mitigation activities will be implemented as required by 40 CFR 1505.3.

Q02I10In describing the experimental plan, the applicant must explain fully any materials, procedures, situations, or activities that may be hazardous to personnel (whether or not they are directly related to a particular phase of the proposed project), along with an outline of precautions to be exercised to avoid or mitigate the effects of such hazards.
I11(4) T3Facilities and equipment.G1T1 All facilities and major items of equipment that are available for use or assignment to the proposed project during the requested period of support should be described. In addition, requested items of nonexpendable equipment necessary to conduct and successfully conclude the proposed project should be listed (including dollar amounts), and, if funds are requested for their acquisition, justified on a separate sheet of paper and attached to the budget.
I11(5) T3Collaborative arrangements.G1T1 If the nature of the proposed project requires collaboration or subcontractual arrangements with other research scientists, corporations, organizations, agencies, or entities, the applicant must identify the collaborator(s) and provide a full explanation of the nature of the collaboration. Evidence (i.e., letters of intent) should be provided to assure peer reviewers that the collaborators involved have agreed to render this service. In addition, the proposal must indicate whether or not such collaborative arrangement(s) have the potential for conflicts of interest.
I11(6) T3References to Project Descriptions.G1T1 All references cited should be complete, including titles, and should conform to an accepted journal format.
I11(7) T3Personnel support.G1T1 To assist peer reviewers in assessing the competence and experience of the proposed project staff, all personnel who will be involved in the proposed project must be identified clearly. For each principal investigator involved, and for all senior associates and other professional personnel who expect to work on the project, whether or not funds are sought for their support, the following should be included:
I11(i) An estimate of the time commitments necessary;
I11(ii) Curriculum vitae. The curriculum vitae should be limited to a presentation of academic and research credentials, e.g., educational, employment and professional history, and honors and awards. Unless pertinent to the project, to personal status, or to the status of the organization, meetings attended, seminars given, or personal data such as birth date, marital status, �344�or community activities should not be included. The vitae shall be no more than two pages each in length, excluding publications listings; and 
I11(iii) Publication List(s). A chronological list of all publications in refereed journals during the past five years, including those in press, must be provided for each professional project member for whom a curriculum vitae is provided. Also list other non-refereed technical publications that have relevance to the proposed project. Authors should be listed in the same order as they appear on each paper cited, along with the title and complete reference as these usually appear in journals.
I11(8) T3Budget.G1T1 A detailed budget is required for each year of requested support. In addition, a summary budget is required detailing requested support for the overall project period. A copy of the form which must be used for this purpose, along with instructions for completion, is included in the NRICGP Application Kit identified under �1A3411.4(b) of the part and may be reproduced as needed by applicants. Funds may be requested under any of the categories listed, provided that the item or service for which support is requested may be identified as necessary for successful conduct of the proposed project, is allowable under applicable Federal cost principles, and is not prohibited under any applicable Federal statute or regulation. It should be noted, for example, that section 2(b)(7) of the Act of August 4, 1965, as amended, prohibits the use of funds under this program for the renovation or refurbishment of research spaces, purchases or installation of fixed equipment in such spaces, or for the planning, repair, rehabilitation, acquisition, or construction of a building or facility. Also, section 2(b)(8) of the Act of August 4, 1965, as amended, requires that all grants, except equipment grants authorized by section 2(b)(3)(D) of the same Act, awarded under this part, shall be used without regard to matching funds or cost sharing. Equipment grants may not exceed 50 percent of the cost of the equipment to be acquired. equipment grant funds also may not be used for installation, maintenance, warranty, or insurance expenses. Indirect costs are not permitted on equipment grants.
I11(9) T3Research involving special considerations.G1T1 A number of situations encountered in the conduct of research require special information and supporting documentation before funding can be approved for the project. If any such situation is anticipated, the proposal must so indicate. It is expected that a significant number of proposals will involve the following:
I11(i) T3Recombinant DNA and RNA molecules.G1T1 All key personnel identified in a proposal and all endorsing officials of a proposed performing entity are required to comply with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health entitled, ``Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules,'' as revised. The NRICGP Application Kit, identified above in �1A3411.4(b), contains forms which are suitable for such certification of compliance. In the event a project involving recombinant DNA and RNA molecules results in a grant award, a qualified Institutional Biosafety Committee must approve the research before CSREES funds will be released.
I11(ii) T3Human subjects at risk.G1T1 Applicable regulations which implement the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects have been issued by the Department under 7 CFR part 1c, Protection of Human Subjects. Responsibility for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects used in any proposed project supported with grant funds provided by the Department rests with the performing entity. The applicant must submit a statement certifying that the project plan has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Committee at the proposing organization or institution. The NRICGP Application Kit, identified above in �1A3411.4(b), contains a form which is suitable for such certification. In the event a project involving human subjects results in a grant award, funds will be released only after a qualified Institutional Committee has approved the project.
I11(iii) T3Experimental vertebrate animal care.G1T1 The responsibility for the humane care and treatment of any experimental vertebrate animal, which has �345�the same meaning as ``animal'' in section 2(g) of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2132(g)), used in any project supported with NRICGP funds rests with the performing organization. In this regard, all key personnel associated with any supported project and all endorsing officials of the proposed performing entity are required to comply with applicable provisions of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2131 T3et seq.G1T1) and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Secretary of Agriculture in 9 CFR parts 1, 2, 3, and 4. In this regard, the applicant must submit a statement certifying that the proposed project is in compliance with the aforementioned regulations, and that the proposed project is either under review by or has been reviewed and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The NRICGP Application Kit, identified above in �1A3411.4(b), contains a form which is suitable for such certification. In the event a project involving the use of living vertebrate animals results in a grant award, funds will be released only after a qualified Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee has approved the project.
I11(10) T3Current and pending support.G1T1 All proposals must list any other current public or private research support (including in-house support) to which key personnel identified in the proposal have committed portions of their time, whether or not salary support for the person(s) involved is included in the budget. Analogous information must be provided for any pending proposals that are being considered by, or that will be submitted in the near future to, other possible sponsors, including other USDA programs or agencies. Concurrent submission of identical or similar proposals to other possible sponsors will not prejudice proposal review or evaluation by the Administrator or experts or consultants engaged by the Administrator for this purpose. However, a proposal that duplicates or overlaps substantially with a proposal already reviewed and funded (or that will be funded) by another organization or agency will not be funded under this program. The Grant Application Kit, identified above in �1A3411.4(b), contains a form which is suitable for listing current and pending support.
I11(11) T3Additions to project description.G1T1 Each project description is expected by the Administrator, the members of peer review groups, and the relevant program staff to be complete. However, if the inclusion of additional information is necessary to ensure the equitable evaluation of the proposal (e.g., photographs which do not reproduce well, reprints, and other pertinent materials which are deemed to be unsuitable for inclusion in the text of the proposal), the number of copies submitted should match the number of copies of the application requested in the program solicitation. Each set of such materials must be identified with the name of the submitting organization, and the name(s) of the principal investigator(s). Information may not be appended to a proposal to circumvent page limitations prescribed for the project description. Extraneous materials will not be used during the peer review process.
I11(12) T3Organizational management information.G1T1 Specific management information relating to an applicant shall be submitted on a one-time basis prior to the award of a grant identified under this part if such information has not been provided previously under this or another program for which the sponsoring agency is responsible. Copies of forms recommended for use in fulfilling the requirements contained in this section will be provided by the agency specified in this part once a grant has been recommended for funding.
I11(13) T3National Environmental Policy Act.G1T1 As outlined in CSREES's implementing regulations of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) at 7 CFR Part 3407, environmental data or documentation for the proposed project is to be provided to CSREES in order to assist CSREES in carrying out its responsibilities under NEPA. These responsibilities include determining whether the project requires an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement or whether it can be excluded from this requirement on the basis of several categorical exclusions listed in 7 CFR Part 3407. In this regard, the applicant should review the categories defined �346�for exclusion to ascertain whether the proposed project may fall within one or more of the exclusions, and should indicate if it does so on the National Environmental Policy Act Exclusions Form (Form CSRS�091234) provided in the NRICGP Application Kit.
I11(14) Even though the applicant considers that a proposed project may fall within a categorical exclusion, CSREES may determine that an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary for a proposed project should substantial controversy on environmental grounds exist or if other extraordinary conditions or circumstances are present that may cause such activity to have a significant environmental effect.

I89Evaluation and disposition of applications.
I11(a) T3Evaluation.G1T1 All proposals received from eligible applicants and postmarked in accordance with deadlines established in the annual program solicitation shall be evaluated by the Administrator through such officers, employees, and others as the Administrator determines are uniquely qualified in the areas represented by particular projects. To assist in equitably and objectively evaluating proposals and to obtain the best possible balance of viewpoints, the Administrator shall solicit the advice of peer scientists, T3ad hocG1T1 reviewers, and/or others who are recognized specialists in the areas covered by the applications received and whose general roles are defined in �1A3411.2(j) and 3411.2(k). Specific evaluations will be based upon the criteria established in subpart B, �1A3411.15, unless CSRS determines that different criteria are necessary for the proper evaluation of proposals in one or more specific program areas, or for specific types of projects to be supported, and announces such criteria and their relative importance in the annual program solicitation. The overriding purpose of these evaluations is to provide information upon which the Administrator may make informed judgments in selecting proposals for ultimate support. Incomplete, unclear, or poorly organized applications will work to the detriment of applicants during the peer evaluation process. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, all applications should be written with the care and thoroughness accorded papers for publication.
I11(b) T3Disposition.G1T1 On the basis of the Administrator's evaluation of an application in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator will (1) approve support using currently available funds, (2) defer support due to lack of funds or a need for further evaluations, or (3) disapprove support for the proposed project in whole or in part. With respect to approved projects, the Administrator will determine the project period (subject to extension as provided in �1A3411.7(c)) during which the project may be supported. Any deferral or disapproval of an application will not preclude its reconsideration or a reapplication during subsequent fiscal years.
Q04I20[56 FR 57952, Nov. 14, 1991. Redesignated at 60 FR 63368, Dec. 8, 1995, as amended at 61 FR 45319, Aug. 29, 1996]

I80�1A3411.6 
I89Grant awards.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 Within the limit of funds available for such purpose, the awarding official shall make grants to those responsible, eligible applicants whose proposals are judged most meritorious in the announced program areas under the evaluation criteria and procedures set forth in this part. The date specified by the Administrator as the beginning of the project period shall be no later than September 30 of the Federal fiscal year in which the project is approved for support and funds are appropriated for such purpose, unless otherwise permitted by law. All funds granted under this part shall be expended solely for the purpose for which the funds are granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of the award, the applicable Federal cost principles, and the Department's ``Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations'' (part 3015 of this title) and the Department's ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to �347�State and Local Governments'' (part 3016 of this title).
I11(b) T3Grant award document and notice of grant awardG1T1_(1) T3Grant award document.G1T1 The grant award document shall include at a minimum the following:
I11(i) Legal name and address of performing organization or institution to whom the Administrator has awarded a competitive grant under the terms of this part;
I11(ii) Title of project;
I11(iii) Name(s) and address(es) of principal investigator(s) chosen to direct and control approved activities;
I11(iv) Identifying grant number assigned by the Department;
I11(v) Project period, specifying the amount of time the Department intends to support the project without requiring recompetition for funds;
I11(vi) Total amount of Departmental financial assistance approved by the Administrator during the project period;
I11(vii) Legal authority(ies) under which the grant is awarded;
I11(viii) Approved budget plan for categorizing allocable project funds to accomplish the stated purpose of the grant award; and
I11(ix) Other information or provisions deemed necessary by the Department to carry out its granting activities or to accomplish the purpose of a particular grant.
I11(2) T3Notice of grant award.G1T1 The notice of grant award, in the form of a letter, will be prepared and will provide pertinent instructions or information to the grantee that is not included in the grant award document.
I11(c) T3Types of grant instruments.G1T1 The major types of grant instruments shall be as follows:
I11(1) T3New grant.G1T1 This is a grant instrument by which the Department agrees to support a specified level of effort for a project that generally has not been supported previously under this program. This type of grant is approved on the basis of peer review recommendation.
I11(2) T3Renewal grant.G1T1 This is a grant instrument by which the Department agrees to provide additional funding for a project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award, provided that the cumulative period does not exceed the statutory limitation. When a renewal application is submitted, it should include a summary of progress to date from the previous granting period. A renewal grant shall be based upon new application, T3de novoG1T1 peer review and staff evaluation, new recommendation and approval, and a new award instrument.
I11(3) T3Supplemental grant.G1T1 This is an instrument by which the Department agrees to provide small amounts of additional funding under a new or renewal grant as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section and may involve a short-term (usually six months or less) extension of the project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award, but in no case may the cumulative period for the project exceed the statutory limitation. A supplement is awarded only if required to assure adequate completion of the original scope of work and if there is sufficient justification to warrant such action. A request of this nature normally will not require additional peer review.
I11(d) T3Funding mechanisms.G1T1 The two mechanisms by which new, renewal, and supplemental grants shall be awarded are as follows:
I11(1) T3Standard grant.G1T1 This is a funding mechanism whereby the Department agrees to support a specified level of effort for a predetermined time period without the announced intention of providing additional support at a future date.
I11(2) T3Continuation grant.G1T1 This is a funding mechanism whereby the Department agrees to support a specified level of effort for a predetermined period of time with a statement of intention to provide additional support at a future date, provided that performance has been satisfactory, appropriations are available for this purpose, and continued support would be in the best interests of the Federal government and the public. This kind of mechanism normally will be awarded for an initial one-year period, and any subsequent continuation project grants will also be awarded in one-year increments. The award of a continuation project grant to fund an initial or succeeding budget �348�period does not constitute an obligation to fund any subsequent budget period. Unless prescribed otherwise by CSRS, a grantee must submit a separate application for continued support for each subsequent fiscal year. Requests for such continued support must be submitted in duplicate at least three months prior to the expiration date of the budget period currently being funded. Decisions regarding continued support and the actual funding levels of such support in future years usually will be made administratively after consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices and the availability of funds. Since initial peer reviews are based upon the full term and scope of the original special grant application, additional evaluations of this type generally are not required prior to successive years' support. However, in unusual cases (e.g., when the nature of the project or key personnel change or when the amount of future support requested substantially exceeds the grant application originally reviewed and approved), additional reviews may be required prior to approving continued funding.
I11(e) T3Obligation of the Federal Government.G1T1 Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any project grant shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any renewal, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion of an approved application.
I11(f) T3Current Research Information Service (CRIS).G1T1 For each project funded, CRIS Form AD�09416, ``Research Work Unit/Project Description-Research Resume'' and CRIS Form AD�09417, ``Research Work Unit/Project Description-Classification of Research'' and specific instructions for their completion will be sent to the grantee for completion and return. Grant funds will not be released until the completed forms are received in CSREES.

I89Use of funds; changes.
I11(a) T3Delegation of fiscal responsibility.G1T1 The grantee may not, in whole or in part, delegate or transfer to another person, institution, or organization the responsibility for use or expenditure of grant funds.
I11(b) T3Change in project plans.G1T1 (1) The permissible changes by the grantee, principal investigator(s), or other key project personnel in the approved grant shall be limited to changes in methodology, techniques, or other aspects of the project to expedite achievement of the project's approved goals. If the grantee and/or the principal investigator(s) is uncertain whether a particular change complies with this provision, the question must be referred to the Administrator for a final determination.
I11(2) Changes in approved goals, or objectives, shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the Department prior to effecting such changes. Normally, no requests for such changes that are outside the scope of the original approved project will be approved.
I11(3) Changes in approved project leadership or the replacement or reassignment of other key project personnel shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the Department prior to effecting such changes.
I11(4) Transfers of actual performance of the substantive programmatic work in whole or in part and provisions for payment of funds, whether or not Federal funds are involved, shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the Department prior to effecting such changes, except as may be allowed in the terms and conditions of a grant award.
I11(c) T3Changes in project period.G1T1 The project period determined pursuant to �1A3411.5(b) may be extended by the Administrator without additional financial support, for such additional period(s) as the Administrator determines may be necessary to complete, or fulfill the purposes of, an approved project. Any extension, when combined with the originally approved or amended project period, shall not exceed five (5) years (the limitation established by statute) and shall be further conditioned upon prior request by the grantee and approval in writing by the Department, except as may be allowed in the terms and conditions of a grant award.
�349�I11(d) T3Changes in approved budget.G1T1 The terms and conditions of a grant will prescribe circumstances under which written Departmental approval must be requested and obtained prior to instituting changes in an approved budget.

I80�1A3415.4
I89How to apply for a grant.
I11(a) A program solicitation will be prepared and announced through publications such as the T4Federal Register,G1T1 professional trade journals, agency or program handbooks, the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, or any other appropriate means, as early as practicable each fiscal year.
Q02I10The Department may elect to solicit preproposals each fiscal year in order to eliminate from consideration proposed research that does not address narrowly focused program objectives. A preproposal will be limited in length (in comparison to a full proposal) to alleviate waste of time and effort by applicants in the preparation of proposals and USDA staff in the review of proposals. If the Department solicits preproposals through publication of the annual program solicitation, the Department does not anticipate publishing a subsequent solicitation for full proposals. Applicants submitting preproposals deemed appropriate to the objectives of this program as set out in the annual solicitation will be requested to submit full proposals; the full proposals will then be evaluated in accordance with �1A3415.5 through �1A3415.15 of this part.
Q02I10The annual program solicitation will contain information sufficient to enable applicants to prepare preproposals or full proposals under this program and will be as complete as possible with respect to:
I11(1) Descriptions of the specific research areas that the Department proposes to support during the fiscal year involved, including anticipated funds to be awarded;
I11(2) Eligibility requirements;
I11(3) Obtaining application kits;
I11(4) Deadline dates for submission of preproposal or proposal packages;
I11(5) Name and mailing address to send preproposals or proposals;
I11(6) Number of copies to submit; and
I11(7) Special requirements.
I11(b) T3Application Kit.G1T1 An Application Kit will be made available to any potential grant applicant who requests a copy. This kit contains required forms, certifications, and instructions applicable to the submission of grant preproposals or proposals.
I11(c) T3Format for preproposals.G1T1 As stated above, the Department may elect to solicit preproposals under this program. Unless otherwise indicated by the Department in the annual program solicitation, the following general format applies for the preparation of preproposals:
I11(1) T3``Application for Funding (Form CSREES�09661)''.G1T1 All preproposals submitted by eligible applicants should contain an ``Application for Funding'', Form CSREES�09661, which must be signed by the proposing principal investigator(s) and endorsed by the cognizant authorized organizational representative who possesses the necessary authority to commit the applicant's time and other relevant resources. The title of the proposal must be brief (80-character maximum), yet represent the major thrust of the project. Because this title will be used to provide information to those who may not be familiar with the proposed project, highly technical words or phraseology should be avoided where possible. In addition, phrases such as ``investigation of'' and ``research on'' should not be used.
I11(2) T3Project summary.G1T1 Each preproposal must contain a project summary, the text of which may not exceed three (3) single- or double-spaced pages. The Department reserves the option of not forwarding for further consideration a preproposal in which the project summary page limit is exceeded. The project summary is not intended for the general reader; consequently, it may contain technical language comprehensible primarily by persons in disciplines relating to the food and agricultural sciences. The project summary �354�should be a self-contained specific description of the activity to be undertaken and should focus on:
I11(i) Overall project goal(s) and supporting objectives;
I11(ii) Plans to accomplish project goal(s); and
I11(iii) Relevance or significance of the project to United States agriculture.
I11(3) T3Budget.G1T1 A budget detailing requested support for the proposed project period must be included in each preproposal. A copy of the form which must be used for this purpose, along with instructions for completion, is included in the Application Kit identified under �1A3415.4(b) of this part and may be reproduced as needed by applicants. Funds may be requested under any of the categories listed on the budget form, provided that the item or service for which support is requested may be identified as necessary for successful conduct of the proposed project, is allowable under applicable Federal cost principles, and is not prohibited under any applicable Federal statute.
I11(4) T3Special requirements.G1T1 (i) The annual program solicitation will describe any special preproposal submission requirements, such as paper size or type pitch to be used in the preparation of preproposals. The solicitation will also describe special program requirements, such as conference attendance or electronic project reporting, for which applicants may allocate funds when preparing proposed budgets.
I11(ii) By signing the ``Application for Funding'' identified under �1A3415.4(c)(1) in its submission of a preproposal, the applicant is certifying compliance with the restrictions on the use of appropriated funds for lobbying set out in 7 CFR part 3018.
I11(5) T3Evaluation of preproposals.G1T1 Preproposals shall be evaluated to determine whether the substance of the proposed project is appropriate to the objectives of this program as set out in the annual program solicitation. Subsequently, the Administrator shall request full proposals from those applicants proposing projects deemed appropriate to the objectives of this program as set out in the annual program solicitation. Such proposals shall conform to the format for full proposals set out below and shall be evaluated in accordance with �1A3415.5 through �1A3415.15 of this part.
I11(d) T3Format for full proposals.G1T1 Unless otherwise indicated by the Department in the annual program solicitation, the following general format applies for the preparation of full proposals under this program:
I11(1) T3``Application for Funding'' (Form CSREES�09661).G1T1 All full proposals submitted by eligible applicants should contain an Application for Funding'', Form CSREES�09661, which must be signed by the proposed principal investigator(s) and endorsed by the cognizant authorized organizational representative who possesses the necessary authority to commit the applicant's time and other relevant resources. Investigators who do not sign the full proposal cover sheet will not be listed on the grant document in the event an award is made. The title of the proposal must be brief (80-character maximum), yet represent The major emphasis of the project. Because this title will be used to provide information to those who may not be familiar with the proposed project, highly technical words or phraseology should be avoided where possible. In addition, phrases such as ``investigation of'' or ``research on'' should not be used.
I11(2) T3Project summary.G1T1 Each full proposal must contain a project summary, the length of which may not exceed three (3) single- or double-spaced pages. This summary is not intended for the general reader; consequently, it may contain technical language comprehensible primarily by persons in disciplines relating to the food and agricultural sciences. The project summary should be a self-contained, specific description of the activity to be undertaken and should focus on:
I11(i) Overall project goal(s) and supporting objectives;
I11(ii) Plans to accomplish project goal(s); and
I11(iii) Relevance or significance of the project to United States agriculture.
I11(3) T3Project description.G1T1 The specific aims of the project must be included in all proposals. The text of the project description may not exceed 15 single- �355�or double-spaced pages.

I11(i) T3Introduction.G1T1 A clear statement of the long-term goal(s) and supporting objectives of the proposed project should preface the project description. The most significant published work in the field under consideration, including the work of key project personnel on the current application, should be reviewed. The current status of research in the particular scientific field also should be described. All work cited, including that of key personnel, should be referenced.
I11(ii) T3Progress report.G1T1 If the proposal is a renewal of an existing project supported under this program, include a clearly marked performance report describing results to date from the previous award. This section should contain the following information:
I11(A) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals established for the previous award;
I11(B) The reasons established goals were not met, if applicable; and
I11(C) A listing of any publications resulting from the award. Copies of reprints or preprints may be appended to the proposal if desired.
I11(4) T3Rationale and significance.G1T1 Present concisely the rationale behind the proposed project. The objectives' specific relationship and relevance to the area in which an application is submitted and the objectives' specific relationship and relevance to potential regulatory issues of United States biotechnology research should be shown clearly. Any novel ideas or contributions that the proposed project offers also should be discussed in this section.
I11(5) T3Experimental plan.G1T1 The hypotheses or questions being asked and the methodology to be applied to the proposed project should be stated explicitly. Specifically, this section must include:
I11(i) A description of the investigations and/or experiments proposed and the sequence in which the investigations or experiments are to be performed;
I11(ii) Techniques to be used in carrying out the proposed project, including the feasibility of the techniques;

Q02I10In describing the experimental plan, the applicant must explain fully any materials, procedures, situations, or activities that may be hazardous to personnel (whether or not they are directly related to a particular phase of the proposed project), along with an outline of precautions to be exercised to avoid or mitigate the effects of such hazards.
I11(6) T3Facilities and equipment.G1T1 All facilities and major items of equipment that are available for use or assignment to the proposed research project during the requested period of support should be described. In addition, items of nonexpendable equipment necessary to conduct and successfully conclude the proposed project should be listed.
I11(7) T3Collaborative arrangements.G1T1 If the nature of the proposed project requires collaboration or subcontractual arrangements with other research scientists, corporations, organizations, agencies, or entities, the applicant must identify the collaborator(s) and provide a full explanation of the nature of the collaboration. Evidence (i.e., letters of intent) should be provided to assure peer reviewers that the collaborators involved have agreed to render this service. In addition, the proposal must indicate whether or not such a collaborative arrangement(s) has the potential for conflict(s) of interest.
I11(8) T3Personnel support.G1T1 To assist peer reviewers in assessing the competence and experience of the proposed project staff, key personnel who will be involved in the proposed project must be identified clearly. For each principal investigator involved, and for all senior associates and other professional personnel who expect to work on the project, whether or not funds are sought for their support, the following should be included:
�356�I11(i) An estimate of the time commitments necessary;
I11(ii) Curriculum vitae. The curriculum vitae should be limited to a presentation of academic and research credentials, e.g., educational, employment and professional history, and honors and awards. Unless pertinent to the project, to personal status, or to the status of the organization, meetings attended, seminars given, or personal data such as birth date, marital status, or community activities should not be included. The vitae shall be no more than two pages each in length, excluding the publication lists. The Department reserves the option of not forwarding for further consideration a proposal in which each vitae exceeds the two-page limit; and
I11(iii) Publication List(s). A chronological list of all publications in referred journals during the past five years, including those in press, must be provided for each professional project member for whom a curriculum vitae is provided. Authors should be listed in the same order as they appear on each paper cited, along with the title and complete reference as these items usually appear in journals.
I11(9) T3Budget.G1T1 A detailed budget is required for each year of requested support. In addition, a summary budget is required detailing requested support for the overall project period. A copy of the form which must be used for this purpose, Form CSREES�0955, along with instructions for completion, is included in the Application Kit identified under �1A3415.4(b) of this part and may be reproduced as needed by applicants. Funds may be requested under any of the categories listed, provided that the item or service for which support is requested may be identified as necessary for successful conduct of the proposed project, is allowable under applicable Federal cost principles, and is not prohibited under any applicable Federal statute.
I11(10) T3Research involving special considerations.G1T1 A number of situations encountered in the conduct of research require special information and supporting documentation before funding can be approved for the project. If any such situation is anticipated, the proposal must so indicate. It is expected that a significant number of proposals will involve the following:
I11(i) T3Recombinant DNA and RNA molecules.G1T1 All key personnel identified in a proposal and all endorsing officials of a proposed performing entity are required to comply with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health entitled, ``Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules,'' as revised. The Application Kit, identified above in �1A3415.4(b), contains a form which is suitable for such certification of compliance (Form CSREES�09662).
I11(ii) T3Human subjects at risk.G1T1 Responsibility for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects used in any proposed project supported with grant funds provided by the Department rests with the performing entity. Regulations have been issued by the Department under 7 CFR Part 1c, Protection of Human Subjects. In the event that a project involving human subjects at risk is recommended for award, the applicant will be required to submit a statement certifying that the project plan has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the proposing organization or institution. The Application Kit, identified above in �1A3415.4(b), contains a form which is suitable for such certification (Form CSREES�09662).
I11(iii) T3Experimental vertebrate animal care.G1T1 The responsibility for the humane care and treatment of any experimental vertebrate animal, which has the same meaning as ``animal'' in section 2(g) of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2132(g)), used in any project supported with grant funds rests with the performing organization. In this regard, all key personnel associated with any supported project and all endorsing officials of the proposed performing entity are required to comply with the applicable provisions of the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2131 T3et seq.G1T1) and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the Secretary of Agriculture in 9 CFR parts 1, 2, 3, and 4. The applicant must submit a statement certifying that the proposed project is in compliance with the aforementioned regulations, and that the proposed project is either under review by or has been reviewed �357�and approved by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The Application Kit, identified above in �1A3415.4(b), contains a form which is suitable for such certification (Form CSREES�09662).
I11(11) T3Current and pending support.G1T1 All proposals must list any other current public or private research support (including in-house support) to which key personnel identified in the proposal have committed portions of their time, whether or not salary support for the person(s) involved is included in the budget. Analogous information must be provided for any pending proposals that are being considered by, or that will be submitted in the near future to, other possible sponsors, including other USDA programs or agencies. Concurrent submission of identical or similar proposals to other possible sponsors will not prejudice proposal review or evaluation by the Administrator or experts or consultants engaged by the Administrator for this purpose. However, a proposal that duplicates or overlaps substantially with a proposal already reviewed and funded (or that will be funded) by another organization or agency will not be funded under this program. The Application Kit, identified above in �1A3415.4(b), contains a form which is suitable for listing current and pending support (Form CSREES�09663).
I11(12) T3Additions to project description.G1T1 Each project description is expected by the Administrator, the members of peer review groups, and the relevant program staff to be complete while meeting the page limit established in �1A3415.4(d)(3). However, if the inclusion of additional information is necessary to ensure the equitable evaluation of the proposal (e.g., photographs that do not reproduce well, reprints, and other pertinent materials that are deemed to be unsuitable for inclusion in the text of the proposal), the number of copies submitted should match the number of copies of the application requested in the program solicitation. Each set of such materials must be identified with the name of the submitting organization, and the name(s) of the principal investigator(s). Information may not be appended to a proposal to circumvent page limitations prescribed for the project description. Extraneous materials will not be used during the peer review process.
I11(13) T3Organizational management information.G1T1 Specific management information relating to an applicant shall be submitted on a one-time basis prior to the award of a grant identified under this Part if such information has not been provided previously under this or another program for which the sponsoring agency is responsible. The Department will contact an applicant to request organizational management information once a proposal has been recommended for funding.

I80�1A3415.5
I89Evaluation and disposition of applications.
I11(a) T3Evaluation.G1T1 All proposals received from eligible applicants and submitted in accordance with deadlines established in the annual program solicitation shall be evaluated by the Administrator through such officers, employees, and others as the Administrator determines are uniquely qualified in the areas of research represented by particular projects. To assist in equitably and objectively evaluating proposals and to obtain the best possible balance of viewpoints, the Administrator shall solicit the advice of peer scientists, T3ad hocG1T1 reviewers, or others who are recognized specialists in the areas covered by the applications received and whose general roles are defined in �1A3415.2. Specific evaluations will be based upon the criteria established in subpart B, �1A3415.15, unless CSREES and/or ARS determine that different criteria are necessary for the proper evaluation of proposals in one or more specific program areas, or for specific types of projects to be supported, and announces such criteria and their relative importance in the annual program solicitation. The overriding purpose of these evaluations is to provide information upon which the Administrator may make an informed judgment in selecting proposals for support. Incomplete, unclear, or poorly organized applications will work to the detriment of applicants during the peer evaluation process. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, all applications should be written with the care and �358�thoroughness accorded papers for publication.
I11(b) T3Disposition.G1T1 On the basis of the Administrator's evaluation of an application in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator will (1) approve support using currently available funds, (2) defer support due to lack of funds or a need for further evaluation, or (3) disapprove support for the proposed project in whole or in part. With respect to approved projects, the Administrator will determine the project period (subject to extension as provided in �1A3415.7(c)) during which the project may be supported. Any deferral or disapproval of an application will not preclude its reconsideration or a reapplication during subsequent fiscal years.

I80�1A3415.6
I89Grant awards.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 Within the limit of funds available for such purpose, the awarding official of CSREES or ARS shall make grants to those responsible, eligible applicants whose proposals are judged most meritorious in the announced program areas under the evaluation criteria and procedures set forth in this part. The date specified by the Administrator as the effective date of the grant shall be no later than September 30 of the Federal fiscal year in which the project is approved for support and funds are appropriated for such purpose, unless otherwise permitted by law. It should be noted that the project need not be initiated on the grant effective date, but as soon thereafter as practicable so that project goals may be attained within the funded project period. All funds granted by CSREES or ARS under this Part shall be expended solely for the purpose for which the funds are granted in accordance with the approved application and budget, the regulations of this part, the terms and conditions of the award, the applicable Federal cost principles, and the Department's assistance regulations (part 3015 and part 3016 of this title).
I11(b) T3Grant award document and notice of grant awardG1T1_(1) T3Grant award document.G1T1 The grant award document shall include at a minimum the following:
I11(i) Legal name and address of performing organization or institution to whom the Administrator has awarded a grant under the terms of this Part;
I11(ii) Title of project;
I11(iii) Name(s) and address(es) of principal investigator(s) chosen to direct and control approved activities;
I11(iv) Identifying grant number assigned by the Department;
I11(v) Project period, specifying the amount of time the Department intends to support the project without requiring recompetition for funds;
I11(vi) Total amount of Departmental financial assistance approved by the Administrator during the project period;
I11(vii) Legal authority(ies) under which the grant is awarded;
I11(viii) Approved budget plan for categorizing allocable project funds to accomplish the stated purpose of the grant award; and
I11(ix) Other information or provisions deemed necessary by CSREES or ARS to carry out their respective granting activities or to accomplish the purpose of a particular grant.
I11(2) T3Notice of grant award.G1T1 The notice of grant award, in the form of a letter, will be prepared and will provide pertinent instructions or information to the grantee that is not included in the grant award document.
I11(c) T3Types of grant instruments.G1T1 The major types of grant instruments shall be as follows:
I11(1) T3New grant.G1T1 This is a grant instrument by which CSREES or ARS agrees to support a specified level of effort for a project that generally has not been supported previously under this program. This type of grant is approved on the basis of peer review recommendation.
I11(2) T3Renewal grant.G1T1 This is a grant instrument by which CSREES or ARS agrees to provide additional funding for a project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award. When a renewal application is submitted, it should include a summary of progress to date from the previous granting period. A renewal grant shall be based upon new application, T3de novoG1T1 peer review and staff evaluation, new recommendation and approval, and a new award action reflecting that the grant has been renewed.
�359�I11(3) T3Supplemental grant.G1T1 This is an instrument by which CSREES or ARS agrees to provide small amounts of additional funding under a new or renewal grant as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section and may involve a short-term (usually six months or less) extension of the project period beyond that approved in an original or amended award. A supplement is awarded only if required to assure adequate completion of the original scope of work and if there is sufficient justification to warrant such action. A request of this nature normally will not require additional peer review.
I11(d) T3Funding mechanisms.G1T1 The two mechanisms by which CSREES or ARS may elect to award new, renewal, and supplemental grants are as follows:
I11(1) T3Standard grant.G1T1 This is a funding mechanism whereby CSREES or ARS agrees to support a specified level of effort for a predetermined time period without the announced intention of providing additional support at a future date.
I11(2) T3Continuation grant.G1T1 This is a funding mechanism whereby CSREES or ARS agrees to support a specified level of effort for a predetermined period of time with a statement of intention to provide additional support at a future date, provided that performance has been satisfactory, appropriations are available for this purpose, and continued support would be in the best interests of the Federal government and the public. This kind of mechanism normally will be awarded for an initial one-year period, and any subsequent continuation project grants also will be awarded in one-year increments. The award of a continuation project grant to fund an initial or succeeding budget period does not constitute an obligation to fund any subsequent budget period. Unless prescribed otherwise by CSREES or ARS, a grantee must subject a separate application for continued support for each subsequent fiscal year. Requests for such continued support must be submitted in duplicate at least three months prior to the expiration date of the budget period currently being funded. Decisions regarding continued support and the actual funding levels of such support in future years usually will be made administratively after consideration of such factors as the grantee's progress and management practices and the availability of funds. Since initial peer reviews are based upon the full term and scope of the original grant application, additional evaluations of this type generally are not required prior to successive years' support. However, in unusual cases (e.g., when the nature of the project or key personnel change or when the amount of future support requested substantially exceeds the grant application originally reviewed and approved), additional reviews may be required prior to approving continued funding.
I11(e) T3Obligation of the Federal Government.G1T1 Neither the approval of any application nor the award of any project grant commits or obligates the United States in any way to make any renewal, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved application or portion thereof.

I80�1A3415.7
I89Use of funds; changes.
I11(a) T3Delegation of fiscal responsibility.G1T1 The grantee may not in whole or in part delegate or transfer to another person, institution, or organization the responsibility for use or expenditure of grant funds.
I11(b) T3Change in project plans.G1T1 (1) The permissible changes by the grantee, principal investigator(s), or other key project personnel in the approved grant shall be limited to changes in methodology, techniques, or other aspects of the project to expedite achievement of the project's approved goals. If the grantee or the principal investigator(s) is uncertain whether a particular change complies with this provision, the question must be referred to the awarding official of CSREES or ARS, as appropriate, for a final determination.
I11(2) Changes in approved goals, or objectives, shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the awarding official of CSREES or ARS, as appropriate, prior to effecting such changes. Normally, no requests for such changes that are outside the scope of the original approved project will be approved.
�360�I11(3) Changes in approved project leadership or the replacement or reassignment of other key project personnel shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the awarding official of CSREES or ARS, as appropriate, prior to effecting such changes.
I11(4) Transfers of actual performance of the substantive programmatic work in whole or in part and provisions for payment of funds, whether or not Federal funds are involved, shall be requested by the grantee and approved in writing by the awarding official of CSREES or ARS, as appropriate, prior to effecting such changes, unless prescribed otherwise in the terms and conditions of a grant.
I11(c) T3Changes in project period.G1T1 The project period determined pursuant to �1A3415.5(b) may be extended by the awarding official of CSREES or ARS, as appropriate, without additional financial support, for such additional period(s) as the appropriate awarding official determines may be necessary to complete, or fulfill the purposes of, an approved project. Any extension of time shall be conditioned upon prior request by the grantee and approval in writing by the appropriate awarding official, unless prescribed otherwise in the terms and conditions of a grant.
I11(d) T3Changes in approved budget.G1T1 The terms and conditions of a grant will prescribe the circumstances under which written approval must be requested and obtained from the awarding official of CSREES or ARS, as appropriate, prior to instituting changes in an approved budget.

I56Subpart A_General 

I80�1A3550.1 
I89Applicability. 
I11This part sets forth policies for the direct single family housing loan programs operated by the Rural Housing Service (RHS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It addresses the requirements of sections 502 and 504 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, and includes policies regarding both �366�loan and grant origination and servicing. Procedures for implementing these regulations can be found in program handbooks, available in any Rural Development office. Any provision on the expenditure of funds under this part is contingent upon the availability of funds. 

I80�1A3550.2 
I89Purpose. 
I11The purpose of the direct RHS single family housing loan programs is to provide low- and very low-income people who will live in rural areas with an opportunity to own adequate but modest, decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings and related facilities. The section 502 program offers persons who do not currently own adequate housing, and who cannot obtain other credit, the opportunity to acquire, build, rehabilitate, improve, or relocate dwellings in rural areas. The section 504 program offers loans to very low-income homeowners who cannot obtain other credit to repair or rehabilitate their properties. The section 504 program also offers grants to homeowners age 62 or older who cannot obtain a loan to correct health and safety hazards or to make the unit accessible to household members with disabilities. 

I80�1A3550.3 
I89Civil rights. 
I11RHS will administer its programs fairly, and in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of all equal opportunity and fair housing legislation and applicable executive orders. Loans, grants, services, and benefits provided under this part shall not be denied to any person based on race, color, national origin, sex, religion, marital status, familial status, age, physical or mental disability, receipt of income from public assistance, or because the applicant has, in good faith, exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 T3et seq.G1T1). All activities under this part shall be accomplished in accordance with the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601�093620), Executive Order 11246, and Executive Order 11063, as amended by Executive Order 12259, as applicable. The civil rights compliance requirements for RHS are in 7 CFR part 1901, subpart E. 

I80�1A3550.4 
I89Reviews and appeals. 
I11Whenever RHS makes a decision that is adverse to a participant, RHS will provide the participant with written notice of such adverse decision and the participant's rights to a USDA National Appeals Division hearing in accordance with 7 CFR part 11. Any adverse decision, whether appealable or non-appealable may be reviewed by the next-level RHS supervisor. 

I80�1A3550.5 
I89Environmental requirements. 
I11(a) T3Policy.G1T1 RHS will consider environmental quality as equal with economic, social, and other relevant factors in program development and decision-making processes. RHS will take into account potential environmental impacts of proposed projects by working with RHS applicants, other federal agencies, Indian tribes, State and local governments, and interested citizens and organizations in order to formulate actions that advance the program's goals in a manner that will protect, enhance, and restore environmental quality. 
I11(b) T3Regulatory references.G1T1 Processing and servicing actions under this part will be done in accordance with the requirements provided in 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G which addresses environmental requirements and 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A, which addresses lead-based paint. 

I80�1A3550.6 
I89State law or State supplement. 
I11State and local laws and regulations, and the laws of federally recognized Indian tribes, may affect RHS implementation of certain provisions of this regulation, for example, with respect to the treatment of liens, construction, or environmental policies. Supplemental guidance may be issued in the case of any conflict or significant differences. 

I80�1A3550.7 
I89Demonstration programs. 
I11From time to time, RHS may authorize limited demonstration programs. The purpose of these demonstration programs is to test new approaches to offering housing under the statutory authority granted to the Secretary. Therefore, such demonstration programs may not be consistent with some of the provisions contained in �367�this part. However, any program requirements that are statutory will remain in effect. Demonstration programs will be clearly identified as such. 

I80�1A3550.8 
I89Exception authority. 
I11An RHS official may request, and the Administrator or designee may make, an exception to any requirement or provision of this part or address any omission of this part that is consistent with the applicable statute if the Administrator determines that application of the requirement or provision, or failure to take action in the case of an omission, would adversely affect the Government's interest. 

I80�1A3550.9 
I89Conflict of interest. 
I11(a) T3Objective.G1T1 It is the objective of RHS to maintain the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and impartiality by employees. To reduce the potential for employee conflict of interest, all processing, approval, servicing, or review activity will be conducted in accordance with 7 CFR part 1900, subpart D by RHS employees who: 
I11(1) Are not themselves the applicant or borrower; 
I11(2) Are not members of the family or close known relatives of the applicant or borrower; 
I11(3) Do not have an immediate working relationship with the applicant or borrower, the employee related to the applicant or borrower, or the employee who would normally conduct the activity; or 
I11(4) Do not have a business or close personal association with the applicant or borrower. 
I11(b) T3Applicant or borrower responsibility.G1T1 The applicant or borrower must disclose any known relationship or association with an RHS employee when such information is requested. 
I11(c) T3RHS employee responsibility.G1T1 An RHS employee must disclose any known relationship or association with a recipient, regardless of whether the relationship or association is known to others. RHS employees or members of their families may not purchase a Real Estate Owned (REO) property, security property from a borrower, or security property at a foreclosure sale. Loan closing agents who have been involved with a particular property, as well as members of their families, are also precluded from purchasing such properties.

I11(c) T3Selection for processing.G1T1 When funding is not sufficient to serve all program-eligible applicants, applications will be selected for processing using the funding priorities specified in this paragraph. Within priority categories, applications will be processed in the order that the completed applications are received. In the case of applications with equivalent priority status that are received on the same day, preference will be extended to applicants qualifying for a veterans preference.

I80�1A3550.57
I89Dwelling requirements. 
I11(a) T3Modest dwelling.G1T1 The property must be one that is considered modest for the area, must not be designed for income providing purposes, must not have an in-ground pool or have a cost in excess of the section 203(b) limit of the National Housing Act unless RHS authorizes an exception:

I11(a) T3Fee-simple ownership.G1T1 Acceptable fee-simple ownership is evidenced by a fully marketable title with a deed vesting a fee-simple interest in the property to the borrower. 
I11(b) T3Secure leasehold interest.G1T1 A written lease is required. To be acceptable, a leasehold interest must have an unexpired term that is at least 150 percent of the term of the mortgage, unless the loan is guaranteed, in which case the unexpired term of the lease must be at least 2 years longer than the loan term. In no case may the unexpired term be less than 25 years. 
I11(c) T3Life estate interest.G1T1 To be acceptable a life estate interest must provide the borrower with rights of present possession, control, and beneficial use of the property.

All of the remainder interests need not be included in the mortgage to the extent that one or more of the persons holding remainder interests are not legally competent (and there is no representative who can legally consent to the mortgage), cannot be located, or if the remainder interests are divided among such a large number of people that it is not practical to obtain the signatures of all of the remainder interests. In such cases, the loan may not exceed the value of the property interests owned by the persons executing the mortgage. 
I11(d) T3Undivided interest.G1T1 All legally competent co-owners will be required to sign the mortgage. When one or more of the co-owners are not legally competent (and there is no representative who can legally consent to the mortgage), cannot be located, or the ownership interests are divided among so large a number of co- owners that it is not practical for all of their interests to be mortgaged, their interests not exceeding 50 percent may be excluded from the security requirements. In such cases, the loan may not exceed the value of the property interests owned by the persons executing the mortgage. 
I11(e) T3Possessory rights.G1T1 Acceptable forms of ownership include possessory rights on an American Indian reservation or State-owned land and the interest of an American Indian in land held in severalty under trust patents or deeds containing restrictions against alienation, provided that land in trust or restricted status will remain in trust or restricted status. 

I80�1A3550.59 
I89Security requirements. 
I11Before approving any loan, RHS will impose requirements to secure its interests. 
I11(a) T3Adequate security.G1T1 A loan will be considered adequately secured only when all of the following requirements are met: 
I11(1) RHS obtains at closing a mortgage on all ownership interests in the security property or the requirements of �1A3550.58 are satisfied. 
I11(2) No liens prior to the RHS mortgage exist at the time of closing and no junior liens are likely to be taken immediately subsequent to or at the time of closing, unless the other liens are taken as part of a leveraging strategy or the RHS loan is essential for repairs and the senior lien secures an affordable non-RHS loan. Liens junior to the �379�RHS lien may be allowed at loan closing if the junior lien will not interfere with the purpose or repayment of the RHS loan and the total value of all liens on the property is less than or equal to the property's market value. 
I11(3) The provisions of 7 CFR part 1927, subpart B regarding title clearance and the use of legal services have been followed. 
I11(4) Existing and proposed property improvements are totally on the site and do not encroach on adjoining property. 
I11(b) T3Guaranteed payment.G1T1 Mortgage insurance guaranteeing payment from a Government agency or Indian tribe is adequate security. 

I80�1A3550.60 
I89Escrow account. 
I11RHS may require that customers deposit into an escrow account amounts necessary to ensure that the account will contain sufficient funds to pay real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance premiums, and other related costs when they are due in accordance with the Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act of 1974 (RESPA) (12 U.S.C. 2601, T3et seq.G1T1) and section 501(e) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended. 

I80�1A3550.61 
I89Insurance. 
I11(a) T3Customer responsibility.G1T1 Until the loan is paid in full the customer must furnish and continually maintain hazard and flood insurance on property securing RHS loans, with companies, in amounts, and on terms and conditions acceptable to RHS. Customers who are required to have insurance may be required to escrow funds to ensure payment. All policies must have a ``loss payable clause'' payable to RHS to protect the Government's interest. 
I11(b) T3Amount.G1T1 Essential buildings must be insured in an amount at least equal to the balance of the secured debts. 
I11(c) T3Flood insurance.G1T1 Flood insurance must be obtained and maintained for the life of the loan for all property located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). RHS actions will be consistent with 7 CFR part 1806, subpart B which addressed flood insurance requirements. If flood insurance through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program is not available in an SFHA, the property is not eligible for federal financial assistance. 
I11(d) T3Losses.G1T1 (1) Loss deductible clauses may not exceed $250 or 1 percent of the insurance coverage, whichever is greater. The deductible for any 1 building may not exceed $750. 
I11(2) Customers must immediately notify RHS of any loss or damage to insured property and collect the amount of the loss from the insurance company. 
I11(3) Depending on the amount of the loss, RHS may require that loss payments be supervised. All repairs and replacements done by or under the direction of the borrower, or by contract, will be planned, performed, inspected, and paid for in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A. 
I11(4) When insurance funds remain after all repairs, replacements, and other authorized disbursements have been made, the funds will be applied in the following order: 
I11(i) Prior liens, including delinquent property taxes. 
I11(ii) Past-due amounts. 
I11(iii) Protective advances due. 
I11(iv) Released to the customer if the RHS debt is adequately secured. 
I11(5) If a loss occurs when insurance is not in force, the borrower is responsible for making the needed repairs or replacements and ensuring that the insurance is reinstated on the property. 
I11(6) If the borrower is not financially able to make the repairs, RHS may take one of the following actions: 
I11(i) Make a subsequent loan for repairs. 
I11(ii) Subordinate the RHS lien to permit the borrower to obtain funds for needed repairs from another source. 
I11(iii) Permit the borrower to obtain funds secured by a junior lien from another source. 
I11(iv) Make a protective advance to protect the Government's interest. 
I11(v) Accelerate the account. 

I80�1A3550.62 
I89Appraisals. 
I11(a) T3Requirement.G1T1 An appraisal is required when the debt to be secured exceeds $15,000 or whenever RHS determines that it is necessary to establish the adequacy of the security. Appraisals must be made in accordance with �380�the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices. When other real estate is taken as additional security, it will be appraised if it represents a substantial portion of the security for the loan. 
I11(b) T3Fees.G1T1 RHS will charge a fee for each loan application that requires an appraisal, except the appraisal fee is not required on appraisals done for subsequent loans needed to make minimal, essential repairs or in cases where another party provides an appraisal which is acceptable to RHS. Fees collected in connection with a dwelling constructed under an approved conditional commitment will be paid to the contractor at closing to offset the cost of the real estate appraisal that is included in the conditional commitment fee. 

I80�1A3550.63 
I89Maximum loan amount. 
I11Total secured indebtedness must not exceed the section 203(b) or market value limitations specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. In addition, the borrower may also finance the amount of the RHS appraisal and tax monitoring fee and the amount required to establish an escrow account for taxes and insurance over and above the limitations specified below. This section does not apply to NP loans. 
I11(a) T3Section 203(b) limitation.G1T1 The section 203(b) limitation is the amount established by 203(b) of the National Housing Act, unless RHS authorizes an exception, as described in �1A3550.57(a) of this subpart. 
I11(b) T3Market value limitation.G1T1 (1) The market value limitation is 100 percent of market value for existing housing and for new dwellings for which RHS will receive adequate documentation of construction quality and the source of such documentation is acceptable to RHS. 
I11(2) The market value limitation is 90 percent of market value for new dwellings for which adequate documentation of construction quality is not available. 
I11(3) The market value limitation can be increased by: 
I11(i) Up to one percent, if RHS makes a subsequent loan for closing costs only, in conjunction with the sale of an REO property or an assumption. 
I11(ii) The amount necessary to make a subsequent loan for repairs necessary to protect the Government's interest, and reasonable closing costs. 
I11(iii) The amount necessary to refinance an existing borrower's RHS loans, plus closing costs associated with the new loan.

I11(a) Thirty-three years in all cases except as noted in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. 
I11(b) Thirty-eight years: 
I11(1) For initial loans, or subsequent loans made in conjunction with an assumption, if the applicant's adjusted income does not exceed 60 percent of the area adjusted median income and the longer term is necessary to show repayment ability. 
I11(2) For subsequent loans not made in conjunction with an assumption if the applicant's initial loan was for a period of 38 years, the applicant's adjusted income at the time the subsequent loan is approved does not exceed 60 percent of area adjusted median income, and the longer terms is necessary to show repayment ability.

I89Payment subsidies. 
I11RHS administers two types of payment subsidies: payment assistance and interest credit. Payment subsidies are subject to recapture when the borrower transfers title or ceases to occupy the property. 
I11(a) T3Eligibility for payment subsidy.G1T1 (1) Applicants or borrowers who receive loans on program terms are eligible to receive payment subsidy if they personally occupy the property and have adjusted income at or below the applicable moderate-income limit. 
I11(2) Borrowers with loans approved before August 1, 1968, are not eligible for payment assistance, even if they assumed the loan after that date. 
I11(3) Payment assistance may be granted for initial loans or subsequent loans made in conjunction with an assumption only if the term of the loan is at least 25 years or more. 
I11(4) Payment assistance may be granted for subsequent loan not made in conjunction with an assumption if the initial loan was for a term of 25 years or more. 
I11(b) T3Determining type of payment subsidy.G1T1 A borrower currently receiving interest credit will continue to receive it for the initial loan and for any subsequent loan for as long as the borrower is eligible for and remains on interest credit. A borrower who has never received interest credit, or who has stopped receiving interest credit and at a later date again qualifies for a payment subsidy, will receive payment assistance. 
I11(c) T3Calculation of payment assistance.G1T1 The amount of payment assistance granted is the difference between the installment due on the promissory note and the greater of the payment amortized at the equivalent interest rate or the payment calculated based on the required floor payment. In leveraging situations, the equivalent interest rate will be used. 
I11(1) The floor payment is a minimum percentage of adjusted income that the borrower must pay for PITI: 
I11(i) Very low-income borrowers must pay a minimum of 22 percent of adjusted income; 
I11(ii) Low-income borrowers with adjusted income below 65 percent of area adjusted median income must pay a minimum of 24 percent of adjusted income; and 
I11(iii) Low-income borrowers with adjusted incomes between 65 and 80 percent of area adjusted median income must pay a minimum of 26 percent of adjusted income. 
I11(2) The equivalent interest rate is determined by a comparison of the borrower's adjusted income to the adjusted median income for the area in which the security property is located. The following chart is used to determine the equivalent interest rate paid by applicants eligible for payment assistance.

I11(d) T3Calculation of interest credit.G1T1 The amount of interest credit granted is the difference between the sum of the annual installments due at the promissory note interest rate and the greater of: 
I11(1) Twenty percent of the borrower's adjusted income less the cost of real estate taxes and insurance; or 
I11(2) The amount the borrower would pay if the loan were amortized at an interest rate of one percent. 
I11(e) T3Annual review.G1T1 The borrower's income will be reviewed annually to determine whether the borrower is eligible for continued payment subsidy. The �382�borrower must notify RHS whenever an adult member of the household changes or obtains employment, there is a change in household composition, or if income increases by at least 10 percent so that RHS can determine whether a review of the borrowers circumstances is required. 

I80�1A3550.69 
I89Deferred mortgage payments. 
I11For qualified borrowers, RHS may defer up to 25 percent of the monthly principal and interest payment at 1 percent for up to 15 years. This assistance may be granted only at initial loan closing and is reviewed annually. Deferred mortgage payments are subject to recapture when the borrower transfers title or ceases to occupy the property. 
I11(a) T3Eligibility.G1T1 In order to qualify for deferred mortgage payments, all of the following must be true: 
I11(1) The applicants adjusted income at the time of initial loan approval does not exceed the applicable very low-income limits. 
I11(2) The loan term is 38 years, or 30 years for a manufactured home. 
I11(3) The applicant's payments for principal and interest, calculated at a one percent interest rate for the maximum allowable term, plus estimated costs for taxes and insurance exceeds: 
I11(i) For applicants receiving payment assistance, 29 percent of the applicants repayment income by more than $10 per month; or 
I11(ii) For applicants receiving interest credit, 20 percent of adjusted income by more than $10 per month. 
I11(b) T3Amount and terms.G1T1 (1) The amount of the mortgage payment to be deferred will be the difference between the applicants payment for principal and interest, calculated at one percent interest for the maximum allowable term, plus estimated costs for taxes and insurance and: 
I11(i) For applicants receiving payment assistance, 29 percent of the applicants repayment income. 
I11(ii) For applicants receiving interest credit, 20 percent of adjusted income. 
I11(2) Deferred mortgage payment agreements will be effective for a 12-month period.

I11(c) T3Annual review.G1T1 The borrower's income, taxes, and insurance will be reviewed annually to determine eligibility for continued deferred mortgage assistance. The borrower must notify RHS whenever an adult member of the household changes or obtains employment or if income increases by at least 10 percent so that RHS can determine whether a review of the borrower's circumstances is required.

I89Conditional commitments. 
I11A conditional commitment is a determination by RHS that a dwelling be offered for sale will be acceptable for purchase by a qualified RHS loan applicant if it is built or rehabilitated in accordance with RHS-approved plans, specifications, and regulations and priced within the lessor of the property's appraised value or the applicable HUD section 203(b) limit. The conditional commitment does not reserve funds, does not guarantee funding, and does not ensure that an eligible loan applicant will be available to buy the dwelling. 
I11(a) T3Eligibility.G1T1 To be eligible to request a conditional commitment, the builder, dealer-contractor, or seller must: 
I11(1) Have an adequate ownership interest in the property, as defined in �1A3550.58, prior to the beginning of any planned construction; 
I11(2) Have the experience and ability to complete any proposed work in a competent and professional manner; 
I11(3) Have the legal capacity to enter into the required agreements; 
I11(4) Be financially responsible and have the ability to finance or obtain financing for any proposed construction or rehabilitation; and 
I11(5) Comply with the requirements of 7 CFR part 1901, subpart E and all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders relating to equal opportunity. Anyone who receives 5 or more conditional commitments during a 12-month period must obtain RHS approval of an affirmative marketing plan. 
�383�I11(b) T3Limitations.G1T1 Conditional commitments for new or substantially rehabilitated dwellings will not be issued after construction has started. RHS may limit the total number of conditional commitments issued in any locality based on market demand. 
I11(c) T3Commitment period.G1T1 A conditional commitment will be valid for 12 months from the date of issuance. The commitment may be extended for up to an additional 6 months if there are unexpected delays in construction caused by such factors as bad weather, materials shortages, or marketing difficulties. Conditional commitments may be canceled if construction does not begin within 60 days after the commitment is issued. 
I11(d) T3Conditional commitments involving packaging of applications.G1T1 A conditional commitment may be made to a seller, builder, or dealer-contractor who packages an RHS loan application for a prospective purchaser. In cases where the dwelling is to be constructed for sale to a specific eligible applicant, all of the following conditions must be met: 
I11(1) The conditional commitment will not be approved until the applicant's loan has been approved; 
I11(2) Construction will not begin until loan funds are obligated for the loan. Exceptions may be made when it appears likely that funding will be forthcoming and as long as the RHS lien priority is not jeopardized. The sales agreement must indicate that the loan has been approved but not funded and must provide that if the loan is not closed within 90 days of the date of approval, the contractor may terminate the sales agreement and sell the property to another party. If the sales agreement is terminated, the conditional commitment will be honored for another eligible loan applicant for the remaining period of the commitment; and 
I11(3) The RHS loan will be closed only after the dwelling is constructed or the required rehabilitation completed and final inspection has been made. 
I11(e) T3Fees.G1T1 An application for a conditional commitment must include payment of the conditional commitment fee. The fee will be refunded if for any reason preliminary inspection of the property or investigation of the conditional commitment applicant indicates that a conditional commitment will not be issued. Application fees will not be refunded for any property on which the required appraisal has been made. 
I11(f) T3Failure of conditional commitment applicant or dwelling to qualify.G1T1 The conditional commitment applicant will be informed if the conditional commitment is denied. Conditional commitments will be canceled if the property does not meet program requirements. 
I11(g) T3Changes in plans, specifications, or commitment price.G1T1 The holder of the conditional commitment must request approval for changes in plans, specifications, and commitment price. RHS may approve the changes if the following requirements are met: 
I11(1) The property price does not exceed the maximum loan limit and increases in costs are due to factors beyond the control of the commitment holder; and
I11(2) The requested changes are justifiable and appropriate. 
I11(h) T3Builder's warranty.G1T1 The builder or seller, as appropriate, must execute either an RHS-approved ``Builder's Warranty,'' or provide a 10-year insured warranty when construction is completed or the loan is closed.

I11(c) If RHS obtains title to a condominium unit pursuant to the remedies in its mortgage or through foreclosure, RHS will not be liable for more than 6 months of the unit's unpaid regularly budgeted dues or charges accrued before acquisition of the title to the unit by RHS. The homeowners association's lien priority may include costs of collecting unpaid dues. 
I11(d) In case of condemnation or substantial loss to the units or common elements of the condominium project, unless at least two-thirds of the first mortgagees or unit owners of the individual condominium units have given their consent, the homeowners association may not: 
I11(1) By act or omission seek to abandon or terminate the condominium project; 
I11(2) Change the pro rata interest or obligations of any condominium unit in order to levy assessments or charges, allocate distribution of hazard insurance proceeds or condemnation awards, or determine the pro rata share of ownership of each condominium unit in the common elements; 
I11(3) Partition or subdivide any condominium unit; 
I11(4) Seek to abandon, partition, subdivide, encumber, sell, or transfer the common elements by act or omission (the granting of easements for public utilities or other public purposes consistent with the intended use of the common elements by the condominium project is not a transfer within the meaning of this clause); or 
I11(5) Use hazard insurance proceeds for losses to any condominium property (whether units or common elements) for other than the repair, replacement, or reconstruction of the condominium property. 
I11(e) All taxes, assessments, and charges that may become liens prior to the first mortgage under local law relate only to the individual condominium units and not to the condominium project as a whole. 
I11(f) No provision of the condominium documents gives a condominium unit owner or any other party priority over any rights of RHS as first or second mortgagee of the condominium unit pursuant to its mortgage in the case of a payment to the unit owner of insurance proceeds or condemnation awards for losses to or taking of condominium units or common elements. 
I11(g) If the condominium project is on a leasehold the underlying lease provides adequate security of tenure as described in �1A3550.58(b). 
I11(h) At least 70 percent of the units have been sold. Multiple purchases of condominium units by one owner are counted as one sale when determining if the sales requirement has been met. 
I11(i) No more than 15 percent of the unit owners are more than 1 month delinquent in payment of homeowners association dues or assessments at the time the RHS loan is closed.

Payment for all work will be in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A, except no payment will be made for materials or property stored on site (e.g., payment for a unit will be made only after it is permanently attached to the foundation). 
I11(g) T3Lien release requirements.G1T1 All persons furnishing materials or labor in connection with the contract except the manufacturer of the unit must sign a Release by Claimants document, as specified in 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A.

However, the dwelling may not continue to have major health or safety hazards. 
I11(c) T3Construction standards.G1T1 All work must be completed in accordance with local construction codes and standards. When potentially hazardous equipment or materials are being installed, all materials and installations must be in accordance with the applicable standards in 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A.

I11(b) T3Secure leasehold interest.G1T1 A written lease is required. For loans, the unexpired portion of the lease must not be less than 2 years beyond the term of the promissory note. For grants, the remaining lease period must be at least 5 years. A leasehold for mutual help housing financed by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) on Indian lands requires no minimum lease period and constitutes acceptable ownership. 
I11(c) T3Life estate interest.G1T1 To be acceptable, a life estate interest must provide the applicant with rights of present possession, control, and beneficial use of the property. For secured loans, generally persons with any remainder interests must be signatories to the mortgage. All of the remainder interests need not be included in the mortgage to the extent that one or more of the persons holding remainder interests are not legally competent (and there is no representative who can legally consent to the mortgage), cannot be located, or if the remainder interests are divided among such a large number of people that it is not practical to obtain the signatures of all of the remainder interests. In such cases, the loan may not exceed the value of the property interests owned by the persons executing the mortgage. 
I11(d) T3Undivided interest.G1T1 An undivided interest is acceptable if there is no reason to believe that the applicant's position as an owner-occupant will be jeopardized as a result of the improvements to be made, and: 
I11(1) In the case of unsecured loans or grants, if any co-owners living or planning to live in the dwelling sign the repayment agreement. 
I11(2) In the case of a secured loan, when one or more of the co-owners are not legally competent (and there is no representative who can legally consent to the mortgage), cannot be located, or the ownership interests are divided among so large a number of co-owners that it is not practical for all of their interests to be mortgaged, their interests not exceeding 50 percent may be excluded from the security requirements. In such cases, the loan may not exceed the value of the property interests owned by the persons executing the mortgage. 
I11(e) T3Possessory rights.G1T1 Acceptable forms of ownership include possessory right on an American Indian reservation or State-owned land and the interest of an American Indian in land held severalty under trust patents or deeds containing �390�restrictions against alienation, provided that land in trust or restricted status will remain in trust or restricted status. 
I11(f) T3Land purchase contract.G1T1 A land purchase contract is acceptable if the applicant is current on all payments, and there is a reasonable likelihood that the applicant will be able to continue meeting the financial obligations of the contract. 
I11(g) T3Alternative evidence of ownership.G1T1 If evidence, as described in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, is not available, RHS may accept any of the following as evidence of ownership: 
I11(1) Records of the local taxing authority that show the applicant as owner and that demonstrate that real estate taxes for the property are paid by the applicant. 
I11(2) Affidavits by others in the community stating that the applicant has occupied the property as the apparent owner for a period of not less than 10 years, and is generally believed to be the owner. 
I11(3) Any instrument, whether or not recorded, which is commonly accepted as evidence of ownership.

I80�1A3550.110
I89Insurance (loans only). 
I11(a) T3Borrower responsibility.G1T1 Until the loan is paid in full, any borrower with a secured indebtedness in excess of $15,000 must furnish and continually maintain hazard insurance on the security property, with companies, in amounts, and on terms and conditions acceptable to RHS and include a ``loss payable clause'' payable to RHS to protect the Government's interest. 
I11(b) T3Amount.G1T1 Essential buildings must be insured in an amount at least equal to the balance of the secured debts. 
I11(c) T3Flood insurance.G1T1 Flood insurance must be obtained and maintained for the life of the loan for all property located in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) as determined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). RHS actions will be consistent with 7 CFR part 1806, subpart B which addresses flood insurance requirements. If flood insurance through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program is not available in a SFHA, the property is not eligible for federal financial assistance. 
I11(d) T3Losses.G1T1 (1) Loss deductible clauses may not exceed $250 or 1 percent of the insurance coverage, whichever is greater. The deductible for any 1 building may not exceed $750. 
I11(2) Borrowers must immediately notify RHS of any loss or damage to insured property and collect the amount of the loss from the insurance company. 
I11(3) RHS may require that loss payments be supervised. All repairs and replacements done by or under the direction of the borrower, or by contract, will be planned, performed, inspected, and paid for in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A. 
I11(4) When insurance funds remain after all repairs, replacements, and other authorized disbursements have �391�been made, the funds will be applied in the following order: 
I11(i) Prior liens, including delinquent property taxes. 
I11(ii) Delinquency on the account. 
I11(iii) Advances due for recoverable cost items. 
I11(iv) Released to the borrower if the RHS debt is adequately secured. 
I11(5) If a loss occurs when insurance is not in force, the borrower is responsible for making the needed repairs or replacements and ensuring that the insurance is reinstated on the property. 
I11(6) If the borrower is not financially able to make the repairs, RHS may take one of the following actions: 
I11(i) Make a subsequent loan for repairs. 
I11(ii) Subordinate the RHS lien to permit the borrower to obtain funds for needed repairs from another source. 
I11(iii) Permit the borrower to obtain funds secured by a junior lien from another source. 
I11(iv) Make a protective advance to protect the Government's interest. 
I11(v) Accelerate the account and demand payment in full. 

I80�1A3550.111 
I89Appraisals (loans only). 
I11An appraisal is required when the section 504 debt to be secured exceeds $15,000 or whenever RHS determines that it is necessary to establish the adequacy of the security. RHS may charge an appraisal fee. Appraisals must be made in accordance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices. When other real estate is taken as additional security it will be appraised if it represents a substantial portion of the security for the loan. 

I80�1A3550.112 
I89Maximum loan and grant. 
I11(a) T3Maximum loan permitted.G1T1 The sum of all outstanding section 504 loans to 1 borrower or on 1 dwelling may not exceed $20,000. 
I11(1) Transferees who have assumed a section 504 loan and wish to obtain a subsequent section 504 loan are limited to the difference between the unpaid principal balance of the debt assumed and $20,000. 
I11(2) For a secured loan, the total of all debts on the secured property may not exceed the value of the security, except by the amount of any required appraisal and tax monitoring fees, and the contributions to an escrow account for taxes and insurance. 
I11(b) T3Maximum loan based upon ability to pay.G1T1 The maximum loan is limited to the principal balance that can be supported given the amount the applicant has available, as determined by RHS, to repay a loan at 1 percent interest with a 20-year term. 
I11(c) T3Maximum grant.G1T1 The lifetime total of the grant assistance to any recipient is $7,500. No grant can be awarded unless the maximum level of loans, as supported by a budget, have been obtained.

I89Rates and terms (loans only). 
I11(a) T3Interest rate.G1T1 The interest rate for all section 504 loans will be 1 percent. 
I11(b) T3Loan term.G1T1 The repayment period for the loan should generally be as short as possible based on the applicant's repayment ability, and may never exceed 20 years; however loans made in combination with grants must have a term of 20 years. 

I80�1A3550.114

I56Subpart D_Regular Servicing 

I80�1A3550.151 
I89Servicing goals. 
I11This subpart sets forth the Rural Housing Service (RHS) policies for managing the repayment of loans made under sections 502 and 504 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended. 

I80�1A3550.152 
I89Loan payments. 
I11(a) T3Payment terms.G1T1 Unless the loan documents specify other loan repayment terms, borrowers are required to make monthly payments. Borrowers with existing loans specifying annual payments may request conversion to monthly payments, and must convert to a monthly payment schedule before any subsequent loan or new payment assistance is approved. Suitable forms of payment are: check, money order, or bank draft. Borrowers who make cash payments will be assessed a fee to cover the cost of conversion to a money order. 
I11(b) T3Application of payments.G1T1 If a borrower makes less than the scheduled payment, the payment is held in suspense and is not applied to the borrower's account. When subsequent payments are received in an amount sufficient to equal a scheduled payment, the amount will be applied in the following order: 
I11(1) Protective advances charged to the account. 
I11(2) Accrued interest due. 
I11(3) Principal due. 
I11(4) Escrow for taxes and insurance. 
I11(c) T3Multiple loans.G1T1 When a borrower with multiple loans for the same property makes less than the scheduled payment on all loans, the payment will be applied to the oldest loan and then in declining order of age. Future remittances will be applied beginning with the oldest unpaid installment. 
I11(d) T3Application of excess payments.G1T1 Borrowers can elect to make payments in excess of the scheduled amount to be applied to principal, provided there are no outstanding fees. 

I80�1A3550.153 
I89Fees. 
I11RHS may assess reasonable fees including a tax service fee, fees for late payments, and fees for checks returned for insufficient funds. 

I80�1A3550.154 
I89Inspections. 
I11RHS or its agent may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of any property used as security for an RHS loan as necessary to protect the interest of the Government. RHS will give the borrower notice at the time of or prior to an inspection. 

I80�1A3550.155 
I89Escrow account. 
I11Escrow accounts will be administered in accordance with RESPA and section 501(e) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended. 
I11(a) Upon creation of the escrow account, RHS may require borrowers to deposit funds sufficient to pay taxes and insurance premiums applicable to the mortgage for the period since the last payments were made and to fund a cushion as permitted by RESPA. 
I11(b) Borrowers may elect to escrow at any time during the terms of the loan if the outstanding RHS loan balance is over $2,500. 
I11(c) RHS may require borrowers to escrow in conjunction with any special servicing action. 

I80�1A3550.156 
I89Borrower obligations. 
I11(a) After receiving a loan from RHS, borrowers are expected to meet a variety of obligations outlined in the loan documents. In addition to making timely payments, these obligations include: 
I11(1) Maintaining the security property; and 
I11(2) Maintaining an adequately funded escrow account, or paying real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance, and other related costs when due. 
I11(b) If a borrower fails to fulfill these obligations, RHS may obtain the needed service and charge the cost to the borrowers account. 

�393�I80�1A3550.157 
I89Payment subsidy. 
I11(a) T3Borrowers currently receiving payment subsidy.G1T1 (1) RHS will review annually each borrower's eligibility for continued payment subsidy and determine the appropriate level of assistance. To be eligible for payment subsidy renewal, the borrower must also occupy the property. 
I11(2) If the renewal is not completed before the expiration date of the existing agreement, the effective date of the renewal will be either the expiration date of the previous agreement if RHS error caused the delay, or the next due date after the renewal is approved in all other cases. 
I11(3) The borrower must notify RHS whenever an adult member of the household becomes employed or changes employment, there is a change in household composition, or if income increases by at least 10 percent. The household may also report decreases in income. If the change in the household's income will cause the payment for principal and interest to change by at least 10 percent, the household's payment subsidy may be adjusted for a new 12-month period. The new agreement will be effective the due date following the date the borrower's information is verified by RHS. 
I11(b) T3Borrowers not currently receiving payment subsidy.G1T1 Payment assistance may be granted to borrowers not currently receiving payment subsidy whose loans were approved on or after August 1, 1968, whose income does not exceed the applicable low-income limit for the area, are personally occupying the RHS financed property, and who meet the requirements of �1A3550.53(b), (e), and (f). In general, to receive payment assistance the term of the loan at closing must have been at least 25 years. If an account has been reamortized and the initial term of the loan was at least 25 years, payment assistance may be granted even though the term of the reamortized loan is less than 25 years. Payment assistance may be granted on a subsequent loan for repairs with a term of less than 25 years. 
I11(c) T3Cancellation of payment subsidy.G1T1 RHS will cancel a payment subsidy if the borrower does not occupy the property, has sold or transferred title to the property, or is no longer eligible for payment subsidy. 

I80�1A3550.158 
I89Active military duty. 
I11The Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act requires that the interest rate charged a borrower who enters full-time active military duty after a loan is closed not exceed six percent. Active military duty does not include participation in a military reserve or the National Guard unless the borrower is called to active duty. 
I11(a) T3Amount of assistance.G1T1 If a borrower qualifies for payment subsidy after reduction of the interest rate to six percent, the amount of payment subsidy received during the period of active military duty will be the difference between the amount due at the subsidized rate for principal and interest and the amount due at a six percent interest rate. The six percent interest rate will be effective with the first payment due after RHS confirms the active military status of the borrower. 
I11(b) T3Change of active military status.G1T1 The borrower must notify RHS when he or she is no longer on active military duty. RHS will cancel the six percent interest rate and resume use of the promissory note interest rate. A new payment subsidy agreement may be processed if the borrower is eligible. 

I80�1A3550.159 
I89Borrower actions requiring RHS approval. 
I11(a) T3Mineral leases.G1T1 Borrowers who wish to lease mineral rights to a security property must request authorization from RHS. RHS may consent to the lease of mineral rights and subordinate its liens to the lessee's rights and interests in the mineral activity if the security property will remain suitable as a residence and the Government's security interest will not be adversely affected. Subordination of RHS loans to a mineral lease does not entitle the leaseholder to any proceeds from the sale of the security property. 
I11(1) If the proposed activity is likely to decrease the value of the security property, RHS may consent to the lease only if the borrower assigns 100 percent of the income from the lease to RHS to be applied to reduce principal and the rent to be paid is at least equal �394�to the estimated decrease in the market value of the security. 
I11(2) If the proposed activity is not likely to decrease the value of the security property, RHS may consent to the lease if the borrower agrees to use any damage compensation received from the lessee to repair damage to the site or dwelling, or to assign it to RHS to be applied to reduce principal. 
I11(b) T3Subordination.G1T1 RHS may subordinate its interests to permit a borrower to defer recapture amounts and refinance the loan, or to obtain a subsequent loan with private credit. 
I11(1) When it is in the best interest of the Government, subordination will be permitted if: 
I11(i) The other lender will verify that the funds will be used for purposes for which an RHS loan could be made; 
I11(ii) The prior lien debt will be on terms and conditions that the borrower can reasonably be expected to meet without jeopardizing repayment of the RHS indebtedness;
I11(iii) Any proposed development will be planned and performed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A or directed by the other lender in a manner which is consistent with that subpart; and 
I11(iv) An agreement is obtained in writing from the prior lienholder providing that at least 30 days prior written notice will be given to RHS before action to foreclose on the prior lien is initiated. 
I11(2) The total amount of debt permitted when RHS subordinates its interests depends on whether the borrower pays off the RHS loan. 
I11(i) For situations in which the borrower is obtaining a subsequent loan from another source and will not pay off the RHS debt, the prior lien debt plus the unpaid balance of all RHS loans, exclusive of recapture, will not exceed the market value of the security. 
I11(ii) For situations in which RHS is subordinating only a deferred recapture amount, the prior lien debt plus the deferred recapture amount will not exceed the market value of the security. 
I11(c) T3Partial release of security.G1T1 RHS may consent to transactions affecting the security, such as sale or exchange of security property or granting of a right-of-way across the security property, and grant a partial release provided: 
I11(1) The compensation is: 
I11(i) For sale of the security property, cash in an amount equal to the value of the security being disposed of or rights granted. 
I11(ii) For exchange of security property, another parcel of property acquired in exchange with value equal to or greater than that being disposed of. 
I11(iii) For granting an easement or right-of-way, benefits derived that are equal to or greater than the value of the security property being disposed of. 
I11(2) An appraisal must be conducted if the latest appraisal is more than 1 year old or if it does not reflect market value and the amount of consideration exceeds $5,000. The appraisal fee will be charged to the borrower. 
I11(3) The security property, after the transaction is completed, will be an adequate but modest, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling and related facilities. 
I11(4) Repayment of the RHS debt will not be jeopardized. 
I11(5) If applicable, the environmental requirements of 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G are met. 
I11(6) When exchange of all or part of the security is involved, title clearance is obtained before release of the existing security. 
I11(7) Proceeds from the sale of a portion of the security property, granting an easement or right-of-way, damage compensation, and all similar transactions requiring RHS consent, will be used in the following order: 
I11(i) To pay customary and reasonable costs related to the transaction that must be paid by the borrower. 
I11(ii) To be applied on a prior lien debt, if any. 
I11(iii) To be applied to RHS indebtedness or used for improvements to the security property in keeping with purposes and limitations applicable for use of RHS loan funds. Proposed development will be planned and performed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A and supervised to ensure that the proceeds are used as planned. 
I11(d) T3Lease of security property.G1T1 A borrower must notify RHS if they lease the property. If the lease is for a term �395�of more than 3 years or contains an option to purchase, RHS may liquidate the loan. During the period of any lease, the borrower is not eligible for a payment subsidy or special servicing benefits. 

I80�1A3550.160 
I89Refinancing with private credit. 
I11(a) T3Objective.G1T1 RHS direct loan programs are not intended to supplant or compete with private credit sources. Therefore, borrowers are required to refinance RHS loans with private credit sources when RHS determines that the borrower meets RHS criteria. 
I11(b) T3Criteria for refinancing with private credit.G1T1 Borrowers must refinance with private credit when RHS determines that the borrower has the ability to obtain other credit at reasonable rates and terms based on their income, assets, and credit history. Reasonable rates and terms are those commercial rates and terms that borrowers are expected to meet when borrowing for similar purposes. Differences in interest rates and terms between RHS and other lenders will not be an acceptable reason for a borrower to fail to refinance with private credit if the available rates and terms are within the borrower's ability to pay. 
I11(c) T3Notice of requirement to refinance with private credit.G1T1 The financial status of all borrowers may be reviewed periodically to determine their ability to refinance with private credit. A borrower's financial status may be reviewed at any time if information becomes available to RHS that indicates that the borrower's circumstances have changed. 
I11(1) A borrower undergoing review is required to supply, within 30 days of a request from RHS, sufficient financial information to enable RHS to determine the borrowers ability to refinance with private credit. Foreclosure action may be initiated against any borrower who fails to respond. 
I11(2) When RHS determines that a borrower has the ability to refinance with private credit, the borrower will be required to refinance within 90 days. 
I11(3) Within 30 days after being notified of the requirement to refinance with private credit, a borrower may contest the RHS decision and provide additional financial information to document an inability to refinance with private credit. 
I11(d) T3Failure to refinance with private credit.G1T1 (1) If the borrower is unable to secure private credit, the borrower must submit written statements and documentation to RHS showing: 
I11(i) The lenders contacted. 
I11(ii) The amount of the loan requested by the borrower and the amount, if any, offered by the lenders. 
I11(iii) The rates and terms offered by the lenders or the specific reasons why other credit is not available. 
I11(iv) The information provided by the borrower to the lenders regarding the purpose of the loan. 
I11(2) If RHS determines that the borrower's submission does not demonstrate the borrower's inability to refinance with private credit, or if the borrower fails to submit the required information, foreclosure may be initiated. 
I11(e) T3Subordination of recapture amount.G1T1 RHS may subordinate its interest in any deferred recapture amount to permit a borrower to refinance with private credit. The amount to which the RHS debt will be subordinated may include: 
I11(1) The amount required to repay the RHS debt, exclusive of recapture;
I11(2) Reasonable closing costs;
I11(3) Up to one percent of the loan amount for loan servicing costs, if required by the lender; and 
I11(4) The cost of any necessary repairs or improvements to the security property. 
I11(f) T3Application for additional credit.G1T1 A borrower who has been asked to refinance with private credit will not be considered for additional credit until the refinancing issue is resolved unless such additional credit is necessary to protect the Government's interest. 

I80�1A3550.161 
I89Final payment. 
I11(a) T3Payment in full.G1T1 Full payment of a borrower's account includes repayment of principal and outstanding interest, unauthorized assistance, recapture amounts, and charges made to the borrower's account. Any supervised funds �396�or funds remaining in a borrower's escrow account will be applied to the borrower's account or returned to the borrower. 
I11(b) T3Release of security instruments.G1T1 RHS may release security instruments when full payment of all amounts owed has been received and verified. If RHS and the borrower agree to settle the account for less than the full amount owed, the security instruments may be released when all agreed-upon amounts are received and verified. Security instruments will not be released until any deferred recapture amount has been paid in full. 
I11(c) T3Payoff statements.G1T1 At the borrower's request, RHS will provide a written statement indicating the amount required to pay the account in full. RHS may charge a fee for statements for the same account if more than 2 statements are requested in any 30 day period. 
I11(d) T3Suitable forms of payment.G1T1 Suitable forms of payment are: check, money order, or bank draft. Borrowers who make cash payments will be assessed a fee to cover conversion to a money order. 
I11(e) T3Recording costs.G1T1 Recording costs for the release of the mortgage will be the responsibility of the borrower, except where State law requires the mortgagee to record or file the satisfaction. 

I80�1A3550.162 
I89Recapture. 
I11(a) T3Recapture policy.G1T1 Borrowers with loans approved or assumed on or after October 1, 1979, will be required to repay subsidy amounts received through payment subsidy or deferred mortgage assistance. Amounts to be recaptured are due and payable when the borrower transfers title or ceases to occupy the property. 
I11(b) T3Amount to be recaptured.G1T1 (1) The maximum amount to be recaptured is the amount of principal reduction attributed to subsidy and the lesser of: 
I11(i) The amount of subsidy received; or 
I11(ii) 50 percent of the value appreciation. 
I11(2) The value appreciation of a property with a cross-collateralized loan is based on the market value of the dwelling; and if located on a farm, the dwelling and a minimum adequate site. 
I11(3) Interest reduced from the promissory note rate to six percent under the Soldiers and Sailors Relief Act is not subject to recapture. 
I11(c) T3Option to defer payment of recapture amounts.G1T1 (1) Borrowers may defer payment of recapture amounts if the loan is repaid, the title does not transfer, and the borrower continues to occupy the property. 
I11(2) The RHS mortgage securing the deferred recapture amount may be subordinated to permit refinancing if the RHS mortgage will be adequately secured. 
I11(3) Borrowers eligible to defer recapture may receive a discount on the recapture amount due if the recapture amount is paid along with the final payment, or in the case of a final installment, within 60 days of the date RHS notifies the borrower that recapture may be due. 
I11(d) T3Borrower ceases to occupy the property.G1T1 When a borrower ceases to occupy a property: 
I11(1) The borrower may pay the recapture amount in full or reamortize the existing loan to include the recapture amount. 
I11(2) If the borrower does not pay the recapture amount or consent to reamortization within 30 days, RHS may proceed with foreclosure. 
I11(e) T3Assumed loans.G1T1 (1) When a loan subject to recapture is assumed under new rates and terms, the recapture amount may be paid in full by the seller or included in the principal amount assumed by the buyer. 
I11(2) When a loan is assumed under the terms of the promissory note, recapture amounts will not be due. When the new borrower transfers title or ceases to occupy the property, all subsidy subject to recapture before and after the assumption is due. 
I11(3) When a borrower has deferred payment of recapture amounts, the deferred recapture amount may be included in the principal amount of the new loan.

I11(a) T3General policy.G1T1 RHS mortgages contain due-on-sale clauses that generally require RHS consent before title to a security property can be transferred with an assumption of the indebtedness. If it is in the best interest of the Government, RHS will approve the transfer of title and assumption of indebtedness on program or nonprogram (NP) terms, depending on the transferee's eligibility and the property's characteristics. 
I11(b) T3RHS approval of assumptions.G1T1 (1) A borrower with a loan on program terms who wishes to transfer a security property restricted by a due-on-sale clause to a purchaser who wishes to assume the debt must receive prior authorization from RHS. If RHS authorizes the transfer and assumption, the account will be serviced in the purchaser's name and the purchaser will be liable for the loan under the terms of the security instrument. 
I11(2) If a borrower sells a security property with a due-on-sale clause without obtaining RHS authorization, RHS will not approve assumption of the indebtedness, and the loan will be liquidated unless RHS determines that it is in the Government's best interest to continue the loan. If RHS decides to continue the loan, the account will be serviced in the original borrower's name and the original borrower will remain liable for the loan under the terms of the security instrument. 
I11(c) T3Exceptions to due-on-sale clauses.G1T1 (1) Due-on-sale clauses are not triggered by the following types of transfers: 
I11(i) A transfer from the borrower to a spouse or children not resulting from the death of the borrower. 
I11(ii) A transfer to a relative, joint tenant, or tenant by the entirety resulting from the death of the borrower. 
I11(iii) A transfer to a spouse or ex-spouse resulting from a divorce decree, legal separation agreement, or property settlement agreement. 
I11(iv) A transfer to a person other than a deceased borrower's spouse who wishes to assume the loan for the benefit of persons who were dependent on the deceased borrower at the time of death, if the dwelling will be occupied by one or more persons who were dependent on the borrower at the time of death, and there is a reasonable prospect of repayment. 
I11(v) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower does not transfer rights of occupancy in the property. 
I11(2) A transferee who obtains property through one of the types of transfer listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section: 
I11(i) Is not required to assume the loan, and RHS is not permitted to liquidate the loan, if the transferee continues to make scheduled payments and meet all other obligations of the loan. A transferee who does not assume the loan is not eligible for payment assistance or a moratorium. 
I11(ii) May assume the loan on the rates and terms contained in the promissory note, with no down payment. If the account is past due at the time an assumption is executed, the account may be brought current by using any of the servicing methods discussed in subpart E of this part. 
I11(iii) May assume the loan under new rates and terms if the transferee applies and is program-eligible. 
I11(3) Any subsequent transfer of title, except upon death of the inheritor or between inheritors to consolidate title, will be treated as a sale. 
I11(d) T3Requirements for an assumption.G1T1 (1) Loans secured by program-eligible properties to be assumed by program-eligible purchasers may be assumed on program terms. Loans secured by nonprogram properties and loans to be assumed by purchasers who are not eligible for program terms may be assumed on NP terms. 
I11(2) The amount the transferee will assume will be either the current market value less any prior liens and any required down payment, or the indebtedness, whichever is less. 
I11(3) For loans assumed on program terms, the interest rate charged by RHS will be the rate in effect at loan approval or loan closing, whichever is lower. For loans assumed on nonprogram terms, the interest rate will be the rate in effect at the time of loan approval. 
I11(4) If additional financing is required to purchase the property or to make �398�repairs, RHS may approve a subsequent loan under subparts B or C of this part. 
I11(5) If an appraisal is required for an assumption on new terms, the purchaser is responsible for the appraisal fee. 
I11(6) If all or a portion of the borrower's account balance is assumed, the borrower and cosigner, if any, will be released from liability on the amount of the indebtedness assumed. If an account balance remains after the assumption, RHS may pursue debt settlement in accordance with subpart F of this part. 
I11(7) Unless it is in the Government's best interest, RHS will not approve an assumption of a secured loan if the seller fails to repay any unsecured RHS loan. 
I11(8) If a loan is secured by a property with a dwelling situated on more than a minimum adequate site and the excess property cannot be sold separately as a minimum adequate site for another dwelling, RHS may approve a transfer of the entire property. If the excess property can be sold separately as a minimum adequate site, RHS will approve assumption of only the dwelling and the minimum adequate site. If the value of the dwelling on the minimum adequate site is less than the amount of the outstanding RHS debt, the remaining debt will be secured by the excess property. The outstanding debt will be converted to an NP loan and reamortized over a period not to exceed 10 years or the final due date of the original promissory note, whichever is sooner.

I89Unauthorized assistance. 
I11(a) T3Definition.G1T1 Unauthorized assistance includes any loan, payment subsidy, deferred mortgage payment, or grant for which the recipient was not eligible. 
I11(b) T3Unauthorized assistance due to false information.G1T1 (1) False information includes information that the recipient knew was incorrect or should have known was incorrect that was provided or omitted for the purposes of obtaining assistance for which the recipient was not eligible. 
I11(2) If the recipient receives an unauthorized loan due to false information, RHS will adjust the account using the NP interest rate that was in effect when the loan was approved. The recipient must pay the account in full within 30 days. 
I11(3) If the recipient receives unauthorized subsidy due to false information, RHS will require the recipient to repay it within 30 days. The account cannot be reamortized to include the unauthorized subsidy. If the recipient repays the unauthorized subsidy, the loan may be continued. 
I11(c) T3Unauthorized assistance due to inaccurate information.G1T1 (1) Inaccurate information includes incorrect information inadvertently provided, used, or omitted without the intent to obtain benefits for which the recipient was not eligible. 
I11(2) RHS will permit a recipient who receives an unauthorized loan due to inaccurate information to retain the loan under the following conditions. 
I11(i) If the inaccurate information was related to the purpose of the loan or the recipient's eligibility, with the exception of income, or the income used was incorrect, but the recipient still qualified as income-eligible, RHS will allow the recipient to continue the loan on existing terms. 
I11(ii) If a section 502 recipient's income was above the moderate-income level, RHS will convert the loan to an NP loan, using the nonprogram interest rate in effect on the date the loan was approved. 
I11(iii) If a section 504 recipient's income was above the very low-income level, RHS will apply the applicable 502 or nonprogram interest rate in effect on the date the loan was approved. 
I11(iv) If an incorrect interest rate was used, RHS will adjust the account using the correct interest rate. 
I11(3) If the recipient receives unauthorized subsidy due to inaccurate information, RHS will require the recipient to repay it within 30 days. If the recipient cannot repay it within 30 days, the account may be reamortized. If the recipient repays the unauthorized subsidy or reamortizes the loan, the loan may be continued. 
I11(d) T3Unauthorized grants.G1T1 Recipients may either repay the unauthorized assistance in a lump sum or execute a promissory note, regardless of whether the unauthorized assistance was due to �399�false or inaccurate information. RHS may seek a judgment if the recipient refuses to repay the unauthorized assistance. 
I11(e) T3Account servicing.G1T1 RHS will adjust all accounts retroactively to establish the amount of unauthorized assistance. If the recipient does not repay the unauthorized assistance within 30 days, RHS may accelerate the loan. If the unauthorized assistance is due to inaccurate information and the recipient is unable to repay within 30 days, RHS may reamortize the loan. 
I11(f) T3Accounts with no security.G1T1 If an unauthorized loan or grant is unsecured, RHS may seek the best mortgage obtainable.

I56Subpart E_Special Servicing 

I80�1A3550.201
I89Purpose of special servicing actions. 
I11The Rural Housing Service (RHS) may approve special servicing actions to reduce the number of borrower failures that result in liquidation. Borrowers who have difficulty keeping their accounts current may be eligible for one or more available servicing options including: payment assistance; delinquency workout agreements that temporarily modify payment terms; protective advances of funds for taxes, insurance, and other approved costs; payment moratoriums; and reamortization of the loan. 

I80�1A3550.202
I89Past due accounts. 
I11An account is past due if the scheduled payment is not received by the due date, or as authorized by State law. 
I11(a) T3Late fee.G1T1 A late fee will be assessed if the full scheduled payment is not received by the 15th day after the due date. 
I11(b) T3LiquidationG1T1_(1) T3For borrowers with monthly payments.G1T1 The account may be accelerated without further servicing when at least 3 scheduled payments are past due or an amount equal to at least 2 scheduled payments is past due for at least 3 consecutive months. In such cases RHS may pursue voluntary liquidation and foreclosure. 
I11(2) T3For borrowers with annual payments.G1T1 The account may be accelerated without further servicing when at least \3/12\ of 1 scheduled payment has not been received by its due date. In such cases, RHS may pursue voluntary liquidation and foreclosure. 

I80�1A3550.203
I89General servicing actions. 
I11Whenever any of the servicing actions described in this subpart result in reamortization of the account RHS may: 
I11(a) Require a borrower who currently makes annual payments, but receives a monthly income, to convert to monthly payments. 
I11(b) Require the creation and funding of an escrow account for real estate taxes and insurance, if one does not already exist for any borrower with monthly payments. 
I11(c) Convert the method of calculating interest for any account being charged daily simple interest to an amortized payment schedule. 

I80�1A3550.204
I89Payment assistance. 
I11Borrowers who are eligible may be offered payment assistance in accordance with subpart B of this part. Borrowers who are not eligible for payment assistance because the loan was approved �400�before August 1, 1968, or the loan was made on above-moderate or nonprogram (NP) terms, may refinance the loan in order to obtain payment assistance if: 
I11(a) The borrower is eligible to receive a loan with payment assistance;
I11(b) Due to circumstances beyond the borrower's control, the borrower is in danger of losing the property; and 
I11(c) The property is program-eligible. 

I80�1A3550.205
I89Delinquency workout agreements. 
I11Borrowers with past due accounts may be offered the opportunity to avoid liquidation by entering into a delinquency workout agreement that specifies a plan for bringing the account current. To receive a delinquency workout agreement, the following requirements apply: 
I11(a) A borrower who is able to do so will be required to pay the past-due amount in a single payment. 
I11(b) A borrower who is unable to pay the past-due amount in a single payment must pay monthly all scheduled payments plus an agreed upon additional amount that brings the account current within 2 years or the remaining term of the loan, whichever is shorter. 
I11(c) If a borrower becomes more than 30 days past due under the terms of a delinquency workout agreement, RHS may cancel the agreement. 

I80�1A3550.206
I89Protective advances. 
I11RHS may pay for fees or services and charge the cost against the borrower's account to protect the Governments interest. 
I11(a) T3Advances for taxes and insurance.G1T1 RHS may advance funds to pay real estate taxes, hazard and flood insurance premiums, and other related costs, as well as amounts needed to fund the current escrow cycle. 
I11(b) T3Advances for costs other than taxes and insurance.G1T1 Protective advances for costs other than taxes and insurance, such as emergency repairs, will be made only if the borrower cannot obtain a subsequent loan. 
I11(c) T3Repayment arrangements.G1T1 (1) Advances for borrowers with multiple loans will be charged against the largest loan. 
I11(2) Amounts advanced will be due with the next scheduled payment. RHS may schedule repayment consistent with the borrowers ability to repay or reamortize the loan. 
I11(3) Advances will bear interest at the promissory note rate of the loan to which the advance was charged. 

I80�1A3550.207
I89Payment moratorium. 
I11RHS may defer a borrowers scheduled payments for up to 2 years. NP borrowers are not eligible for a payment moratorium. 
I11(a) T3Borrower eligibility.G1T1 For a borrower to be eligible for a moratorium, all of the following conditions must be met: 
I11(1) Due to circumstances beyond the borrower's control, the borrower is temporarily unable to continue making scheduled payments because: 
I11(i) The borrower's repayment income fell by at least 20 percent within the past 12 months; 
I11(ii) The borrower must pay unexpected and unreimbursed expenses resulting from the illness, injury, or death of the borrower or a family member; or 
I11(iii) The borrower must pay unexpected and unreimbursed expenses resulting from damage to the security property in cases where adequate hazard insurance was not available or was prohibitively expensive. 
I11(2) The borrower occupies the dwelling, unless RHS determines that it is uninhabitable. 
I11(3) The borrower's account is not currently accelerated. 
I11(b) T3Reviews of borrower eligibility.G1T1 (1) Periodically RHS may require the borrower to submit financial information to demonstrate that the moratorium should be continued. The moratorium may be canceled if:

I11(2) At least 30 days before the moratorium is scheduled to expire, RHS will �401�require the borrower to provide financial information needed to determine whether the borrower is able to resume making scheduled payments. 
I11(c) T3Resumption of scheduled payments.G1T1 When the borrower is able to resume scheduled payments, the loan will be reamortized to include the amount deferred during the moratorium and the borrower will be required to escrow. If the new monthly payment, after consideration of the maximum amount of payment subsidy available to the borrower, exceeds the borrower's repayment ability, all or part of the interest that has accrued during the moratorium may be forgiven. 
I11(d) T3Borrowers unable to resume scheduled payments.G1T1 If even after all appropriate servicing actions have been taken the borrower is unable to resume making scheduled payments after 2 consecutive years of being on a moratorium, the account will be liquidated. 

I80�1A3550.208
I89Reamortization using promissory note interest rate. 
I11Reamortization using the promissory note interest rate may be authorized when RHS determines that reamortization is required to enable the borrower to meet scheduled obligations, and only if the Government's lien priority is not adversely affected. 
I11(a) T3Permitted uses.G1T1 Reamortization at the promissory note interest rate may be used to accomplish a variety of servicing actions, including to: 
I11(1) Repay unauthorized assistance due to inaccurate information. 
I11(2) Repay principal and interest accrued and advances made during a moratorium. 
I11(3) Bring current an account under a delinquency workout agreement after the borrower has demonstrated the willingness and ability to meet the terms of the loan and delinquency workout agreement and reamortization is in the borrower's and Government's best interests. 
I11(4) Bring a delinquent account current in the case of an assumption where the due on sale clause is not triggered as described in �1A3550.163(c). 
I11(5) Cover the remaining debt when a portion of the security property is being transferred but the acquisition price does not cover the outstanding debt. The remaining balance will be reamortized for a period not to exceed 10 years or the final due date of the note being reamortized, whichever is sooner. 
I11(b) T3Payment term of reamortized loan.G1T1 Except as noted in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, the term of the reamortized loan may be extended to the maximum term for which the borrower was eligible at the time the loan was originally made, less the number of years the loan has been outstanding. In all cases, the term must not exceed the remaining security life of the property.

I80�1A3550.211
I89Liquidation. 
I11(a) T3Policy.G1T1 When RHS determines that a borrower is unable or unwilling to meet loan obligations, RHS may accelerate the loan and, if necessary, acquire the security property. The borrower is responsible for all expenses associated with liquidation and acquisition. If the account is satisfied in full, the borrower will be released from liability. If the account is not satisfied in full, RHS may pursue any deficiency �402�unless the borrower received a moratorium at any time during the life of the loan and faithfully tried to repay the loan. 
I11(b) T3Tribal allotted or trust land.G1T1 Liquidations involving a security interest in tribal allotted or trust land shall only be pursued after offering to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the tribe, or the Indian Housing Authority. Forced liquidation of RHS security interests in Indian trust lands or on tribal allotted land will be recommended only after the State Director has determined it is in the best interest of the Government. 
I11(c) T3Acceleration and foreclosure.G1T1 If RHS determines that foreclosure is in the best interest of the Government, RHS will send an acceleration notice to each borrower and any cosigner. If the borrower does not pay the full account balance and meet the other terms of the loan within 30 days of acceleration, RHS may foreclose. RHS will not accept partial payment of an accelerated loan unless required to accept the payment by State law. 
I11(d) T3Voluntary liquidation.G1T1 Borrowers may voluntarily liquidate through: 
I11(1) T3Refinancing or sale.G1T1 The borrower may refinance or sell the security property for at least net recovery value and apply the proceeds to the account. 
I11(2) T3Deed in lieu of foreclosure.G1T1 RHS may accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure to convey title to the security property only after the debt has been accelerated and when it is in the Government's best interest. 
I11(3) T3Offer by third party.G1T1 If a junior lienholder or cosigner makes an offer in the amount of at least the net recovery value, RHS may assign the note and mortgage. 
I11(e) T3Bankruptcy.G1T1 (1) When a petition in bankruptcy is filed by a borrower after acceleration, collection actions and foreclosure actions are suspended in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. 
I11(2) RHS may accept conveyance of security property by the trustee in bankruptcy if the Bankruptcy Court has approved the transaction, RHS determines the conveyance is in the best interest of the Government, and RHS will acquire title free of all liens and encumbrances except RHS liens. 
I11(3) Whenever possible in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, a reaffirmation agreement will be signed by the borrower and approved by the court prior to discharge, if RHS decides to continue with the borrower. 
I11(f) T3Junior lienholder foreclosure.G1T1 When a junior lienholder foreclosure does not result in payment in full of the RHS debt but the property is sold subject to the RHS lien, RHS may liquidate the account unless the new owner is eligible to assume the RHS debt and actually assumes the RHS debt. 
I11(g) T3Payment subsidy.G1T1 If the borrower is receiving payment subsidy, the payment subsidy agreement will not be canceled when the debt is accelerated, but will not be renewed unless the account is reinstated. 
I11(h) T3Eligibility for special servicing actions.G1T1 A borrower is not eligible for special servicing actions once the account has been accelerated. 
I11(i) T3Reporting.G1T1 RHS may report to IRS and credit reporting agencies any debt settled through liquidation.

I89Property management and disposition. 
I11(a) T3Policy.G1T1 Rural Housing Service (RHS) will manage custodial property and Real Estate Owned (REO) property to protect the Government's interest, and may dispose of REO property through direct sales, sealed bid, or auction. RHS will follow affirmative fair housing marketing policies. 
I11(b) T3Custodial property.G1T1 RHS may take custodial possession of security property that has been abandoned, or for other reasons necessary to protect the Government's security. After taking custodial possession of a security property, RHS may maintain and repair the security property as needed to protect the Government's interest, pay required real estate taxes and assessments, and secure personal property left on the premises. Expenses will be charged to the borrower's account. Custodial property may be leased when it is in the Government's best interest and in such cases the borrower's account will be credited for income from the security property. 
I11(c) T3REO propertyG1T1_(1) T3Classification.G1T1 When RHS takes title to a security property, it is classified as either program or nonprogram (NP) property. An REO property that is eligible for financing under the section 502 program, or which could reasonably be repaired to be eligible, is classified as program property. An REO property that cannot reasonably be repaired to be eligible as section 502 property, and property that has been improved to a point that it will no longer qualify as modest under section 502, is classified as NP property. 
I11(2) T3Disclosing decent, safe, and sanitary defects.G1T1 When RHS determines that an REO property to be sold is not decent, safe, and sanitary, or does not meet cost-effective energy conservation standards, it will disclose the reasons why. The deed by which such an REO property is conveyed will contain a covenant restricting it from residential use until it is decent, safe, and sanitary and meets the RHS cost-effective energy conservation standards. RHS will also notify any potential purchaser of any known lead-based paint hazards. 
I11(3) T3Property on Indian tribal allotted or trust land.G1T1 REO property which is located on Indian tribal allotted or trust land, will be sold or otherwise disposed of only to a member of the particular tribe having jurisdiction over the allotted or tribal land, to the tribe, or to an Indian housing authority serving the tribe on a first-come, first-served basis. 
I11(4) T3Reservation of program REO properties.G1T1 (i) Program REO properties are reserved for program-eligible applicants and nonprofit organizations or public bodies providing transitional housing during the first 60 days after the date of the first notice of sale, and during the first 30 days following any reduction in price or any other change in credit terms or other sale terms. After the expiration of a reservation period, program REO properties can be bought by any buyer. 
I11(ii) An offer on a program REO property from a buyer who does not qualify for a section 502 program loan may be submitted during a reservation period, but is considered to have been received on the day after the reservation period ends. 
I11(iii) No offer is considered until 3 business days after the date the property is offered for sale. An offer received during the 3-day holding period is not considered until the 4th day, and is evaluated with any other offers actually received on the 4th day. 
I11(5) T3Priority of offers received the same day.G1T1 (i) Offers received on the same business day are selected in the following order: 
I11(A) Offers from program-eligible applicants, with a request for credit on program terms. All offers are evaluated as if they were submitted at the listed price, regardless of the offering price. 
I11(B) Offers from nonprofits or public bodies for conversion to use as transitional housing or for other special purposes as specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. 
I11(C) Cash offers, from highest to lowest. 
I11(D) NP credit offers, from highest to lowest. 
I11(ii) Acceptable offers of equal priority received on the same business day are selected by lot. 
�404�I11(iii) REO properties are not held off the market pending the outcome of an appeal of RHS rejection of a request for financing. 
I11(6) T3Sale by sealed bid or auction.G1T1 RHS may authorize the sale of an REO property by sealed bid or public auction when it is in the best interest of the Government. RHS will publicly solicit requests for sealed bids and publicize auctions. If a successful bidder is unable to settle the transaction under the terms of the offer, except for the financing contingency, any required bid deposit may be retained by RHS. If the highest bid is lower than the minimum acceptable bid established by RHS, or if no acceptable bids are received, RHS may negotiate a sale without further public notice. 
I11(d) T3Special purposes.G1T1 (1) REO property may be purchased for conversion to multiple family housing. 
I11(2) When a nonprofit organization or public body notifies RHS in writing of its intent to buy an REO property to provide transitional housing for the homeless, RHS may withdraw the property from the market for up to 30 days to give the entity an opportunity to execute a purchase contract. The listed price may be discounted for offers on a nonprogram REO property at any time, and on a program REO property after the 60-day reservation period. No down payment is required, and the loan term will be for a maximum of 30 years. Until RHS executes a sales agreement, an offer from a program-eligible applicant will receive priority, regardless of a nonprofit's interest in purchasing the REO property for use as transitional housing. 
I11(3) NP properties may be leased to a nonprofit organization or public body to provide transitional housing for the homeless at an annual cost of one dollar. When an REO property is to be leased as transitional housing, RHS will make repairs needed to put the property in decent, safe, and sanitary condition.

I11(b) T3Initiating special servicing.G1T1 When special servicing is initiated, the lender must submit for Agency review a special servicing plan that includes proposed actions to cure the deficiencies and a timeframe for completion. The special servicing plan will specify the proposed terms of any workout agreement recommended by the lender. The lender must obtain Agency approval of the terms of any workout agreement with the borrower. The workout agreement may include a loan modification, transfer of physical assets, or partial payment of claim and reamortization of the loan. Failure to comply with terms contained in the executed workout agreement will be considered a default of the guaranteed loan.
I11(1) T3Loan modification.G1T1 The borrower and lender may agree to a loan modification when such action will improve the financial viability of the project and its operations, and when a circumstance exists that is beyond the borrower's control. The Agency must approve in advance any loan modification that extends the life of the loan or requires an increase in the amount of the guarantee. All changes must be within the requirements of section 538 of the Housing Act of 1949.
I11(2) T3Change in ownership and transfer of physical assets.G1T1 A default or delinquency may be resolved by a change of the ownership entity in whole or in part. The Agency must approve all changes in ownership prior to the effective date of the transfer, and may require additional resources from the lender or borrower to resolve project deficiencies. A change in the ownership entity, including a transfer of physical assets, will not relieve the original borrower of liability for the loan, pursuant to the provisions regarding release of liability contained in subpart E of this part.
I11(3) T3Partial payment of claims.G1T1 The lender may request a partial payment of claim as a result of a loss experienced by the lender as a means to work out a troubled loan. The Agency will accept such claim if it determines that it is in the best interest of the government. In applying the partial payment, the lender must assign the obligation covered by the partial payment to the Agency, and, if required by the Agency, reamortize the obligation using the amount of the remaining obligation over an agreed-upon term.
�426�I11(c) T3Claims processing.G1T1 In the event of a loss, the lender must submit claims under the guarantee in accordance with subpart J of this part. Prior to submitting a claim, the lender must exhaust all possibilities of collection on the loan.
I11(d) T3Displacement prevention.G1T1 The actions of the lender must not harm the property's tenants through displacement.

I11(a) T3Lender certifications.G1T1 After borrower default and before filing a claim or assignment of the loan to the Agency, the lender must make every reasonable and prudent effort to resolve the default. The lender must provide the Agency with an accounting of all proposed and actual actions taken to cure the default. The lender must certify that all reasonable efforts to cure the default have been exhausted. Where the lender fails to comply with the terms of the loan guarantee agreement and the corresponding regulations and guidance with regard to liquidating the property, the Agency, at its option, may take possession of the security collateral and dispose of the property.
I11(b) T3Due diligence by lender.G1T1 For all loan servicing actions where a market, net recovery or liquidation value determination is required, guaranteed lenders shall perform due diligence in conjunction with the appraisal and submit it to the Agency for review. The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment published by the American Society of Testing and Materials is considered an acceptable format for due diligence.
I11(c) T3Environmental review.G1T1 The Agency is required to complete an environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G or a successor regulation, prior to disposition of inventory property, if title is held by the Agency, and prior to any authorization to the guaranteed lender to foreclose and dispose of property, and for any other servicing action requiring Agency approval or consent.


I80�1A3565.452
I89Decision to liquidate.

I80�1A3565.453
I89Disposition of the property.
I11(a) T3Liquidation plan.G1T1 The lender will, within 30 days after a decision to liquidate, submit to the Agency in writing its proposed detailed plan of liquidation.

I11(8) A schedule to periodically report to the Agency on the progress of liquidation.
I11(9) Estimated protective advance amounts with justification.
I11(b) T3Filing an estimated loss claim.G1T1 Upon Agency concurrence in the liquidation plan and when the lender owns any or all of the guaranteed portion of the loan, the Agency may, in accordance with program guidance, pay an estimated loss payment based on an Agency determined percentage of the approved estimate of the loss. The estimated loss payment will be based in the liquidation value of the collateral. If such payment is made, it will be applied to the outstanding principal balance owed on the guaranteed debt. The lender will discontinue interest accrual on the defaulted loan in accordance with Agency procedures.
I11(c) T3Property disposition.G1T1 Once the liquidation plan has Agency approval, the lender must make every effort to liquidate the property in a manner that will yield the highest market value consistent with the protections afforded to tenants contained in 7 CFR part 1944, subpart L or successor regulation. This liquidation process must be completed within 9 months from the lender's decision to liquidate, unless otherwise approved by the Agency.
I11(d) T3Transmitting payments and proceeds to the Agency.G1T1 When the Agency is the holder of a portion of the guaranteed loan, the lender will transmit to the Agency its pro rata share of any payments received from the borrower, liquidation, or other proceeds.

I11The Agency, in its sole discretion, may choose to obtain an assignment of the loan from the lender or conveyance of title obtained by the lender through foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure.
I11(a) T3Assignment.G1T1 In the case of an assignment of the loan, the assignment of the security instruments or the security must be in written and recordable form. Completion of the assignment will occur once the following transactions are completed to the Agency's satisfaction.
I11(1) Conveyance to the Agency of all the lender's rights and interests arising under the loan.
I11(2) Assignment to the Agency of all claims against the borrower or others arising out of the loan transactions, including:

I11(3) Certification that the collateral has been evaluated for the presence of contamination from the release of hazardous substances, petroleum products or other environmental hazards which may adversely impact the market value of the property and the results of that evaluation.
I11(b) T3Conveyance of title.G1T1 In the case of a conveyance of title to the property, the lender must inform the Agency in advance of how it plans to acquire title and a timetable for doing so. The Agency will accept the conveyance upon receipt of an assignment to the Agency of all claims of the lender against the property and assignment of the lender's rights to any operating funds and any reserves or escrows established for the maintenance of the property or the payment of property taxes and insurance.

I11(b) T3Date of loss.G1T1 The date of loss is the earliest of the date on which the property is foreclosed or acquired or the proposed date of foreclosure or acquisition in the liquidation plan, unless an alternative date is approved by the Agency. Where the Agency chooses to accept an assignment of the loan or conveyance of title, the date of loss will be the date on which the Agency accepts assignment of the loan or conveyance of title.
I11(c) T3Allowable claim amount.G1T1 The allowable claim amount must be calculated by:
I11(1) Adding to the unpaid principal and interest on the date of loss, an amount approved by the Agency for payments made by the lender for amounts due and owing on the property, including:

I11(a) This subpart contains Rural Housing Service (RHS) policies and authorizations and establishes procedures for making essential Community Facilities Grants (CFG) authorized under section 306(a)(19) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1926(a)(19)).
I11(b) Funds allocated for use in accordance with this subpart are also to be considered for use by federally recognized Indian tribes within a State regardless of whether State development strategies include Indian reservations within the State's boundaries. Indian tribes must have equal opportunity along with other rural residents to participate in the benefits of this program.
I11(c) Federal statutes provide for extending RHS financial assistance without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, and marital or familial status. To file a complaint, write the Secretary of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington DC 20250, or call 1�09800�09245�096340 (voice) or (202) 730�091127 (TDD). Persons with disabilities who require alternative means for communication of program information (Braille, large print, audiotape, etc.) should contact USDA's TARGET Center at (202) 720�092600 (voice and TDD).
I11(d) Any processing or servicing activity conducted pursuant to this subpart involving authorized assistance to Agency employees, members of their families, close relatives, or business or close personal associates is subject to the provisions of 7 CFR part 1900, subpart D. Applications for assistance are required to identify any relationship or association with an RHS employee.
I11(e) Copies of all forms referenced in this subpart are available in the Agency's National Office or any Rural Development field office.
I11(f) An outstanding judgment obtained against an applicant by the United States in a Federal Court (other than in the United States Tax Court), shall cause the applicant to be ineligible to receive any grant or loan until the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. Grant funds may not be used to satisfy the judgment.
I11(g) Grants made under this subpart will be administered under, and are subject to, 7 CFR parts 3015, 3016, or 3019, as appropriate.
I11(h) The income data used to determine median household income must be that which accurately reflects the income of the population to be served by the proposed facility. The median household income of the service area and the nonmetropolitan median household income for the State will be determined using income data from the most recent decennial Census of the United States. If there is reason to believe that the census data is not an accurate representation of the median household income within the area to be served, this will be documented and the applicant may furnish, or the Agency may obtain, additional information regarding such median household income. Information will consist of reliable data from local, regional, State, or Federal sources or from a survey conducted by a reliable impartial source.
I11(i) CFG funds can be used for up to 75 percent of the cost to develop the facility, notwithstanding that other contributions may be from other Federal sources.

�433�I11(4) Obligations for construction incurred before grant approval. Construction work should not be started and obligations for such work or materials should not be incurred before the grant is approved. However, if there are compelling reasons for proceeding with construction before grant approval, applicants may request Agency approval to pay such obligations. Such requests may be approved if the Agency determines that:

I11(i) Compelling reasons exist for incurring obligations before grant approval;
I11(ii) The obligations will be incurred for authorized grant purposes;
I11(iii) Contract documents have been approved by the Agency;
I11(iv) All environmental requirements applicable to the Agency and the applicant have been met; and

Q02I10The Agency may authorize payment of such obligations at the time of grant closing. The Agency's authorization to pay such obligations, however, is on the condition that it is not committed to make the grant; it assumes no responsibility for any obligations incurred by the applicant; and the applicant must subsequently meet all grant approval requirements. The applicant's request and the Agency's authorization for paying such obligations shall be in writing.

I89Project selection priorities.
I11Applications are scored on a priority basis. Points will be distributed as follows:
I11(a) T3Population priorities.G1T1 The proposed project is located in a rural community having a population of:
I11(1) 5,000 or less_30 points;
I11(2) Between 5,001 and 12,000, inclusive_20 points;
I11(3) Between 12,001 and 20,000, inclusive_10 points; or
I11(4) Between 20,001 and 50,000, inclusive, when applicable_5 points.
I11(b) T3Income priorities.G1T1 The median household income of the population to be served by the proposed project is below the higher of the poverty line or:
I11(1) 60 percent of the State nonmetropolitan median household income_30 points;
�435�I11(2) 70 percent of the State nonmetropolitan median household income_20 points;
I11(3) 80 percent of the State nonmetropolitan median household income_10 points; or

I11(d) T3DiscretionaryG1T1. (1) The State Director may assign up to 15 points to a project in addition to those that may be scored under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. These points are to address unforeseen exigencies or emergencies, such as the loss of a community facility due to an accident or natural disaster or the loss of joint financing if Agency funds are not committed in a timely fashion. In addition, the points will be awarded to projects benefiting from the leveraging of funds in order to improve compatibility and coordination between the Agency and other agencies' selection systems and for those projects that are the most cost effective.
I11(2) In selecting projects for funding at the National Office level, additional points will be awarded based on the priority assigned to the project by the State Office. These points will be awarded in the manner shown below. Only the three highest priority projects for a State will be awarded points. The Administrator may assign up to 30 additional points to account for geographic distribution of funds, emergency conditions caused by economic problems, natural disasters, or leveraging of funds.

(1) In cases when preliminary cost estimates indicate that an eligible, high-scoring application is not feasible, or would require grant assistance exceeding 50 percent of a State's current annual allocation, or an amount greater than that remaining in the State's allocation, the approval official may instead select the next lower-scoring application for further processing provided the high-scoring applicant is notified of this action and given an opportunity to review the proposal and resubmit it prior to selection of the next application.
I11(2) If it is found that there is no effective way to reduce costs, the approval official, after consultation with the applicant, may request an additional allocation of funds from the National office.

I80�1A3575.3
I89Full faith and credit.
I11The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States and is not contestable except for fraud or misrepresentation (including negligent misrepresentation) of which the lender or holder has actual knowledge, participates in, or condones. A note which provides for the payment of interest on interest shall not be guaranteed and any Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement attached to, or relating to, a note which provides for payment of interest on interest is void. The Loan Note Guarantee will not be enforceable by the lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the required security regardless of the time at which the Agency acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Any losses occasioned will not be enforceable by the lender to the extent that loan funds are used for purposes other than �441�those specifically approved by the Agency in its Conditional Commitment for Guarantee. Negligent servicing is defined as the failure to perform those services which a reasonably prudent lender would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The term includes not only the concept of a failure to act, but also not acting in a timely manner, acting in a manner contrary to the manner in which a reasonably prudent lender would act up to the time of loan maturity, or until a final loss is paid. The Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement in the hands of a holder shall not cover interest accruing 90 days after the holder has demanded repurchase by the lender, nor shall the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement in the hands of a holder cover interest accruing 90 days after the lender or Agency has requested the holder to surrender the evidence of debt for repurchase.


I80�1A3575.4
I89Conditions of guarantee.
I11A loan guarantee under this part will be evidenced by a Loan Note  Guarantee issued by the Agency. Each lender will also execute a Lender's  Agreement.
I11(a) The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and non-guaranteed portions of the loan. The non-guaranteed portion of the loan will not be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion.
I11(b) The lender will be responsible for servicing the entire loan and will remain mortgagee or secured party of record notwithstanding the fact that another party may hold a portion of the loan.
I11(c) When a guaranteed portion of a loan is sold to a holder, the holder shall have all rights of the lender under the Loan Note Guarantee to the extent of the portion purchased. The lender will remain bound by all the obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee, Lender's Agreement, and Agency program regulations. If the Agency makes a payment to a holder, then the lender must reimburse the Agency.
I11(d) A lender will receive all payments of principal and interest on the account of the entire loan and will promptly remit to each holder a pro rata share, less any lender servicing fee.
I11(e) The lender may retain all of the unguaranteed portion of the loan or may sell part of the unguaranteed portion of the loan through participation.  However, the lender is required to retain 5 percent of the loan amount from the unguaranteed portion in their portfolio.

I89Access to lender's records.
I11Upon request by the Agency, the lender will permit representatives of the Agency (or other agencies of the U.S. Department of Agriculture authorized by that Department or the U.S. Government) to inspect and make copies of any of the records of the lender pertaining to the guaranteed loans. Such inspection and copying may be made during regular office hours of the lender or at any other time the lender and the Agency agree upon.


I80�1A3575.9
I89Environmental requirements.
I11Requirements for an environmental review or mitigation actions are contained in part 1940, subpart G, of this title. The lender must assist the Agency to ensure that the lender's applicant complies with any mitigation measures required by the Agency's environmental review for the purpose of avoiding or reducing adverse environmental impacts of construction or operation of the facility financed with the guaranteed loan. This assistance includes ensuring that the lender's applicant is to take no actions (for example, initiation of construction) or incur any obligations with respect to their proposed undertaking that would either limit the range of alternatives to be considered during the Agency's environmental review process or which would have an adverse effect on the environment. If construction is started prior to completion of the environmental review and the Agency is deprived of its opportunity to fulfill its obligation to comply with applicable environmental requirements, the application for financial assistance may be denied. Satisfactory completion of the environmental review process must occur prior to �442�Agency approval of the applicant's request or any commitment of Agency resources.

I80�1A3575.12
I89Inspections.
I11The lender will notify the Agency of any scheduled field inspections during construction and after issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee. The Agency may attend such field inspections. Any inspections or review conducted by the Agency, including those with the lender, are for the benefit of the Agency only and not for the benefit of other parties of interest. Agency inspections do not relieve any parties of interest of their responsibilities to conduct necessary inspections.


I80�1A3575.13
I89Appeals.
I11Only the borrower, lender, or holder can appeal an Agency decision. In cases where the Agency has denied or reduced the amount of final loss payment to the lender, the adverse decision may be appealed only by the lender. A decision by a lender adverse to the interest of the borrower is not a decision by the Agency, whether or not concurred in by the Agency. Appeals will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the National Appeals Division, U.S. Department of Agriculture, published at 7 CFR part 11.

Requests for exceptions must be in writing by the State Director.

I89Eligibility.
I11(a) T3Availability of credit from other sources.G1T1 The Agency must determine that the borrower is unable to obtain the required credit without the loan guarantee from private, commercial, or cooperative sources at reasonable rates and terms for loans for similar purposes and periods of time. This determination shall become a part of the Agency casefile. The Agency must also determine if an outstanding judgment obtained by the United States in a Federal Court (other than the U.S. Tax Court) has been entered against the borrower or if the borrower has an outstanding delinquent debt with any Federal agency. Such judgment or delinquency shall cause the potential borrower to be ineligible to receive a loan guarantee until the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied or the delinquency is cured.
I11(b) T3Legal authority and responsibility.G1T1 (1) Each borrower must have, or will obtain, the legal authority necessary to construct, operate, and maintain the proposed facility and services. They must also have legal authority for obtaining security and repaying the proposed loan.
I11(2) The borrower shall be responsible for operating, maintaining, and managing the facility and services, and providing for the continued availability and use of the facility and services at reasonable rates and terms.
I11(i) These responsibilities must be exercised by the borrower even though the facility may be operated, maintained, or managed by a third party under contract, management agreement, or written lease.
I11(ii) Leases may only be used when this is the only feasible way to provide the service, is the customary practice to provide such service in the State, and must provide for the borrower's management control of the facility.
I11(iii) Contracts, management agreements, or leases must not contain options or other provisions for transfer of ownership.
I11(3) The lender is responsible for reviewing any contracts, management agreements, or leases to determine that they will not adversely impact the borrower's repayment ability or the security value of the guaranteed loan.
I11(c) T3Borrower.G1T1 (1) A public body such as a municipality, county, district, authority, or other political subdivision of a State located in a rural area.
�443�I11(2) An organization operated on a not-for-profit basis such as an association, cooperative, or private corporation. For-profit corporations operated as not-for-profit corporations are eligible borrowers as long as they operate as a not-for-profit corporation for the duration of their guaranteed loans. Single member corporations or corporations owned or substantially controlled by other corporations or associations are not eligible organizations. Before a loan is made to a borrower other than a public body, the articles of incorporation or the loan agreement will include a condition similar to the following:
Q04


I21If the corporation dissolves or ceases to perform the community facility objectives and functions, the board of directors shall distribute all business property and assets to one or more nonprofit corporations or public bodies. This distribution must be approved by 75 percent of the users or members and must serve the public welfare of the community. The assets may not be distributed to any members, directors, stockholders, or others having financial or managerial interest in the corporation. Nothing herein shall prohibit the corporation from paying its debts.

Q04
I11(3) A private nonprofit essential community facility (other than utilities) must have significant ties with the local rural community. Such ties are necessary to ensure to the greatest extent possible that a facility under private control will carry out a public purpose and continue to primarily serve rural areas. Ties may be evidenced by items such as:
I11(i) Association with, or controlled by, a local public body or bodies or broadly based ownership and controlled by members of the community.
I11(ii) Substantial public funding through taxes, revenue bonds, or other local government sources, or substantial voluntary community funding such as would be obtained through a community-wide funding campaign.
I11(4) Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations and other federally recognized Indian tribes.
I11(d) T3Facility location.G1T1 Facilities must be located in rural areas, except:
I11(1) For utility services such as natural gas or hydroelectric serving both rural and non-rural areas. In such cases, Agency funds may be used to finance only that portion serving rural areas, regardless of facility location.
I11(2) Telecommunication projects. The part of the facility located in a non-rural area must be necessary to provide the essential services to rural areas.
I11(e) T3Facilities for public use.G1T1 All facilities financed under the provisions of this subpart shall be for public purposes.
I11(1) Facilities will be installed to serve any user within the service area who desires service and can be feasibly and legally served.
I11(2) In no case will boundaries for the proposed service area be chosen in such a way that any user or area will be excluded because of race, color, religion, sex, marital status, age, disability, or national origin. This does not preclude:
I11(i) Financing or constructing projects in phases when it is not practical to finance or construct the entire project at one time, and
I11(ii) Financing or constructing facilities where it is not economically feasible to serve the entire area, provided economic feasibility is determined on the basis of the entire system or facility and not by considering the cost of separate extensions to, or parts thereof. Additionally, the borrower must publicly announce a plan for extending service to areas not initially receiving service. Also, the borrower must provide written notice to potential users located in the areas not to be initially served.
I11(3) The lender will determine that, when feasible and legally possible, inequities within the proposed project's service area for the same type service proposed (i.e., gas distribution system) will be remedied by the owner on, or before, completion of the project. Inequities are defined as unjustified variations in availability, adequacy, or quality of service. User rate schedules for portions of existing systems or facilities that were developed under different financing, rates, terms, or conditions do not necessarily constitute inequities.

I89Interest rates.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 Rates will be negotiated between the lender and the borrower.
I11They may be either fixed or variable rates. Interest rates will be those rates customarily charged borrowers in similar circumstances in the ordinary course of business and are subject to Agency review and approval.
I11(b) T3Variable rate publication.G1T1 A variable interest rate must be tied to a base rate published periodically in a recognized national or regional financial publication specifically agreed to by the lender and borrower. Such an agreement must be documented in the borrower or lender loan agreement.
I11(1) Interest rate caps and incremental adjustment limitations will also be negotiated between the lender and the borrower. Notice of any interest rate change proposed by the lender should allow a sufficient time period for the borrower to obtain any required State or other regulatory approval and to implement any user rate adjustments necessary as a result of the interest rate change. The intervals between interest rate adjustments will be specified in the loan agreement (but not more often than quarterly).
I11(2) The lender must incorporate within the variable rate note, the provision for adjustment of payments coincident with an interest rate adjustment. This will ensure the outstanding principal balance is properly amortized within the prescribed loan maturity and eliminate the possibility of a balloon payment at the end of the loan.
I11(c) T3Changes.G1T1 Any change in the interest rate between the date of issuance of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee and before the issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee must be approved by the Agency. Approval of such change will be shown as an amendment to the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee.
I11(d) T3Different rates on guaranteed and unguaranteed portion of the loan.G1T1 It is permissible to have one interest rate on the guaranteed portion of the loan and another interest rate on the unguaranteed portion of the loan, provided the lender and borrower agree, and:
I11(1) The rate on the unguaranteed portion does not exceed that currently being charged on loans for similar purposes to borrowers under similar circumstances; and,
I11(2) The rate on the guaranteed portion of the loan will not exceed the rate on the unguaranteed portion. This requirement does not apply when the unguaranteed rate is variable and the guaranteed portion is fixed.
I11(e) T3Multi-rates.G1T1 When multi-rates are used, the lender will provide the Agency with the overall effective interest rate for the entire loan. Multi-rate loans may be either fixed, variable, or a combination of fixed and variable. When a combination of fixed and variable interest rates are used, the interest rate for the unguaranteed portion will not be lower than the guaranteed portion of the loan.

I89Terms of loan repayment.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 Principal and interest on the loan will be due and payable as provided in the note except, any interest accrued as the result of the borrower's default on the guaranteed loan over and above that which would have accrued at the note rate on the guaranteed loan will not be guaranteed by the Agency. The lender will structure repayments as established in the loan agreement between the lender and borrower. Ordinarily, such installments will be scheduled for payment as agreed upon by the lender and borrower on terms that reasonably ensure repayment of the loan. However, the first installment to include a repayment of principal may be scheduled for payment after the project is operable and has begun to generate income. Such installment must be due and payable within 3 years from the date of the note and at least annually thereafter. Interest will be due at least annually from the date of the note. Monthly �448�payments will be required except for borrowers with income limited to less frequent intervals.
I11(b) T3Term length.G1T1 The maximum time allowable for final maturity for a guaranteed CP loan will be limited to the useful life of the facility, not to exceed 40 years.
I11(c) T3Balloon payments.G1T1 The principal balance should be properly amortized within the prescribed loan maturity. Balloon payments at the end of the loan are prohibited.

I89Economic feasibility requirements.
I11All projects financed under the provisions of this section must be based on taxes, assessments, revenues, fees, or other sources of revenues in an amount sufficient to provide for facility operation and maintenance, a reasonable reserve, and debt payment. Other sources of revenue or guarantors are particularly important in considering the feasibility of recreation-type loans. The lender is responsible for determining the credit quality and economic feasibility of the proposed loan and must address all elements of the credit quality in a written financial feasibility analysis which includes adequacy of equity, cash flow, security, history, and management capabilities. Financial feasibility reports must take into consideration any interest rate adjustment which may be instituted under the terms of the note. The lender's financial credit analysis may also serve as the feasibility analysis when sufficient evidence is included to determine economic feasibility as well as financial viability.
I11(a) T3Financial feasibility.G1T1 The borrower, lender, or other qualified entity must prepare the financial feasibility analysis (suggested financial feasibility guidelines are available in any Agency office) in the following instances:

I89Conditions precedent to issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee.
I11The Loan Note Guarantee will not be issued until:
I11(a) The lender certifies that:
I11(1) No changes have been made in the lender's loan conditions and requirements since the issuance of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee except those approved in the interim by the Agency in writing.
I11(2) All planned property acquisition has been completed and all development has been substantially completed in accordance with plans, specifications, and applicable building codes. No costs have exceeded the amounts approved by the lender and the Agency.
I11(3) Required insurance is in effect.
I11(4) All equal opportunity and Fair Housing Plan requirements have been met.
I11(5) The loan has been properly closed and the required security instruments have been obtained on any after-acquired property that cannot be covered initially under State statutory provisions.
I11(6) The borrower has marketable title to the collateral then owned by the borrower, subject to the instrument securing the loan to be guaranteed and subject to any other exceptions approved, in writing, by the Agency.
I11(7) When required, the entire amount of the loan for working capital has been disbursed except in cases where the Agency has approved disbursement over an extended time.
I11(8) All other requirements of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee have been met.
I11(9) Lien priorities are consistent with requirements of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee.
I11(10) The loan proceeds have been disbursed for purposes and in amounts consistent with the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee and as specified on the application for the guaranteed loan. A copy of a detailed statement by the lender detailing the use of loan funds will be attached to support this certification.
I11(11) There has been no substantive adverse change in the borrower's financial condition nor any other adverse change in the borrower during the period of time from the Agency's issuance of the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee to issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee. The lender's certification must address all adverse changes of the borrower and the guarantors. For purposes of this paragraph, the term borrower includes any parent, affiliate, or subsidiary of the borrower.
I11(12) All Federal, State, and local design and construction requirements have been met.
I11(13) The lender understands and will meet the requirements of the Debt Collection Act (chapter 37 of title 31 of the United States Code).
I11(14) The lender would not make the loan without an Agency guarantee.

I11(c) The lender has advised the Agency of plans to sell or assign any part of the loan as provided in the Lender's Agreement.
I11(d) Where applicable, the lender must certify that the borrower has obtained:
I11(1) A legal opinion relative to the title to rights-of-way and easements. Lenders are responsible for ensuring that borrowers have obtained valid, continuous, and adequate rights-of-way and easements needed for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a facility.
I11(2) A title opinion or title insurance showing ownership of the land and all mortgages or other lien defects, restrictions, or encumbrances, if any. It is the responsibility of the lender to ensure that the borrower has obtained and recorded such releases, consents, or subordinations to such property rights from holders of outstanding liens or other instruments as may be necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility �452�and to provide the required security. For example, when a site is for major structures for utility-type facilities (such as a gas distribution system) and the lender and borrower are able to obtain only a right-of-way or easement on such a site rather than a fee simple title, such a title opinion must be requested.
I11(e) For loans exceeding $150,000, the lender has certified its compliance with the Anti-Lobby Act (18 U.S.C. 1913). Also, if any funds have been, or will be, paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with this commitment providing for the United States to guarantee a loan, the lender shall completely disclose such lobbying activities in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 1352.

For loans to public bodies, lenders may require an opinion from recognized bond counsel regarding the adequacy of the preparation and issuance of the debt instruments. Only when the Agency is satisfied that all conditions for the guarantee have been met will the Loan Note Guarantee be executed.

The unguaranteed portion of the loan will not be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion of the loan. The lender is responsible for taking all servicing actions that a prudent lender would perform in servicing a portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed.

I11(i) Legal name and present address of either the lender or the holder who is requesting the replacement forms;
I11(ii) Legal name and address of the lender of record;

I11(2) An indemnity bond acceptable to the Agency shall accompany the request for replacement except when the holder is the United States, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Government corporation, a State or Territory, or the District of Columbia.
I11(3) All indemnity bonds must be issued and payable to the United States of America. The bond shall be in an amount not less than the unpaid principal and interest.

If a monetary default exceeds 60 days, the lender will arrange a meeting with the borrower to resolve the default. The lender will provide a summary of the meeting and any decisions or actions agreed upon.
I11(b) T3Servicing options.G1T1 In considering servicing options, the prospects for providing a permanent cure without adversely affecting the risks to the Agency and the lender must be the paramount objective. Temporary curative actions (such as payment deferments or collateral subordination) must strengthen the loan and be in the best financial interest of the lender and the Agency. Some of these actions may require concurrence of the holder.
I11(c) T3Multi-note.G1T1 If the loan was closed with the multi-note option, the lender may need to possess all notes to take some servicing actions. In those situations when the Agency is holder of some of the notes, the Agency may endorse the notes back to the lender, provided a proper receipt is received from the lender which defines the reason for the transfer. Under no circumstances will the Agency endorse the original Loan Note Guarantee to the lender.

I89Repurchase of loan.
I11(a) T3Repurchase by lender.G1T1 The lender has the option to repurchase the loan from a holder within 30 days of written demand from the holder when the borrower is in default not less than 60 days on payment. The repurchase will be for an amount equal to the unpaid guaranteed portion of principal and accrued interest less the lender's servicing fee. The guarantee does not cover the note interest to the holder on the guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the demand letter to the lender. The holder will concurrently send a copy of the demand to the Agency. The lender will accept an assignment without recourse from the holder upon repurchase. The lender is encouraged to repurchase the loan to facilitate the accounting of funds, resolve the problem, and permit the borrower to cure the default, where reasonable. �455�The lender will notify the holder and the Agency of its decision within 30 days of receipt of demand from the holder.
I11(b) T3Agency repurchase.G1T1 (1) If the lender does not repurchase as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency will purchase from the holder the unpaid principal balance of the guaranteed portion together with accrued interest to date of repurchase (less the lender's servicing fee) within 30 days after written demand to the Agency. The guarantee will not cover the note interest to the holder on the guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the original demand letter. The lender shall not charge the Agency any servicing fees nor are any such fees collectible from the Agency.
I11(2) The holder's demand to the Agency must include a copy of the written demand made upon the lender. The holder or duly authorized agent must also include evidence of the right to require payment from the Agency. Such evidence will consist of either the original of the Loan Note Guarantee properly endorsed to the Agency or the original of the Assignment Guarantee Agreement properly assigned to the Agency without recourse including all rights, title, and interest in the loan. The Agency will be subrogated to all rights of the holder. The holder must include in the demand the amount due including unpaid principal, unpaid interest to date of demand, and interest subsequently accruing from the date of demand to the proposed payment date. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Agency, such proposed payment will not be later than 30 days from the date of demand.
I11(3) The lender must promptly provide the Agency with the information necessary for the Agency's determination of the appropriate amount due the holder upon the Agency's notification to the lender of the holder's demand for payment. This information must be certified by an authorized officer of the lender. Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the holder and the information submitted by the lender must be resolved before payment will be approved. The Agency will notify both parties and such conflict will suspend the running of the 30-day payment requirement.
I11(4) Any purchase by the Agency does not change, alter, or modify any of the lender's obligations to the Agency arising from the loan or guarantee nor does it waive any of the Agency's rights against the lender. The Agency may set off against the lender all rights inuring to the Agency as the holder of the instrument against the Agency's obligation to the lender under the Loan Note Guarantee.
I11(c) T3Repurchase for servicing.G1T1 When the lender determines that repurchase of the guaranteed portion of the loan is necessary to service the loan, the holder must sell the guaranteed portion to the lender for the unpaid principal and interest balance (less the lender's servicing fee). The guarantee does not cover interest accruing after 90 days from the date the lender's or Agency's letter requesting the holder to tender its guaranteed portion. The lender must not repurchase from the holder for arbitrage purposes to further its own financial gain. Any repurchase must be made only after the lender obtains the Agency written approval. If the lender does not repurchase the portion from the holder, the Agency may, at its option, purchase such guaranteed portion for servicing purposes.

I89Interest rate changes after loan closing.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 Subject to the restrictions below, the borrower, lender, and holder (if any) may collectively effect a permanent reduction in the interest rate on the guaranteed loan at any time during the life of the loan on written agreement by all of the applicable parties. After such a permanent reduction, the Loan Note Guarantee will only cover losses of interest at the reduced interest rate. The Agency must be notified by the lender, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the change. When the Agency is a holder, it will concur only when it is demonstrated that the change is more viable than liquidation and that the Government's financial interests are not adversely affected. Factors which will be considered in making such determination are �456�the Government's cost of borrowing money and the project's enhancement of rural development. The monetary recovery must be greater than the liquidation recovery, and a financial feasibility analysis must show the project's continued viability.
I11(1) Fixed rates cannot be changed to variable rates to reduce the interest rate to the borrower unless the variable rate has a ceiling which is less than the original fixed rate.
I11(2) Variable rates can be changed to a lower fixed rate. In a final loss settlement when qualifying rate changes are made with the required written agreements and notification, the interest will be calculated for the periods the given rates were in effect. The lender must maintain records which adequately document the accrued interest claimed.
I11(3) The lender is responsible for the legal documentation of interest rate changes. However, the lender may not issue a new note.
I11(b) T3Increases.G1T1 No increases in interest rates will be permitted under the loan guarantee except the normal fluctuations in approved variable interest rate loans.


I80�1A3575.81
I89Liquidation.
I11Liquidation will occur when the lender concludes that liquidation of the guaranteed loan is necessary because of default or third party actions that the borrower cannot, or will not, cure or eliminate within a reasonable period of time and the Agency concurs with the lender; or the Agency, at any time, independently concludes that liquidation is necessary. The lender will proceed as expeditiously as possible, including giving any notices or taking any legal actions required by the security instruments.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 If a lender has made a loan guaranteed by the Agency under previous regulations, the lender has the option to liquidate the loan under the provisions of this subpart or under the provisions of previous regulations. The lender will notify the Agency in writing within 10 days after its decision to liquidate, which regulatory provisions it chooses to use. The lender may not choose some provisions of one regulation and other provisions of the other regulation.
I11(b) T3Acquiring property titles.G1T1 If a lender acquires title to property, the Agency may elect to permit the lender the option of calculating the final loss settlement using the net proceeds received at the time of the ultimate disposition of the property. The lender must submit to the Agency a written request to use this option within 15 days of acquiring title and the Agency must agree, in writing, prior to the lender submitting any request for estimated loss payment.
I11(c) T3Liquidation plan.G1T1 The lender will (within 30 days after a decision to liquidate) submit to the Agency, in writing, a proposed, detailed liquidation plan. Upon approval by the Agency of the liquidation plan, the lender will commence liquidation. The lender's liquidation plan must include, but is not limited to, the following:
I11(1) Such proof as the Agency requires to establish the lender's ownership of the guaranteed loan notes and related security instruments, a copy of the payment ledger or other documentation which reflects the outstanding loan balance and accrued interest to date, and the method of computing the interest;
I11(2) A complete list of collateral;
I11(3) The recommended liquidation methods for making the maximum collection possible on the indebtedness and the justification for such methods, including the recommended action for acquiring and disposing of all collateral;
I11(4) Necessary steps for preservation of the collateral;
I11(5) Copies of the borrower's latest available financial statements;
I11(6) An itemized list of estimated liquidation expenses expected to be incurred and justification for each expense;
I11(7) A schedule to periodically report to the Agency on the progress of the liquidation;
I11(8) Estimated protective advance amounts with justification;
I11(9) Proposed protective bid amounts on collateral to be sold at auction and a discussion of how the amounts were determined;
�457�I11(10) If a voluntary conveyance is considered, the proposed amount to be credited to the guaranteed debt;
I11(11) Legal opinions, as needed; and
I11(12) If the outstanding balance of principal and interest is less than $250,000, the lender will obtain an estimate of fair market and potential liquidation value of the collateral. If the outstanding balance of principal and interest is $250,000 or more, the lender will obtain an independent appraisal report on all collateral securing the loan which will reflect the fair market value and potential liquidation value. The independent appraiser's fee will be shared equally by the Agency and the lender.
I11(d) T3Partial liquidation plan.G1T1 If actions are necessary to immediately preserve and protect the collateral, a partial liquidation plan may be submitted and, when approved, must be followed by a complete liquidation plan prepared by the lender.
I11(e) T3Disposition of collateral.G1T1 Disposition of collateral acquired by the lender must be approved, in writing, by the Agency when:
I11(1) The lender's cost to acquire the collateral of a borrower exceeds the potential recovery value of the security and the lender proposes abandoning the collateral in lieu of liquidation; or
I11(2) The acquired collateral is to be sold to the borrower, borrower's stockholders or officers, or the lender or lender's stockholders or officers.
I11(f) T3Agency liquidation.G1T1 The Agency will liquidate at its option only when it is a holder and there is reason to believe the lender is not likely to initiate liquidation efforts that will result in maximum recovery. When the Agency liquidates, reasonable liquidation expenses will be assessed against the proceeds derived from the sale of the collateral.
I11(g) T3Final loss payment.G1T1 Final loss payments will be made only after all collateral has been properly accounted for and liquidation expenses are determined to be reasonable and within approved limits. Any estimated loss payments made to the lender will be credited against the final loss on the guaranteed loan. The amount of an estimated loss payment must be credited as a deduction from the principal balance of the loan.

I80�1A3575.83
I89Protective advances.
I11Protective advances can only be added to the loan account for purposes of requirements to preserve the value of the security. Protective advances constitute an indebtedness of the borrower to the lender and must be secured by collateral to the same extent as principal and interest. Protective advances include, but are not limited to, advances made for taxes, annual assessments, ground rent, hazard and flood insurance premiums affecting the collateral (including any other expenses necessary to protect the collateral). Attorney fees are not a protective advance.
I11(a) T3Agency approval.G1T1 The Agency must approve, in writing, all protective advances on loans within its loan approval authority which exceed a total cumulative advance amount of $5,000 to the same borrower. Protective advances must be reasonable when associated with the value of the collateral being preserved.
I11(b) T3Preserving collateral.G1T1 When considering protective advances, sound judgment must be exercised in determining that the additional funds advanced will actually preserve collateral and recovery is actually enhanced by making the advance.


I80�1A3575.84
I89Additional loans or advances.
I11The lender will not make additional expenditures or new loans to the borrower without first obtaining the written approval of the Agency even though such expenditures or loans will not be guaranteed.

I89Bankruptcy.
I11(a) T3Calculating losses.G1T1 Report of Loss form (available in any Agency office) will be used for calculating estimated and final loss determinations.
I11(b) T3Lender responsibility.G1T1 The lender is responsible for protecting the guaranteed loan debt and all the collateral securing it in bankruptcy proceedings. These responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:
�458�I11(1) Filing a proof of claim, where necessary, and all necessary papers and pleadings;
I11(2) Attending and, where necessary, participating in meetings of the creditors and all court proceedings;
I11(3) Immediately seeking adequate protection of the collateral if it is subject to being used by the trustee in bankruptcy or the debtor in possession;
I11(4) Where appropriate, seeking involuntary conversion of a pending chapter 11 case to a liquidation proceeding or seeking dismissal of the proceedings; and
I11(5) Keeping the Agency adequately and regularly informed, in writing, of all aspects of the proceedings.
I11(c) T3Appraisals.G1T1 In a chapter 9 or chapter 11 reorganization, the lender must obtain an independent appraisal of the collateral if the Agency believes an independent appraisal is necessary. The Agency and the lender will share the appraisal fee equally.
I11(d) T3Liquidation expenses.G1T1 Only expenses authorized by the court of chapter 11 reorganizations, or chapters 11 or 7 liquidation (unless the liquidation is by the lender), may be deducted from the collateral proceeds.
I11(e) T3Repurchase from the holder.G1T1 The Agency or the lender, with the approval of the Agency, may initiate the repurchase of the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan from the holder. If the lender is the holder, an estimated loss payment may be filed at the initiation of a chapter 7 proceeding or after a chapter 11 proceeding becomes a liquidation proceeding. Any loss payment on loans in bankruptcy must be approved by the Agency.
I11(f) T3Chapter 11 bankruptcy.G1T1 If a borrower has filed for protection under chapter 11 of the United States Code for a reorganization (but not chapter 13) and all or a portion of the debt has been discharged, the lender may request an estimated loss payment of the guaranteed portion of the accrued interest and principal discharged by the court. If the court approves revisions to the chapter 11 reorganization plan, subsequent estimated loss payments may be requested in accordance with the court approved changes. Once the reorganization plan has been satisfactorily completed, the lender is responsible for submitting the documentation necessary for the Agency to review and adjust the estimated loss claim to reflect any actual discharge of principal and interest and to reimburse the lender for any court ordered interest-rate reduction under the terms of the reorganization plan.
I11(g) T3Agency approval of estimated liquidation expenses.G1T1 The Agency must approve, in advance and in writing, the lender's estimated liquidation expenses of collateral in a liquidation if the liquidation is performed by the lender. These expenses must be reasonable and customary and not include in-house expenses of the lender.
I11(h) T3Reconciliation.G1T1 In the event that the estimated loss payment exceeds the actual loss, the lender will reimburse the Agency the amount in excess of the actual loss plus interest at the note rate from the date of the estimated loss payment.

I89Transfers and assumptions.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 For all transfers and assumptions, the lender must concur in the plans for disposition of funds in the transferor's debt service, reserve, and operation and maintenance account. The Agency will approve, in writing, transfers and assumptions of loans to transferees who will continue the original purpose of the guaranteed loan subject to the following applicable provisions:
I11(1) When the transaction is to a member of the borrower's organization, it will be at an amount which will not result in a loss to the lender.
I11(2) Transfers to eligible borrowers will receive preference if recovery to the lender from the sale price is not less than it would be if the transfer was to an ineligible borrower.
I11(3) The present borrower is unable or unwilling to accomplish the objectives of the guaranteed loan, and the transfer will be to the lender's and Agency's advantage.
I11(4) The transferee will assume an amount at least equal to either the present market value or the debt, whichever is less.
�459�I11(b) T3Transfers to an eligible borrower.G1T1 (1) The total indebtedness may be transferred to an eligible borrower on the same terms.
I11(2) The total indebtedness may be transferred to another eligible borrower on different terms not to exceed those terms for which an initial guaranteed loan can be made.
I11(3) Less than the total indebtedness may be transferred to another eligible borrower on the same or different terms and the pro rata share of any eligible loss paid to the lender.
I11(4) A guaranteed loan for which the transferee is eligible may be made in connection with a transfer subject to the policies and procedures governing the type of loan being made.
I11(5) If the transferor is to receive a payment for the equity, the total debt must be assumed.
I11(c) T3Ineligible borrower.G1T1 Transfers to ineligible borrowers are considered only when needed as a method for servicing problem cases when an eligible transferee is not available. Transfers should not be considered as a means by which members can obtain equity or as a method of providing a source of easy credit for purchasers. Transfers must meet the following requirements:
I11(1) All transfers to ineligible borrowers will include a one-time nonrefundable transfer fee to the Agency of no more than one percent. Transfer fees will be collected, and payments applied, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
I11(2) For all loans covered by this subpart, the Agency may approve a transfer of indebtedness to, and assumption of, a loan by a transferee who does not meet the eligibility requirements for the kind of loan being assumed when the ineligible borrower will:
I11(i) Make a significant down payment, and
I11(ii) Agree to pay the remaining balance within not more than 15 years. Installments will be at least equal to the amount amortized over a period not greater than the remaining life of the debt being transferred, and the balance will be due the fifteenth year.
I11(3) Interest rates to ineligible transferees will be the rate specified in the note of the transferor or the rates customarily charged borrowers in similar circumstances in the ordinary course of business and are subject to Agency review and approval. The rates may be either fixed or variable.
I11(i) Transferees must have the ability to repay as determined by the lender the debt according to the Assumption Agreement and must have the legal authority to enter into the contract. The transferee will submit a current balance sheet to the lender. The lender will obtain and analyze the credit history of the transferee.
I11(ii) The transferor may receive equity payments only when the full amount of the debt is assumed. However, equity payments will not be made on more favorable terms than those on which the balance of the debt will be paid.
I11(d) T3Transfer fees.G1T1 Transfer fees are a one-time nonrefundable cost to be collected by the lender at the time of application or proposal.
I11(1) The transfer fees will be a standard fee plus the cost of the appraisal.
I11(2) The lender will collect and submit the fee to the Agency.
I11(3) The Agency may waive the transfer fee if it determines that such waiver is in the best interest of the Agency.
I11(e) T3Processing transfers and assumptions.G1T1 (1) In any transfer and assumption case, the transferor (including any guarantor) may be released from liability by the lender only with prior Agency written concurrence and only when the value of the collateral being transferred is at least equal to the amount of the loan, or part of the loan, being assumed. If the transfer is for less than the entire debt:
I11(i) The Agency must determine that the transferor and any guarantor have no reasonable debt-paying ability considering their assets and income at the time of transfer, and
I11(ii) The lender must certify that the transferor has cooperated in good faith, used due diligence to maintain the collateral against loss, and has otherwise fulfilled all of the regulations of this subpart to the best of the borrower's ability.
I11(2) The lender will make, in all cases, a complete credit analysis to determine viability of the project (subject to the Agency review and approval) including any requirement for deposit in �460�an escrow account as security to meet the determined equity requirements for the project.
I11(3) The lender will confirm that the transaction can be properly transferred and the conveyance instruments will be filed, registered, or recorded as appropriate and legally permissible.
I11(4) The assumption will be made on the lender's form of Assumption Agreement and will contain the Agency case number of the transferor and transferee.
I11(5) Loan terms cannot be changed by the Assumption Agreement unless previously approved in writing by the Agency with the concurrence of holder and the transferor (including guarantor if it has not been released from personal liability). Any new loan terms cannot exceed those authorized in this subpart. The lender's request will be supported by:
I11(i) An explanation of the reasons for the proposed change in the loan terms, and
I11(ii) Certification that the lien position securing the guaranteed loan will be maintained or improved, and proper hazard insurance will be continued in effect.
I11(6) In the case of a transfer and assumption, it is the lender's responsibility to see that all such transfers and assumptions will be noted on all originals of the Loan Note Guarantee. The lender will provide the Agency a copy of the Transfer and Assumption Agreement.
I11(7) If a loss should occur upon a complete transfer of assets and assumption for less than the full amount of the debt and the transferor-debtor (including personal guarantor) is released from personal liability (as provided in paragraph (e) of this section), the lender (if holding the guaranteed portion) may file an estimated Report of Loss to recover their pro rata share of the actual loss at that time. Approved protective advances and accrued interest made during the arrangement of a transfer and assumption, if not assumed by the transferee, will be entered on the estimated Report of Loss.

I89Mergers.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 The Agency may approve mergers or consolidations (herein referred to as ``mergers'') when the resulting organization will be eligible for an Agency guaranteed loan and assumes all the liabilities and acquires all the assets of the merged borrower. Mergers may be approved when:
I11(1) The merger is in the best interest of the Government and the merging borrower;
I11(2) The resulting borrower can meet all required conditions as contained in specific loan note agreements; and
I11(3) All property can be legally transferred to the resulting borrower.
I11(b) T3Distinguishing mergers from transfers and assumptions.G1T1 Mergers occur when one entity combines with another entity in such a way that the first entity ceases to exist as a separate entity while the other continues. In a consolidation, two or more entities combine to form a new, consolidated entity with the original entity ceasing to exist. Such transactions must be distinguished from transfers and assumptions in which a transferor will not necessarily go out of existence, and the transferee will not always take all the transferor's assets nor assume all the transferor's liabilities.


I80�1A3575.90
I89Disposition of acquired property.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 When the lender acquires title to the collateral and the final loss claim is not paid until final disposition, the lender must proceed as quickly as possible to develop a plan to fully protect the collateral, and the lender must dispose of the collateral without delay.
I11(b) T3Re-title collateral.G1T1 Any collateral accepted by the lender T3must notG1T1 be titled in the Agency's name in whole or in part. The Agency's position is that of a guarantor relating to losses, not a lender.
I11(c) T3Collateral preservation.G1T1 After acquiring the collateral, the lender must protect the collateral from deterioration (weather, vandalism, etc.). Hazard insurance in an amount necessary to cover the fair market value of the collateral must be maintained.
I11(d) T3Collateral sale.G1T1 (1) The lender will prepare and submit to the Agency a plan on the best method of sale, keeping in mind any prospective purchasers. The Agency must approve the �461�plan in writing. If an existing approved liquidation plan addresses the disposition of acquired property, no further review is required unless modification of the plan is needed.
I11(2) Anytime there is a case when the conversion of collateral to cash can reasonably be expected to result in a negative net recovery amount, abandonment of the collateral should be considered. The Agency must approve abandonment in writing.

I89Determination and payment of loss.
I11In all liquidation cases, final settlement will be made with the lender after the collateral is liquidated. The Agency will have the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from any liable party.
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 If the lender takes title to collateral, any loss will be based on the collateral value at the time the lender obtains title.
I11(b) T3Loss calculations.G1T1 The Report of Loss form (available in any Agency office) will be used for calculations of all estimated and final loss determinations. Estimated loss payments may only be approved after the lender has submitted a liquidation plan approved by the Agency.
I11(c) T3Estimated loss payments.G1T1 When the lender is conducting the liquidation and owns any of the guaranteed portion of the loan, it may request an estimated loss payment by submitting an estimate of loss that will occur in connection with liquidation of the loan. An estimated loss payment may be approved after the Agency has approved the liquidation plan.
I11(1) The lender will prepare and submit a Report of Loss using the appraised value in lieu of amount received from sale of collateral.
I11(2) The estimated loss payment shall be calculated as of the date of such payment. The total amount of the loss payment remitted by the Agency will be applied by the lender on the guaranteed portion of the loan debt. Such application does not release the borrower from liability. At the time of final loss settlement, the lender may notify the borrower that the loss payment has been so applied.
I11(3) After liquidation has been completed, a final Report of Loss will be submitted by the lender to the Agency.
I11(d) T3Final report of loss.G1T1 In all cases, a final Report of Loss must be submitted to the Agency. Before Agency approval of any final loss report, the lender must account for all funds obtained, disposition of the collateral, all costs incurred, and any other information necessary for the successful completion of liquidation. Upon receipt of the final accounting and Report of Loss, the Agency may conduct an may audit and will determine the final loss. The lender will make its records available to, and otherwise assist, the Agency in making any audit it requires of the Report of Loss. The documentation accompanying the Report of Loss must support the loss claimed.
I11(1) The lender must document and show that all of the collateral has been accounted for and properly liquidated and that liquidation proceeds have been properly accounted for and applied correctly on the loan. The Agency must be satisfied that the lender has accomplished this in the manner contained herein and that the lender has maximized the collections in conducting the liquidation.
I11(2) The lender must show a breakdown on any protective advance amount as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, evidence that the amount expended was proper, and that the amount was actually paid.
I11(3) The lender must show a breakdown of liquidation expenses as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, evidence that the amount expended was proper, and that the amount was actually paid.
I11(4) Accrued interest should be supported by attachments showing how the amount was accrued by the lender. A copy of the promissory note and ledger will be attached. If the interest rate was a variable rate, the lender must include documentation of changes in the selected base rate and when the changes in the loan rate became effective.
I11(e) T3Liquidation income.G1T1 Any net rental or other income that has been received �462�by the lender from the collateral will be applied on the guaranteed loan debt.
I11(f) T3Liquidation costs.G1T1 Certain reasonable liquidation costs will be allowed during the liquidation process. The liquidation costs must be submitted as a part of the liquidation plan. Such costs will be deducted from gross proceeds received from the disposition of collateral unless the costs have been previously determined by the lender (with Agency concurrence) to be protective advances. If changed circumstances after submission of the liquidation plan require a revision of liquidation costs, the lender will obtain the Agency's written concurrence prior to proceeding with the proposed changes. No in-house expenses of the lender will be allowed.
I11(g) T3Protective advance losses.G1T1 In those instances where the lender made authorized protective advances, the lender may claim recovery for the guaranteed portion of any loss of monies advanced as well as interest resulting from such protective advances. These claims shall be included in the final Report of Loss.
I11(h) T3Final loss approval.G1T1 After the final Report of Loss has been tentatively approved:
I11(1) If the actual loss is greater than any estimated loss payment, such loss will be paid by the Agency;
I11(2) If the actual loss is less than any estimated loss payment, the lender will reimburse the Agency;
I11(3) If the Agency conducted the liquidation, it will provide an accounting to the lender and will pay the lender in accordance with the Loan Note Guarantee.
I11(i) T3Loss limits.G1T1 The amount payable by the Agency to the lender cannot exceed the limits contained in the Loan Note Guarantee. If the Agency conducts the liquidation, loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered by the guarantee only to the date the Agency accepts this responsibility. When the liquidation is conducted by the lender, loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered to the extent of the guarantee to the date of final settlement provided the lender proceeds expeditiously with the liquidation plan approved by the Agency.


I80�1A3575.95
I89Future recovery.
I11After a loan has been liquidated and a final loss has been paid by the Agency, any future funds which may be recovered by the lender will be pro-rated between the Agency and the lender in accordance with the guaranteed percentage even if the Loan Note Guarantee has been terminated.


I80�1A3575.96
I89Termination of Loan Note Guarantee.
I11The Loan Note Guarantee under this subpart will terminate automatically:
I11(a) Upon full payment of the guaranteed loan; or
I11(b) Upon full payment of any loss obligation or negotiated loss settlement except for future recovery provisions; or
I11(c) Upon written request from the lender to the Agency, provided that the lender holds all of the guaranteed portion and the original Loan Note Guarantee is returned to the Agency.

I11(ii) Refinancing debts may be allowed only when it is determined by the intermediary that the project is viable and refinancing is necessary to create new or save existing jobs or create or continue a needed service; and
I11(iii) On any request for refinancing of existing secured loans, the intermediary is required, at a minimum, to obtain the previously held collateral as security for the loans and must not pay off a creditor in excess of the value of the collateral.

I11(iii) All revolving lines of credit will be approved by the intermediary for a specific maximum amount and for a specific maximum time period, not to exceed two years;
I11(iv) The intermediary will provide a detailed description, which will be incorporated into the intermediary's work plan and be subject to Agency approval, of how the revolving lines of credit will be operated and managed. The description will include evidence that the intermediary has an adequate system for:
I11(A) Interest calculations on varying balances, and
I11(B) Monitoring and control of the ultimate recipients' cash, inventory, and accounts receivable; and
I11(v) If, at any time, the Agency determines that an intermediary's operation of revolving lines of credit is causing excessive risk of loss for the intermediary or the Government, the Agency may terminate the intermediary's authority to use the IRP revolving fund for revolving lines of credit. Such termination will be by written notice and will prevent the intermediary from approving any new lines of credit or extending any existing revolving lines of credit beyond the effective date of termination contained in the notice.

I89Loan terms.
I11(a) No loan to an intermediary shall be extended for a period exceeding 30 years. Interest and principal payments will be scheduled at least annually. The initial principal payment may be deferred (during the period before the facility becomes income producing) by the Agency, but not more than 3 years.
I11(b) Loans made by an intermediary to an ultimate recipient from the IRP revolving fund will be scheduled for repayment over a term negotiated by the intermediary and ultimate recipient.

I89Interest rates.
I11(a) Loans made by the Agency pursuant to this subpart shall bear interest at a fixed rate of 1 percent per annum over the term of the loan.
I11(b) Interest rates charged by intermediaries to ultimate recipients on loans from the IRP revolving fund shall be negotiated by the intermediary and ultimate recipient. The rate must be within limits established by the intermediary's work plan approved by the Agency. The rate should normally be the lowest rate sufficient to cover the loan's proportional share of the IRP revolving fund's debt service costs, reserve for bad debts, and administrative costs.


I80�1A4274.326
I89Security.
I11(a) T3Intermediaries.G1T1 Security for all loans to intermediaries must be such that the repayment of the loan is reasonably assured, when considered along with the intermediary's financial condition, work plan, and management ability. It is the responsibility of the intermediary to make loans to ultimate recipients in such a manner that will fully protect the interests of the intermediary and the Government.
I11(1) Security for such loans may include, but is not limited to:
I11(i) Any realty, personalty, or intangible capable of being mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise encumbered by the intermediary in favor of the Agency; and
I11(ii) Any realty, personalty, or intangible capable of being mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise encumbered by an ultimate recipient in favor of the Agency.
I11(2) Initial security will consist of a pledge by the intermediary of all assets now in or hereafter placed in the IRP revolving fund, including cash and investments, notes receivable from ultimate recipients, and the intermediary's security interest in collateral pledged by ultimate recipients. Except for good cause shown, the Agency will not obtain assignments of specific assets at the time a loan is made to an intermediary or ultimate recipient. The intermediary will covenant that, in the event the intermediary's financial condition deteriorates or the intermediary takes action detrimental to prudent fund operation or fails to take action required of a prudent lender, the intermediary will provide additional security, execute any additional documents, and undertake any reasonable acts the Agency may request to protect the Agency's interest or to perfect a security interest in any asset, including physical delivery of assets and specific assignments to the Agency. All debt instruments and collateral documents used by an intermediary in connection with loans to ultimate recipients must be assignable.

I11(b) T3Ultimate recipients.G1T1 Security for a loan from an intermediary's IRP revolving fund to an ultimate recipient will be negotiated between the intermediary and ultimate recipient, within the general security policies established by the intermediary and approved by the Agency.

I89Loan limits.
I11(a) T3Intermediary.G1T1 (1) No loan to an intermediary will exceed the maximum amount the intermediary can reasonably be expected to lend to eligible ultimate recipients, in an effective and �489�sound manner, within 1 year after loan closing.
I11(2) The initial Agency IRP loan as defined in �1A4274.302(a) will not exceed $2 million.
I11(3) Intermediaries that have received one or more IRP loans may apply for and be considered for subsequent IRP loans provided:
I11(i) At least 80 percent of the Agency IRP loan funds approved for the intermediary have been disbursed to eligible ultimate recipients;
I11(ii) The intermediary is promptly relending all collections from loans made from its IRP revolving fund in excess of what is needed for required debt service, reasonable administrative costs approved by the Agency, and a reasonable reserve for debt service and uncollectable accounts;
I11(iii) The outstanding loans of the intermediary's IRP revolving fund are generally sound; and
I11(iv) The intermediary is in compliance with all applicable regulations and its loan agreements with the Agency.
I11(4) Subsequent loans will not exceed $1 million each and not more than one loan will be approved for an intermediary in any one fiscal year.
I11(5) Total outstanding IRP indebtedness of an intermediary to the Agency will not exceed $15 million at any time.
I11(b) T3Ultimate recipients.G1T1 Loans from intermediaries to ultimate recipients using the IRP revolving fund must not exceed the lesser of:
I11(1) $250,000; or
I11(2) Seventy five percent of the total cost of the ultimate recipient's project for which the loan is being made.
I11(c) T3Portfolio.G1T1 No more than 25 percent of an IRP loan approved may be used for loans to ultimate recipients that exceed $150,000. This limit does not apply to revolved funds.


I80�1A4274.332
I89Post award requirements.
I11(a) T3Applicability.G1T1 Intermediaries receiving loans under this program shall be governed by these regulations, the loan agreement, the approved work plan, security interests, and any other conditions which the Agency may impose in making a loan. Whenever this subpart imposes a requirement on loans made from the ``IRP revolving fund,'' such requirement shall apply to all loans made by an intermediary to an ultimate recipient from the intermediary's IRP revolving fund for as long as any portion of the intermediary's IRP loan from the Agency remains unpaid. Whenever this subpart imposes a requirement on loans made by intermediaries from ``Agency IRP loan funds,'' without specific reference to the IRP revolving fund, such requirement shall apply only to loans made by an intermediary using Agency IRP loan funds, and will not apply to loans made from revolved funds.
I11(b) T3Maintenance of IRP revolving fund.G1T1 For as long as any part of an IRP loan to an intermediary remains unpaid, the intermediary must maintain the IRP revolving fund. All Agency IRP loan funds received by an intermediary must be deposited into an IRP revolving fund. The intermediary may transfer additional assets into the IRP revolving fund. All cash of the IRP revolving fund shall be deposited in a separate bank account or accounts. No other funds of the intermediary will be commingled with such money. All moneys deposited in such bank account or accounts shall be money of the IRP revolving fund. Loans to ultimate recipients are advanced from the IRP revolving fund. The receivables created by making loans to ultimate recipients, the intermediary's security interest in collateral pledged by ultimate recipients, collections on the receivables, interest, fees, and any other income or assets derived from the operation of the IRP revolving fund are a part of the IRP revolving fund.
I11(1) The portion of the IRP revolving fund that consists of Agency IRP loan funds, on a last-in-first-out basis, may only be used for making loans in accordance with �1A4274.314 of this subpart. The portion of the IRP revolving fund which consists of revolved funds may be used for debt service, reasonable administrative costs, or reserves in accordance with this section, or for making additional loans.
I11(2) The intermediary must submit an annual budget of proposed administrative costs for Agency approval. The amount removed from the IRP revolving fund for administrative costs in �490�any year must be reasonable, must not exceed the actual cost of operating the IRP revolving fund, including loan servicing and providing technical assistance, and must not exceed the amount approved by the Agency in the intermediary's annual budget.
I11(3) A reasonable amount of revolved funds must be used to create a reserve for bad debts. Reserves must be accumulated over a period of years. The total amount should not exceed maximum expected losses, considering the quality of the intermediary's portfolio of loans. Unless the intermediary provides loss and delinquency records that, in the opinion of the Agency, justifies different amounts, a reserve for bad debts of 6 percent of outstanding loans must be accumulated over 3 years and then maintained.
I11(4) Any cash in the IRP revolving fund from any source that is not needed for debt service, approved administrative costs, or reasonable reserves must be available for additional loans to ultimate recipients.
I11(5) All reserves and other cash in the IRP revolving loan fund not immediately needed for loans to ultimate recipients or other authorized uses will be deposited in accounts in banks or other financial institutions. Such accounts will be fully covered by Federal deposit insurance or fully collateralized with U.S. Government obligations, and must be interest bearing. Any interest earned thereon remains a part of the IRP revolving fund.
I11(6) If an intermediary receives more than one IRP loan, it need not establish and maintain a separate IRP revolving loan fund for each loan; it may combine them and maintain only one IRP revolving fund, unless the Agency requires separate IRP revolving funds because there are significant differences in the loan purposes, work plans, loan agreements, or requirements for the loans. The Agency may allow loans with different requirements to be combined into one IRP revolving fund if the intermediary agrees in writing to operate the combined revolving funds in accordance with the most stringent requirements as required by the Agency.

I89Other regulatory requirements.
I11(a) T3Intergovernmental consultation.G1T1 The IRP is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. The approval of a loan to an intermediary will be the subject of intergovernmental consultation. For each ultimate recipient to be assisted with a loan from Agency IRP loan funds and for which the State in which the ultimate recipient is to be located has elected to review the program under their intergovernmental review process, the State Single Point of Contact must be notified. Notification, in the form of a project description, must be initiated by the intermediary or the ultimate recipient. Any comments from the State must be included with the intermediary's request to use the Agency loan funds for the ultimate recipient. Prior to the Agency's decision on the request, compliance with the requirements of intergovernmental consultation must be demonstrated for each ultimate recipient. (See RD Instruction 1940-J (available in any Rural Development State Office)).
I11(b) T3Environmental requirements.G1T1 (1) Unless specifically modified by this section, the requirements of part 1940, subpart G, of this title apply to this subpart. Intermediaries and ultimate recipients must consider the potential environmental impacts of their projects at the earliest planning stages and develop plans to minimize the potential to adversely impact the environment. Both the intermediaries and the ultimate recipients must cooperate and furnish such information and assistance as the Agency needs to make any of its environmental determinations.
I11(2) For each application for a loan to an intermediary, the Agency will review the application, supporting materials, and any environmental information required from the intermediary and complete a Class II environmental assessment. This assessment will focus on the potential cumulative impacts of the projects as well as any environmental concerns or problems that are associated with individual projects �491�that can be identified at this time. Neither the completion of the environmental assessment nor the approval of the application is an Agency commitment to the use of loan funds for a specific project; therefore, no public notification requirements for a Class II assessment will apply to the application.
I11(3) For each proposed loan from an intermediary to an ultimate recipient using Agency IRP loan funds, the Agency will complete the environmental review required by part 1940, subpart G, of this title including public notification requirements. The results of this review will be used by the Agency in making its decision on concurrence in the proposed loan. The Agency will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for any application for a loan from Agency IRP loan funds determined to have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.
I11(c) T3Equal opportunity and nondiscrimination requirements.G1T1 (1) In accordance with title V of Pub. L. 93�09495, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for Federally Conducted Programs and Activities, neither the intermediary nor the Agency will discriminate against any employee, intermediary, or proposed ultimate recipient on the basis of sex, marital status, race, color, religion, national origin, age, physical or mental disability (provided the proposed intermediary or proposed ultimate recipient has the capacity to contract), because all or part of the proposed intermediary's or proposed ultimate recipient's income is derived from public assistance of any kind, or because the proposed intermediary or proposed ultimate recipient has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction anytime Agency loan funds are involved.
I11(2) The regulations contained in subpart E of part 1901 of this title apply to this program.
I11(3) The Administrator will assure that equal opportunity and nondiscrimination requirements are met in accordance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ``Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs,'' 42 U.S.C. 2000d�094, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for Federally Conducted Programs and Activities, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and the Americans With Disabilities Act.
I11(d) T3Seismic safety of new building construction.G1T1 (1) The Intermediary Relending Program is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12699 that requires each Federal agency assisting in the financing, through Federal grants or loans, or guaranteeing the financing, through loan or mortgage insurance programs, of newly constructed buildings to assure appropriate consideration of seismic safety.
I11(2) All new buildings financed with Agency IRP loan funds shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the seismic provisions of one of the following model building codes or the latest edition of that code providing an equivalent level of safety to that contained in the latest edition of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Programs (NEHRP) Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Building (NEHRP Provisions):
I11(i) 1991 International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) Uniform Building Code;
I11(ii) 1993 Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA) National Building Code; or
I11(iii) 1992 Amendments to the Southern Building Code Congress International (SBCCI) Standard Building Code.
I11(3) The date, signature, and seal of a registered architect or engineer and the identification and date of the model building code on the plans and specifications shall be evidence of compliance with the seismic requirements of the appropriate code.


I80�1A4274.338
I89Loan agreements between the Agency and the intermediary.
I11A loan agreement or a supplement to a previous loan agreement must be executed by the intermediary and the Agency at loan closing for each loan. The loan agreement will be prepared by the Agency and reviewed by the intermediary prior to loan closing.
I11(a) The loan agreement will, as a minimum, set out:
I11(1) The amount of the loan;
�492�I11(2) The interest rate;
I11(3) The term and repayment schedule;
I11(4) T3The provisions for late charges.G1T1 The intermediary shall pay a late charge of 4 percent of the payment due if payment is not received within 15 calendar days following the due date. The late charge shall be considered unpaid if not received within 30 calendar days of the missed due date for which it was imposed. Any unpaid late charge shall be added to principal and be due as an extra payment at the end of the term. Acceptance of a late charge by the Agency does not constitute a waiver of default;
I11(5) T3The disbursement procedure.G1T1 Disbursement of loan funds by the Agency to the intermediary shall take place after the loan agreement and promissory note are executed, and any other conditions precedent to disbursement of funds are fully satisfied. For purposes of computing interest, the date of each draw down shall constitute the date the funds are advanced under the loan agreement;
I11(i) The intermediary may initially draw up to 25 percent of the loan funds. If the intermediary does not have loans to ultimate recipients ready to close sufficient to use the initial draw, the funds must be deposited in an interest bearing account in accordance with �1A4274.332(b)(5) until needed for such loans. The initial draw must be used for loans to ultimate recipients before any additional Agency IRP loan funds may be drawn by the intermediary. Any funds from the initial draw that have not been used for loans to ultimate recipients within 1 year from the date of the draw must be returned to the Agency as an extra payment on the loan. Agency IRP loan funds must not be used for administrative expenses;
I11(ii) After the initial draw of funds, an intermediary may draw down only such funds as are necessary to cover a 30-day period in implementing its approved work plan. Advances must be requested by the intermediary in writing;
I11(6) T3The provisions regarding default.G1T1 On the occurrence of any event of default, the Agency may declare all or any portion of the debt and interest to be immediately due and payable and may proceed to enforce its rights under the loan agreement or any other instruments securing or relating to the loan and in accordance with the applicable law and regulations. Any of the following may be regarded as an ``event of default'' in the sole discretion of the Agency:
I11(i) Failure of the intermediary to carry out the specific activities in its loan application as approved by the Agency or comply with the loan terms and conditions of the loan agreement, any applicable Federal or State laws, or with such USDA or Agency regulations as may become applicable;
I11(ii) Failure of the intermediary to pay within 15 calendar days of its due date any installment of principal or interest on its promissory note to the Agency;
I11(iii) The occurrence of;
I11(A) The intermediary becoming insolvent, or ceasing, being unable, or admitting in writing its inability to pay its debts as they mature, or making a general assignment for the benefit of, or entering into any composition or arrangement with creditors, or;
I11(B) Proceedings for the appointment of a receiver, trustee, or liquidator of the intermediary, or of a substantial part of its assets, being authorized or instituted by or against it;
I11(iv) Submission or making of any report, statement, warranty, or representation by the intermediary or agent on its behalf to USDA or the Agency in connection with the financial assistance awarded hereunder which is false, incomplete, or incorrect in any material respect; or
I11(v) Failure of the intermediary to remedy any material adverse change in its financial or other condition (such as the representational character of its board of directors or policymaking body) arising since the date of the Agency's award of assistance hereunder, which condition was an inducement to Agency's original award.
I11(7) T3The insurance requirements.G1T1 (i) Hazard insurance with a standard mortgage clause naming the intermediary as beneficiary will be required by the intermediary on every ultimate recipient's project funded from the IRP revolving fund in an amount that is at least the lesser of the depreciated replacement value of the property being �493�insured or the amount of the loan. Hazard insurance includes fire, windstorm, lightning, hail, business interruption, explosion, riot, civil commotion, aircraft, vehicle, marine, smoke, builder's risk, public liability, property damage, flood or mudslide, or any other hazard insurance that may be required to protect the security. The intermediary's interest in the insurance will be assigned to the Agency, upon the Agency's request, in the event of default by the intermediary.
I11(ii) Ordinarily, life insurance, which may be decreasing term insurance, is required for the principals and key employees of the ultimate recipient funded from the IRP revolving fund and will be assigned or pledged to the intermediary and subsequently, in the event of request by the Agency following default by the intermediary, to the Agency. A schedule of life insurance available for the benefit of the loan will be included as part of the application.
I11(iii) Workmen's compensation insurance on ultimate recipients is required in accordance with the State law.
I11(iv) T3Flood insurance.G1T1 The intermediary is responsible for determining if an ultimate recipient funded from the IRP revolving fund is located in a special flood or mudslide hazard area. If the ultimate recipient is in a flood or mudslide area, then flood or mudslide insurance must be provided in accordance with subpart B of part 1806 of this chapter.
I11(v) Intermediaries will provide fidelity bond coverage for all persons who have access to intermediary funds. Coverage may be provided either for all individual positions or persons, or through ``blanket'' coverage providing protection for all appropriate employees and officials. The Agency may also require the intermediary to carry other appropriate insurance, such as public liability, workers compensation, and property damage.
I11(A) The amount of fidelity bond coverage required by the Agency will normally approximate the total annual debt service requirements for the Agency loans;
I11(B) Other types of coverage may be considered acceptable if it is determined by the Agency that they fulfill essentially the same purpose as a fidelity bond;
I11(C) Intermediaries must provide evidence of adequate fidelity bond and other appropriate insurance coverage by loan closing. Adequate coverage in accordance with this section must then be maintained for the life of the loan. It is the responsibility of the intermediary to assure and provide evidence that adequate coverage is maintained. This may consist of a listing of policies and coverage amounts in reports required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section or other documentation.
I11(b) The intermediary will agree in the loan agreement:
I11(1) Not to make any changes in the intermediary's articles of incorporation, charter, or by-laws without the concurrence of the Agency;
I11(2) Not to make a loan commitment to an ultimate recipient to be funded from Agency IRP loan funds without first receiving the Agency's written concurrence;
I11(3) To maintain a separate ledger and segregated account for the IRP revolving fund;
I11(4) To Agency reporting requirements by providing:
I11(i) An annual audit;
I11(A) Dates of audit report period need not necessarily coincide with other reports on the IRP. Audit reports shall be due 90 days following the audit period. Audits must cover all of the intermediary's activities. Audits will be performed by an independent certified public accountant. An acceptable audit will be performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards and include such tests of the accounting records as the auditor considers necessary in order to express an opinion on the financial condition of the intermediary. The Agency does not require an unqualified audit opinion as a result of the audit. Compilations or reviews do not satisfy the audit requirement;
I11(B) It is not intended that audits required by this subpart be separate and apart from audits performed in accordance with State and local laws or for other purposes. To the extent feasible, the audit work should be done in connection with these audits. Intermediaries covered by OMB Circular A�09�494�128 or A�09133 should submit audits made in accordance with those circulars;
I11(ii) Quarterly or semiannual reports (due 30 days after the end of the period);
I11(A) Reports will be required quarterly during the first year after loan closing and, if all loan funds are not utilized during the first year, quarterly reports will be continued until at least 90 percent of the Agency IRP loan funds have been advanced to ultimate recipients. Thereafter, reports will be required semiannually. Also, the Agency may require quarterly reports if the intermediary becomes delinquent in repayment of its loan or otherwise fails to fully comply with the provisions of its work plan or Loan Agreement, or the Agency determines that the intermediary's IRP revolving fund is not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the ultimate recipients.
I11(B) These reports shall contain information only on the IRP revolving loan fund, or if other funds are included, the IRP loan program portion shall be segregated from the others; and in the case where the intermediary has more than one IRP revolving fund from the Agency a separate report shall be made for each of the IRP revolving funds.
I11(C) The reports will include, on a form provided by the Agency, information on the intermediary's lending activity, income and expenses, financial condition, and a summary of names and characteristics of the ultimate recipients the intermediary has financed.
I11(iii) Annual proposed budget for the following year; and
I11(iv) Other reports as the Agency may require from time to time.
I11(5) Before the first relending of Agency funds to an ultimate recipient, to obtain written Agency approval of;
I11(i) All forms to be used for relending purposes, including application forms, loan agreements, promissory notes, and security instruments;
I11(ii) Intermediary's policy with regard to the amount and form of security to be required;
I11(6) To obtain written approval of the Agency before making any significant changes in forms, security policy, or the work plan. The servicing officer may approve changes in forms, security policy, or work plans at any time upon a written request from the intermediary and determination by the Agency that the change will not jeopardize repayment of the loan or violate any requirement of this subpart or other Agency regulations. The intermediary must comply with the work plan approved by the Agency so long as any portion of the intermediary's IRP loan is outstanding;
I11(7) To secure the indebtedness by pledging the IRP revolving fund, including its portfolio of investments derived from the proceeds of the loan award, and pledging its real and personal property and other rights and interests as the Agency may require;
I11(8) In the event the intermediary's financial condition deteriorates or the intermediary takes action detrimental to prudent fund operation or fails to take action required of a prudent lender, to provide additional security, execute any additional documents, and undertake any reasonable acts the Agency may request, to protect the agency's interest or to perfect a security interest in any assets, including physical delivery of assets and specific assignments; and
I11(9) That if any part of the loan has not been used in accordance with the intermediary's work plan by a date three years from the date of the loan agreement, the Agency may cancel the approval of any funds not yet delivered to the intermediary and the intermediary will return, as an extra payment on the loan, any funds delivered to the intermediary that have not been used by the intermediary in accordance with the work plan. The Agency, at its sole discretion, may allow the intermediary additional time to use the loan funds by delaying cancellation of the funds by not more than 3 additional years. If any loan funds have not been used by 6 years from the date of the loan agreement, the approval will be canceled of any funds that have not been delivered to the intermediary and the intermediary will return, as an extra payment on the loan, any funds it has received and not used in accordance with the work plan. In accordance with the Intermediary Relending Program promissory note, regular loan payments will be based on the amount �495�of funds actually drawn by the intermediary.

I89Application.
I11(a) The application will consist of:
I11(1) An application form provided by the Agency.
I11(2) A written work plan and other evidence the Agency requires to demonstrate the feasibility of the intermediary's program to meet the objectives of this program. The plan must, at a minimum:
I11(i) Document the intermediary's ability to administer IRP in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. In order to adequately demonstrate the ability to administer the program, the intermediary must provide a complete listing of all personnel responsible for administering this program along with a statement of their qualifications and experience. The personnel may be either members or employees of the intermediary's organization or contract personnel hired for this purpose. If the personnel are to be contracted for, the contract between the intermediary and the entity providing such service will be submitted for Agency review, and the terms of the contract and its duration must be sufficient to adequately service the Agency loan through to its ultimate conclusion. If the Agency determines the personnel lack the necessary expertise to administer the program, the loan request will not be approved;
I11(ii) Document the intermediary's ability to commit financial resources under the control of the intermediary to the establishment of IRP. This should include a statement of the sources of non-Agency funds for administration of the intermediary's operations and financial assistance for projects;
I11(iii) Demonstrate a need for loan funds.

I11(b) T3Other lenders.G1T1 Rural Utilities Service borrowers and other lenders not meeting the criteria of paragraph (a) of this section may be considered by the Agency for eligibility to become a guaranteed lender provided, the Agency determines that they have the legal authority to operate a lending program and sufficient lending expertise and financial strength to operate a successful lending program. 
I11(1) Such a lender must: 
I11(i) Have a record of successfully making at least three commercial loans annually for at least the most recent 3 years, with delinquent loans not exceeding 10 percent of loans outstanding and historic losses not exceeding 10 percent of dollars loaned, or when the proposed lender can demonstrate that it has personnel with equivalent previous experience and where the commercial loan portfolio was of a similar quantity and quality; and 
I11(ii) Have tangible balance sheet equity of at least seven percent of tangible assets and sufficient funds available to disburse the guaranteed loans it proposes to approve within the first 6 months of being approved as a guaranteed lender. 
I11(2) A lender not eligible under paragraph (a) of this section that wishes consideration to become a guaranteed lender must submit a request in writing to the State Office for the State where the lender's lending and servicing activity takes place. The National Office will notify the prospective lender, through the State Director, whether the lender's request for eligibility is approved or rejected. If rejected, the reasons for the rejection will be indicated to the prospective lender in writing. The lender's written request must include: 
I11(i) Evidence showing that the lender has the necessary capital and resources to successfully meet its responsibilities. 
I11(ii) Copy of any license, charter, or other evidence of authority to engage in the proposed loanmaking and servicing activities. If licensing by the State is not required, an attorney's opinion to this effect must be submitted.

I89Lenders' functions and responsibilities. 
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 (1) Lenders have the primary responsibility for the successful delivery of the B&I loan program. All lenders obtaining or requesting a B&I loan guarantee are responsible for:
I11(i) Processing applications for guaranteed loans,
I11(ii) Developing and maintaining adequately documented loan files,
I11(iii) Recommending only loan proposals that are eligible and financially feasible, 
I11(iv) Obtaining valid evidence of debt and collateral in accordance with sound lending practices,
I11(v) Supervising construction
I11(vi) Distribution of loan funds,
I11(vii) Servicing guaranteed loans in a prudent manner, including liquidation if necessary,
I11(viii) Following Agency regulations, and

I11(2) This subpart, along with subpart B of this part and subpart B of part 4287 of this chapter, contain the regulations for this program, including the lenders' responsibilities. 
I11(b) T3Credit evaluation.G1T1 This is a key function of all lenders during the loan processing phase. The lender must analyze all credit factors associated with each proposed loan and apply its professional judgment to determine that the credit factors, considered in combination, ensure loan repayment. The lender must have an adequate underwriting process to ensure that loans are reviewed by other than the originating officer. There must be good credit documentation procedures. 
I11(c) T3Environmental responsibilities.G1T1 Lenders have a responsibility to become familiar with Federal environmental requirements; to consider, in consultation with the prospective borrower, the potential environmental impacts of their proposals at the earliest planning stages; and to develop proposals that minimize the potential to adversely impact the environment. Lenders must alert the Agency to any controversial environmental issues related to a proposed project or items that may require extensive environmental review. Lenders must help the borrower prepare Form FmHA 1940�0920, ``Request for Environmental Information'' (when required by subpart G of part 1940 of this title); assist in the collection of additional data when the Agency needs such data to complete its environmental review of the proposal; and assist in the resolution of environmental problems. 
I11(d) T3Loan closing.G1T1 The lender will conduct loan closings.

I89Certified Lender Program. 
I11(a) T3General.G1T1 This section provides policies and procedures for the Certified Lender Program (CLP) for loans guaranteed under this part. The objectives are to expedite loan approval, making, and servicing. 
I11(b) T3CLP eligibility criteria.G1T1 The lender must meet established eligibility criteria as follows: 
I11(1) Be an ``eligible lender'' as defined in 4279.29 of this subpart and authorized to do business in the State in which CLP status is desired. 
I11(2) Demonstrate to the Agency's satisfaction that it has a thorough knowledge of commercial lending. The lender will demonstrate such knowledge by providing a summary of its guaranteed �505�and unguaranteed business lending activity. At a minimum, the summary must include the dollar amount and number of loans in the lender's portfolio, unguaranteed and guaranteed by any Federal agency, with information on delinquencies and losses and, if applicable, the performance of the lender as a Small Business Administration (SBA) certified or preferred lender. A certified lender must be recognized throughout the State as a commercial lender and have a track record of successfully making at least five commercial loans per year for at least the most recent 5 years, with delinquent commercial loans outstanding not exceeding 6 percent of commercial loans outstanding and historic losses not exceeding 6 percent of dollars loaned, or it must demonstrate that it has personnel with equivalent previous experience where the commercial loan portfolio was of a similar quantity and quality. The lender will provide a written certification to this effect along with a statistical analysis of its commercial loan portfolio for the last 3 of its fiscal years. 
I11(3) The percentage of guarantee will not exceed 80 percent. 
I11(4) If the lender is a bank or savings and loan, it must have a financial strength rating in the upper half of possible ratings as reported by a lender rating service selected by the Agency. 
I11(5) Possess loan officers and other appropriate personnel who have received training conducted by the Agency. Additional training may be required if the lender's contact person changes or if the Agency determines further instruction is needed. 
I11(6) Have committed no action within the most recent 2 years prior to requesting CLP status which would be considered cause for revoking CLP status under paragraph (e) of this section. 
I11(c) T3CLP approval.G1T1 The Agency may grant CLP status for a period not to exceed 5 years by executing Form 4279�098, ``Certified Lender, Business and Industry Program,'' with the lender. CLP status will not apply to branches or suboffices of the lender unless so specified in the agreement. Such branches or suboffices may submit loans as regular lenders or apply for their own CLP status. Any lender who desires CLP status must prepare a written request to the State Director where it desires CLP status. The request must address each of the required criteria outlined in paragraph (b) of this section, except paragraph (b)(3), and should be accompanied by any other information the lender believes will be helpful. The request will also include Form 4279�098 completed and executed by the lender and an executed Lender's Agreement if it does not already have a valid Lender's Agreement on file with the Agency. Loans made by the lender and guaranteed by the Agency prior to the lender receiving CLP status shall continue to be governed by the forms and agreements executed between the lender and the Agency for those loans. 
I11(d) T3Renewal of CLP status.G1T1 Renewal of CLP status is not automatic. CLP status will lapse upon the expiration date of Form 4279�098 unless the lender obtains a renewal. A lender whose CLP status has lapsed may continue to submit loan guarantee requests as a regular lender. A new Form 4279�098 completed and executed by the lender must be provided, along with a written update of the eligibility criteria required by this section for CLP approval. This information must be supplied at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the existing agreement to be assured of uninterrupted status. The information must address how the lender is complying with each of the required criteria described in paragraph (b) of this section. It must include any proposed changes in the designated persons for processing guaranteed loans or operating methods used in processing and servicing Agency guaranteed loans. 
I11(e) T3Revocation of CLP status.G1T1 The lender's CLP status may be revoked at any time for cause. The debarment of a lender is an additional alternative the Agency may consider. A lender which has lost its CLP status, but has not been debarred and still meets the requirements of �1A4279.29 of this subpart may continue to submit loan guarantee requests as a regular lender. Cause for revoking CLP status includes: 
I11(1) Failure to maintain status as an eligible lender as set forth in �1A4279.29 of this subpart; 
I11(2) Knowingly submitting false information when requesting a guarantee or �506�basing a guarantee request on information known to be false or which the lender should have known to be false; 
I11(3) Making a guaranteed loan with deficiencies which may cause losses not to be covered by the Loan Note Guarantee; 
I11(4) Conviction for acts in connection with any loan transaction whether or not the loan was guaranteed by the Agency; 
I11(5) Violation of usury laws in connection with any loan guaranteed by the Agency; 
I11(6) Failure to obtain the required security for any loan guaranteed by the Agency; 
I11(7) Using loan funds guaranteed by the Agency for purposes other than those specifically approved by the Agency in the Conditional Commitment; 
I11(8) Violation of any term of the Lender's Agreement; 
I11(9) Failure to correct any cited deficiency in loan documents in a timely manner; 
I11(10) Failure to submit reports required by the Agency in a timely manner; 
I11(11) Failure to process Agency guaranteed loans in a reasonably prudent manner; 
I11(12) Failure to provide for adequate construction planning and monitoring in connection with any loan to ensure that the project will be completed with the available funds and, once completed, will be suitable for the borrower's needs; 
I11(13) Repetitive recommendations for guaranteed loans with marginal or substandard credit quality or that do not comply with Agency requirements; 
I11(14) Repetitive recommendations for servicing actions that do not comply with Agency requirements; 
I11(15) Negligent servicing; or 
I11(16) Failure to conduct any approved liquidation of a loan guaranteed by the Agency or its predecessors in a timely and effective manner and in accordance with the approved liquidation plan. 
I11(f) T3General loan processing and servicing guidelines.G1T1 All requests for guaranteed loans will be processed and serviced under subparts A and B of this part and subpart B of part 4287 of this chapter except as modified by this section. When determining whether or not to request a guarantee for a proposed loan, lenders must consider the priorities set forth in �1A279.155 of subpart B of this part. 
I11(1) Prior to processing an application, the CLP lender may give written notice to the State Director of its intention to submit an application. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Agency will notify the CLP lender whether or not there is sufficient guarantee authority for the loan. Such guarantee authority will be held for 30 days pending receipt of the application. If a complete application for which guarantee authority is being held is not received within 30 days of the notice of intent to file or is rejected, the guarantee authority for this application will no longer be held in reserve. Notwithstanding the preceding, no guarantee authority will be held in reserve the last 60 days of the Agency's fiscal year. 
I11(2) Refinancing of existing lender debt in accordance with �1A4279.113(q) of subpart B of this part will not be permitted without prior Agency approval. 
I11(3) CLP lenders will process all guaranteed loans as a ``complete application'' by obtaining and completing all items required by �1A4279.161(b) of subpart B of this part. The CLP lender must maintain all information required by �1A4279.161(b) in its loan file and determine that such material complies with all requirements. 
I11(4) CLP lenders will make all material relating to any guarantee application available to the Agency upon request. 
I11(5) At the time of the Agency's issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee, the CLP lender will provide the Agency with copies of the following documents: 
I11(i) Executed Loan Agreement; 
I11(ii) Executed Promissory Notes; and 
I11(iii) Executed security documents including personal and corporate guarantees. 
I11(g) T3Unique characteristics of the CLP.G1T1 A proposed loan by a CLP lender requires a review by the Agency of the information submitted by the lender, plus satisfactory completion of the environmental review process by the Agency. The Agency may rely on the lender's credit analysis. 
�507�I11(1) The following will constitute a complete application submitted by a CLP lender: 
I11(i) Form 4279�091, ``Application for Loan Guarantee (Business and Industry),'' (marked with the letters ``CLP'' at the top) completed in its entirety and executed by the borrower and CLP lender; 
I11(ii) Copy of the proposed Loan Agreement or a list of proposed requirements; 
I11(iii) Form FmHA 1940�0920, completed and signed, with attachments; 
I11(iv) The lender's complete written analysis of the proposal, including spreadsheets of the balance sheets and income statements for the 3 previous years (for existing businesses), pro forma balance sheet at startup, and 2 years projected yearend balance sheets and income statements, with appropriate ratios and comparisons with industry standards (such as Dun & Bradstreet or Robert Morris Associates). All data must be shown in total dollars and also in common size form, obtained by expressing all balance sheet items as a percentage of assets and all income and expense items as a percentage of sales. The lender's credit analysis must include the borrower's management, repayment ability including a cash flow analysis, history of debt repayment, necessity of any debt refinancing, and the credit reports of the borrower, its principals, and any parent, affiliate, or subsidiary; 
I11(v) Intergovernmental consultation comments in accordance with 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V; and 
I11(vi) If the loan will exceed $1 million and will increase direct employment by more than 50 employees, Form 4279�092, ``Certification of Non-Relocation and Market Capacity Information Report,'' must be completed by the lender. For such loans, the Agency will submit Form 4279�092 to the Department of Labor and obtain clearance before a Conditional Commitment may be issued. 
I11(2) The Agency will make the final credit decision based primarily on a review of the credit analysis submitted by the lender and approval of the Agency's completed environmental analysis, if required, except that refinancing of existing lender debt in accordance with �1A4279.113(q) of subpart B of this part will not be approved without a credit analysis by the Agency of the borrower's complete financial statements; and completion by the Agency of the environmental analysis. The Agency may request such additional information as it determines is needed to make a decision. 
I11(h) T3Lender loan servicing responsibilities.G1T1 CLP lenders will be fully responsible for all aspects of loan servicing and, if necessary, liquidation as described in subpart B of part 4287 of this chapter. 

I80�1A4279.44 
I89Access to records.

The lender will comply with the requirements of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as contained in the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation implementing that Act (see 12 CFR part 202). Such compliance will be accomplished prior to loan closing.

If the loan is for development or purchases made in a previous fiscal year through interim financing, an audit will also be provided for the fiscal year in which the development or purchases occurred. Any audit provided by a public body or nonprofit corporation in compliance with OMB Circulars A�09128 or A�09133 or their successors will be considered adequate to meet the audit requirements of the B&I program for that year. 

I80�1A4279.72 
I89Conditions of guarantee. 
I11A loan guarantee under this part will be evidenced by a Loan Note Guarantee issued by the Agency. Each lender will execute a Lender's Agreement. If a valid Lender's Agreement already exists, it is not necessary to execute a new Lender's Agreement with each loan guarantee. The provisions of this part and part 4287 of this chapter will apply to all outstanding guarantees. In the event of a conflict between the guarantee documents and these regulations as they exist at the time the documents are executed, the regulations will control. 
I11(a) T3Full faith and credit.G1T1 A guarantee under this part constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which a lender or holder has actual knowledge at the time it becomes such lender or holder or which a lender or holder participates in or condones. The guarantee will be unenforceable to the extent that any loss is occasioned by a provision for interest on interest. In addition, the guarantee will be unenforceable by the lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by the violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the required security regardless of the time at which the Agency acquires knowledge thereof. Any losses occasioned will be unenforceable to the extent that loan funds are used for purposes other than those specifically approved by the Agency in its Conditional Commitment. The Agency will guarantee payment as follows: 
I11(1) To any holder, 100 percent of any loss sustained by the holder on the guaranteed portion of the loan and on interest due on such portion. 
I11(2) To the lender, the lesser of: 
I11(i) Any loss sustained by the lender on the guaranteed portion, including principal and interest evidenced by the notes or assumption agreements and secured advances for protection and preservation of collateral made with the Agency's authorization; or 
I11(ii) The guaranteed principal advanced to or assumed by the borrower and any interest due thereon. 
I11(b) T3Rights and liabilities.G1T1 When a guaranteed portion of a loan is sold to a holder, the holder shall succeed to all rights of the lender under the Loan Note Guarantee to the extent of the portion purchased. The lender will remain bound to all obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee, Lender's Agreement, and the Agency program regulations. A guarantee and right to require purchase will be directly enforceable by a holder notwithstanding any fraud or misrepresentation by the lender or any unenforceability of the guarantee by the lender, except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the holder had actual knowledge at the time it became the holder or in which the holder participates or condones. In the event of material fraud, negligence or misrepresentation by the lender or the lender's participation in or condoning of such material fraud, negligence or misrepresentation, the lender will be liable for payments made by the Agency to any holder. 
I11(c) T3Payments.G1T1 A lender will receive all payments of principal and interest on account of the entire loan and will promptly remit to the holder its T3pro �509�rataG1T1 share thereof, determined according to its respective interest in the loan, less only the lender's servicing fee.

I89Sale or assignment of guaranteed loan. 
I11The lender may sell all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan on the secondary market or retain the entire loan. The lender shall not sell or participate any amount of the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion of the loan to the borrower or members of the borrower's immediate families, officers, directors, stockholders, other owners, or a parent, subsidiary or affiliate. If the lender desires to market all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan at or subsequent to loan closing, such loan must not be in default. Loans made with the proceeds of any obligation the interest on which is excludable from income under 26 U.S.C. 103 (interest on State and local banks) or any successor section will not be guaranteed. 
I11(a) T3Single note system.G1T1 The entire loan is evidenced by one note, and one Loan Note Guarantee is issued. The lender may assign all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan to one or more holders by using the Agency's Assignment Guarantee Agreement. The holder, upon written notice to the lender and the Agency, may reassign the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan sold under the Assignment Guarantee Agreement. Upon notification and completion of the assignment through the use of Form 4279�096, the assignee shall succeed to all rights and obligations of the holder thereunder. If this option is selected, the lender may not at a later date cause any additional notes to be issued. 
I11(b) T3Multinote system.G1T1 Under this option the lender may provide one note for the unguaranteed portion of the loan and no more than 10 notes for the guaranteed portion. When this option is selected by the lender, the holder will receive one of the borrower's executed notes and a Loan Note Guarantee. The Agency will issue a Loan Note Guarantee for each note, including the unguaranteed note, to be attached to the note. An Assignment Guarantee Agreement will not be used when the multinote option is utilized. 
I11(c) T3After loan closing.G1T1 If a loan is closed using the multinote option and at a later date additional notes are desired, the lender may cause a series of new notes, so that the total number of notes issued does not exceed the total number provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, to be issued as replacement for previously issued guaranteed notes, provided: 
I11(1) Written approval of the Agency is obtained; 
I11(2) The borrower agrees and executes the new notes; 
I11(3) The interest rate does not exceed the interest rate in effect when the loan was closed; 
I11(4) The maturity date of the loan is not changed; 
I11(5) The Agency will not bear or guarantee any expenses that may be incurred in reference to such reissuances of notes; 
I11(6) There is adequate collateral securing the notes; 
I11(7) No intervening liens have arisen or have been perfected and the secured lien priority is better or remains the same; and 
I11(8) All holders agree. 
I11(d) T3Termination of lender servicing fee.G1T1 The lender's servicing fee will stop when the Agency purchases the guaranteed portion of the loan from the secondary market. No such servicing fee may be charged to the Agency and all loan payments and collateral proceeds received will be applied first to the guaranteed loan and, when applied to the guaranteed loan, will be applied on a pro rata basis.

I89Participation. 
I11The lender may obtain participation in the loan under its normal operating procedures; however, the lender must retain title to the notes if any of them are unguaranteed and retain the lender's interest in the collateral. 

I80�1A4279.77 
I89Minimum retention. 
I11The lender is required to hold in its own portfolio a minimum of 5 percent of the total loan amount. The amount required to be maintained must be of the unguaranteed portion of the loan �510�and cannot be participated to another. The lender may sell the remaining amount of the unguaranteed portion of the loan only through participation. 

I80�1A4279.78 
I89Repurchase from holder. 
I11(a) T3Repurchase by lender.G1T1 A lender has the option to repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan from a holder within 30 days of written demand by the holder when the borrower is in default not less than 60 days on principal or interest due on the loan; or the lender has failed to remit to the holder its pro rata share of any payment made by the borrower within 30 days of the lender's receipt thereof. The repurchase by the lender will be for an amount equal to the unpaid guaranteed portion of principal and accrued interest less the lender's servicing fee. The holder must concurrently send a copy of the demand letter to the Agency. The guarantee will not cover the note interest to the holder on the guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the demand letter to the lender requesting the repurchase. The lender will accept an assignment without recourse from the holder upon repurchase. The lender is encouraged to repurchase the loan to facilitate the accounting of funds, resolve the problem, and prevent default, where and when reasonable. The lender will notify the holder and the Agency of its decision. 
I11(b) T3Agency purchase.G1T1 (1) If the lender does not repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the Agency will purchase from the holder the unpaid principal balance of the guaranteed portion together with accrued interest to date of repurchase, less the lender's servicing fee, within 30 days after written demand to the Agency from the holder. (This is in addition to the copy of the written demand on the lender.) The guarantee will not cover the note interest to the holder on the guaranteed loan accruing after 90 days from the date of the original demand letter of the holder to the lender requesting the repurchase. 
I11(2) The holder's demand to the Agency must include a copy of the written demand made upon the lender. The holder must also include evidence of its right to require payment from the Agency. Such evidence will consist of either the original of the Loan Note Guarantee properly endorsed to the Agency or the original of the Assignment Guarantee Agreement properly assigned to the Agency without recourse including all rights, title, and interest in the loan. The holder must include in its demand the amount due including unpaid principal, unpaid interest to date of demand, and interest subsequently accruing from date of demand to proposed payment date. The Agency will be subrogated to all rights of the holder. 
I11(3) The Agency will notify the lender of its receipt of the holder's demand for payment. The lender must promptly provide the Agency with the information necessary for the Agency to determine the appropriate amount due the holder. Upon request by the Agency, the lender will furnish a current statement certified by an appropriate authorized officer of the lender of the unpaid principal and interest then owed by the borrower on the loan and the amount then owed to any holder. Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the holder and the information submitted by the lender must be resolved between the lender and the holder before payment will be approved. Such conflict will suspend the running of the 30 day payment requirement. 
I11(4) Purchase by the Agency neither changes, alters, nor modifies any of the lender's obligations to the Agency arising from the loan or guarantee nor does it waive any of Agency's rights against the lender. The Agency will have the right to set-off against the lender all rights inuring to the Agency as the holder of the instrument against the Agency's obligation to the lender under the guarantee. 
I11(c) T3Repurchase for servicing.G1T1 If, in the opinion of the lender, repurchase of the guaranteed portion of the loan is necessary to adequately service the loan, the holder must sell the guaranteed portion of the loan to the lender for an amount equal to the unpaid principal and interest on such portion less the lender's servicing fee. The guarantee will not cover the note interest to the holder on the guaranteed loan accruing �511�after 90 days from the date of the demand letter of the lender or the Agency to the holder requesting the holder to tender its guaranteed portion. The lender must not repurchase from the holder for arbitrage or other purposes to further its own financial gain. Any repurchase must only be made after the lender obtains the Agency's written approval. If the lender does not repurchase the portion from the holder, the Agency may, at its option, purchase such guaranteed portion for servicing purposes.

I89Replacement of document. 
I11(a) The Agency may issue a replacement Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement which was lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced to the lender or holder upon receipt of an acceptable certificate of loss and an indemnity bond. 
I11(b) When a Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement is lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced while in the custody of the lender or holder, the lender will coordinate the activities of the party who seeks the replacement documents and will submit the required documents to the Agency for processing. The requirements for replacement are as follows: 
I11(1) A certificate of loss, notarized and containing a jurat, which includes: 
I11(i) Name and address of owner; 
I11(ii) Name and address of the lender of record; 
I11(iii) Capacity of person certifying; 
I11(iv) Full identification of the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement including the name of the borrower, the Agency's case number, date of the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement, face amount of the evidence of debt purchased, date of evidence of debt, present balance of the loan, percentage of guarantee, and, if an Assignment Guarantee Agreement, the original named holder and the percentage of the guaranteed portion of the loan assigned to that holder. Any existing parts of the document to be replaced must be attached to the certificate; 
I11(v) A full statement of circumstances of the loss, theft, or destruction of the Loan Note Guarantee or Assignment Guarantee Agreement; and 
I11(vi) For the holder, evidence demonstrating current ownership of the Loan Note Guarantee and Note or the Assignment Guarantee Agreement. If the present holder is not the same as the original holder, a copy of the endorsement of each successive holder in the chain of transfer from the initial holder to present holder must be included if in existence. If copies of the endorsement cannot be obtained, best available records of transfer must be submitted to the Agency (e.g., order confirmation, canceled checks, etc.). 
I11(2) An indemnity bond acceptable to the Agency shall accompany the request for replacement except when the holder is the United States, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal corporation, a State or territory, or the District of Columbia. The bond shall be with surety except when the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest due the present holder is less than $1 million verified by the lender in writing in a letter of certification of balance due. The surety shall be a qualified surety company holding a certificate of authority from the Secretary of the Treasury and listed in Treasury Department Circular 580. 
I11(3) All indemnity bonds must be issued and payable to the United States of America acting through the USDA. The bond shall be in an amount not less than the unpaid principal and interest. The bond shall hold USDA harmless against any claim or demand which might arise or against any damage, loss, costs, or expenses which might be sustained or incurred by reasons of the loss or replacement of the instruments. 
I11(4) In those cases where the guaranteed loan was closed under the provision of the multinote system, the Agency will not attempt to obtain, or participate in the obtaining of, replacement notes from the borrower. It will be the responsibility of the holder to bear costs of note replacement if the borrower agrees to issue a replacement instrument. Should such note be replaced, the terms of the note cannot be changed. If the evidence of debt has been lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated or defaced, such evidence of debt must �512�be replaced before the Agency will replace any instruments.

I89Guarantee fee. 
I11The guarantee fee will be paid to the Agency by the lender and is nonrefundable. The fee may be passed on to the borrower. Except as provided in this section, the guarantee fee will be 2 percent multiplied by the principal loan amount multiplied by the percent of guarantee and will be paid one time only at the time the Loan Note Guarantee is issued. 
I11(a) The guarantee fee may be reduced to 1 percent if the Agency determines that the business meets the following criteria: 
I11(1) High impact business development investment (It is the goal of this program to encourage high impact business investment in rural areas. The weight given to business investments will be in accordance with �1A4279.155(b)(5) of this subpart); and 
I11(2) The business is located in a community that is experiencing long term population decline and job deterioration; or 
I11(3) The business is located in a rural community that has remained persistently poor over the last 60 years; or 
I11(4) The business is located in a rural community that is experiencing trauma as a result of natural disaster or that is experiencing fundamental structural changes in its economic base. 
I11(b) Each fiscal year, the Agency shall establish a limit on the maximum portion of guarantee authority available for that fiscal year that may be used to guarantee loans with a guarantee fee of 1 percent. The limit will be announced by publishing a notice in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1. Once the limit has been �513�reached, the guarantee fee for all additional loans obligated during the remainder of that fiscal year will be 2 percent.

I11(r) Takeout of interim financing. Guaranteeing a loan after project completion to pay off a lender's interim loan will not be treated as debt refinancing provided that the lender submits a complete preapplication or application which proposes such interim financing prior to completing the interim loan.

The Administrator may, at the Administrator's discretion, grant an exception to the $10 million limit under the following circumstances: 
I11(1) The project to be financed is a high-priority project. Priority will be �516�determined in accordance with the criteria contained in �1A4279.155 of this subpart; 
I11(2) The lender must document to the satisfaction of the Agency that the loan will not be made and the project will not be completed if the guarantee is not approved; and 
I11(3) Under no circumstances will the total amount of guaranteed loans to one borrower, including the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions, the outstanding principal and interest balance of any existing Agency guaranteed loans, and new loan request, exceed $25 million; 
I11(4) The percentage of guarantee will not exceed 60 percent. No exception to this requirement will be approved under paragraph (b) of this section for loans exceeding $10 million; and 
I11(5) Any request for a guaranteed loan exceeding the $10 million limit must be submitted to the Agency in the form of a preapplication. The preapplication must be submitted to the National Office for review and concurrence before encouraging a full application. 
I11(b) T3Percent of guarantee.G1T1 The percentage of guarantee, up to the maximum allowed by this section, is a matter of negotiation between the lender and the Agency. The maximum percentage of guarantee is 80 percent for loans of $5 million or less, 70 percent for loans between $5 and $10 million, and 60 percent for loans exceeding $10 million. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Administrator may, at the Administrator's discretion, grant an exception allowing guarantees of up to 90 percent on loans of $10 million or less under the following circumstances: 
I11(1) The project to be financed is a high-priority project. Priority will be determined in accordance with the criteria contained in 4279.155 of this subpart;

I11(3) The State Director may grant an exception for loans of up to 90 percent on loans of $2 million or less subject to the State Director's delegated loan authority and meeting all of the conditions as set forth in this section. In cases where the State Director does not have the loan approval authority to approve a loan of $2 million or less or the proposed percentage, the case must be submitted to the National Office for review. 
I11(4) Each fiscal year, the Agency will establish a limit on the maximum portion of guarantee authority available for that fiscal year that may be used to guarantee loans with a guarantee percentage exceeding 80 percent. The limit will be announced by publishing a notice in the T4Federal RegisterG1T1. Once the limit has been reached, the guarantee percentage for all additional loans guaranteed during the remainder of that fiscal year will not exceed 80 percent.

I89Fees and charges. 
I11(a) T3Routine lender fees.G1T1 The lender may establish charges and fees for the loan provided they are similar to those normally charged other applicants for the same type of loan in the ordinary course of business. 
I11(b) T3Professional services.G1T1 Professional services are those rendered by entities generally licensed or certified by States or accreditation associations, such as architects, engineers, packagers, accountants, attorneys, or appraisers. The borrower may pay fees for professional services needed for planning and developing a project provided that the amounts are reasonable and customary in the area. Professional fees may be included as an eligible use of loan proceeds.

I89Interest rates. 
I11The interest rate for the guaranteed loan will be negotiated between the lender and the applicant and may be either fixed or variable as long as it is a legal rate. Interest rates will not be more than those rates customarily charged borrowers in similar circumstances in the ordinary course of business and are subject to Agency review and approval. Lenders are encouraged to utilize the secondary market and pass interest-rate savings on to the borrower. 
�517�I11(a) A variable interest rate agreed to by the lender and borrower must be a rate that is tied to a base rate agreed to by the lender and the Agency. The variable interest rate may be adjusted at different intervals during the term of the loan, but the adjustments may not be more often than quarterly and must be specified in the Loan Agreement. The lender must incorporate, within the variable rate Promissory Note at loan closing, the provision for adjustment of payment installments coincident with an interest-rate adjustment. The lender will ensure that the outstanding principal balance is properly amortized within the prescribed loan maturity to eliminate the possibility of a balloon payment at the end of the loan. 
I11(b) Any change in the interest rate between the date of issuance of the Conditional Commitment and before the issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee must be approved in writing by the Agency approval official. Approval of such a change will be shown as an amendment to the Conditional Commitment.

I89Credit quality. 
I11The lender is primarily responsible for determining credit quality and must address all of the elements of credit quality in a written credit analysis including adequacy of equity, cash flow, collateral, history, management, and the current status of the industry for which credit is to be extended. 
I11(a) T3Cash flow.G1T1 All efforts will be made to structure or restructure debt so that the business has adequate debt coverage and the ability to accommodate expansion.

Lenders will discount collateral consistent with sound loan-to-value policy. 
I11(2) Some businesses are predominantly cash-flow oriented, and where cash flow and profitability are strong, loan-to-value coverage may be discounted accordingly. A loan primarily based on cash flow must be supported by a successful and documented financial history. 
I11(c) T3Industry.G1T1 Current status of the industry will be considered and businesses in areas of decline will be required to provide strong business plans which outline how they differ from the �518�current trends. The regulatory environment surrounding the particular business or industry will be considered. 
I11(d) T3Equity.G1T1 A minimum of 10 percent tangible balance sheet equity will be required for existing businesses at the time the Loan Note Guarantee is issued. A minimum of 20 percent tangible balance sheet equity will be required for new businesses at the time the Loan Note Guarantee is issued. Tangible balance sheet equity will be determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Modifications to the equity requirements may be granted by the Administrator or designee. For the Administrator to consider a reduction in the equity requirement, the borrower must furnish the following: 
I11(1) Collateralized personal and corporate guarantees, including any parent, subsidiary, or affiliated company, when feasible and legally permissible (in accordance with 4279.149 of this subpart), and 
I11(2) Pro forma and historical financial statements which indicate the business to be financed meets or exceeds the median quartile (as identified in Robert Morris Associates Annual Statement Studies or similar publication) for the current ratio, quick ratio, debt-to-worth ratio, debt coverage ratio, and working capital. 
I11(e) T3Lien priorities.G1T1 The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan. The unguaranteed portion of the loan will neither be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion. A parity or junior position may be considered provided that discounted collateral values are adequate to secure the loan in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section after considering prior liens. 
I11(f) T3Management.G1T1 A thorough review of key management personnel will be completed to ensure that the business has adequately trained and experienced managers.

I11(b) T3Life.G1T1 The lender may require life insurance to insure against the risk of death of persons critical to the success of the business. When required, coverage will be in amounts necessary to provide for management succession or to protect the business. The cost of insurance and its effect on the applicant's working capital must be considered as well as the amount of existing insurance which could be assigned without requiring additional expense. 
I11(c) T3Worker compensation.G1T1 Worker compensation insurance is required in accordance with State law. 
I11(d) T3Flood.G1T1 National flood insurance is required in accordance with 7 CFR, part 1806, subpart B (FmHA Instruction 426.2, available in any field office or the National Office).

Such community may be incorporated or unincorporated to extend from the contiguous boundaries to recognizable open country, less densely settled areas, or natural boundaries such as forests or water. Minor open spaces such as airports, industrial sites, recreational facilities, or public parks shall be disregarded.

A community is considered ``separate'' when it is separated from the city and its immediately adjacent urbanized area by open country, less densely settled areas, or natural barriers such as forests or water. Minor open spaces such as airports, industrial sites, recreational facilities, or public parks shall not be considered as an area to determine if a community is separate. A community is considered ``independent'' when its social (T3e.g.,G1T1 government, educational, health, and recreational facilities) and economic structure (T3e.g.,G1T1 business, industry, tax base, and employment opportunities) are not primarily dependent on the city and its immediately adjacent urbanized areas.

I80�1A4284.527 
I89Other considerations.  
I11(a) T3Civil rights compliance requirementsG1T1. All grants made under this subpart are subject to the requirements of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin as outlined in part 1901, subpart E of this title. In addition, the grants made under this subpart are subject to the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability; the requirements of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of age; and title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by private entities in places of public accommodations.  
I11(b) T3Environmental requirementsG1T1_(1) T3General applicabilityG1T1. Unless specifically modified by this section, the requirements of part 1940, subpart G of this title apply to this subpart. For example, the Agency's general and specific environmental policies contained in �1A1940.303 and 1940.304 of this title must be complied with. Although the purpose of the grant program established by this subpart is to improve business, industry, and employment in rural areas, this purpose is to be achieved, to the extent practicable, without adversely affecting important environmental resources of rural areas such as important farmland and forest lands, prime rangelands, wetland, and flood plains. Prospective recipients of grants, therefore, must consider the potential environmental impacts of their applications at the earliest planning stages and develop plans and projects that minimize the potential to adversely impact on the environment.  
I11(2) T3Technical assistanceG1T1. An application for a project exclusively involving technical assistance is generally excluded from the environmental review process by �1A1940.310(e)(1) of this title. However, as further specified in �1A1940.333 of this title, the grantee of a technical assistance grant, in the process of providing technical assistance, must consider and generally document within their plans the potential environmental impacts of the plan and recommendations provided to the recipient of the technical assistance.  
I11(3) T3Applications for grants to provide other than technical assistance to third-party recipientsG1T1. As part of the preapplication, the applicant must provide a complete ``Request for Environmental Information,'' for each project specifically identified in its plan to provide other than technical assistance to third parties who will undertake eligible projects with such assistance. The Agency will review the preapplication, supporting materials, and the required ``Request for Environmental Information'' and assess the impact of the preapplication. This assessment will focus on the potential cumulative impacts of the projects as well as any environmental concerns or problems that are associated with individual projects that can be identified at this time from the information submitted. Because the Agency's approval of this type of grant application does not constitute a commitment to the use of grant funds for any identified third-party projects (see �1A4284.541), no public notification requirements will apply to the preapplication. After the �529�grant is approved, each third-party project to be assisted under the grant will undergo the applicable environmental review and public notification requirements in part 1940, subpart G of this title prior to the Agency providing its consent to the grantee to assist the third-party project. If the preapplication reflects only one project which is specifically identified as the third-party recipient for financial assistance, the Agency may proceed directly to the appropriate environmental assessment for the third-party recipient with public notification as required. The applicant must be advised that if the recipient or project changes after the grant is approved, the project to be assisted under the grant will undergo the applicable environmental review and public notification requirements.  
I11(c) T3Government-wide debarment and suspension (non-procurement) and requirements for drug-free workplaceG1T1. Persons who are disbarred or suspended are excluded from federal assistance and benefits including grants under this subpart. Grantees must certify that they will provide a drug-free workplace.  
I11(d) T3Restrictions on lobbyingG1T1. All grants must comply with the lobbying restrictions contained in part 3018 of this title.  
I11(e) T3Excess capacity or transfer of employmentG1T1. If a proposed project has financial assistance from all sources for more than $1 million and will increase direct employment by more than 50 employees, the applicant will be requested to provide written support for an Agency determination that the proposal will not result in a project which is calculated to, or likely to, result in the transfer of any employment or business activity from one area to another. This limitation will not prohibit assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary of such entity if the expansion will not result in an increase in the unemployment in the area of original location or in any other area where such entity conducts business operations.  
I11(f) T3Management assistanceG1T1. Grant recipients will be supervised, as necessary, to ensure that projects are completed in accordance with approved plans and specifications and that funds are expended for approved purposes. Grants made under this subpart will be administered under, and are subject to, parts 3015, 3017, 3019, and 3051 of this title, as appropriate, and established RBS guidelines.  
I11(g) T3Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies ActG1T1. All projects must comply with the requirements contained in part 21 of this title. 

I11(h) T3Flood or mudslide hazard area precautions.G1T1 If the grantee financed project is in a flood or mudslide area, flood or mudslide insurance must be obtained through the National Flood Insurance Program.  
I11(i) T3Termination of federal requirements.G1T1 Once the grantee has provided assistance with project loans in an amount equal to the grant provided by RBS, the requirements imposed on the grantee shall not be applicable to any new projects thereafter financed from the RCDG funds. Such new projects shall not be considered as being derived from federal funds. The purposes of such new projects, however, shall be consistent with these regulations.  
I11(j) T3Intergovernmental review.G1T1 Grant projects are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials. A loan fund established in whole, or in part, with grant funds will also be considered a project for the purpose of intergovernmental review as well as the specific projects funded with grant funds from the RCDG funds. For each project to be assisted with a grant under this subpart and which the state has elected to review under their intergovernmental review process, the state point of contact must be notified. Notification, in the form of a project description, can be initiated by the grantee. Any comments from the state must be included with the grantee's request to use RBS grant funds for the specific project. Prior to the RBS decision on the request, compliance with requirements of intergovernmental consultation must be demonstrated for each project. �530�These requirements should be completed in accordance with ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Agriculture Programs and Activities,'' part 3015, subpart V of this title.

I89Introduction. 
I11(a) This subpart supplements part 4279, subparts A and B, by providing additional requirements and instructions for servicing and liquidating all Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loans. This includes Drought and Disaster (D&D), Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprises (DARBE), and Business and Industry Disaster (BID) loans. 
I11(b) The lender will be responsible for servicing the entire loan and will remain mortgagee and secured party of record notwithstanding the fact that another party may hold a portion of the loan. The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan. The unguaranteed portion of a loan will neither be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion of the loan. 
I11(c) Copies of all forms, regulations, and Instructions referenced in this subpart are available in any Agency office. Whenever a form is designated in this subpart, that designation includes predecessor and successor forms, if applicable, as specified by the field or National Office.

I89Routine servicing. 
I11The lender is responsible for servicing the entire loan and for taking all servicing actions that a prudent lender would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The Loan Note Guarantee is unenforceable by the lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, use of loan funds for unauthorized purposes, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain the required security interest regardless of the time at which the Agency acquires knowledge of the foregoing. This responsibility includes but is not limited to the collection of payments, obtaining compliance with the covenants and provisions in the Loan Agreement, obtaining and analyzing financial statements, checking on payment of taxes and insurance premiums, and maintaining liens on collateral. 
I11(a) T3Lender reports.G1T1 The lender must report the outstanding principal and interest balance on each guaranteed loan semiannually using Form FmHA 1980�0941, ``Guaranteed Loan Status Report.'' 
I11(b) T3Loan classification.G1T1 Within 90 days of receipt of the Loan Note Guarantee, the lender must notify the Agency of the loan's classification or rating under its regulatory standards. Should the classification be changed at a future time, the Agency must be notified immediately. 
I11(c) T3Agency and lender conference.G1T1 At the Agency's request, the lender will meet with the Agency to ascertain how the guaranteed loan is being serviced and that the conditions and covenants of the Loan Agreement are being enforced. 
I11(d) T3Financial reports.G1T1 The lender must obtain and forward to the Agency the financial statements required by the Loan Agreement. The lender must submit annual financial statements to the Agency within 120 days of the end of �549�the borrower's fiscal year. The lender must analyze the financial statements and provide the Agency with a written summary of the lender's analysis and conclusions, including trends, strengths, weaknesses, extraordinary transactions, and other indications of the financial condition of the borrower. Spreadsheets of the new financial statements must be included. 
I11(e) T3Additional expenditures.G1T1 The lender will not make additional loans to the borrower without first obtaining the prior written approval of the Agency, even though such loans will not be guaranteed.

I80�1A4287.112 
I89Interest rate adjustments. 
I11(a) T3Reductions.G1T1 The borrower, lender, and holder (if any) may collectively initiate a permanent or temporary reduction in the interest rate of the guaranteed loan at any time during the life of the loan upon written agreement among these parties. The Agency must be notified by the lender, in writing, within 10 calendar days of the change. If any of the guaranteed portion has been purchased by the Agency, then the Agency will affirm or reject interest rate change proposals in writing. The Agency will concur in such interest-rate changes only when it is demonstrated to the Agency that the change is a more viable alternative than initiating or proceeding with liquidation of the loan or continuing with the loan in its present state. 
I11(1) Fixed rates can be changed to variable rates to reduce the borrower's interest rate only when the variable rate has a ceiling which is less than or equal to the original fixed rate. 
I11(2) Variable rates can be changed to a fixed rate which is at or below the current variable rate. 
I11(3) The interest rates, after adjustments, must comply with the requirements for interest rates on new loans as established by �1A4279.125 of subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter. 
I11(4) The lender is responsible for the legal documentation of interest-rate changes by an endorsement or any other legally effective amendment to the promissory note; however, no new notes may be issued. Copies of all legal documents must be provided to the Agency. 
I11(b) T3Increases.G1T1 No increases in interest rates will be permitted except the normal fluctuations in approved variable interest rates unless a temporary interest-rate reduction had occurred. 

I80�1A4287.113 
I89Release of collateral. 
I11(a) All releases of collateral with a value exceeding $100,000 must be supported by a current appraisal on the collateral released. The appraisal will be at the expense of the borrower and must meet the requirements of �1A4279.144 of subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter. The remaining collateral must be sufficient to provide for repayment of the Agency's guaranteed loan. The Agency may, at its discretion, require an appraisal of the remaining collateral in cases where it is determined that the Agency may be adversely affected by the release of collateral. Sale or release of collateral must be based on an arm's-length transaction. 
I11(b) Within the parameters of paragraph (a) of this section, lenders may, over the life of the loan, release collateral (other than personal and corporate guarantees) with a cumulative value of up to 20 percent of the original loan amount without Agency concurrence if the proceeds generated are used to reduce the guaranteed loan or to buy replacement collateral. 
I11(c) Within the parameters of paragraph (a) of this section, release of collateral with a cumulative value in excess of 20 percent of the original loan or when the proceeds will not be used to reduce the guaranteed loan or to buy replacement collateral must be requested in writing by the lender and concurred in by the Agency in writing in advance of the release. A written evaluation will be completed by the lender to justify the release.

I80�1A4287.123 
I89Subordination of lien position. 
I11A subordination of the lender's lien position must be requested in writing by the lender and concurred in by the Agency in writing in advance of the subordination. The subordination must enhance the borrower's business and �550�the Agency's interest. After the subordination, collateral must be adequate to secure the loan. The lien to which the guaranteed loan is subordinated must be for a fixed dollar limit and fixed or limited term, after which the guaranteed loan lien priority will be restored. Subordination to a revolving line of credit will not exceed 1 year. There must be adequate consideration for the subordination. 

I80�1A4287.124 
I89Alterations of loan instruments. 
I11The lender shall neither alter nor approve any alterations of any loan instrument without the prior written approval of the Agency.

I80�1A4287.134 
I89Transfer and assumption. 
I11(a) T3Documentation of request.G1T1 All transfers and assumptions must be approved in writing by the Agency and must be to eligible applicants in accordance with subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter. An individual credit report must be provided for transferee proprietors, partners, officers, directors, and stockholders with 20 percent or more interest in the business, along with such other documentation as the Agency may request to determine eligibility. 
I11(b) T3Terms.G1T1 Loan terms must not be changed unless the change is approved in writing by the Agency with the concurrence of any holder and the transferor (including guarantors) if they have not been or will not be released from liability. Any new loan terms must be within the terms authorized by 4279.126 of subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter. The lender's request for approval of new loan terms will be supported by an explanation of the reasons for the proposed change in loan terms. 
I11(c) T3Release of liability.G1T1 The transferor, including any guarantor, may be released from liability only with prior Agency written concurrence and only when the value of the collateral being transferred is at least equal to the amount of the loan being assumed and is supported by a current appraisal and a current financial statement. The Agency will not pay for the appraisal. If the transfer is for less than the debt, the lender must demonstrate to the Agency that the transferor and guarantors have no reasonable debt-paying ability considering their assets and income in the foreseeable future. 
I11(d) T3Proceeds.G1T1 Any proceeds received from the sale of collateral before a transfer and assumption will be credited to the transferor's guaranteed loan debt in inverse order of maturity before the transfer and assumption are closed. 
I11(e) T3Additional loans.G1T1 Loans to provide additional funds in connection with a transfer and assumption must be considered as a new loan application under subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter. 
I11(f) T3Credit quality.G1T1 The lender must make a complete credit analysis which is subject to Agency review and approval. 
I11(g) T3Documents.G1T1 Prior to Agency approval, the lender must advise the Agency, in writing, that the transaction can be properly and legally transferred, and the conveyance instruments will be filed, registered, or recorded as appropriate. 
I11(1) The assumption will be done on the lender's form of assumption agreement and will contain the Agency case number of the transferor and transferee. The lender will provide the Agency with a copy of the transfer and assumption agreement. The lender must ensure that all transfers and assumptions are noted on all original Loan Note Guarantees. 
I11(2) A new Loan Agreement, consistent in principle with the original Loan Agreement, should be executed to establish the terms and conditions of the loan being assumed. An assumption agreement can be used to establish the loan covenants. 
I11(3) The lender will provide to the Agency a written certification that the transfer and assumption is valid, enforceable, and complies with all Agency regulations. 
I11(h) T3Loss resulting from transfer.G1T1 If a loss should occur upon consummation of a complete transfer and assumption for less than the full amount of the debt and the transferor (including personal guarantors) is released from liability, the lender, if it holds the guaranteed portion, may file an estimated report of loss to recover its T3pro rataG1T1 �551�share of the actual loss. If a holder owns any of the guaranteed portion, such portion must be repurchased by the lender or the Agency in accordance with 4279.78(c) of subpart A of part 4279 of this chapter. In completing the report of loss, the amount of the debt assumed will be entered as net collateral (recovery). Approved protective advances and accrued interest thereon made during the arrangement of a transfer and assumption will be included in the calculations. 
I11(i) T3Related party.G1T1 If the transferor and transferee are affiliated or related parties, any transfer and assumption must be for the full amount of the debt. 
I11(j) T3Payment requests.G1T1 Requests for a loan guarantee to provide equity for a transfer and assumption must be considered as a new loan under subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter. 
I11(k) T3Cash downpayment.G1T1 When the transferee will be making a cash downpayment as part of the transfer and assumption: 
I11(1) The lender must have an appropriate appraiser, acceptable to both the transferee and transferor and currently authorized to perform appraisals, determine the value of the collateral securing the loan. The appraisal fee and any other costs will not be paid by the Agency. 
I11(2) The market value of the collateral, plus any additional property the transferee proposes to offer as collateral, must be adequate to secure the balance of the guaranteed loans. 
I11(3) Cash downpayments may be paid directly to the transferor provided: 
I11(i) The lender recommends that the cash be released, and the Agency concurs prior to the transaction being completed. The lender may wish to require that an amount be retained for a defined period of time as a reserve against future defaults. Interest on such account may be paid periodically to the transferor or transferee as agreed; 
I11(ii) The lender determines that the transferee has the repayment ability to meet the obligations of the assumed guaranteed loan as well as any other indebtedness; 
I11(iii) Any payments by the transferee to the transferor will not suspend the transferee's obligations to continue to meet the guaranteed loan payments as they come due under the terms of the assumption; and 
I11(iv) The transferor agrees not to take any action against the transferee in connection with the assumption without prior written approval of the lender and the Agency. 

I80�1A4287.135
I89Substitution of lender. 
I11After the issuance of a Loan Note Guarantee, the lender shall not sell or transfer the entire loan without the prior written approval of the Agency. The Agency will not pay any loss or share in any costs (i.e., appraisal fees, environmental studies, or other costs associated with servicing or liquidating the loan) with a new lender unless a relationship is established through a substitution of lender in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. This includes cases where the lender has failed and been taken over by a regulatory agency such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the loan is subsequently sold to another lender. 
I11(a) The Agency may approve the substitution of a new lender if: 
I11(1) The proposed substitute lender: 
I11(i) Is an eligible lender in accordance with 4279.29 of subpart A of part 4279 of this chapter; 
I11(ii) Is able to service the loan in accordance with the original loan documents; and 
I11(iii) Agrees in writing to acquire title to the unguaranteed portion of the loan held by the original lender and assumes all original loan requirements, including liabilities and servicing responsibilities. 
I11(2) The substitution of the lender is requested in writing by the borrower, the proposed substitute lender, and the original lender if still in existence. 
I11(b) Where the lender has failed and been taken over by FDIC and the guaranteed loan is liquidated by FDIC rather than being sold to another lender, the Agency will pay losses and share in costs as if FDIC were an approved substitute lender.

I80�1A4287.145
I89Default by borrower. 
I11(a) The lender must notify the Agency when a borrower is 30 days past due on a payment or is otherwise in default of the Loan Agreement. Form FmHA 1980�0944, ``Guaranteed Loan Borrower Default Status,'' will be used and the lender will continue to submit this form bimonthly until such time as the loan is no longer in default. If a monetary default exceeds 60 days, the lender will arrange a meeting with the Agency and the borrower to resolve the problem. 
I11(b) In considering options, the prospects for providing a permanent cure without adversely affecting the risk to the Agency and the lender is the paramount objective. 
I11(1) Curative actions include but are not limited to: 
I11(i) Deferment of principal (subject to rights of any holder); 
I11(ii) An additional unguaranteed loan by the lender to bring the account current; 
I11(iii) Reamortization of or rescheduling the payments on the loan (subject to rights of any holder); 
I11(iv) Transfer and assumption of the loan in accordance with �1A4287.134 of this subpart; 
I11(v) Reorganization; 
I11(vi) Liquidation; 
I11(vii) Subsequent loan guarantees; and 
I11(viii) Changes in interest rates with the Agency's, the lender's, and holder's approval, provided that the interest rate is adjusted proportionately between the guaranteed and unguaranteed portion of the loan and the type of rate remains the same. 
I11(2) In the event a deferment, rescheduling, reamortization, or moratorium is accomplished, it will be limited to the remaining life of the collateral or remaining limits as contained in �1A4279.126 of subpart B of part 4279 of this chapter, whichever is less.

I89Protective advances. 
I11Protective advances are advances made by the lender for the purpose of preserving and protecting the collateral where the debtor has failed to, will not, or cannot meet its obligations. Sound judgment must be exercised in determining that the protective advance preserves collateral and recovery is actually enhanced by making the advance. Protective advances will not be made in lieu of additional loans. 
I11(a) The maximum loss to be paid by the Agency will never exceed the original principal plus accrued interest regardless of any protective advances made. 
I11(b) Protective advances and interest thereon at the note rate will be guaranteed at the same percentage of loss as provided in the Loan Note Guarantee. 
I11(c) Protective advances must constitute an indebtedness of the borrower to the lender and be secured by the security instruments. Agency written authorization is required when cumulative protective advances exceed $5,000. 

I80�1A4287.157
I89Liquidation. 
I11In the event of one or more incidents of default or third party actions that the borrower cannot or will not cure or eliminate within a reasonable period of time, liquidation may be considered. If the lender concludes that liquidation is necessary, it must request the Agency's concurrence. The lender will liquidate the loan unless the Agency, at its option, carries out liquidation. When the decision to liquidate is made, if the loan has not already been repurchased, provisions will be made for repurchase in accordance with �1A4279.78 of subpart A of part 4279 of this chapter. 
I11(a) T3Decision to liquidate.G1T1 A decision to liquidate shall be made when it is determined that the default cannot be cured through actions contained in �1A4287.145 of this subpart or it has been determined that it is in the best interest of the Agency and the lender to liquidate. The decision to liquidate or continue with the borrower must be made as soon as possible when any of the following exist: 
I11(1) A loan has been delinquent 90 days and the lender and borrower have not been able to cure the delinquency through one of the actions contained in �1A4287.145 of this subpart. 
�553�I11(2) It has been determined that delaying liquidation will jeopardize full recovery on the loan. 
I11(3) The borrower or lender has been uncooperative in resolving the problem and the Agency or the lender has reason to believe the borrower is not acting in good faith, and it would enhance the position of the guarantee to liquidate immediately. 
I11(b) T3Liquidation by the Agency.G1T1 The Agency may require the lender to assign the security instruments to the Agency if the Agency, at its option, decides to liquidate the loan. When the Agency liquidates, reasonable liquidation expenses will be assessed against the proceeds derived from the sale of the collateral. Form FmHA 1980�0945, ``Notice of Liquidation Responsibility,'' will be forwarded to the Finance Office when the Agency liquidates the loan. 
I11(c) T3Submission of liquidation plan.G1T1 The lender will, within 30 days after a decision to liquidate, submit to the Agency in writing its proposed detailed method of liquidation. Upon approval by the Agency of the liquidation plan, the lender will commence liquidation. 
I11(d) T3Lender's liquidation plan.G1T1 The liquidation plan must include, but is not limited to, the following: 
I11(1) Such proof as the Agency requires to establish the lender's ownership of the guaranteed loan promissory note and related security instruments and a copy of the payment ledger if available which reflects the current loan balance and accrued interest to date and the method of computing the interest. 
I11(2) A full and complete list of all collateral including any personal and corporate guarantees. 
I11(3) The recommended liquidation methods for making the maximum collection possible on the indebtedness and the justification for such methods, including recommended action: 
I11(i) For acquiring and disposing of all collateral; and 
I11(ii) To collect from guarantors. 
I11(4) Necessary steps for preservation of the collateral. 
I11(5) Copies of the borrower's latest available financial statements. 
I11(6) Copies of the guarantor's latest available financial statements. 
I11(7) An itemized list of estimated liquidation expenses expected to be incurred along with justification for each expense. 
I11(8) A schedule to periodically report to the Agency on the progress of liquidation. 
I11(9) Estimated protective advance amounts with justification. 
I11(10) Proposed protective bid amounts on collateral to be sold at auction and a breakdown to show how the amounts were determined. 
I11(11) If a voluntary conveyance is considered, the proposed amount to be credited to the guaranteed debt. 
I11(12) Legal opinions, if needed. 
I11(13) If the outstanding balance of principal and accrued interest is less than $200,000, the lender will obtain an estimate of fair market and potential liquidation value of the collateral. If the outstanding balance of principal and accrued interest is $200,000 or more, the lender will obtain an independent appraisal report meeting the requirements of �1A4279.144 of subpartB of part 4279 of this chapter on all collateral securing the loan which will reflect the fair market value and potential liquidation value. In order to formulate a liquidation plan which maximizes recovery, collateral must be evaluated for the release of hazardous substances, petroleum products, or other environmental hazards which may adversely impact the market value of the collateral. The appraisal shall consider this aspect. The independent appraiser's fee, including the cost of the environmental site assessment, will be shared equally by the Agency and the lender. 
I11(e) T3Approval of liquidation plan.G1T1 The Agency will inform the lender in writing whether it concurs in the lender's liquidation plan. Should the Agency and the lender not agree on the liquidation plan, negotiations will take place between the Agency and the lender to resolve the disagreement. When the liquidation plan is approved by the Agency, the lender will proceed expeditiously with liquidation. 
I11(1) A transfer and assumption of the borrower's operation can be accomplished before or after the loan goes �554�into liquidation. However, if the collateral has been purchased through foreclosure or the borrower has conveyed title to the lender, no transfer and assumption is permitted. 
I11(2) A protective bid may be made by the lender, with prior Agency written approval, at a foreclosure sale to protect the lender's and the Agency's interest. The protective bid will not exceed the amount of the loan, including expenses of foreclosure, and should be based on the liquidation value considering estimated expenses for holding and reselling the property. These expenses include, but are not limited to, expenses for resale, interest accrual, length of time necessary for resale, maintenance, guard service, weatherization, and prior liens. 
I11(f) T3Acceleration.G1T1 The lender, or the Agency if it liquidates, will proceed to accelerate the indebtedness as expeditiously as possible when acceleration is necessary including giving any notices and taking any other legal actions required. A copy of the acceleration notice or other acceleration document will be sent to the Agency (or lender if the Agency liquidates). The guaranteed loan will be considered in liquidation once the loan has been accelerated and a demand for payment has been made upon the borrower. 
I11(g) T3Filing an estimated loss claim.G1T1 When the lender is conducting the liquidation and owns any or all of the guaranteed portion of the loan, the lender will file an estimated loss claim once a decision has been made to liquidate if the liquidation will exceed 90 days. The estimated loss payment will be based on the liquidation value of the collateral. For the purpose of reporting and loss claim computation, the lender will discontinue interest accrual on the defaulted loan in accordance with Agency procedures, and the loss claim will be promptly processed in accordance with applicable Agency regulations. 
I11(h) T3Accounting and reports.G1T1 When the lender conducts liquidation, it will account for funds during the period of liquidation and will provide the Agency with reports at least quarterly on the progress of liquidation including disposition of collateral, resulting costs, and additional procedures necessary for successful completion of the liquidation. 
I11(i) T3Transmitting payments and proceeds to the Agency.G1T1 When the Agency is the holder of a portion of the guaranteed loan, the lender will transmit to the Agency its T3pro rataG1T1 share of any payments received from the borrower; liquidation; or other proceeds using Form FmHA 1980�0943, ``Lender's Guaranteed Loan Payment to FmHA.'' 
I11(j) T3Abandonment of collateral.G1T1 There may be instances when the cost of liquidation would exceed the potential recovery value of the collection. The lender, with proper documentation and concurrence of the Agency, may abandon the collateral in lieu of liquidation. A proposed abandonment will be considered a servicing action requiring the appropriate environmental review by the Agency in accordance with subpart G of part 1940 of this title. Examples where abandonment may be considered include, but are not limited to: 
I11(1) The cost of liquidation is increased or the value of the collateral is decreased by environmental issues; 
I11(2) The collateral is functionally or economically obsolete; 
I11(3) There are superior liens held by other parties in excess of the value of the collateral; 
I11(4) The collateral has deteriorated; or 
I11(5) The collateral is specialized and there is little or no demand for it. 
I11(k) T3Disposition of personal or corporate guarantees.G1T1 The lender should take action to maximize recovery from all collateral, including personal and corporate guarantees. The lender will seek a deficiency judgment when there is a reasonable chance of future collection of the judgment. The lender must make a decision whether or not to seek a deficiency judgment when: 
I11(1) A borrower voluntarily liquidates the collateral, but the sale fails to pay the guaranteed indebtedness; 
I11(2) The collateral is voluntarily conveyed to the lender, but the borrower and personal and corporate guarantors are not released from liability; or 
I11(3) A liquidation plan is being developed for forced liquidation. 
I11(l) T3Compromise settlement.G1T1 A compromise settlement may be considered at any time. 
�555�I11(1) The lender and the Agency must receive complete financial information on all parties obligated for the loan and must be satisfied that the statements reflect the true and correct financial position of the debtor including all assets. Adequate consideration must be received before a release from liability is issued. Adequate consideration includes money, additional security, or other benefit to the goals and objectives of the Agency. 
I11(2) Before a personal guarantor can be released from liability, the following factors must be considered. 
I11(i) Cash, either lump sum or over a period of time, or other consideration offered by the guarantor; 
I11(ii) Age and health of the guarantor; 
I11(iii) Potential income of the guarantor; 
I11(iv) Inheritance prospects of the guarantor; 
I11(v) Availability of the guarantor's assets. 
I11(vi) Possibility that the guarantor's assets have been concealed or improperly transferred; and 
I11(vii) Effect of other guarantors on the loan. 
I11(3) Once the Agency and the lender agree on a reasonable amount that is fair and adequate, the lender can proceed to effect the settlement compromise. 
I11(4) A compromise will only be accepted if it is in the best interest of the Agency. 

I80�1A4287.158
I89Determination of loss and payment. 
I11In all liquidation cases, final settlement will be made with the lender after the collateral is liquidated, unless otherwise designated as a future recovery or after settlement and compromise of all parties has been completed. The Agency will have the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from any party which may be liable. 
I11(a) T3Report of loss form.G1T1 Form FmHA 449�0930, ``Loan Note Guarantee Report of Loss,'' will be used for calculations of all estimated and final loss determinations. Estimated loss payments may only be approved by the Agency after the Agency has approved a liquidation plan. 
I11(b) T3Estimated loss.G1T1 In accordance with the requirements of �1A4287.157(g) of this subpart, an estimated loss claim based on liquidation appraisal value will be prepared and submitted by the lender. 
I11(1) The estimated loss payment shall be applied as of the date of such payment. The total amount of the loss payment remitted by the Agency will be applied by the lender on the guaranteed portion of the loan debt. Such application does not release the borrower from liability. 
I11(2) An estimated loss will be applied first to reduce the principal balance on the guaranteed loan and the balance, if any, to accrued interest. Interest accrual on the defaulted loan will be discontinued. 
I11(3) A protective advance claim will be paid only at the time of the final report of loss payment, except in certain transfer and assumption situations as specified in �1A4287.134 of this subpart. 
I11(c) T3Final loss.G1T1 Within 30 days after liquidation of all collateral, except for certain unsecured personal or corporate guarantees as provided for in this section, is completed, a final report of loss must be prepared and submitted by the lender to the Agency. The Agency will not guarantee interest beyond this 30-day period other than for the period of time it takes the Agency to process the loss claim. Before approval by the Agency of any final loss report, the lender must account for all funds during the period of liquidation, disposition of the collateral, all costs incurred, and any other information necessary for the successful completion of liquidation. Upon receipt of the final accounting and report of loss, the Agency may audit all applicable documentation to determine the final loss. The lender will make its records available and otherwise assist the Agency in making any investigation. The documentation accompanying the report of loss must support the amounts shown on Form FmHA 449�0930. 
I11(1) A determination must be made regarding the collectibility of unsecured personal and corporate guarantees. If reasonably possible, such guarantees should be promptly collected or otherwise disposed of in accordance with �1A4287.157(k) of this subpart prior to �556�completion of the final loss report. However, in the event that collection from the guarantors appears unlikely or will require a prolonged period of time, the report of loss will be filed when all other collateral has been liquidated, and unsecured personal or corporate guarantees will be treated as a future recovery with the net proceeds to be shared on a pro rata basis by the lender and the Agency. 
I11(2) The lender must document that all of the collateral has been accounted for and properly liquidated and that liquidation proceeds have been properly accounted for and applied correctly to the loan. 
I11(3) The lender will show a breakdown of any protective advance amount as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, and evidence that the amount expended was proper and that payment was actually made. 
I11(4) The lender will show a breakdown of liquidation expenses as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, and evidence that the amount expended was proper and that payment was actually made. Liquidation expenses are recoverable only from collateral proceeds. Attorney fees may be approved as liquidation expenses provided the fees are reasonable and cover legal issues pertaining to the liquidation that could not be properly handled by the lender and its in-house counsel. 
I11(5) Accrued interest will be supported by documentation as to how the amount was accrued. If the interest rate was a variable rate, the lender will include documentation of changes in both the selected base rate and the loan rate. 
I11(6) Loss payments will be paid by the Agency within 60 days after the review of the final loss report and accounting of the collateral. 
I11(d) T3Loss limit.G1T1 The amount payable by the Agency to the lender cannot exceed the limits set forth in the Loan Note Guarantee. 
I11(e) T3Rent.G1T1 Any net rental or other income that has been received by the lender from the collateral will be applied on the guaranteed loan debt. 
I11(f) T3Liquidation costs.G1T1 Liquidation costs will be deducted from the proceeds of the disposition of primary collateral. If changed circumstances after submission of the liquidation plan require a substantial revision of liquidation costs, the lender will procure the Agency's written concurrence prior to proceeding with the proposed changes. No in-house expenses of the lender will be allowed. In-house expenses include, but are not limited to, employee's salaries, staff lawyers, travel, and overhead. 
I11(g) T3Payment.G1T1 When the Agency finds the final report of loss to be proper in all respects, it will approve Form FmHA 449�0930 and proceed as follows: 
I11(1) If the loss is greater than any estimated loss payment, the Agency will pay the additional amount owed by the Agency to the lender. 
I11(2) If the loss is less than the estimated loss payment, the lender will reimburse the Agency for the overpayment plus interest at the note rate from the date of payment. 
I11(3) If the Agency has conducted the liquidation, it will pay the lender in accordance with the Loan Note Guarantee.

I89Future recovery. 
I11After a loan has been liquidated and a final loss has been paid by the Agency, any future funds which may be recovered by the lender will be pro rated between the Agency and the lender based on the original percentage of guarantee. 

I80�1A4287.170
I89Bankruptcy. 
I11The lender is responsible for protecting the guaranteed loan and all collateral securing the loan in bankruptcy proceedings. 
I11(a) T3Lender's responsibilities.G1T1 It is the lender's responsibility to protect the guaranteed loan debt and all of the collateral securing it in bankruptcy proceedings. These responsibilities include but are not limited to the following: 
I11(1) The lender will file a proof of claim where necessary and all the necessary papers and pleadings concerning the case. 
I11(2) The lender will attend and, where necessary, participate in meetings of the creditors and all court proceedings. 
I11(3) When permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, the lender will request �557�modification of any plan of reorganization whenever it appears that additional recoveries are likely. 
I11(4) The Agency will be kept adequately and regularly informed in writing of all aspects of the proceedings. 
I11(5) In a Chapter 11 reorganization, if an independent appraisal of collateral is necessary in the Agency's opinion, the Agency and the lender will share such appraisal fee equally. 
I11(b) T3Reports of loss during bankruptcy.G1T1 When the loan is involved in reorganization proceedings, payment of loss claims may be made as provided in this section. For a liquidation proceeding, only paragraphs (b)(3) and (5) of this section are applicable. 
I11(1) T3Estimated loss payments.G1T1 (i) If a borrower has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Code for a reorganization (but not Chapter 13) and all or a portion of the debt has been discharged, the lender will request an estimated loss payment of the guaranteed portion of the accrued interest and principal discharged by the court. Only one estimated loss payment is allowed during the reorganization. All subsequent claims of the lender during reorganization will be considered revisions to the initial estimated loss. A revised estimated loss payment may be processed by the Agency, at its option, in accordance with any court-approved changes in the reorganization plan. Once the reorganization plan has been completed, the lender is responsible for submitting the documentation necessary for the Agency to review and adjust the estimated loss claim to reflect any actual discharge of principal and interest and to reimburse the lender for any court-ordered interest-rate reduction under the terms of the reorganization plan. 
I11(ii) The lender will use Form FmHA 449�0930 to request an estimated loss payment and to revise any estimated loss payments during the course of the reorganization plan. The estimated loss claim, as well as any revisions to this claim, will be accompanied by documentation to support the claim. 
I11(iii) Upon completion of a reorganization plan, the lender will complete a Form FmHA 1980�0944 and forward this form to the Finance Office. 
I11(2) T3Interest loss payments.G1T1 (i) Interest losses sustained during the period of the reorganization plan will be processed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section. 
I11(ii) Interest losses sustained after the reorganization plan is completed will be processed annually when the lender sustains a loss as a result of a permanent interest rate reduction which extends beyond the period of the reorganization plan. 
I11(iii) If an estimated loss claim is paid during the operation of the Chapter 11 reorganization plan and the borrower repays in full the remaining balance without an additional loss sustained by the lender, a final report of loss is not necessary. 
I11(3) T3Final loss payments.G1T1 Final loss payments will be processed when the loan is liquidated. 
I11(4) T3Payment applicationG1T1. The lender must apply estimated loss payments first to the unsecured principal of the guaranteed portion of the debt and then to the unsecured interest of the guaranteed portion of the debt. In the event a bankruptcy court attempts to direct the payments to be applied in a different manner, the lender will immediately notify the Agency servicing office. 
I11(5) T3Overpayments.G1T1 Upon completion of the reorganization plan, the lender will provide the Agency with the documentation necessary to determine whether the estimated loss paid equals the actual loss sustained. If the actual loss sustained as a result of the reorganization is less than the estimated loss, the lender will reimburse the Agency for the overpayment plus interest at the note rate from the date of payment of the estimated loss. If the actual loss is greater than the estimated loss payment, the lender will submit a revised estimated loss in order to obtain payment of the additional amount owed by the Agency to the lender. 
I11(6) T3Protective advances.G1T1 If approved protective advances were made prior to the borrower having filed bankruptcy, these protective advances and accrued interest will be considered in the loss calculations. 
I11(c) T3Legal expenses during bankruptcy proceedings.G1T1 (1) When a bankruptcy proceeding results in a liquidation of the �558�borrower by a trustee, legal expenses will be handled as directed by the court. 
I11(2) Chapter 11 pertains to a reorganization of a business contemplating an ongoing business rather than a termination and dissolution of the business where legal protection is afforded to the business as defined under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Consequently, expenses incurred by the lender in a Chapter 11 reorganization can never be liquidation expenses unless the proceeding becomes a Chapter 11 liquidation. If the proceeding should become a Liquidating 11, reasonable and customary liquidation expenses may be deducted from proceeds of collateral as provided in the Lender's Agreement. Chapter 7 pertains to a liquidation of the borrower's assets. If, and when, liquidation of the borrower's assets under Chapter 7 is conducted by the bankruptcy trustee, then the lender cannot claim expenses.
