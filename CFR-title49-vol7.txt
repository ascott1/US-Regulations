S8092

I11The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. 

I11Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows: 
Q02

I37Title 1 through Title 16 Las of January 1 

I37Title 17 through Title 27 Las of April 1 

I37Title 28 through Title 41 Las of July 1 

I37Title 42 through Title 50 Las of October 1 

I11The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. 
Q02

I10LEGAL STATUS 
Q02

I11The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). 

Q02

S8092

I10HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS 

Q02

I11The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule. 

I11To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, October 1, 1996), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule. 
Q02

I10EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES 
Q02

I11Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
Q02

I10OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
Q02

I11The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96�09511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. �vi�Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. 
Q02

I10OBSOLETE PROVISIONS 
Q02

I11Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949�091963, 1964�091972, or 1973�091985, published in seven separate volumes. For the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. 
Q02

I10CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES 
Q02

I11A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR T4Index and Finding Aids. T1This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume. 

I11An index to the text of ``Title 3_The President'' is carried within that volume.

I11The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register. 

I11A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles. 
Q02

I10REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
Q02

I11There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.
Q02

I10INQUIRIES 
Q02

I11For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd�09numbered pages.

I11For inquiries concerning CFR reference assistance, call 202�09523�095227 or write to the Director, Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC 20408.

          the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

    Authority: Sec. 20, 24 Stat. 386; 49 U.S.C. 20; sec. 220(a), 49

<R05>
Sec. 1200.1   Financial statements released by carriers.

    Carriers desiring to do so may prepare and publish financial 
statements in reports to stockholders and others, except in reports to 
this Commission, based on generally accepted accounting principles for 
which there is authoritative support, provided that any variance from 
this Commission's prescribed accounting rules contained in such 
statements is clearly disclosed in footnotes to the statements.

[32 FR 20123, Dec. 20, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 1200.2  Adoption of generally accepted accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

    (a) Accounting Series Circulars.  Following the release of a 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards by the FASB, and provided 
that the Bureau of Accounts of the Commission considers such standards 
appropriate for the Commission's accounting regulations, the Bureau of 
Accounts shall issue an Accounting Series Circular (ASC) requiring 
carriers under the Commission's jurisdiction to follow the new standards 
in their accounts and reports filed with the Commission. The Bureau 
shall also specify in the ASC the proper accounting procedures that the 
carriers shall follow.
    (b) Carriers' and Interested Parties' Comments on the ASC. The ASC 
issued by the Bureau of Accounts will remain effective until revoked by 
the Bureau of Accounts. After an ASC is issued, the Bureau of Accounts 
shall allow carriers and interested parties 45 days following the 
service date of the ASC during which the respondents may submit to the 
Bureau their comments and reasons either supporting or opposing the ASC.
    (c) Formal Adoption of the New Accounting Standards.  After 
considering the comments submitted in response to the ASC, and based on 
the proposal of the Bureau of Accounts, the Commission will decide 
whether or not to adopt the new accounting standards specified in the 
ASC by revising the Uniform Systems of Accounts, (49 CFR 1201 through 
1210).
    (d) Accounting Standards Not Appropriate for Commission's Use.  The 
Bureau of Accounts may determine that a new FASB Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards is not appropriate for use by carriers under the 
Commission's jurisdiction. In such instances, the Bureau shall issue an 
ASC to advise the carriers that the new standards shall not be used in 
their reports filed with the Commission. The carriers and interested 
parties shall be allowed 45 days following the ASC's service date to 
submit comments to the Commission. The Commission will then determine 
whether or not to revise the Uniform Systems of Accounts to conform to 
the new accounting standards.

<R03>
REGULATIONS PRESCRIBED--Table of Contents

<R05>

    (i) Regulations prescribed.  Carriers by railroad subject to 
provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and not independently operated 
as electric lines, and each lessor of such a carrier, shall comply with 
regulations in this part as presented hereinafter.
    (ii) Definitions. 
    1. Abandonment means the withdrawal from transportation service of a 
branch line or other track segment or facility, representing a permanent 
reduction in plant.
    2. Accounts means the accounts prescribed in this system of 
accounts.
    3. Actually issued as applied to funded debt securities or capital 
stock issued or assumed by the company, means those which have been sold 
to bona fide purchasers or holders for a valuable consideration 
(including those issued in exchange for other securities or other 
property) and such purchasers or holders secured them free from control 
by the carriers. Also securities issued as dividends on stock.
    4. Actually outstanding as applied to funded debt securities or 
capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier means those which have 
been actually issued and are neither retired and canceled nor reacquired 
and held by or for the accounting company.
    5. (a) Affiliated companies means companies or persons that 
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries control, or 
are controlled by, or are under common control with, the accounting 
carrier.
    (b) Control (including the terms controlling, controlled by, and 
under common control with) means the possession directly or indirectly, 
of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and 
policies of a company, whether such power is exercised through one or 
more intermediary companies, or alone, or in conjunction with, or 
pursuant to an agreement, and whether such power is established through 
a majority of minority ownership or voting of securities, common 
directors, officers or stockholders, voting trusts, holding trusts, 
associated companies, contract or any other direct or indirect means.
    6. Amortization means the gradual extinguishment of an amount in an 
account by distributing such amount over a fixed period dependent on the 
requirements of regulatory bodies, over the life of the asset or 
liability to which it applies, or over the period during which it is 
anticipated the benefit will be realized.
    7. Carrier as used herein and when not otherwise indicated in the 
context means any carrier to which this system of accounts is 
applicable.
    8. Consolidation means the formation of a new company. See 
instruction 2-15.
    9. Commission means the Interstate Commerce Commission.
    10. Compensating balance means the portion of any demand deposit (or 
any time deposit or certificate of deposit) maintained by a carrier (or 
by any person on behalf of the carrier) which constitutes support for 
existing borrowing arrangements of the carrier with a lending 
institution. Such arrangements include both outstanding borrowings and 
the assurance of future credit availability. (The compensating balance 
requirement should be adjusted by the amount of float unless such 
adjustment would cause the compensating balance to be greater than the 
cash balance per carrier's books.) The float adjustment is made by 
subtracting the float from the compensating balance requirement if the 
collected bank ledger balance exceeds the cash balance per carrier's 
books or by adding the float to the compensating balance requirement if 
the collected bank ledger balance is less than the cash balance per 
carrier's books.
    (a) Float means deposits and withdrawals in transit which constitute 
a difference between the collected bank

[[Page 12]]

ledger balance and the cash balance per carrier's books.
    11. Cost center refers to an organizational subdivision for which 
cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate 
costs such as a terminal, yard, or track segment. A cost center may 
correspond to a given area of responsibility for which costs are 
presently accumulated for planning and control. A cost center is the 
smallest segment of activity or area of responsibility for which costs 
are accumulated and directly traceable.
    12. Cost of renewal means the cost of additional material applied 
(other than the value assigned second-hand parts remaining in the 
rebuilt unit) plus the cost of labor used in the rebuilding process, 
exclusive of the portion applicable to dismantling and repair of old 
parts reused.
    13. Cost of removal means cost of demolishing, dismantling, tearing 
down or otherwise removing property.
    14. Debt issue cost means all costs in connection with the issuance 
and sale of evidences of debt, such as fees for drafting mortgages and 
trust deeds; fees for issuing or recording evidences of debt; cost of 
engraving and printing bonds and certificates of indebtedness; fees paid 
trustees, specific costs of obtaining governmental authority; fees for 
legal services; fees and commissions paid underwriters, brokers and 
salespeople for marketing such evidences for debt; fees and costs of 
listing on exchanges; and other like costs.
    15. Discount as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock 
issued or assumed by the carrier, means the excess of the par or face 
value of the securities plus interest or dividends accrued at the date 
of the sale over the cash value of the consideration received from their 
sale.
    16. Equity security encompasses any instrument representing 
ownership shares (e.g., common, preferred and other capital stock), or 
the right to acquire (e.g., warrants, rights, and call options) or 
dispose of (e.g., put options) ownership shares in an enterprise at 
fixed or determinable prices. The term does not encompass preferred 
stock that by its terms either must be redeemed by the issuing 
enterprise or is redeemable at the option of the investor, nor does it 
include treasury stock or convertible bonds.
    (a) Marketable, as applied to an equity security, means an equity 
security as to which sales prices or bid and ask prices are currently 
available on a national securities exchange (i.e., those registered with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission) or in the over-the-counter 
market. In the over-the-counter market, an equity security shall be 
considered marketable when a quotation is publicly reported by the 
National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotations System 
or by the National Quotations Bureau, Inc. (provided, in the latter 
case, that quotations are available from at least three dealers). Equity 
securities traded in foreign markets shall be considered marketable when 
such markets are of a breadth and scope comparable to those referred to 
above. This definition is not met by restricted stock (securities for 
which sale is restricted by a governmental or contractual requirement 
except where such requirement terminates within one year or where the 
holder has the power to cause the requirement to be met within one 
year). Any portion of the stock which can reasonably be expected to 
qualify for sale within one year, such as may be the case under Rule 144 
or similar rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is not 
considered restricted.
    (b) Market value refers to the aggregate of the market price of a 
single share or unit times the number of shares or units of each 
marketable equity security in the portfolio. When an equity has taken 
positions involving short sales, sales of calls, and purchases of puts 
for marketable equity securities and the same securities are included in 
the portfolio, those contracts shall be taken into consideration in the 
determination of market value of the marketable equity securities.
    (c) Cost, as applied to a marketable equity security, refers to the 
original cost unless a new cost basis has been assigned based on 
recognition of an impairment of value that was deemed other than 
temporary or as the result of a transfer between current and noncurrent 
classifications. In such cases,

[[Page 13]]

the new cost basis assigned shall be considered cost.
    17. (a) Income taxes means taxes based on income determined under 
provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code and foreign, state 
and other taxes (including franchise taxes) based on income.
    (b) Income tax expense means the amount of income taxes (whether or 
not currently payable or refundable) allocable to a period in the 
determination of net income.
    (c) Pretax accounting income means income or loss for a period, 
exclusive of related income tax expense.
    (d) Taxable income means the excess of revenues over deductions or 
the excess of deductions over revenue to be reported for income tax 
purposes for a period.
    (e) Timing differences means differences between the periods in 
which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they 
enter into the determination of pretax accounting income. Timing 
differences originate in one period and reverse or turn around in one or 
more subsequent periods. Some timing differences reduce income taxes 
that would otherwise be payable currently; others increase income taxes 
that would otherwise be payable currently.
    (f) Permanent differences means differences between taxable income 
and pretax accounting income arising from transactions that, under 
applicable tax laws and regulations, will not be offset by corresponding 
differences or turn around in other periods.
    (g) Tax effects means differentials in income taxes of a period 
attributable to (1) revenue or expense transactions which enter into the 
determination of pretax accounting income in one period and into the 
determination of taxable income in another period, (2) deductions or 
credits that may be carried backward or forward for income tax purposes 
and (3) adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to other 
stockholders' equity accounts which enter into the determination of 
taxable income in a period but which do not enter into the determination 
of pretax accounting income of that period. A permanent difference does 
not result in a tax effect as that term is used in this definition.
    (h) Deferred taxes means tax effects which are deferred for 
allocation to income tax expense of future periods.
    (i) Interperiod tax allocation means the process of apportioning 
income taxes among periods.
    (j) Tax allocation within a period means the process of apportioning 
income tax expenses applicable to a given period between income before 
extraordinary items and extraordinary items, and of associating the 
income tax effects of adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to 
other stockholders' equity accounts with these items.
    18. (a) Investor means a business entity that holds an investment in 
voting stock of another company.
    (b) Investee means a corporation that issued voting stock held by an 
investor.
    (c) Corporate joint venture is a company owned and operated as a 
separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the 
members of the group. Joint facilities for purposes of this system of 
accounts are not considered corporate joint ventures.
    (d) Dividends when applied to distributions received from investees 
unless otherwise specified, means dividends received or receivable in 
cash, other assets, or another class of stock and does not include stock 
dividends or stock splits.
    (e) Earnings or losses of an investee and financial position of an 
investee refer to net income (or net loss) and financial position of an 
investee determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles.
    (f) Undistributed earnings of an investee means net income less 
dividends declared whether received or not.
    (g) Date of acquisition is the date on which the investor assumes 
the rights of ownership. Ordinarily, this is the date assets are 
received and other assets are given or securities issued.
    19. Joint facility means any owned or leased carrier operating 
property occupied or operated jointly by the carrier and one or more 
other carriers, under an arrangement whereby the cost and income are 
apportioned to the parties to the joint agreement. Portions of a

[[Page 14]]

structure or other property used exclusively by each of two or more 
carriers are not joint facilities.
    20. Ledger value of an account means the undepreciated or 
unamortized cost of acquisition of the item to the carrier, recorded in 
the general ledger. In case the cost of any item of property is not 
shown separately in the ledger, the ledger value of that item shall be 
its proportionate share of the value of the entire group in which the 
particular property is included.
    21. Merger means the acquisition of one company by another. See 
instruction 2-15.
    22. Minor items of property means the associated parts or items of 
which units of property are composed.
    23. Net railway operating income: Operating revenue remaining after 
deducting operating expenses, income taxes on ordinary income, and the 
provision for deferred income taxes. Also, in arriving at NROI, deduct 
the Income from Lease of Road and Equipment and add the Rent for Leased 
Road and Equipment, formerly accounts 509 and 542, respectively.
    24. Net salvage value means salvage value of property retired less 
the cost of removal.
    25. Nominally issued as applied to funded debt securities or capital 
stock issued or assumed by the carrier, means those which have been 
signed, certified by trustees, or otherwise executed, and placed with 
the proper officer for sale and delivery, or pledged, or otherwise 
placed in some special fund of the accounting company, but which have 
not been sold or issued directly to the trustees of such fund in 
accordance with contractual requirements.
    26. Nominally outstanding as applied to funded debt securities or 
capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier, means those which, after 
being actually issued, have been reacquired by or for the accounting 
company under such circumstances which require them to be considered as 
held alive and not retired and canceled.
    27. Premium as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock 
issued or assumed by the carrier, means the excess of the cash value of 
the consideration received from their sale over the sum of their par 
(stated value of no par stock) or face value and interest or dividends 
accrued at the date of sale.
    28. Programmed track replacements are costs incurred as part of a 
track replacement program or planned expenditures. Programmed track 
replacements are generally performed by relatively large work gangs 
which, on the basis of programmed and authorized work orders, use heavy 
mechanized equipment to replace rail, ties and other track material. For 
guidance on what not to capitalize, see the notes to the text of 
Accounts 8, 9 and 11.
    29. Property retired means units of property which have been 
removed, sold, abandoned, destroyed, or which for any cause have been 
permanently withdrawn from service; also minor items of property not 
replaced.
    30. Rail Transportation Property. Rail transportation property is 
all property and other assets, irrespective of ownership, that comprise 
the entire operating unit devoted to rail transportation service. This 
definition comprises the following accounts:

701  Cash
703  Special deposits
704  Loans and notes receivable
705  Accounts receivable--interline and other balances
706  Accounts receivable--customers
707   Accounts receivable--other
708.5  Receivable with affiliated companies
709  Accrued accounts receivable
710  Working funds
711  Prepayments
712  Material and supplies
713  Other current assets
714  Deferred income tax charges
731  Road and equipment property
732  Improvements on leased property

    31. Salvage value means the amount received from the sale of 
operating property retired less any expenses in connection with the sale 
or in preparing the property for sale. If the property is retained for 
reuse, the salvage value shall be recorded in account 712, Materials and 
Supplies, or other appropriate account at an amount not to exceed its 
recorded cost (actual or average), or current market value, whichever is 
lower.
    32. Segment of a business refers to a component of an entity whose 
activities represent a separate major line of

[[Page 15]]

business or class of customer. A segment may be in the form of a 
subsidiary, a division, or a department, and in some cases a joint 
venture or other non-subsidiary investee, provided that its assets, 
results of operations, and activities can be clearly distinguished, 
physically and operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from 
the other assets, results of operations, and activities of the entity. 
The fact that the results of operations of the segment being sold or 
abandoned cannot be separately identified strongly suggests that the 
transaction should not be classified as a disposal of a segment of 
business.
    (a) Measurement date means the date on which the management having 
authority to approve the action commits itself to a formal plan to 
dispose of a segment of the business, whether by abandonment or sale. 
The measurement date for disposals requiring Commission approval shall 
be the service date of the Order authorizing the disposal.
    (b) Disposal date refers to the date of closing the sale, if the 
disposal is by sale or the date that operations cease if the disposal is 
by abandonment.
    33. Service life means the period between the date when operating 
property is placed in service and the date of its retirement.
    34. Service value means the ledger value of operating property less 
its salvage value (see definition 17).
    35. Track maintenance is material and labor costs of routine track 
repairs such as sporadic tie replacement, repair of broken rails, 
tightening track bolts and track spikes. A more complete list of 
maintenance items are included in notes to the text of Accounts 8, 9 and 
11.
    36. Work equipment means equipment which can be coupled in a train 
for movement over the carrier's tracks, and which is used in the 
carrier's work service. See equipment listing for account 57, Work 
equipment.

    1-1  Classification of carriers. (a) For purposes of accounting and 
reporting, carriers are grouped into the following three classes:
    Class I: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $250 
million or more after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula 
shown in Note A.
    Class II: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of less 
than $250 million but in excess of $20 million after applying the 
railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.
    Class III: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $20 
million or less after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula 
shown in Note A.
    (b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by 
annual carrier operating revenues after the railroad revenue deflator 
adjustment. Upward and downward reclassification will be effected as of 
January 1 in the year immediately following the third consecutive year 
of revenue qualification.
    (2) If a Class II or Class III carrier's classification is changed 
based on three years' adjusted revenues the carrier shall complete and 
file the Classification Index Survey Form with the Commission by March 
31 of the year following the end of the period to which it relates.
    (3) Newly organized carriers shall be classified on the basis of 
their annual carrier operating revenues after railroad revenue deflator 
adjustment for the latest period of operation. If actual data are not 
available, new carriers shall be classified on the basis of their 
carrier operating revenues known and estimated for a year (after 
railroad revenue deflator adjustment).
    (4) When a business combination occurs, such as a merger, 
reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be 
reclassified effective January 1 of the next calendar year on the basis 
of the combined revenue for the year when the combination occurred 
(after railroad revenue deflator adjustment).
    (5) In unusual circumstances, such as partial liquidation and 
curtailment or elimination of contracted services, where regulations 
will unduly burden the carrier, the carrier may request the

[[Page 16]]

Commission for an exception to the regulations. This request shall be in 
writing specifying the conditions justifying an exception.
    (c) Class I carriers shall keep all of the accounts of this system 
which are applicable to their operations. Class II and III carriers are 
not required to maintain the accounts of this system.
    (d) All switching and terminal companies, regardless of their 
operating revenues will be designated Class III carriers.
    (e) Unless provided for otherwise, all electric railway carriers, 
regardless of operating revenues, will be designated Class III carriers.

    Note A: The railroad revenue deflator formula is based on the 
Railroad Freight Price Index developed by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. The formula is as follows:

Current Year's Revenues  x  (1991 Average Index/Current Year's Average 
Index)

    Note B: See related regulations 49 CFR 1241.15 Railroad 
classification survey form.

[57 FR 27185, June 18, 1992; 57 FR 31754, July 17, 1992]

    1-2  Classification of accounts. (a) Accounts are prescribed to 
cover cost of property used in transportation operations and operations 
incidental thereto and for revenues, expenses, taxes, rents, and other 
items of income for such operations. Separate accounts are prescribed 
for investment in property not used in transportation operations and for 
other investments and income therefrom; for unusual and infrequent 
items; for operations and disposal of discontinued segments; for 
extraordinary items and accounting changes; and for assets, liabilities 
and capital includable in the balance sheet statement. Retained earnings 
accounts form the connecting link between the income account and the 
equity section of the balance sheet. They are provided to record the 
transfer of net income or loss for the year; certain capital 
transactions; and, when authorized by the Commission, other items.
    (b) The cost of property, and the revenues, expenses, taxes and 
rents for miscellaneous operations involving the use of such facilities 
as hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, storage warehouses, power 
plants, cold storage plants, etc., shall not be included in the accounts 
prescribed for transportation operations unless the operation of the 
facilities is conducted by the railway companies in connection with 
furnishing transportation services. Likewise, the cost of property, the 
revenues, expenses, taxes, and rents arising from the operation of 
stockyards shall not be included in accounts prescribed for 
transportation operations unless operation of the facilities is 
conducted in connection with transportation of livestock. It is not 
intended that cost of property and income arising from incidental public 
stockyards service rendered by stockyards primarily devoted to 
transportation services shall be excluded from transportation operation 
accounts.
    (c) Joint facility accounts are provided for the joint users of 
tracks, bridges, yards, wharves, stations, and other facilities in which 
to record items in settlement for use of such facilities. When the 
compensation for the use of facilities is a fixed amount or is based 
upon a charge per passenger, ton, car or other unit, the amount shall be 
fairly apportioned by the operating company among the joint facility 
operating expense and income accounts. The creditor shall show the 
distribution of these charges upon its bills, and such distribution 
shall be adhered to by the debtor. Train service in connection with the 
line haul of traffic, including that operated under a joint arrangement 
for the benefit of two or more carriers, is not considered a joint 
facility operation.
    (d)(1) Extraordinary Items. All items of profit and loss recognized 
during the year are includable in ordinary income unless evidence 
clearly supports their classification as extraordinary items.
    Extraordinary items are characterized by both their unusual nature 
and infrequent occurrence taking into account the environment in which 
the firm operates; they must also meet the materiality standard.
    Unusual means the event or transaction must possess a high degree of 
abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally 
related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity.
    Infrequent occurrence means the event or transaction shall be of a 
type

[[Page 17]]

not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future.
    (2) Unusual or Infrequent Items. Material events unusual in nature 
or infrequent in occurrence but not both, thus not meeting both criteria 
for classification as extraordinary, shall be includable in the accounts 
provided as separate components of income/expense from continuing 
operations.
    (3) Discontinued Operations. The results of continuing operations 
shall be reported separately from discontinued operations and any gain 
or loss resulting from disposal of a segment of a business (see 
definition 23(a)) shall be reported in conjunction with the related 
results of discontinued operations and not as an extraordinary item. The 
disposal of a segment of a business shall be distinguished from other 
disposals of assets incident to the evolution of the entity's business, 
such as the disposal of part of a line of business, the shifting of 
production or marketing activities for a particular line of business 
from one location to another, the phasing out of a product line or class 
of service, and other changes occasioned by technological improvements. 
If a loss is expected from the proposed sale or abandonment of a 
segment, the estimated loss shall be provided for at the measurement 
date (see definition 23(b)). If a gain is expected, it shall be 
recognized when realized, which ordinarily is the disposal date (see 
definition 23(c)).
    (4) Prior period adjustments. Only the following two items of profit 
and loss shall be accounted for and reported as prior period adjustments 
and excluded from the determination of net income for the current 
period:
    (1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior 
period, and
    (2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits 
of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased 
subsidiaries.
    With the exception of the two items just mentioned, all items of 
profit and loss recognized during a period shall be included in the 
determination of net income for that period.

    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules is needed or obtain an 
interpretation from its public accountant or the Commission.

    (5) Accounting Changes. Errors in financial statements result from 
mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting 
principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the 
financial statements were prepared. In contrast, a change in an 
accounting estimate results from new information or subsequent 
developments and from better insight or judgment. Correction of an error 
should be accomplished through a prior period adjustment [See 
Instruction 1-2(d)(4)]. Changes in an accounting estimate should be 
accounted for in the period of change (and future period if the change 
affects both)(See Instruction 1-7). A change in an accounting principle 
or accounting entity should be referred to this Commission for approval. 
The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should 
ordinarily be reflected in the account provided for in determining net 
income.
    (6) Materiality. As a general standard an item shall be considered 
material when it exceeds 10 percent of annual income (loss) before 
extraordinary items. An item may also be considered in relation to the 
trend of annual earnings before extraordinary items or other appropriate 
criteria. Items shall be considered individually and not in the 
aggregate in determining materiality. However, the effects of a series 
of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable 
event or plan of action shall be aggregated to determine materiality.
    (7) Commission Approval and Accountant's Letter. Items shall be 
included in the accounts provided for extraordinary items, unusual or 
infrequent items, discontinued operations, prior period adjustments and 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles only upon approval 
of the Commission. If the carrier retains the service of an independent 
accountant, a request for using these accounts shall be accompanied by a 
letter from the independent accountant approving or otherwise commenting 
on the request.


[[Page 18]]


    Note: The carrier may refer to generally accepted accounting 
principles for further guidance in applying paragraph (d) above.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977 as amended at 43 FR 37455, Aug. 23, 1978; 52 
FR 4321, 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-3  Records. (a) Each carrier shall keep its books of account, and 
all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in 
such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full 
information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be 
supported by such detailed information as will permit ready 
identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant 
thereto.
    (b) All expenditures including the expense accounts of officers and 
employees shall be supported by vouchers, payrolls, receipted bills, 
canceled checks, receipts for petty cash payments, or other evidences of 
the expenditures incurred.
    (c) The books referred to herein include not only books of accounts 
in a limited technical sense but all other records such as minute books, 
stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which will be 
useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.
    (d) No carrier shall destroy any books, records, memoranda, etc., 
which support entries to its accounts unless destruction is permitted by 
the regulations governing preservation of records, Part 1220 of this 
chapter.
    (e) In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary 
accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts may be kept, provided the 
integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
    (f) Cost detail shall be maintained by cost centers for purposes of 
cost assignments effective 1-1-79. This provides for cost control and 
cost planning at any designated area of responsibility. These cost 
centers shall be similarly defined as the railroads' existing 
responsibility centers. Cost center information shall therefore be kept 
at the same level of detail presently collected, categorized, and 
maintained in railroad internal managerial accounting systems. This 
detailed information shall not be reported to the Commission on an 
ongoing basis. However, the carrier shall keep the detailed information 
to provide a ready analysis and verification of the costs collected by 
cost center.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987; 61 
FR 9113, Mar. 7, 1996]

    1-4  Accounting period. (a) Each carrier shall keep its books on a 
monthly basis so that known transactions, as nearly as may be 
ascertained, shall be entered in the accounts not later than 60 days 
after the last day of the period for which the accounts are stated, 
except that the time within which the final entries for the year ending 
December 31 shall be made may be extended to such date in the following 
March as shall not interfere with the preparation and filing of annual 
report.
    (b) A trial balance of the general ledger accounts shall be prepared 
at the close of each month setting out the account number, title, and 
amount of each ledger account. (Mechanical, electronic or automatic data 
processing printout documentation producing the equivalent of manually 
prepared trial balances shall identify balances by account numbers.) At 
the end of the calendar year, the revenue, expense, and other income 
accounts shall be closed into retained earnings account, and the balance 
sheet account balances shall be brought forward to the general ledger 
for the succeeding year.
    (c) No changes shall be made in the accounts for periods covered by 
quarterly and annual reports that have been filed with the Commission 
unless the changes have first been authorized by the Commission.
    1-5  Accrual method of accounting. The accounting for operating 
revenues, operating expenses, income and other items each month and year 
shall be, as nearly as practicable, upon the basis of accruals 
consistently applied. Any change in practice of accounting for accruals 
or any unusual accruals involving material amounts shall be reported 
promptly to the Commission.
    1-6  Charges to be just and reasonable. All charges to the accounts 
prescribed in this system of accounts for carrier property, operating 
revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, and other carrier 
expenses, shall be just, reasonable and not exceed amounts necessary to 
the honest and efficient

[[Page 19]]

operation and management of carrier business. Payments shall not exceed 
the fair market value of goods and services acquired in an arm's length 
transaction. Any payments in excess of such just and reasonable charges 
shall be included in account 551, Miscellaneous income charges.
    1-7  Changes in accounting estimates. Changes in accounting estimate 
arising during the current year which are applicable to prior years 
shall be included in the same account which would have been charged or 
credited if the item had been taken up or the adjustment made in the 
year to which it pertained. [See Instruction 1-2(d)(5) for Accounting 
Changes].

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-8  Accounting for computer systems and word processing costs. (a) 
Capitalized costs for computer systems and word processing equipment 
shall be charged to property account 59, when such costs are not 
dedicated to a particular function (See Account 59). Related 
depreciation expenses for capitalized costs shall be charged to account 
62-23-00, Depreciation, Other Equipment.
    (b) Repair and maintenance costs related to computer systems and 
word processing equipment shall be charged to function 46 of the Other 
equipment subactivity by appropriate natural expense (labor, material, 
purchased services, other). Repairs performed by an outside company 
shall be charged to operating expense account 39-23-46.
    (c) Operating costs related to computer systems and word processing 
equipment shall be charged to function 87, Management services and data 
and word processing, when the equipment benefits more than one activity. 
When the equipment benefits one activity only, such operating costs 
shall be charged to the activity/function benefited.

[52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-9  Transactions with affiliated companies. (a) The records and 
supporting data of all transactions with affiliated companies shall be 
maintained in a separate file. The types of transactions referred to in 
this paragraph are for management services or any other type of services 
rendered, sale or use of facilities or any other type of assets or 
property. The file shall be maintained so as to enable the carrier, upon 
a Commission request, to furnish accurate information with supporting 
documentation about particular transactions within 15 days of the 
request. We do not intend the file to include data relating to ordinary 
carrier operations (e.g. lawful tariff charges or interchange of 
equipment).
    (b) Each bill rendered by an affiliated company shall state 
specifically the basis used for determining charges, unless the file 
contains the information to support the specific basis for charges.
    (c) Punched cards, magnetic tapes, discs, or other machine-sensible 
devices used for recording, consolidating, and summarizing accounting 
transactions and records with a carrier's electronic or automatic data 
processing system may constitute a file within the meaning of this 
instruction.
    (d) The carrier shall record, as the cost of assets or services 
received from an affiliated supplier, the invoice price (plus any 
incidental costs related to those transactions) in those cases where the 
invoice price can be determined from a prevailing price list of the 
affiliated supplier available to the general public in the normal course 
of business. If no such price list exists, the charges shall be recorded 
at the lower of their cost to the originating affiliated supplier (less 
all applicable valuation reserves in case of asset sales, or their 
estimated fair market value determined on the basis of a representative 
study of similar competitive and arm's-length or bargained transaction. 
Any difference between actual transaction price and the above, as well 
as charges that are not transportation related, shall be considered of a 
financing nature and shall be recorded, accordingly, as nonoperating 
charges or credits. (See instruction 1-6.)
    (e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as restraining the 
carrier from subdividing accounts (see instruction I-3(e)) for the 
purpose of recording separately transactions with affiliated companies.

[[Page 20]]

    (f) Carriers reporting information on a consolidated or combined 
basis in railroad Annual Report Form R-1 shall maintain a file with 
appropriate records and supporting data. This shall include work sheets 
showing revenues, expenses, earnings, investment in assets and 
accumulated depreciation for all affiliated railroads and rail-related 
affiliated companies. The work sheets shall also disclose any 
eliminations. Carriers shall also disclose the methodology used to 
support segregation of rail-related or other items as appropriate. 
Further, a file shall be maintained to support and reconcile entity 
sales, transfers and reclassifications as well as taxes deducted from 
gains or losses.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 53 FR 46620, Nov. 18, 1988]

    1-10  Accounting for income taxes. (a) The interperiod tax 
allocation method of accounting shall be applied where material timing 
differences (see definition 20(e)) occur between pretax accounting 
income and taxable income. Carriers may elect, as provided by the 
Revenue Act of 1971, to account for the investment tax credit by either 
the flow through method or the deferred method of accounting. See 
paragraphs (d) and (e) below. All income taxes (Federal, state and 
other) currently accruable for income tax return purposes shall be 
charged to account 556, Income taxes on ordinary income, and account 
590, Income Taxes on Extraordinary Items, as applicable.
    (b) Under the interperiod tax allocation method of accounting the 
tax effect of timing differences (see definition 20) originating in the 
current accounting period are allocated to income tax expense of future 
periods when the timing differences reverse. Similar timing differences 
originating and reversing in the current accounting period should be 
combined into groups and the current tax rates applied to determine the 
tax effect of each group. A carrier shall not apply other than current 
tax rates in determining the tax effect of reversing differences except 
upon approval of the Commission. When determining the amount of deferred 
taxes, rather than computing state and other taxes individually by 
jurisdiction, the Federal income tax rate may be increased by a percent 
equivalent to the effect of taxes imposed by the jurisdictions. In 
classifying a deferred charge or credit as current or noncurrent a 
carrier shall follow the classification criteria used for the related 
asset or liability which caused the timing difference. A deferred charge 
or credit that is not related to an asset or liability because (a) there 
is no associated asset or liability or (b) reduction of an associated 
asset or liability will not cause the timing difference to reverse shall 
be classified based on the expected reversal date of the specific timing 
difference. Such classification disregards any additional timing 
differences that may arise and is based on the criteria used for 
classifying other assets and liabilities.
    (c) The future tax benefits of loss carryforwards shall normally be 
recognized in the year in which such loss is applied to reduce taxes. 
Only in those unusual instances when realization is assured beyond any 
reasonable doubt should the future tax benefits of loss carryforwards be 
recognized in the year of loss. The tax effects of any realizable loss 
carrybacks shall be recognized in the determination of net income (loss) 
of the loss periods; appropriate adjustments of existing net deferred 
tax credits may also be necessary in the loss period.
    (d) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by 
the flow through method shall credit account 556 Income taxes on 
ordinary income, or account 590, Income taxes on extraordinary items, as 
applicable, and charge account 760, Federal income taxes accrued, with 
the amount of investment tax credit utilized in the current accounting 
period. When the flow through method is followed for the investment tax 
credit, account 557, Provision for Deferred Taxes, shall reflect the 
difference between the tax payable (after recognition of allowable 
investment tax credit) based on taxable income and tax expense (with 
full recognition of investment tax credit that would be allowable based 
on accounting income) based on accounting income.

[[Page 21]]

    (e) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by 
the deferred method shall concurrently with making the entries 
prescribed in (d) above charge account 557, Provision for deferred 
taxes, or account 591, Provision for deferred taxes--extraordinary item, 
as applicable, and shall credit account 786, Accumulated deferred income 
tax credits, with the investment tax credit utilized as a reduction of 
the current year's tax liability but deferred for accounting purposes. 
The investment tax credit so deferred shall be amortized by credits to 
account 557, Provision for deferred taxes.

    Note A: Any change in practice of accounting for the investment tax 
credit shall be reported promptly to the Commission. Carriers desiring 
to clear deferred investment tax credits because of a change from the 
deferral method to the flow though method shall submit the proposed 
journal entry to the Commission for consideration and advice.
    Note B: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the accounting rules for income 
taxes is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant 
or the Commission.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 47 FR 12350, Mar. 23, 1982; 52 
FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-11  Items in texts of accounts. The items appearing in the texts 
of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly 
indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The items are 
intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an 
item in the text of a primary account warrants the inclusion of the item 
in the account mentioned only when the whole text also indicates 
inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one 
primary account. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by 
the entire text of each primary account.
    1-12  Distribution of pay and expenses of employees. (a) The pay and 
expenses of officers or employees regularly assigned to specific duties 
who perform incidental services of a different nature involving small 
expense may be included in the appropriate expense accounts for the 
duties to which such officers or employees are regularly assigned.
    (b) When it is necessary to apportion the pay of officers and 
employees among various accounts, the carrier shall apportion the pay on 
the basis of the directly assignable pay to the various accounts.
    1-13  Payroll related expenses. (a) Fringe benefits (account series 
12-00-00) distributed to the activities using one of the following 
techniques (in order of preference):
    (1) Apply appropriate factors to the total of the fringe expense 
account, in such a way as to distribute an equitable proportion of cost 
to each activity. These factors shall be developed to take into account 
variables such as the following:
    (i) The effect of seniority on the expense. For example, profit 
sharing or pensions may be available to only certain categories of 
employees, which may be more predominant in one activity than another.
    (ii) The effect of the type of work performed. For example, 
workmen's compensation expense may vary for each category of employees 
because of the rate charged or the claims experience of the category.
    (iii) Any other variable which may have an appreciable effect on the 
equity of the apportionment.
    (2) Distribute the amount in the same proportion as the pay charged 
to each activity in account series 11-00-00 (salaries and wages).
    (3) Distribute the amounts using any other equitable basis which the 
carrier can substantiate.
    (b) All carriers shall be prepared to describe the basis of 
apportionment used to distribute expenses included in this instruction.
    (c) Any carrier which finds it impracticable to distribute expenses 
as required by this instruction should furnish the Commission with full 
particulars of the conditions which prevent the proper distribution. 
Upon receipt of such information carrier will be advised of the 
procedure to be followed.
    1-14  Submission of questions. To maintain uniformity of accounting, 
carriers shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the 
Commission for consideration and decision.

[[Page 22]]

    1-15  Transfers from government authorities. When a Federal, State, 
or municipal government transfers cash or other assets to a railroad, 
the transaction shall be accounted for in accordance with the provisions 
set forth hereunder.
    (a) The following forms of government transfers shall be included in 
account 502, Railway Operating Revenues--Transfers from Government 
Authorities for Current Operations when received:
    (1) Payments as reimbursement for operating losses sustained on a 
specific line, or in a certain region. Examples include support of 
commuter operations of a railroad, and local rail service assistance 
subsidies granted to a railroad under authority of the Railroad 
Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976;
    (2) Subsidies designated by the donor to offset operating expenses 
of the railroad, and
    (3) Subsidies which may be applied at the discretion of the 
recipient to operating expenses and/or operating property.
    (b) Government transfers relating to the acquisition, addition to, 
or improvement of depreciable operating property shall be included in 
account 783, Deferred Revenues--Transfers from Government Authorities 
when received. Account 783 shall be periodically charged, and account 
503, Railway Operating Revenues--Amortization of Deferred Transfers from 
Government Authorities shall be credited with amounts equal to the 
depreciation costs of the assets to which they apply.
    (c) Government transfers in the form of, or designated for the 
purchase of nondepreciable operating property shall be included in 
account 796, Other Capital Surplus in the manner described in the text 
of that account.
    (d)(1) Transfers from the Federal Government to Amtrak and ConRail 
relating to the acquisitions, addition to, or improvement of depreciable 
or nondepreciable operating property shall be included in account 796 in 
the manner described in the text of that account.
    (2) Transfers from the Federal Government to Amtrak and ConRail 
other than those described in paragraph (d)(1) shall be accounted for in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) The provisions of this section do not apply to the following 
forms of government transfers:
    (1) Government contributions in connection with construction 
projects in which government agencies and railroads participate. 
Transfers of this type shall be accounted for in accordance with the 
provisions of instruction 2-17. Paragraph (b) of that instruction lists 
applicable construction projects.
    (2) Government payment for specific services rendered by the carrier 
in transporting property or persons by rail line other than services 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such payments shall be 
included in account 501, Railway Operating Revenues (Exclusive of 
Transfers from Government Authorities).
    (3) Government transfers relating to other than carrier operations.
    (4) Government transfers in exchange for debt and/or equity 
securities of recipients.
    (f) Government transfers shall generally be recorded when made 
available to the railroad. However, transfers relating to specific 
operations shall be recorded as earned.
    (g) Government transfers in the form of assets other than cash shall 
be recorded at fair value when received.

[43 FR 30558, July 17, 1978, as amended at 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-16  Business entertainment expenses. (a) Business entertainment 
expenses are to be accounted for as operating expenses when incurred in 
conjunction with sales or marketing related activities. Sales or 
marketing related activities are those that emphasize a carrier's 
ability to provide efficient, timely and competitive service. These 
activities include outlays designed to promote new business as well as 
outlays incurred in maintaining existing business. The entertainment 
expenditures must be reasonable in relation to the business conducted 
and the business purpose for the entertainment must be adequately 
supported. Examples of this type of activity include the following:

[[Page 23]]

    (1) Salespersons' salaries and travel expenses, advertising, 
promotional and educational material;
    (2) The conduct of shipper symposiums, conferences, meetings and 
traffic related functions;
    (3) The use of direct mail solicitations and the publication and 
distribution of routing guides and service directories;
    (4) Incidental promotional materials such as road atlases, 
calendars, pens, scratchpads, and other materials of nominal value;
    (5) The conduct of business oriented lunches and dinners, public 
affairs programming, conferences and customer service calls;
    (6) Sponsoring sales promotion functions, involving a number of 
customers or potential customers.

It must be noted that an activity listed above is not to be 
automatically accounted for as an operating expense. A carrier must be 
able to justify that an activity was primarily sales or marketing 
related.
    (b) Business entertainment expenses are to be accounted for as non-
operating expenses when they cannot be shown to be related to the sales 
or marketing activity. These are expenses that are primarily related to 
recreation or to the convenience and comfort of the individuals rather 
than to the transaction of business. Examples of this type of activity 
include the following:
    (1) Recreational or resort entertainment, including but not limited 
to, fishing, hunting, tennis, golfing, skiing or other sporting or 
recreational trips or outings;
    (2) Expense paid transportation in any carrier owned, leased or 
furnished vehicles, planes, helicopters, boats, yachts, or other 
methods;
    (3) Expense paid lodging in any carrier owned, leased or furnished 
motels, hotels, apartments, condominiums, lodges, rooms and other places 
of overnight accommodation;
    (4) Paid admission to any sporting, cultural, educational, 
recreational, or entertaining occurrence or event;
    (5) Gifts such as athletic equipment, food or liquor, beverages of 
all types, smoking materials, clothing and personal accessories;
    (6) The furnishing of lunches, dinners, appetizers or beverages 
where there is no true business purpose;
    (7) Social occasions such as holiday parties.

It must be noted that an activity listed above is not to be 
automatically accounted for as a non-operating expense. If a carrier can 
justify that the activity was primarily sales or marketing related, it 
may be accounted for as an operating expense.

    Note: The examples listed above are not inclusive, but are intended 
as a guide to give carriers an indication of what will or will not be 
permitted to be recovered through the rate structure. In all instances 
the burden of proof will fall on the carrier involved.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPERTY ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    2-1  Items to be charged. (a) To the road and equipment property 
accounts shall be charged the cost of purchasing land, the cost of 
purchasing and constructing buildings, facilities and equipment, and the 
cost of additions and betterments to property, Cost means the amount of 
cash disbursed, or the fair value of other assets distributed, or the 
present value of amounts to be paid. Where the fair market value of 
resources given up (assets, services or items of stockholder's equity) 
is not clearly determinable, the cost may be determined by the fair 
market value of the resources acquired. The carrier shall be prepared to 
furnish the Commission with the particulars of its method of determining 
cash value when the consideration is other than monetary. The amount of 
liabilities incurred with suppliers in the normal course of business, 
which are due in customary trade terms not exceeding

[[Page 24]]

approximately one year, shall be recorded at the maturity value. 
Acquisition date is the date title passes to the carrier.
    (b) The cost of road and equipment purchased under a plan involving 
other deferred payments (debt or capital lease) shall be recorded at the 
discounted present value of the payment, net of executory costs such as 
insurance, maintenance, and taxes. The interest rate used to discount 
the payments should be the prevailing market rate for similar debt 
instruments of issues with similar credit ratings. In any event, the 
rate used for valuation purposes will normally be at least equal to the 
rate at which the carrier can obtain financing of a similar nature from 
other sources at the date of the transaction (the carrier's incremental 
borrowing rate). In the case of a capital lease, when it is practical to 
ascertain the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and that rate is 
less than the carrier's incremental borrowing rate, the carrier should 
use the implicit rate. Acquisition date for a capital lease is the date 
the lease agreement is signed. If the property covered by the lease has 
yet to be constructed or has not been acquired by the lessor at the date 
the lease agreement or commitment is signed, the acquisition date shall 
be the date the property under construction is completed or the date the 
property not yet acquired is acquired by the lessor. (See Instruction 2-
20.)
    (c) Where actually incurred, interest cost is to be added to the 
cost of road and equipment deemed qualifying assets during the period of 
time required to get them ready for their intended use (acquisition 
period). Qualifying assets are those that are (1) either constructed or 
otherwise produced for a carrier's own use (including assets constructed 
or produced for the carrier by others for which deposits or progress 
payments have been made) or (2) assets intended for sale or lease that 
are constructed or otherwise produced as discrete projects. The amount 
of interest to be capitalized for qualifying assets shall be based upon 
the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the 
acquisition period at the rate used on specific new borrowings 
associated with the qualifying asset. If average accumulated 
expenditures for the asset exceed the amount of specific new borrowings 
associated with the asset, the rate to be applied to such excess shall 
be a weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowings of the 
enterprise. The total amount of interest cost capitalized in an 
accounting period shall not exceed the total amount of interest cost 
incurred by the enterprise during that period.
    (d) Suitable records shall be maintained showing expenditures during 
the year for original road and equipment and road extensions; for merger 
and purchase of existing lines and reorganizations; for additions and 
betterments; and credits for property retirement.
    (e) When the carrier exchanges road and equipment for other road and 
equipment with no other consideration involved, the road and equipment 
received shall be recorded at the ledger value of the road and equipment 
relinquished. Where the carrier receives a monetary consideration in the 
exchange, the carrier shall recognize gain on the exchange to the extent 
that the consideration received exceeds a proportionate share of the 
recorded cost of the road and equipment surrendered. The portion of the 
cost applicable to the realized amount shall be based on the ratio of 
the monetary consideration to the total consideration received (monetary 
consideration plus the estimate fair value of the road and equipment 
received) or, if more clearly evident, the fair value of the road and 
equipment transferred. Where the carrier pays a monetary consideration 
in the exchange, it shall not recognize any gain on the transaction but 
shall record the road and equipment received at the amount of the 
monetary consideration paid plus the recorded costs of the road and 
equipment surrendered. If a loss is indicated by the terms of an 
exchange transaction, the carrier shall recognize the entire loss on the 
exchange. Immaterial gains and losses on these exchanges shall be 
included in account 519, Miscellaneous Income, or 551, Miscellaneous 
Income Charges, as appropriate. Material amounts shall be

[[Page 25]]

recorded in accordance with Instruction 1-2(d).

[52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-2 Minimum rule applicable to additions to property. An exception 
to the rule in Instruction 2-1 is that when the cost of acquisition of 
units of road property and of additions to existing units of road 
property (other than land and tracks) is less than $5,000, such costs 
may be charged to operating expenses. This amount (rounded to the 
nearest $100) will be adjusted by the June Producer Price Index for all 
commodities when an aggregate adjustment is $500 or more. The revision 
will be published in the Federal Register and be effective as of January 
1 of the following year. The carrier shall not parcel expenditures under 
a general plan bringing the accounting for such expenditures within this 
minimum rule. An amount of less than the current minimum capitalization 
level, for the railroad as a whole or for individual property accounts 
may be adopted for purposes of this rule provided the carrier first 
notifies the Commission of the amount it proposes to adopt and 
thereafter makes no change in the amount unless authorized by the 
Commission. An amount adopted shall be adhered to in reporting property 
changes for valuation purposes.

[55 FR 42016, Oct. 17, 1990]

    2-3  Land. (a) Accounts are provided for the cost of land used in 
transportation operations and also for land used in other than 
transportation operations. When land is retired from transportation 
operations but is retained by the carrier the original cost (estimated, 
if not known) shall be transferred to the account prescribed for 
property used in other than transportation operations. It is not 
contemplated that irregular parcels of land acquired in connection with 
acquisition of right-of-way which have no value as commercial property 
shall be thus transferred, either for the purpose of making right-of-way 
boundaries run more or less regular or for the purpose of eliminating 
from transportation property account the cost of unoccupied lands 
between tracks in yards and terminals. When any land, the cost of which 
is included in the accounts, is sold or otherwise retired, the ledger 
value shall be credited to the appropriate property investment account. 
The profit or loss from sale or loss from retirement or land shall be 
included in the accounts prescribed for such amounts.
    (b) [Reserved]

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-4  Structures. Accounts are provided for the cost of several 
classes of buildings and facilities, including fixtures permanently 
attached to and made a part thereof. When a building or other structure 
is used or held primarily for transportation operations and is an 
integral part of the carrier's transportation plant, but a part thereof 
is used or held for commercial purposes such as for rental to others or 
for use in other than transportation operations by the carrier, the 
entire cost of the building or other structure is includable in the 
accounts for transportation property. When a building or other structure 
is used or held primarily for commercial purposes or for use in other 
than transportation operations by the carrier, the entire cost of the 
building or structure is includable in account 737, Property used in 
other than carrier operations. Reclassification of property from its 
primary classification as transportation or other than transportation 
property, as the case may be, to the other classification is not 
required where changes in use are of a temporary nature or for a short 
period of time. The accounting for costs of maintenance, taxes, other 
operating costs, and for revenues and rentals shall be consistent with 
the classification of the building or other structure.
    2-5  Equipment. Accounts are provided for several classes of 
equipment, such as locomotives, passenger-train cars, freight-train 
cars, highway revenue equipment, work equipment, floating equipment, and 
the necessary appurtenance, furniture, and fixtures first to equip for 
service, including the cost of inspection, setting up, and trying out, 
and transportation over foreign lines; also the cost of additions and 
betterments, such as improved appliances, parts, or appurtenances.

[[Page 26]]

When retired equipment is held without being torn down, the estimated 
value of the salvage therefrom shall be included in account 741, Other 
assets, until the salvage is recovered, except that the estimated scrap 
value of retired equipment held for sale in the ordinary course of 
business, and on which sale and realization of the proceeds within one 
year is assured, is includable in account 713, Other current assets.
    2-6  Components of construction cost. The cost of constructing 
property includable in the property accounts shall include the direct 
and other costs as described hereunder.
    (a) Cost of labor. This includes the amount paid for labor expended 
by the carrier's own employees, including the cost of labor expended for 
preliminary work, such as sinking test holes or making soundings for 
tunnels, grading, buildings, and other structures; and cost of labor 
expended in laying and taking up tracks for temporary use in 
construction, except the cost of labor expended on tracks provided for 
the protection of traffic during the progress of addition and betterment 
work. The cost of labor shall also include the accounting company's 
expenditures for associated fringe benefits, such as vacation and 
holiday pay, health and welfare group insurance, pensions and retirement 
plans, payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. Office expenses and 
traveling and other personal expenses of employees, when borne by the 
carrier, shall be considered a part of the cost of the labor, as shall 
also the cost of fidelity bonds and employer's liability insurance 
premiums. When officers or employees are especially assigned to 
construction work their pay and their traveling and incidental expenses 
while thus engaged shall be included in the cost of the work. No charge 
shall be made against road and equipment accounts for the pay of 
officers and employees who merely render services incidentally in 
connection with extensions, additions, or betterments, although 
traveling and incidental expenses incurred by such officers and 
employees solely on account of such work shall be included in the 
account to which the cost of the work is chargeable.
    (b) Cost of materials and supplies. This includes the purchase price 
of materials and supplies, including small tools, at the point of free 
delivery plus the cost of inspection and loading assumed by the carrier; 
a suitable proportion of store expenses; also sales and excise taxes on 
materials and supplies except as otherwise provided in the text of 
account 712, Material and supplies. In calculating the cost of materials 
used, proper allowance shall be made for the value of unused portions 
and of cuttings, turnings, borings, etc.; for the value of the material 
recovered from temporary tracks, scaffolding, cofferdams, and other 
temporary structures used in construction; and for the value of small 
tools recovered and used for other purposes.
    (c) Cost of work-train service. This includes amounts paid to others 
for rent and maintenance of equipment used; cost of labor of enginemen, 
trainmen, and enginehousemen, including wages of engine crews and train 
crews held in readiness for such service; and cost of fuel and other 
supplies consumed in connection with the operation of work trains. It 
shall also include the cost of maintaining the carrier's own equipment 
used in construction service. Amounts representing constructive rent or 
return upon the investment in owned equipment shall not be included as a 
part of the cost of work-train service.
    (d) Cost of special machine service. This includes the cost of labor 
expended and of materials and supplies consumed in maintaining and 
operating power shovels, scrapers, rail unloaders, ballast unloaders, 
pile drivers, dredges, ditchers, weed burners, and other labor-saving 
machines; also rents paid for use of such machines.
    (e) Cost of transportation. This includes the amounts paid to other 
companies or individuals for the transportation of men, materials and 
supplies, special machine outfits, appliances, and tools in connection 
with construction. Freight charges paid foreign lines for the 
transportation of construction material to the carrier's line shall be 
included, so far as practicable, as a part of the cost of the material.
    (f) Cost of contract work. This includes amounts paid for work 
performed

[[Page 27]]

under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, and costs 
incident to the award of the contract.
    (g) Cost of protection from casualties. This includes expenditures 
for protection against fire, such as payments for discovery or 
extinguishment of fires, cost of detecting and prosecuting incendiaries, 
witness fees in relation thereto, amounts paid to municipal corporations 
and other for fire protection, and other analogous items of expenditure 
incurred directly in connection with construction work.
    (h) Cost of injuries and damages. This includes expenditures on 
account of injuries to persons or damage to property when incurred 
directly as a result of construction projects, and shall be included in 
the cost of the work in connection with which the injury or damage 
occurs. It also includes that portion of premiums paid for insuring 
property applicable to the period prior to the completion or coming into 
service of the property insured. Insurance recovered on account of 
compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction shall 
be credited to the accounts to which such compensation is charged, and 
insurance recovered on account of damages to property incident to 
construction shall be credited to the accounts chargeable with the 
expenditures necessary for restoring the damaged property. The cost of 
injuries and damages incident to the removal of old structures, or parts 
thereof, shall be charged to operating expenses, except that such costs 
in connection with the removal of old structures which are incumberances 
on newly acquired lands shall be included in accounts 2, Land for 
transportation purposes, or 3, Grading, as appropriate.
    (i) Cost of privileges. This includes compensation for temporary 
privileges, such as the use of public property or streets, in connection 
with the construction of the property of the carrier.
    (j) Material excavated. The cost of disposing of material excavated 
in connection with construction shall be considered as a part of the 
cost of work, except that when such material is used for filling, the 
cost of removal and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the 
work in connection with which the removal occurs and the work in 
connection with which the material is used.
    (k) Interest cost. [See Instruction 2-1(c)].

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-7  Additions to and retirements of property--General. (a) In 
accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of road and 
equipment property (excluding land) used in transportation operations, 
such property changes shall be considered as consisting of: (1) Units of 
property, and (2) other than units of property as prescribed in 
Instruction 2-19. Track property changes will be distinguished by units 
of property as approved by the Commission.
    (b) The cost of removal of retired property, both depreciable and 
other than depreciable, when borne by the carrier, shall be charged, as 
appropriate, to account 11-13-39, Personnel--Salaries and Wages--Way and 
Structures--Other--Dismantling retired property, or 11-23-39. 
Personnel--Salaries and Wages--Equipment--Other Equipment--Dismantling 
retired property, and other appropriate accounts (including 
subactivities 11 and 12).<SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1The references to solely related freight operating expense 
activity/subactivity numbers and titles used throughout the system are 
for convenience and brevity. Refer to the specific account texts to 
determine the appropriate solely related passenger and/or common expense 
activity/subactivity numbers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) An equitable proportion of a balance in property accounts 76, 
Interest During Construction, and 80, Other elements of investment, 
applicable to retired property shall be cleared from these accounts 
concurrently with the retirement accounting. Unless provided for 
otherwise, interest costs shall be capitalized in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
    (d) When retired property is held and not removed, the estimated 
value of the salvage therefrom shall be included in account 741, Other 
assets, until the salvage is recovered, except that the estimated scrap 
value of retired property held for sale in the ordinary course of 
business, and on which sale and realization of the proceeds within

[[Page 28]]

one year is assured, is includible in account 713, Other current assets.
    (e) The accounting for track additions and retirements (with and 
without replacement) shall be guided by Instruction 2-10.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 10920, Feb. 5, 1981; 48 
FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983; 49 FR 2254, Jan. 19, 1984; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 
1987]

    2-8  Additions to and retirements of units of property. (a) When a 
unit of road or equipment property is added to the plant, the cost 
thereof shall be included in the appropriate primary account. When a 
unit of property is retired, with or without replacement, the cost 
thereof shall be written out of the property account at time of 
retirement.
    (b) When a unit of road or equipment property (or a minor item not 
replaced) classified as depreciable and included in the accounts 
prescribed for depreciable property is retired the service value shall 
be charged to account 735, Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment 
property.
    (c) When road property (other than a minor item constituting 
repairs) classifed as other than depreciable property is retired, the 
cost thereof shall be cleared from the property account and the service 
value shall be charged to account 61-13-99, General--Other Expenses--Way 
and Structures--Other--Other. When the retirement requires Commission 
approval, the carrier shall clear the cost from the property account 
upon the effective date of the abandonment. Subactivities 11 and 12 also 
apply.
    (d) When property included in the depreciable accounts but excluded 
from the depreciation base is retired, the service value (including 
engineering expenditures assignable to retired property but not included 
in the depreciation base) shall be charged to operating expense.

    2-9 Additions and retirements of other than units of property. (a) 
When an item of road or equipment property, other than a complete unit, 
is added to the plant and the addition is not a replacement, the cost 
thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as an addition of a 
complete unit of property, subject to the minimum rule applicable to 
road property (see Instruction 2-2). When an item of property other than 
a complete unit (minor item) is replaced, independent of the complete 
unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be treated as 
maintenance and charged to operating expenses. If the replacement 
constitutes an improvement then the cost of replacement should be 
accounted for as a rebuilding expenditure under Instruction 2-12.
    (b) When second-hand property acquired is in such physical condition 
that it is necessary to rehabilitate the property to bring it up to the 
standard required by the carrier, the cost of such rehabilitation shall 
be included in the appropriate account for the property.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 55 FR 42016, Oct. 17, 1990]

    2-10  Additions to and retirements of track.
    (a) When track or its components are added to the plant, the cost 
shall be included in the track primary account. When track components 
are replaced as part of a track replacement program, the replacement 
cost shall be accounted for as an addition to the track property 
account. The cost of track components which are retired with or without 
replacement shall be written out of the track property account at the 
time of retirement.
    (b) When track is retired the service value (ledger value less net 
salvage) shall be charged to account 735, Accumulated depreciation; Road 
and equipment property.
    (c) All repairs of tracks shall be accounted for as operating 
expenses.
    (d) Track investment written out of the accounts shall be at 
original cost or estimated standard or average cost for that density 
category. Material to be reused shall be put in an investment pool at 
unrecovered cost and, when reused, included in the appropriate density 
category at the average cost of the investment pool.

[48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983]

    2-11  Expenses in connection with additions and betterments. The 
cost of removing old material from equipment and from buildings, 
bridges, wharves,

[[Page 29]]

tracks, and other fixed improvements, shall be charged to the 
appropriate operating expense accounts. Such charges shall include the 
cost of removing old foundations and filling old excavations, and 
restoring condition of grounds after addition and betterment work; and 
maintaining or protecting traffic during the progress of addition and 
betterment work, including the cost of constructing, maintaining, and 
removing temporary tracks required for maintaining traffic during the 
progress of the work.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977. Redesignated at 48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983]

    2-12  Units of property rebuilt or converted--(a) Rebuilding 
expenditures. Carriers shall be governed by the following provisions 
when determining and accounting for depreciable road and equipment 
property rebuilding expenditures:
    (1) Rebuilding expenditures are those cost actually incurred which 
substantially extend the service life or substantially increase the 
utility of depreciable road and equipment property. The rebuilding 
expenditures shall be material in nature relative to the current 
replacement cost of a similar new unit of road or equipment property. 
Expenses resulting from delayed maintenance and repairs shall not be 
considered in determining materiality.
    (2) The phrase extend the service life means to extend the life of a 
property unit past its estimated service life.
    (3) The term increased utility means that the road or equipment 
property has become more useful, more efficient, more durable, or has 
greater capacity.
    (4) Rebuilt or converted road or equipment property shall be 
accounted for as an addition to the appropriate property accounts, with 
the old units accounted for as retired from service. The charge to the 
appropriate property accounts shall be composed of (i) the cost 
(estimated if necessary) less a fair allowance for depreciation, or 
salvage value, whichever is lower, of the parts reused, (ii) the cost of 
labor expended in rebuilding or in the conversion process, (iii) the 
cost of additional materials applied, and (iv) any other expenses 
incurred directly with the rebuilding or conversion. In no case shall 
the total amount charged to the property accounts for these units exceed 
the current replacement costs of similar new units that would be used 
for the same purpose. When a unit of road property or equipment is 
transferred from one class of service to another, with or without 
physical conversion, the unit shall be accounted for as retired from its 
original account and be recorded in a primary investment account 
appropriate to its new class of service.
    (5) If it is necessary to repair the secondhand or reused parts 
remaining in a rebuilt unit, the repair cost may be added to the value 
assigned parts in determining the related cost to be capitalized. 
Associated dismantling costs shall be included in operating expenses.
    (b) Repair expenses. Expenses pertaining to road and equipment 
property, which represent normal or delayed repairs and maintenance, 
shall be expensed in the year incurred.
    (c) File and Storage. Carriers shall keep records of each rebuilding 
program readily available. These records shall be provided to 
representatives of the Commission when requested. The retention period 
shall be as required by 49 CFR part 1220, Preservation of Records.

[44 FR 67426, Nov. 26, 1979. Redesignated at 48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983, 
and amended at 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-13  Changes in line of road and relocation of yard tracks.
    (a) When changes are made in a line of road for the purpose of 
reducing curves or grades, or to eliminate bridges, tunnels, tracks in 
the installation of a centralized traffic control system, or other 
physical features, the part of the line so changed shall be considered 
property retired and its ledger value credited to the property accounts. 
The new line of road, including land, grading, ballast, track elements, 
and other transportation facilities serving the road shall be considered 
an addition and the cost charged to the property accounts. The cost of 
track changes which do not involve change in the existing roadbed shall 
be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be 
dismantled in the process, but the resulting track

[[Page 30]]

extensions or reductions shall be accounted for as additions or 
retirements as appropriate.
    (b) The cost of shifting or rearranging tracks within a yard shall 
be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be 
dismantled in the process, but resulting increases or decreases in 
grading, ballast, or track length shall be accounted for as additions or 
retirements, as appropriate. Where tracks in whole or in part within a 
yard are determined to be no longer permanently used, the ledger value 
of such tracks shall be eliminated from the property account. If yard 
tracks and facilities are constructed in another location to take the 
place of tracks retired, such tracks and facilities shall be accounted 
for as additions and the cost thereof shall be included in the property 
account.

[48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983]

    2-14  Track connections. (a) When the accounting carrier bears the 
construction cost of a connecting track situated on the property of 
another carrier, but acquires the salvage rights to the track, the cost 
of the track construction shall be charged to account 731, Road and 
equipment property.
    (b) When carriers (1) share the cost of constructing a connecting 
track of which a portion is situated on each carrier's right-of-way, and 
(2) own and obtain the salvage rights to the track segment located on 
their respective properties, the construction cost borne by each carrier 
shall be charged to account 731, Road and equipment property.
    (c) The cost of constructing a track connection on the right-of-way 
of another carrier which acquires the ownership of and salvage rights to 
the track, shall be charged by the carrier bearing such cost to accounts 
37-11-00, Purchased service--Joint facility--Debit--Way and Structures--
Running, or 37-12-00, Purchased services--Joint facility--Debit--Way and 
Structures--Switching. The owner carrier shall charge the amount of the 
construction cost to account 731, Road and equipment--property, with 
contra credit to accounts 38-11-00, Purchases services--Joint facility--
Credit--Way and Structures--Running, or 38-12-00, Purchases services--
Joint facility--Credit--Way and Structures--Switching. Material amounts 
for such costs shall be referred to the Commission for consideration and 
decision.
    (d) The cost of constructing a side track under a deposit refund 
agreement shall be charged to account 731, Road and equipment property. 
The deposit shall be credited to account 782, Other liabilities. Deposit 
amounts refunded during the agreement period shall be charged to account 
782, Other liabilities. Upon termination of the agreement, the amount of 
any unrefunded deposit shall be credited to the applicable primary 
property accounts on an equitable basis.
    2-15  Merger, consolidation, and purchase of a railway operating 
entity or system. (a) When a railway or portion thereof constituting an 
operating unit or system is acquired by merger or consolidation in a 
pooling of interests or by purchase the cost of acquisition represented 
by cash, capital stock or other securities issued or assumed, 
liabilities assumed, and other consideration, shall be recorded in the 
accounts in the manner stated hereunder. Separate instructions are 
provided for a merger of subsidiaries.
    (b) Pooling of interests:
    (1) When the acquisition results from a merger or consolidation 
constituting a pooling of interests, in which all or substantially all 
of the equity interest in predecessor companies continue, as such, in a 
surviving company or a new company created for the purpose, the road and 
equipment, the other assets, and the liabilities of the predecessor 
companies, together with the balances in the accumulated amortization 
and depreciation accounts and the retained earnings accounts shall be 
recorded in the appropriate balance sheet accounts at the amounts shown 
in the accounts of predecessor companies, adjusted as may be necessary 
to conform with the accounting rules of the Commission. Such adjustments 
shall be included in retained earnings or the other accounts that would 
have been appropriate had the adjustments been made in the books of 
account of the predecessor company.
    (2) When the total par or the stated value of no par capital stock 
issued or outstanding pursuant to the pooling of interests is more than 
the aggregate

[[Page 31]]

amount of the capital stock of the separate companies before such 
pooling of interests, the excess shall be charged to account 795, Other 
capital, if unrestricted capital is available for such purpose; 
otherwise, the excess shall be charged to retained earnings.
    (3) When the total par or stated value of no par capital stock 
issued or outstanding pursuant to the pooling of interests is less than 
aggregate amount of the capital stock of the separate companies before 
such pooling of interests, the difference for reduction in capital stock 
shall be credited to account 795, Other capital.
    (c) Purchase:
    (1) When the acquisition results from a purchase (except from 
subsidiaries controlled through ownership of the majority share of 
voting stock) including mergers or consolidations other than pooling of 
interests, the amount includible in account 731, Road and equipment 
property, shall be the cost at the date of acquisition to the purchaser 
of the transportation property acquired. The cost assigned the property, 
as well as other assets acquired, shall be the amount of the cost 
consideration given. Where property and other assets are acquired for 
other than cash, including liabilities assumed and shares of stock 
issued, cost shall be determined by either the fair value of the 
consideration given or the fair value of the assets acquired, whichever 
is more clearly evident. In addition to any liabilities assumed, 
provision shall be made for such estimated liabilities as may be 
necessary.
    (2) When the costs of individual units or classes of transportation 
property are not specified in the agreement, the cost assigned such 
property shall be apportioned among the appropriate primary accounts 
using the percentage relationship between the fair values for each class 
of property acquired and the total of such values.
    (d) Merger of subsidiaries:
    The acquisition and merger of property of subsidiaries controlled 
through ownership of the majority shares of voting stock is to be 
accounted for as a pooling of interests or as a purchase depending on 
the circumstances in each case. Where control was initially acquired 
through issuance of capital stock to stockholders of the subsidiary the 
rule applicable to pooling of interests ordinarily is applicable. Where 
control was initially acquired through purchase of stock the rule 
applicable to purchase of property may be appropriate even though the 
shares were purchased gradually from time to time over a period of 
years, in which event recognition of retained earnings since date of 
acquisition assignable to such shares may be proper. The journal entry 
pertaining to acquisition of property of subsidiaries shall be submitted 
to the Commission for consideration based on the principles herein and 
procedures for which there is authoritative support, and the accounting 
for the merger shall become final only after approval by the Commission.
    2-16  Reorganization of railway. (a) When a railway reorganization 
or receivership has been consummated, the assets acquired, liabilities 
assumed, and the capital stock or other securities issued or assumed, 
and other consideration, shall be recorded in the accounts in the manner 
stated hereunder. An adjustment of capitalization resulting in 
modification and reformation of classes of securities pursuant to 
voluntary action of the holders of securities but not resulting in a 
formal reorganization following a bankruptcy or other receivership 
proceedings (sometimes called a quasi-reorganization) is not covered by 
this instruction 2-16. Reduction of capital stock and other 
contributions to capital by stockholders shall be recorded in accordance 
with the instructions in the text of account 795, Other capital.
    (b) The amounts includable in primary road and equipment property 
accounts shall be recorded at cost as shown in the predecessor 
companies' accounts except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this instruction 2-16. The remaining assets and the liabilities 
of the predecessor companies, adjusted as necessary to conform with the 
accounting rules of the Commission, together with the balances in the 
accumulated amortization and depreciation accounts, shall be recorded in 
the appropriate balance sheet accounts.
    (c) When the amount recorded for assets acquired is more than the 
par or

[[Page 32]]

stated value of no par capital stock issued and other consideration 
paid, including liabilities assumed, the difference shall be applied to 
such extent as necessary and is available to provide first for any 
deficiency in past accrued depreciation on property classified as 
depreciable; and, second, for any estimated loss from retirement of a 
branch line, segment of track or other important facility indicated by 
supporting records to be imminent. The remaining amount of the 
difference, if any, shall be applied proportionately to reduce the 
amounts includable in the property accounts in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this instruction 2-16, based on the percentage relationship 
between such difference and the aggregate cost of the property shown in 
the predecessor companies' accounts.
    (d) When the amount applicable to the assets acquired is less than 
the par or stated value of no par capital stock issued and other 
consideration paid, including liabilities assumed, the accounting shall 
be referred to the Commission for consideration and decision.
    2-17  Construction projects in which governmental agencies, 
individuals, or others, and the carrier participate. (a) The amount 
includible in the property account for construction projects in which 
the carrier and governmental agencies, individuals, or others 
participate shall be (1) the payment made by the carrier for its share 
of the cost of construction plus (2) the recorded cost (estimated if 
unknown) of property relinquished as a direct result of the arrangement 
and retired from service less the value of salvage recovered therefrom 
by the carrier and less depreciation accrued on depreciable property, 
which is part of the carrier's cost of the project. The amount so 
includable in the property account shall be distributed equitably among 
the primary accounts applicable to railway property constructed. This 
amount shall first be applied to railway facilities includable in 
accounts other than 4, Other right-of-way expenditures, or 39, Public 
improvements--Construction, then any remaining balance shall be included 
in account 4 or 39, as appropriate. In no case shall the amount included 
in the primary accounts for the railway facilities acquired exceed the 
actual cost of constructing such facilities. The property account shall 
not include any cost or value for facilities or land contributed or paid 
for by governmental agencies, individuals or others. Property acquired 
as a specific contribution to capital by stockholders does not come 
under this rule. (See text of account 795, Other capital.)
    (b) Construction projects as used in this section means widening of 
highways, construction of spillways, drainage canals, farm and other 
private passes, pipelines, drains or other facilities across the right-
of-way; construction of overhead highway bridges, and railroad bridges 
over public highways and across streams, which provide a railroad use in 
the operation of trains and a public use in the uninterrupted passage of 
highway and river traffic; installation of warning signals to protect 
highway traffic; and industrial side tracks. Also, reconstruction and 
relocation of tracks and appurtenant facilities such as occur in 
connection with carrying out flood control, reclamation, and other 
public improvement projects where it becomes necessary to abandon part 
of the line of railroad and relocate the tracks.
    2-18  Leased property improvements and retirements. The cost to 
lessee of structures, facilities, additions and betterments on leased 
property and for retirement of property the cost of which is included in 
account 732 Improvements on leased property, shall be accounted for in 
conformity with the principles in the instructions for property owned. 
When lessor's property is retired and replaced and lessee is not 
obligated to reimburse the lessor for the retired property other than 
through the replacement, the lessee shall (1) charge the cost of the 
replacement to account 732, Improvements on leased property, (2) 
discontinue accruing depreciation for lessor's retired property, and (3) 
when recording final settlement with the lessor, consider jointly the 
amount accrued in account 772, Accrued liability; Leased property, for 
lessor's retired property and the respective amounts for the replacement 
included in accounts 732, Improvements on leased property, and 733, 
Accumulated depreciation; Improvements on leased

[[Page 33]]

property. When lessee is obligated to reimburse the lessor currently or 
at the termination of the lease for property retired other than through 
replacement, the lessee shall include the amount of the obligation in 
the appropriate liability account. The lessee shall furnish the lessor 
such information as is required to enable the lessor to perform 
necessary accounting. The accounting by the lessee and the lessor shall 
be consistent with contractual arrangements.

    2-20  Accounting for leases. (a) Leases shall be accounted for as 
capital leases whenever the lease meets one or more of the following 
four criteria:
    (1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by 
the end of the lease term,
    (2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option,

[[Page 36]]

    (3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated 
economic life of the property, and,
    (4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the 
minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair value of 
the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease less any 
related investment tax credit retained by the lessor.
    (b) If the lease does not meet any of the four criteria, the lease 
shall be classified and accounted for as an operating lease.
    (c) When accounting for capital leases the lessee shall record the 
asset and the related obligation. The amount recorded as the asset and 
the obligation shall be the present value at the beginning of the lease 
term of the minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that 
portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, 
maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor. However, if that amount 
exceeds the fair value of the leased property, the amount recorded as 
the asset and the obligation shall be the fair value. The lessee shall 
compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its 
incremental borrowing rate unless (1) it is practicable to learn the 
implicit rate computed by the lessor and (2) the implicit rate computed 
by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If 
both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit 
rate.
    (d) Leased assets that meet the criteria for classification as a 
capital lease shall be subject to depreciation over their useful lives 
in the same manner as assets owned. If the capital lease meets the 
criteria of either Instruction 2-20(a)(1) or 2-20(a)(2), the asset shall 
be amortized in a manner consistent with the lessee's normal 
depreciation policy for owned assets. If the lease does not meet either 
of these two criteria, the asset shall be amortized in a manner 
consistent with the lessee's normal depreciation policy except that the 
period of amortization shall be the lease term.
    (e) The accounting accorded the lease shall be subject to the same 
considerations as other obligations in classifying them with current and 
noncurrent liabilities in the classified balance sheet. Leases that meet 
the criteria requiring capitalization shall be recorded in those 
accounts that provide for carrier operating property or property used in 
other than carrier operations, as appropriate. The accounts shall 
segregate the amounts pertaining to capital leases.
    (f) If the lease qualifies as an operating lease it should be 
accounted for by charging the rent to expense over the lease term. The 
rental expense should be recognized on a straight line basis over the 
lease term unless another method is more representative of the use and 
the benefits derived.
    (g) The criteria specified in paragraph (a) should be applied to all 
leases regardless of the relationship between the lessor and the lessee 
unless it is clear that the terms of the lease transaction have been 
significantly affected by their relationship. In this situation, the 
accounting should be modified to recognize economic substance rather 
than legal form.
    (h) In the case of subsidiary companies or companies under common 
control whose principal business activity is leasing property or 
facilities to the carrier, the carrier is encouraged to request special 
authority to file consolidated or combined financial statements. If the 
carrier does not wish to file consolidated or combined financial 
statements, capitalization of the lease will be required if the lease 
meets the criteria that would require capitalization.

    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules for lease accounting is 
needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the 
Commission.

    2-21  Freight train car repair costing. Class I railroads shall 
report the costs of repairing freight train cars by car types.
    (a) The accounting for freight train car repair costs shall agree 
with the applicable instructions and texts of accounts in 49 CFR Part 
1201 relating to the equipment repair process (see Note A).

[[Page 37]]

    (b) Railroads may assign either actual costs, standard costs, or a 
combination of both to the accounting process. Standard costs, if used, 
shall recognize the differences in performing repairs on various types 
of equipment, and the differences related to specific repair facilites. 
Standard costs shall be based on adequate operational data which are 
reviewed at least annually. The resulting variances (price, efficiency, 
capacity, etc.) shall be reasonably allocated back to the car types to 
derive the amounts reported in Form R-1.
    (c) Railroads shall report repair costs by the freight train car 
types shown in Schedule 415 of Form R-1. In assigning repair costs, 
railroads may use either one of the following methodologies:

                     Level I: Job Order Cost System

    Railroads may use a job order cost system for assigning repair costs 
to the car types for freight train cars. Under this methodology, 
railroads shall directly match direct labor and materials with the 
specific unit of equipment that was repaired. Actual costs, standard 
costs, or a combination of both may be used as stated above.

             Level II: Alternative Repair Costs Methodology

    Railroads not using the job order cost system shall report freight 
train car repair costs by using the methodology described below:

    (1) The repair costs relating to heavy, program, or project repairs 
of freight train cars shall be directly assigned to the car types 
repaired by using actual or standard costs. A heavy repair is defined as 
a repair that is relatively so material in cost, repair time, or 
physical damage that management's involvement in the determination of 
the repair to be made is necessary and relatively greater than usual. 
Program or project repairs are those repairs which are performed under a 
predetermined plan where estimates costs, time periods, and car types to 
be repaired are identified.
    (2) The repair costs relating to light and running repairs of system 
cars shall be allocated to the car types by using the Association of 
American Railroads' Car Repair Billing System (CRBS) as the process for 
distributing light and running repairs. The CRBS will be the tracking 
system for recording the number of repairs, the car types and types of 
repairs. Then by applying the CRBS standard costs to the particular 
repairs, standard costs relationships by car type can be developed and 
used to distribute actual light and running repair cost pools to the car 
types.
    (3) Railroads shall match repair costs billed by and paid to foreign 
roads with the car types that were repaired. Foreign billings for light 
and running repairs are usually conducted through CRBS, and therefore, 
the car types can be identified. For heavy off-line repairs, car type 
identification is possible because system management is generally 
involved with the authorization of such heavy repairs and car 
identification numbers are generally included in the billing process.
    (4) Repair costs relating to foreign freight train cars shall also 
be reported by car types. However, a separate breakdown between foreign 
and system repair costs is not required for Commission reporting 
purpose. Car type identification for light and running repairs to 
foreign cars can be obtained from CRBS tapes. The cost of heavy repairs 
to foreign cars should be accumulated by car types. The resulting 
expense credits from foreign railroads should be assigned to the car 
types to which they relate.
    (5) Railroads shall match any resulting expense credits with the car 
types to which they relate. This can occur, for example, when a railroad 
is charged with the repair costs of system cars, but the responsibility 
of the repair ultimately rests with and is paid by a foreign road.
    (d) Railroads shall submit to the Commission any repair cost by car 
type methodology which does not agree with item (c) above. The 
Commission shall review the methodology and determine if it is 
acceptable for reporting purposes.
    (e) Railroads may submit justification and supporting documents 
requesting waiver from provisions required by this instruction. This 
provision is intended to provide relief for those smaller Class I 
railroads that might be unduly burdened by the cost

[[Page 38]]

of developing and maintaining the required system. Waivers shall be 
directed to the Commission's Accounting and Valuation Board.
    (f) Equipment repair cost records, including the allocation methods 
used, shall be maintained and made available to the Commission upon 
request.

showing its property as it exists on such date or dates as may be fixed 
by the Commission.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    4-1  Method. (a) There shall be charged monthly to operating 
expenses or other appropriate accounts and credited to account 735, 
Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment property, during the 
service life of depreciable road and equipment property, includable in 
accounts classed as depreciable, amounts which will approximate the loss 
in service value not restored by current repairs or covered by 
insurance. The charges for accruing depreciation currently shall be 
computed in conformity with the group plan by applying to the cost of 
property such percentage rates as will distribute the service value by 
the straight-line method in equal annual charges to operating expenses 
or other accounts during the estimated life of the property. In the case 
of track accounts 8, 9 and 11, service value shall reflect net salvage 
value. For road property, the cost shall be original cost or estimated 
original cost, as used in the valuation records, adjusted to current 
date. If a carrier submits proof that the actual cost of depreciable 
property is substantially different from cost figures in the valuation 
records, the carrier may, with the approval of the Commission, use such 
cost figures as the depreciation base.
    (b) The term group plan means the plan under which depreciation 
charges are accrued upon the basis of the cost of depreciable property 
includable in accounts classed as depreciable using the service lives of 
the individual depreciable units in the accounts and properly weighing 
to determine the composite annual rate of depreciation.
    (c) For the purpose of the group plan of depreciation accounting, 
the following primary accounts are classed as depreciable accounts:

Road accounts:
    3. Grading.
    4. Other right-of-way expenditures.
    5. Tunnels and subways.
    6. Bridges, trestles and culverts.
    7. Elevated structures.
    8. Ties.
    9. Rails and other track material.
    11. Ballast.
    13. Fences, snowsheds, and signs.
    16. Station and office buildings.
    17. Roadway buildings.
    18. Water stations.
    19. Fuel stations.
    20. Shops and enginehouses.
    22. Storage warehouses.
    23. Wharves and docks.
    24. Coal and ore wharves.
    25. TOFC/COFC terminals.
    26. Communication systems.
    27. Signals and interlockers.
    29. Power plants.
    31. Power transmission systems.
    35. Miscellaneous structures.
    37. Roadway machines.
    39. Public improvements-construction.
    44. Shop machinery.
    45. Power plant machinery.
Equipment accounts:
    52. Locomotives.
    53. Freight-train cars.
    54. Passenger-train cars.
    55. Highway revenue equipment.
    56. Floating equipment.
    57. Work equipment.
    58. Miscellaneous equipment.
    59. Computer systems and word processing equipment.

    (d) When abandonment of a branch line or other important segment of 
the track structure or other part of the plant for which depreciation 
charges are not includable in the accounts as foreseeable within a 
reasonable period of time due to exhaustion of traffic, obsolescence or 
other causes, application may be made to the Commission for authority to 
record a suitable provision in anticipation of a probable loss.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 48 FR 4183, Feb. 18, 1983; 52 
FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987]

    4-2  Rates of depreciation. (a) A separate composite annual 
percentage rate for each depreciable property account, or a subgroup in 
that account, shall be used in computing annual depreciation expenses 
and accumulated depreciation. The composite rates shall be based on the 
results of a depreciation study performed by each railroad. A 
depreciation study shall, in general, contain the following components:
    (i) Actuarial or semiactuarial methods for determining service lives 
for road and equipment properties;
    (ii) Salvage value calculations for road and equipment properties;
    (iii) Accumulated depreciation for each account or subaccount as 
appropriate;

[[Page 41]]

    (iv) Other factors and related calculations involving the 
depreciation process; and
    (v) A commentary on any adjustments and judgmental factors used in 
the study.
    (b) Railroads shall submit to the Commission for review and approval 
a report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every 
three years for equipment property, and ever six years for road 
property. Railroads can, however, submit depreciation studies prior to 
its scheduled year, in which case a new cycle will begin.
    (c) In computing monthly depreciation charges, the annual percentage 
rates shall be applied to the depreciation base as of the first of each 
month and the results shall be divided by twelve.
    (d) Class II railroads are exempt from the three-year and six-year 
cyclical reviews, but shall submit depreciation studies when requested 
by the Commission. Class III railroads are not required to submit 
depreciation studies.
    (e) A separate track depreciation rate shall apply to each primary 
property account in each track density category as provided in 
Instruction 4-3(d). Track depreciation rates shall be developed by 
estimating the average life based on an acceptable depreciation 
methodology, consistently applied, including as an option the units of 
production method based on gross ton-miles per mile of track.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 20210, Apr. 3, 1981; 48 
FR 7184, Feb. 18, 1983; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    4-3  Depreciation records to be kept. (a) The carrier shall maintain 
for each class of property in convenient and accessible form engineering 
and other data bearing on prospective service lives.
    (b) The carrier also shall keep such records of depreciable property 
and property retirements as will reflect the service life of each class 
of property which has been retired, or will permit the determination of 
service life indications by past experience of useful life tenure of 
comparable property, turnover, or other appropriate methods; also such 
records as will reflect the percentage of value of the salvage for 
property retired from each class of depreciable property.
    (c) For purposes of analysis the carrier shall maintain subsidiary 
records in which the accumulated depreciation account is broken down 
into component parts corresponding to each primary account to show the 
current credits and debits and the balance for each account. Such 
detailed information shall be reported annually to this Commission. For 
balance sheet purposes, the accumulated depreciation account shall be 
treated as a single composite account for depreciable property.
    (d) Carriers shall be prepared to justify all track depreciation 
rates by keeping appropriate data on the service lives and salvage 
values of track components which went into the life and net salvage 
computation of each primary account in each density category.
    (e) The investment and related accumulated depreciation for accounts 
3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 39 must be maintained by distinct traffic density 
categories. Each line segment shall be identified on January 1 of each 
year as belonging to one of the following traffic density classes, based 
on the average traffic density in the preceding three years:

                                 Density

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Class                              Description                          
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I  ...  Lines carrying at least 20 million gross ton-miles per mile on  
         an annual basis and not designated as belonging to Density     
         Class III.                                                     
II  ..  Lines carrying less than 20 million gross ton-miles per mile on 
         an annual basis and not designated as belonging to Density     
         Class III.                                                     
III  .  Lines identified as potentially subject to abandonment pursuant 
         to Section 10904 of the Interstate Commerce Act.               
IV  ..  Yard and way switching tracks.                                  
V  ...  Electronic yards.                                               
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Note A: For purposes of designating line segments as belonging to 
one of the density classes, the carrier shall consider all traffic 
carried over the segment whether in the carrier's trains or in the 
trains of other carriers (estimated if not known).

    Note B: When a carrier operates systems of parallel tracks on a 
single roadbed, the density associated with the related segment of a 
rail route shall be the aggregate gross ton-miles on all individual 
tracks.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 20210, Apr. 3, 1981; 48 
FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]


[[Page 42]]


    4-4  Leased property--depreciation. (a) The carrier shall include in 
operating expenses charges for depreciation on road property and 
equipment used but not owned, the rent for which is includable in the 
lease rental accounts, and shall maintain the same records of service 
lives, salvage values, etc., as provided for owned road property and 
equipment. The excess of the total compensation paid over the amount 
chargeable for depreciation shall be included in the rent account. If 
settlement between the carrier and the lessor is not currently made, the 
amount of the depreciation accrued during the period of the lease shall 
be credited by the carrier to account 772. Accrued liability; Leased 
property. The necessary adjustments of the difference between the 
balance thus accrued in that account and the actual amount of settlement 
shall be made appropriately through accounts 519, Miscellaneous income, 
or 551, Miscellaneous income charges, at the time settlement for 
depreciation on the property is made with the lessor.
    (b) The carrier shall not include in the depreciation account in 
operating expenses any charges for depreciation of equipment used but 
not owned when the rents therefor are not included in the lease rental 
accounts but shall include such charges in the appropriate other rent 
expense accounts.
    4-5  Jointly used property--depreciation. The owning carrier shall 
include in the depreciation accounts in operating expenses the charges 
for depreciation on units of depreciable property jointly used with one 
or more other carriers. The owning carrier shall credit and each using 
carrier shall charge the appropriate joint facility accounts in 
operating expenses with the amounts billed by the owning carrier against 
each using carrier for its proportion of the service loss on property 
retired from service whether billed currently as depreciation or when 
retirements occur as the loss in service value. The using carriers shall 
be required to account for depreciation or retirement of units of road 
property jointly used but not owned to the extent of their contract 
liability. The same principle shall apply to terminal companies and 
their nonowner tenants in accounting for depreciation accruals or 
retirement charges recorded in the accounts of the terminal companies.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INCOME AND BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    5-1  Current assets. (a) In the group of accounts designated as 
current assets shall be included cash, those assets which are readily 
convertible into cash or are held for current use in operations, current 
claims against others and amounts accruing to the carrier which are 
subject to settlement in the ordinary course of business within one 
year. There shall not be included in this group of accounts any amount 
the collection of which is not reasonably assured within one year 
because of the known financial conditions of the debtor or otherwise. 
Such items shall be included in account 741, Other assets, at an amount 
not in excess of a reasonable estimate of realizable value. Items of 
current character but of doubtful value shall be written down or written 
off by charge to account 63-61-00, General--Uncollectible accounts--
General and administrative, or account 553, Uncollectible accounts, as 
appropriate. Adjustment of these items of doubtful value shall be made 
by direct reduction of the asset account in which such items are carried 
or by provision in account 709.5, Allowance for uncollectible accounts, 
for the estimated uncollectible amount.
    (b) The carrier shall transfer the estimated realizable value of 
obsolete material to account 741, Other assets, equitably distribute the 
loss due to obsolescence among the accounts ordinarily chargeable for 
such classes of material, and concurrently credit account 712, Material 
and Supplies.
    5-2  Recorded value of securities owned. (a)(1) The investment in 
securities other than those issued or assumed by the accounting company 
shall be recorded in these accounts at cost, but excluding amounts paid 
for accrued interest and accrued dividends.
    (2) Accounts 702, Temporary Cash Investments, 721, Investments in 
Affiliated Companies, and 722, Other Investments, shall be maintained in 
such a manner

[[Page 43]]

as to reflect the marketable equity securities' portion (see definition 
26) and other securities or investments.
    (3) For the purpose of determining net ledger value, the marketable 
equity securities in account 702 shall be considered the current 
portfolio and the marketable equity securities in accounts 721 and 722 
(combined) shall be considered the noncurrent portfolio. The net ledger 
value of each portfolio shall be the lower of its aggregate cost or 
market value. (See definition 26.) The amount by which aggregate cost 
exceeds market value shall be accounted for as the valuation allowance. 
Account 702, Temporary Cash Investments, shall be subdivided to include 
the valuation allowance for the marketable equity securities included 
therein. Account 724, Allowance for Net Unrealized Loss on Noncurrent 
Marketable Equity Securities--Cr., is the valuation allowance for the 
marketable equity securities recorded in account 721, Investments in 
Affiliated Companies, and 722, Other Investments. Marketable equity 
securities accounted for by the equity method shall not be combined with 
other marketable equity securities when determining aggregate cost and 
market value.
    (4) Realized gains and losses (the difference between net proceeds 
from sale and cost) shall be included in the determination of net income 
of the period in which they occur. Changes in the valuation allowance 
for marketable equity securities included in account 702 shall be 
charged to account 551, Miscellaneous Income Charges, or credited to 
account 519, Miscellaneous Income, as appropriate, with a contra entry 
to the valuation allowance contained within account 702. Changes in the 
valuation allowance for marketable equity securities included in 
accounts 721 and 722 shall be recorded in equity account 798.1, Net 
Unrealized Loss on Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, with a 
contra entry to valuation account 724.
    (5) If there is a change in the classification of a marketable 
equity security between current and noncurrent, the security shall be 
transferred at the lower of its cost or market value at date of 
transfer. If market value is less than cost, the market value shall 
become the new cost basis, and the difference shall be accounted for as 
if it were a realized loss and included in the determination of net 
income.
    (6) The accounting company shall write down the ledger value of any 
securities to the extent of impairment in their value or write off 
entirely if there is no reasonable prospect of realizing any value 
therefrom. For long term investments in marketable equity securities, 
when the decline in market value below cost is judged to be other than 
temporary, the cost basis of the individual security shall be writen 
down to a new cost basis. The amount of the write-down shall be 
accounted for as realized loss by a charge to account 551, Other Income 
Charges, and a credit to account 723, Reserve for Adjustment of 
Investment in Securities. The new cost basis shall not be changed for 
subsequent recoveries in value.
    (b)(1) For financial statement purposes the carrier shall follow the 
principles of equity accounting for (1) all investments in corporate 
joint ventures (see definition 21(c)), and (2) all investments in voting 
stock of affiliated companies giving the carrier the ability to 
significantly influence the operating and financial policies of an 
investee (see definition 21(b)). For purposes of this instruction an 
investment of 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an 
investee will indicate the ability to exercise significant influence 
over an investee in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
    (2) Since the equity method is not to be effected by entries in the 
books of accounts but is to apply only in financial reports to the 
Commission, the carrier shall establish worksheet or memorandum 
accounts. Three basic worksheet or memorandum accounts are needed:
    (i) An investment account to include (1) equity in the undistributed 
earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition (see 
definition 21(g)); (2) accumulated amortization of the difference 
between cost and net assets at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below); 
and other adjustments for disposition or writedown of investments.
    (ii) An income account to include (1) the investor's share of the 
investee's undistributed profits or losses for each

[[Page 44]]

reporting period subsequent to acquisition of the investment except that 
in the year of acquisition such amount shall be determined from the date 
of acquisition; (2) amortization for the reporting period of the 
difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition. This 
account shall be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum 
account discussed in paragraph (iii) below.
    (iii) A retained earnings account to include (1) equity in the 
undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of 
acquisition; (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost 
and net assets acquired at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below).
    (iv) Other memorandum accounts will be needed for such adjustments 
as gains and losses on disposition of investments, recognition of 
impairments in value, the investor's share of extraordinary and prior 
period adjustments reported in the investee's financial statements (see 
instruction 1-2(d)), and provision for deferred taxes where it is 
reasonable to assume that undistributed earnings of an investee will be 
transferred to the investor in a taxable distribution. These memorandum 
accounts shall be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum 
account discussed in paragraph (iii) above.
    (3) The carrier shall retain the following information for each 
investee in support of the worksheet or memorandum accounts:
    (i) Original cost of investment.
    (ii) Equity in net assets of investee at date of acquisition.
    (iii) Allocation of difference between cost and equity in net 
assets, namely, to specific assets of investee or to goodwill.
    (iv) Accumulated amortization of difference between cost and equity 
in net assets.
    (v) Unamortized balance of difference between cost and equity in net 
assets.
    (vi) Equity in undistributed earnings/losses for each year since 
date of acquisition.
    (vii) Dividends received since date of acquisition if determinable.
    (viii) Proceeds from sale of investments.
    (4) Any difference between the investor's cost and its share of the 
net assets of the investee at date of acquisition shall be allocated to 
specific assets of the investee to the extent the difference is 
attributable to them. When the difference is allocated to depreciable or 
amortizable assets, depreciation and amortization (through the 
investment and income memorandum accounts) should absorb the difference 
over the remaining life of the related assets. If the difference is not 
related to specific accounts, it should be considered goodwill and 
amortized over a reasonable period not to exceed 40 years. For 
investments made prior to November 1, 1970, amortization of goodwill is 
not required in the absence of evidence that the goodwill has a limited 
term of existence.
    (5) The financial statements of the investee that are used for 
equity accounting should be timely. If the accounting year of the 
investee differs from that of the investor then the most recent 
available financial statements may be used. The lag in reporting should 
be consistent from period to period.
    (6) Material profits or losses on transactions between the investor 
and investee shall be eliminated until realized by either company as if 
the two were consolidated.
    (7) A transaction of the investee of a capital nature that affects 
the investor's share of the investee's stockholder's equity should be 
reported in the financial statements as if the two were consolidated.
    (8) The investor shall deduct any dividends applicable to 
outstanding cumulative preferred stock whether or not declared, and any 
other dividends declared when computing its share of undistributed 
earnings or losses.
    (9) The investor shall suspend application of the equity method when 
the investment (including the investment memorandum account) together 
with any net advances made to the investee is reduced to zero. 
Additional losses shall not be provided for unless the investor has 
guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to 
provide further financial support for

[[Page 45]]

the investee. If the investee subsequently reports net income the 
investor shall resume applying the equity method at such time as its 
share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized 
during the period of suspension.
    (10) When the investor's voting stock interest falls below the level 
of ownership described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the 
investment no longer qualifies for the equity method. Should dividends 
received on the investment in subsequent periods exceed the investor's 
share of earnings for such periods, the investment memorandum and income 
memorandum accounts shall be reduced by the excess amount.
    (11) When the level of ownership of an investment increases to that 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the equity method 
shall be applied. The memorandum accounts for the investment, income 
(for current year's equity in undistributed earnings less amoritzation), 
and retained earnings (for prior years' equity in undistributed earnings 
less amortization) shall be adjusted retroactively on a step-by-step 
basis determining the equity in net assets at date of acquisition, 
amortization adjustment, and equity in undistributed earnings or losses 
at each level of ownership. Where small purchases are made over a period 
of time and then a purhase is made which qualifies the investment for 
the equity method, the date of latest purchase may be used as date of 
acquisition.
    (12) Information having significance with respect to the investor's 
ownership in investees shall be disclosed in notes to financial 
statements of annual reports filed with the Commission in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles.
    (c) When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a 
discount (i.e., when total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, 
commissions, etc., is less than par), such discounts may be amortized 
over the remaining life of the securities through periodic debits to the 
account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with 
entries recording interest accruals) and credits to the same account in 
which interest income is credited. No debits shall be made in respect to 
discounts upon securities held as investments or in special funds if 
there is reason to believe that such securities will be disposed of by 
redemption or otherwise at less than par or will not be paid at date of 
maturity. When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a 
premium (i.e., when the total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, 
commissions, etc., is in excess of par), such premium may be amortized 
over the remaining life of the securities through periodic credits to 
the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident 
with entries recording interest accruals) and debits to the same 
accounts in which the interest income is recorded.

    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules for equity accounting is 
needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the 
Commission.

    5-3  Discounts, expenses, and premiums on debt. (a) Ledger accounts 
shall be provided to cover the discounts, expenses, and premiums on the 
sale or resale of each subclass of funded debt and of receivers' and 
trustees' securities issued for the benefit of or assumed by the 
company. (For explanation of subclass see account 765, Funded debt 
unmatured.) The net debit balances remaining in the ledger accounts for 
discount and premium shall be included in account 770.1, Unamortized 
debt discount, and the net credit balances in account 770.2, Unamortized 
premium on debt. Debt expense shall be included in account 743, Other 
deferred debits.
    (b) Each fiscal period there shall be charged to account 548, 
Amortization of discount on funded debt, a proportion on a consistent 
basis of each of the debit balances in the discount and premium accounts 
and correspondingly there shall be credited to income account 517, 
Release of premiums on funding debt, a similar proportion of each of the 
credit balances in these accounts. Related debt expense shall also be 
charged to account 548 on a proportional and consistent basis. The 
amounts for the respective debit balances for discount and expenses 
applicable to a particular issue of obligations may be charged directly 
to account 548 at time of issue

[[Page 46]]

when the aggregate of such amounts does not appreciably affect the 
accounts. The method of apportioning debt discount, issue costs, and 
premium to accounts 517 and 548 shall be the interest method, where the 
effective interest rate on the date of issuance is applied to the 
carrying value (debt, less related discount, and issue cost, plus 
related premium of each specific issue to the beginning of any given 
period.) However, other methods of amortization may be used if the 
results obtained are not materially different from those which would 
result from the interest method.
    (c) When any funded debt which has been actually issued to bona fide 
holders for value is reacquired by the accounting company, that 
proportion of the balance remaining in accounts containing discount, 
expense and premium on funded debt for the subclass of the security 
reacquired applicable to the portion reacquired shall be credited or 
charged thereto, as appropriate, and concurrently charged or credited to 
account 519, Miscellaneous income, account 551, Miscellaneous income 
charges; or to account 570, Extraordinary items, as appropriate, in 
accordance with the text of these accounts. Such proportion shall be 
based upon the ratio of the par value of the security reacquired to the 
par value of all the securities of the subclass actually outstanding 
immediately before such reacquirement. Gains and losses from 
extinguishment of debt (excluding debt maturing serially) which is 
acquired to satisfy sinking fund requirements, shall not be recorded as 
extraordinary items regardless of amount, but shall be included in 
accounts 519 and 551, as appropriate. Such gains and losses shall be 
separately disclosed in reports to this Commission.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987]

    5-4  Discount, premium, and assessment on capital stock. (a) 
Separate ledger accounts shall be provided for each subclass of capital 
stock issued or assumed by the accounting company to cover discount 
suffered and premium realized at the time of sale of capital stock. 
General levies or assessments against stockholders shall be credited to 
the appropriate ledger accounts for the subclass of capital stock 
against which the levy or assessment is made.
    (b) The total of net debit balance in these ledger accounts shall be 
included in account 793, Discount on capital stock, and the total of net 
credit balances in account 794, Premiums and assessments on capital 
stock.
    (c) Discount on each subclass of capital stock may be offset or 
reduced by charges to account 794, Premiums and assessments on capital 
stock, to the extent that net gains from premiums or assessments have 
been included therein or to account 795, Other capital, to the extent 
that net gains from reacquisition and resale or retirement of capital 
stock applicable to such subclass have been included therein. Any 
remaining discount may be amortized by charge to account 616. Other 
debits to retained earnings, or may be retained and carried in account 
793, Discount on capital stock, until the stock to which the discount 
applies is retired.
    (d) In case the accounting company is permitted and elects with the 
approval of the Commission, to distribute all or any part of the net 
balance of other paid-in capital to its stockholders, the amount thus 
distributed shall be charged to account 795, Other capital.
    (e) When capital stock is reacquired, either by purchase or 
donation, and is retired or cancelled, account 791, Capital stock, shall 
be charged with the par value, stated value of no par stock, or if no 
par stock without stated value, the proportionate amount at which the 
particular class of stock is included in account 791. Any excess of 
reacquisition cost over the recorded value of the stock shall be charged 
to account 795, Other capital, to the extent of the accumulated net 
gains included in this account applicable to reacquisition and resale or 
retirement of such subclass. Any remaining excess reacquisition cost 
shall be charged to account 616, Other debits to retained earnings. Any 
excess of recorded value over reaquisition cost shall be credited to 
account 795, Other capital.
    (f) When capital stock is reacquired, either by purchase or 
donation, and is not retired or cancelled, nor properly includable in 
sinking or other funds,

[[Page 47]]

the reacquisition cost shall be charged to account 798.5, Treasury 
stock.
    (g) When treasury stock is resold, account 798.5, Treasury stock, 
shall be credited with the cost paid for it. Gains shall be credited to 
account 795, `Other capital. Losses shall be charged to account 795, 
Other capital, to the extent that previous net gains from sales or 
retirements of the same class of stock are included therein; otherwise, 
to account 616, Other debits to retained earnings.
    5-5  Joint liabilities. The accounting company shall state as a 
liability in its balance sheet the difference between the total par 
value of securities jointly or severally issued by it and others and the 
portion of such liability which, under the joint arrangement, it is 
expected will be liquidated by the other party or parties to the joint 
arrangement. The amount of the jointly or severally issued securities 
expected to be liquidated by the other party or parties shall be shown 
as a contingent liability in accordance with instruction 5-6 pertaining 
to contingent assets and liabilities.
    5-6  Contingencies. (a) The proper accounting treatment for 
contingencies depends upon whether the contingency is: Probable: the 
event or events are likely to occur; Reasonably possible: the chance of 
occurrence of the future event or events is more than remote, but less 
than likely; or Remote: the chance of occurrence of the future event or 
events is slight.
    (b) Loss contingencies must be accrued when they are probable and 
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Where they are only 
reasonably possible, only footnote disclosure is required. Where they 
are remote, footnote disclosure is not required, but is permitted.
    (c) Gain contingencies usually are not reflected in the accounts 
since to do so might be to recognize revenue prior to its realization. 
Adequate disclosure shall be made of contingencies that might result in 
gain, but care shall be exercised to avoid misleading implications as to 
the likelihood of realization.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4326, Feb. 11, 1987]

    5-7  Long-term obligations. Commitments under unconditional purchase 
obligations associated with suppliers' financing arrangements and future 
payments on long-term borrowings and redeemable stock shall be disclosed 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Such 
disclosures shall not preclude accounting recognition if the substance 
of a financing arrangement is the acquisition of an asset or incurrence 
of a liability.

[47 FR 4266, Jan. 29, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLEARING ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    6-1  Items to be charged. In recognition of the fact that certain 
expenditures incident to the construction and the operation of property 
are not chargeable directly to any particular property investment or 
expense account, clearing accounts have been provided for the purpose of 
securing an equitable distribution of such items to the proper primary 
accounts.
    6-2  Material and stationery store expenses. (a) To clearing 
accounts called Material store expenses and Stationery store expenses 
shall be charged expenses in connection with purchasing, handling and 
storing material and stationery in and distributing it from the 
company's storehouses. Including the pay of officers and employees in 
the purchasing and store departments and their traveling, office, and 
other expenses; also expenses, including wages, fuel, and supplies, of 
operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to the service 
of switching at material storehouses. (Expenses of incidental switching 
at material yards by locomotives in regular switching service shall be 
charged to the appropriate transportation accounts.) The pay and 
expenses of men employed in purchasing or inspecting a single class of 
material, such as ties, shall be added as store expenses to the cost of 
that particular material.
    (b) The total amount of storehouse expenses charged to these 
accounts shall be distributed among the accounts to which material and 
stationery has been charged, in proportion to the amounts charged to 
each account

[[Page 48]]

for the items issued, except that the amount representing the purchasing 
department expenses shall be apportioned on the value of the items 
issued which were purchased by that department. To avoid monthly 
fluctuations in the ratio of store expenses to the value of material and 
statonery purchased or issued, carriers may make a monthly apportionment 
on the basis of fair percentage rates, provided the store expense 
accounts are adjusted and closed out at the end of each year.
    6-3  Shop expenses. (a) To a clearing account entitled Shop expenses 
shall be charged items of expense at shops, enginehouses, repair tracks, 
and other places where mechanical work is performed, not assignable 
directly to specific accounts. Such expenses shall be apportioned among 
the various accounts affected. The basis of distribution shall be the 
relative proportion which the total amount of charges to Shop expenses 
bears to the total of the directly distributed labor. To avoid monthly 
fluctuations in the ratio of shop expenses to the total of distributed 
labor, carriers are permitted to make the monthly apportionment on the 
basis of a percentage of the distributed labor, provided the shop 
expense account is adjusted and closed out at the end of the year.
    (b) The expenses assignable to this account shall include the pay of 
foremen (who exercise supervision over all departments), their clerks, 
and other employees engaged in general work in and about shops, cost of 
heat, light and power; cost of small tools and supplies and water and 
power purchased; also cost of removal of snow and ice from transfer 
tables and shop yards, and other incidental shop expenses. To this 
account shall be charged expenses, including wages, fuel and supplies, 
of operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to 
switching service at shops (the expenses of incidental switching at 
shops by locomotives in transportation switching service shall be 
charged to appropriate transportation accounts).
    6-4  Gravel and sand pits and quarries. (a) When a gravel or sand 
pit or quarry is opened for operations likely to extend over a long 
period, an account shall be set up designated, Operations of gravel pit 
at --------------, or Operations of quarry at --------, as the case may 
be. To this account shall be charged cost of the land in excess of its 
estimated value after the gravel, sand, or stone has been removed 
(credit to the property account in which the cost of the land is 
included); payments for right to enter upon and remove ballast from land 
not owned by the carrier; cost of sinking test holes; and costs 
preparatory to opening the pit or quarry. To this account shall be 
charged also the cost, in excess of the estimated salvage value, of 
rails and fastenings, ties, other material and labor used in 
constructing tracks to and in the gravel pit or quarry (the estimated 
salvage being carried in an appropriate suspense account); cost of labor 
and train service employed in producing, quarrying, and loading ballast, 
including the cost of operation, repairs, and depreciation of power 
shovels and other machines and machinery; pay and expenses of watchmen; 
cost of explosives and hand tools, and miscellaneous expenses; and cost 
of installing, operating and maintaining signals and interlockers at 
gravel pits.
    (b) Credit to the clearing account shall be made each month to cover 
the cost of ballast material produced during the month. The cost of 
production shall include the expenses directly assignable to the monthly 
output plus a proportion of the expenses not directly assignable, such 
as cost of land, tracks, machinery, and interlockers. This latter amount 
shall be computed upon the basis of the ratio which the monthly output 
bears to the total estimated yardage to be taken from the pit. When any 
portion of the product of such pits or quarries is sold, the cost 
thereof shall be credited to this clearing account and any related 
profit shall be credited to account 110, Incidental.
    6-5  Power plant operations. (a) The accounting for the expenses of 
maintaining and operating an electric, steam, or other power plant (both 
building and machinery) shall be determined by the purpose for which the 
power produced is used. When a power plant is intended and used for 
producing power solely for the carrier's own operations and the cost of 
operating

[[Page 49]]

the plant is chargeable to clearing account Shop expenses, or to any one 
specific account for operating expenses, the expenses of maintenance 
shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance accounts, and the cost 
of operation to the account appropriate according to the use of the 
power.
    (b) When the power from such a plant is properly chargeable to more 
than one account, the expenses of maintaining and operating the plant 
shall be included in clearing account designated Power plant operations. 
The expense of maintenance shall be cleared from that account to the 
appropriate maintenance accounts. The expenses of operation shall be 
apportioned to the appropriate accounts upon the basis of quantity of 
power used for the various purposes.
    (c) When a part of the power produced by a power plant is sold and 
the remainder is used in the carrier's own operations, the cost of 
maintaining and operating the plant shall be charged to a clearing 
account. The expense of maintenance shall be cleared from that account 
to the appropriate maintenance accounts. The proportion of the expenses 
of operation assignable to the power sold, on the basis of ratio of 
quantity of power sold to total quantity of power produced, shall be 
credited to this clearing account and any related profit shall be 
credited to account 110, Incidental. The remainder of the cost of 
operation shall be distributed to the appropriate expense accounts for 
the carrier's own operations.
    (d) When power plants are intended and used solely for furnishing 
power to others, their investment cost shall be included in account 737, 
Property used in other than carrier operations, and the revenues and 
operating expenses shall be included in the accounts provided for 
operations of such property.
    (e) The accounting for the maintenance of transmission systems and 
distribution systems shall be in accordance with instructions pertaining 
to power plant operations.

General Expenditures--Table of Contents

<R05>


70  General expenditures.
    The primary accounts of this general account are designed to include 
expenditures made in connection with the acquisition and construction of 
original road and equipment, and with extension, additions, and 
betterments to road and equipment property, when such expenditures 
cannot properly be included in any of the foregoing accounts as a part 
of the cost of any specific work. When assignable, such expenditures 
shall be included in the cost of the property for which the expenditures 
occurred.

[[Page 65]]

76  Interest during construction.
    (a) When any bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness are 
sold, or any interest-bearing debt is incurred for acquisition and 
construction of original road and equipment, extensions, additions, and 
betterments, the interest accruing on the part of the debt representing 
the cost of property chargeable to road and equipment accounts (less 
interest, if any, allowed by depositaries on unexpended balances) after 
such funds become available for use and before the receipt or the 
completion or coming into service of the property so acquired shall be 
charged to this account.
    (b) When such securities are sold at a premium, the proportion of 
such premium assignable to the time between the date of the actual 
issuance of the securities and the time when the property acquired or 
the improvement made becomes available for service shall be credited to 
this account.
    (c) This account shall also include such proportion of the discount 
and expense on funded debt issued for the acquisition of original road, 
original equipment, road extensions, additions, and betterments, as is 
equitably assignable to the period between the date of the actual 
issuance of securities and the time when the property acquired or the 
improvement made become available for the service for which it is 
intended. The proportion of discount and expense thus chargeable shall 
be determined by the ratio between the period prior to the completion or 
coming into service of the facilities or improvements acquired and the 
period of the entire life of the securities issued.

    Note A: Interest on bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness 
accruing before the proceeds from the sale of the securities become 
available for use shall not be included in this account, nor shall there 
be included any interest accruing after the property with respect to 
which the proceeds are expended is received or becomes available for use 
in connection with commercial service.
    Note B: If securities issued or assumed by the carrier are 
subsequently sold or exchanged by or for the carrier, the excess of the 
par value and accrued interest of the securities over the actual money 
value of the consideration received shall be deemed a discount. In no 
case (except as provided in the third paragraph of this account) shall 
discount be included as part of the cost of items included in the 
accounts prescribed in this classification.
    Note C: Whenever interest, premium, or discount assignable to the 
construction period is incurred in connection with an expenditure 
covered by some specific road and equipment account or accounts, such 
interest, premium, or discount shall be charged directly to the specific 
accounts to which it is related. Unless provided for otherwise, interest 
costs shall be capitalized in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

    Note D: This account shall not include interest during the 
construction period on the carrier's own funds expended in connection 
with the acquisition or construction of original road and equipment, 
extensions, additions, and betterments.

Other Property Accounts--Table of Contents

<R05>


80  Other elements of investment.
    (a) This account shall include amounts resulting from adjustment of 
the primary property accounts to conform with cost of property in 
valuation records. The amount in this account shall be cleared on a 
consistent basis as property is retired from service or otherwise in 
accordance with the rules in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
account. Any material amount in this account assignable to property 
previously retired from service shall be cleared immediately.
    (b) When property is retired from service, an equitable portion of 
the balance in this account assignable to such property shall be cleared 
when the retirement entry is made. The amount so cleared, when a debit, 
shall be charged to account 551, Miscellaneous income charges, or, when 
a credit, shall be recorded in account 519, Miscellaneous income. The 
exception to this general rule with respect to a credit balance 
assignable to property retired is that when property classified as 
depreciable is retired from service and the balance in the accumulated 
depreciation account for the property is materially deficient, because 
of sudden retirement or other unusual cause, the portion of a credit 
balance cleared for the retirement, equal to the deficiency, shall be

[[Page 66]]

applied to reduce the amount of loss otherwise chargeable to the 
accumulated depreciation account.
    (c) A carrier may apply to the Commission for authority to clear the 
entire balance from this account immediately or amortize the balance 
over a short period of time by appropriate inclusion in account 616, 
Other debits to retained earnings, or account 606 Other credits to 
retained earnings. Any amount so authorized or directed by the 
Commission to be cleared and written off to retained income shall be in 
lieu of amounts includible in accounts indicated in paragraph (b).
    (d) Other plans for clearance, disposition, or classification of a 
balance in this account in conformity with sound accounting principles 
may be submitted to the Commission with suitable details for 
consideration. This includes application for disposition of a balance in 
this account attributable to reduction of capitalization in a 
reorganization. An accounting procedure so applied for shall become 
effective only after Commission approval. Each carrier shall maintain a 
record of items initially included in and cleared later from this 
account and the basis used in computing such items.

    Note: The amounts attributable to past mergers, consolidations and 
purchases of property included in this account shall be merged with the 
adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this text.
90  Construction in progress.
    This account shall include expenditures incurred by the carrier in 
the process of constructing road and equipment with its own forces or 
under contract during the period prior to the time property is placed in 
transportation operations, including cost of materials and supplies 
located at point of use and of necessary land acquired for such 
projects. When a project is completed or when a segment of a large 
project is completed and placed in service, the cost of the completed 
project or the completed segment thereof shall be transferred to the 
appropriate road and equipment primary accounts. Separate subaccounts 
may be maintained for road, equipment, or other classes of expenditures. 
Expenditures for relatively unimportant projects may be included 
directly in primary accounts.

\1\ Each operating expense account has a six-digit code divided into three two-digit groups. The first two-digit group denotes the natural expense [see control column], the second group       
  denotes the activity/subactivity for freight, passenger or common service [see Table F]; and the third group signifies applicable function assignment [see Tables B, C, D & E].               
\2\ The account numbers shown on this matrix are for freight only. The account numbers for passenger and common are derived by applying the natural expense code (first two digits) to the      
  activity codes shown in Table F. Natural expenses are used only in the same activities as shown for freight.                                                                                  
\3\ Expenses shall be reported by applicable functions [see account text].

dedicated yard serving the facility, or switching within the dedicated 
supporting terminal facility when performed by yard crews. They also do 
not include costs appropriate to the Way and Structures, Equipment, or 
General and Administrative activities.
    Floating operations should be classified by line and terminal 
operations. The distribution should be made based on the nature of the 
operation and not the facility or equipment. When the service occurs 
between distinct terminals, the operation should be considered a line 
operation. When the service is conducted within a general terminal or 
harbor area, the operation should be considered a terminal operation.
    (c) Coal Terminal Operations and Ore Terminal Operations refers to 
operations of rail-to-water or water-to-rail transloading facilities for

and Administrative activity except for those otherwise included in the 
definition of this subactivity.
    Carrier staff, administrative, or clerical operations related to 
operating or transportation department general administration should not 
be charged to this subactivity. The Administrative Support Operations 
subactivity may be performed at local stations, regional offices, or 
even at the general offices; however, the location of the operation 
performance does not affect its nature. The operations included in this 
subactivity should reasonably correlate to the quantity of shipments or 
to the quantity of carloadings.
General and Administrative Activity--(XX-60-XX)
    (D) General and Administrative activity refers to the providing of 
overall administration or other general support for carrier operations. 
It comprehends only that portion of general and administrative

calendar year and the necessary adjustments to bring this account into 
harmony with the actual inventory balances shall be made in the accounts 
of the year in which the inventories are taken. In effecting this 
adjustment, determined differences in accounting for important classes 
of material shall be equitably assigned among the accounts to which the 
classes of material are ordinarily chargeable. Other differences shall 
be equitably apportioned among

[[Page 113]]

the primary accounts to which material has been charged since the last

such items shall be transferred to this account.
    Note B: The term affiliated companies (also see definition 4) 
includes:
    1. Controlled companies, including companies solely controlled by

the par value of (1) certificates or other evidences of funded debt 
(pledged and unpledged) held in the company's treasury, by its agents or 
trustees, or otherwise subject to its control, including both those

issued; and (2) certificates or other evidences of funded debt issued 
and actually outstanding, being those not held by the company, its 
agents or trustees, or subject to its control.
    (c) The amounts included herein shall be further divided so as to 
show the amount of each class of funded debt, as follows:
    (1) Mortgage bonds. Bonds secured by lien on physical property and 
not includible in the other subdivisions of this account.
    (2) Collateral trust bonds. Bonds and notes secured by a lien on 
securities or other negotiable paper; and stock trust certificates that 
are similar in character to collateral trust bonds.
    (3) Income bonds. Bonds which are a lien on a carrier's revenue 
alone, or bonds which, while being a lien on its property and

earned.
    (4) Miscellaneous obligations. All funded obligations not provided 
for by the other subdivisions of this account, also notes, unsecured 
certificates of indebtedness, debenture bond, plain bonds, real estate

respectively.
    (5) Receipts outstanding for funded debt. Receipts for payments on 
account of funded debt. When certificates are issued for such payments,

funded debt for which the certificates are issued.
    (d) Each of the above classes shall also be divided into subclasses 
according to differences in mortgage or other lien or security therefor, 
rate of interest, interest dates, or date of maturity. Parts of any 
issue agreeing in other characteristics but maturing serially may be 
treated as of the same subclass.
    (e) Records shall be maintained in such manner as to show (1) 
securities the issuance or assumption of which has been authorized by 
the Commission under provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, and 
similar securities issued or assumed prior to the effective date of such 
provisions of the Act, and (2) other obligations of a kind which may 
legally be issued or assumed without such authorization.

    Note A: Securities (other than equipment obligations) maturing one 
year or less from date of issue shall be included in accounts 757, 
``Payables to affiliated companies,'' 769, ``Accounts payable; 
Affiliated companies,'' or 751, ``Loans and notes payable,'' as 
appropriate, except that where an issue of securities maturing serially 
over a period of years contains short-term obligations such obligations 
may be included as funded debt. Mature funded debt shall be included in 
account 763, ``Other current liabilities,'' if provision has been made 
for current settlement. If no provision has been made for current 
settlement, matured funded debt shall be included in account 768, ``Debt 
in default,'' except that when the collection of matured funded debt of 
affiliated companies is not enforced by controlling companies, the 
principal amount (to the extent held by a controlling company) shall be

and notes payable.''
    (b) The amounts included herein shall be divided as follows:
    (1) Principal amount of equipment securities including those 
maturing serially, issued or assumed by the accounting company or by

under provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and similar securities 
issued or assumed prior to the effective date of such provisions of the

representing matured funded securities or obligations, receivers' and 
trustees' securities, equipment obligations and short-term notes, when 
maturity dates of such obligations have not been extended

    Note A: The principle amount of matured funded debt of affiliated 
companies the collection of which is not enforced by the controlling 
company shall (to the extent of the principal amount held by the

[[Page 123]]

when such interest is not subject to current settlements. The amounts 
included herein shall be divided as follows:
    (a) Notes, including not only nonnegotiable notes that run longer

one year from the date of issue when it is mutually agreed that the 
notes shall not be enforced as current assets by the holder.
    (b) Par value of matured funded debt of affiliated companies held by 
controlling companies where there is no agreement for an extension of 
time and collection is not enforced.
    (c) Open accounts not subject to current settlement.
    (d) Interest accrued on amounts included in this account when not

liabilities, as appropriate.
    Note B: No item shall be included in this account which is not known 
to be the property of an affiliated company.
    Note C: The term affiliated companies includes:
    1. Controlled companies, including companies solely controlled by 
the accounting company, and also companies jointly controlled by the 
accounting company and others under a joint arrangement. (See definition 
4.)
    2. Controlling companies, including both companies solely 
controlling the accounting company, and companies which jointly control 
the accounting company under a joint arrangement.
    3. Companies controlled by controlled companies.
    4. Companies controlled by controlling companies.
    By control (See definition 8) is meant the ability to determine the 
action of a corporation. For the purposes of this account, the following 
are to be considered forms of control:
    (a) Right through title to securities issued or assumed to exercise 
the major part of the voting power in the controlled corporation.
    (b) Right through agreement of some character or through some source 
other than title to securities, to name the majority of the board of 
directors, managers, or trustees of the controlled corporation.
    (c) Right to foreclose a first lien upon all or a major part in 
value of the tangible property of the controlled corporation.
    (d) Right to secure control in consequence of advances made for 
construction of the operating property of the controlled corporation.
    (e) Right to control only in a specific respect the action of the 
controlled corporation.
    A leasehold interest in the property of a corporation is not to be 
classed as a form of control over the lessor corporation.
    Sole control is that which rests in one corporation.
    Joint control is that which rests in two or more corporations and 
which is held under a joint arrangement.
770.1 Unamortized debt discount.
    This account shall include the total of the net debit balances

or equipment obligations. Separate subdivisions shall be maintained for 
each issue of such obligations. (See instruction 5-3.)

    Note A: Issue costs related to long-term debt (debt expense) shall 
be included in account 743, ``Other deferred debits.'' (See instruction 
5-3.)

transferred to account 551, ``Miscellaneous income charges.''
770.2  Unamortized premium on debt.
    This account shall include the total of all credit balances 
representing the excess of the premium over the discount and expenses in 
connection with the issuance of each class of the carrier's outstanding

benefits, savings, relief, hospital, or other provident purposes.
    (b) The carrier may use the ``full accrual basis'' to account for 
pension costs upon prior approval of the Commission. Full accrual basis 
as used herein means recording in the accounts now and hereafter costs 
of employees pensions accrued, including credits for past services, upon 
the basis of actuarial computations, even though the sum has not been 
funded by payment to the trustees. Applications for such accounting 
shall show the method of computation, together with the carrier's 
proposal for recording in the accounts the related income tax credits to 
be realized in subsequent years.
    (c) This account shall be charged when payments are made to retired 
employees, or disbursements are made for the purposes for which 
liability was provided.

provided for each liability and the nature of and amounts of debits and 
credits to the subaccounts.

operating expense to provide for estimated liabilities for claims for 
deaths of or injuries to employees and others, and for damages to 
property not owned or held under lease by the carrier; for claims for 
loss, destruction, damage, or delays to property entrusted to the 
carrier for transportation or storage; for revenue over charges, such as 
those covered by reparation claims; and for similar items. No credits 
shall be made to this account for amounts recoverable from insurance 
companies or others.
    (b) Separate subaccounts shall be maintained to show the amount 
provided for each liability and the nature of and amounts of debits and 
credits to the subaccounts.
    (c) If settlements for claims when audited are charged to this 
account, the balances for each year shall be kept separately until all 
items have been adjusted and cleared. If the settlements when audited 
are charged to the appropriate expense accounts, the balance in this 
account shall be adjusted through the expense accounts so as to reflect 
the probable liability at the close of each accounting period for claims 
which have been or may be filed for actuarial occurrences.
    (d) Estimates of amounts payable within one year covering liability 
for claims shall be transferred from this account to account 759, 
``Accrued accounts payable.''

accrued liability accounts.
    (b) Separate subaccounts shall be maintained to show the amount 
provided for each liability and the nature of and amounts of debits and 
credits to the subaccounts.
    (c) Upon accomplishment of the purpose for which each accrued 
liability was provided in this account, any remaining balance in the 
applicable subaccount shall be cleared to the appropriate operating 
expense or other account. Prior Commission approval shall be required 
for clearance of balances in accrued liability subaccounts which were 
originally established by authority of the Commission.
    (d) Estimates of amounts payable within one year covering any 
liability included in this account shall be transferred to account 759, 
``Accrued accounts payable.''

[[Page 125]]

781  Interest in default.
    This account shall include the amount of matured and unpaid interest 
(for which no provision has been made for current settlement) on all 
indebtedness issued or assumed by the accounting company except interest 
which is added to the principal of the debt on which incurred. Where 
interest is in default, subsequent accruals shall be credited to this 
account.

acquisition, addition to, or improvement of depreciable operating 
property received, or receivable from Federal, state, or local 
authorities. Items to be included in this account shall be determined in 
accordance with instruction 1-15.
    An appropriate record shall be maintained of each asset associated 
with these transfers showing: (1) Original cost to carrier (or fair 
value if not purchased), (2) accumulated depreciation, and (3) estimated 
salvage value, if any.
    This account shall be charged periodically, and account 503, 
``Railway Operating Revenues--Amortization of Deferred Transfers from 
Government Authorities,'' shall be credited with amounts equal to the 
depreciation costs of the assets to which they apply. When such assets 
are retired or otherwise disposed of, this account shall be charged, and 
account 503 concurrently credited with any remaining associated amounts. 
(See instruction 1-15.)

    Note A: This account shall not include government transfers in the 
form of, or designated for the purchase of land or other non-depreciable 
property. Transfers of this type are includible in account 795, ``Other

21-XX refers to all salary and wage accounts for locomotives because 11 
designates salaries and wages and 21 designates locomotives. Thus, 11-
21-XX includes all of the following accounts: 11-21-01; 11-21-40; 11-21-
48; 11-21-39; and 11-21-99. Similarly, XX-31-67 means all accounts 
containing 31 (train operations) and 67 (locomotive fuel).

910  Purpose and scope.
    (a) Section 205(e)(1)(A) of the 3R Act directs the office to issue 
regulations which will permit the collection and publication by the 
Consolidated Rail Corp. (ConRail), or by profitable railroads of 
information necessary to determine accurately the revenues attributable, 
avoidable costs, and service units of light-density lines scheduled for 
abandonment. This accurate information is intended to facilitate the 
determination of the revenues and avoidable costs in abandonment 
proceedings and in potential offers of subsidy. This information is 
intended to be compatible with the Regional Subsidy Standards (49 CFR 
Part 1155), for those lines which were not conveyed to ConRail under the 
final system plan and with the National Subsidy Standards (49 CFR Part 
1152, Subpart D), for all other lines. The purpose of the Branch Line 
Accounting System regulations is to specify an accounting system for the 
collection and publication of this information.
    (b) For further information regarding the Branch Line Accounting 
System, persons may contact the RSPO's Cost Evaluation Branch: Cost 
Evaluation Branch, Rail Services Planning Office, 1900 L Street NW., 
Washington, DC 20036, 202-254-7552.

920  Collection of data.
    (a) Lines for which data collection is required. The railroad shall 
collect data on all branch lines which meet the criteria listed in 
paragraphs 1 through 4 below. The data to be collected is specified in 
section 920(b).
    (1) Branch lines in categories (1), (2), and (3) on the System 
Diagram Map include, respectively, lines for which a carrier intends to 
file an abandonment application within three years, lines which the 
carrier has under study and are potentially subject to abandonment, and 
lines for which an abandonment application is pending before the 
Commission. The collection of data on such lines shall commence on the 
first day of the month after the line has been designated in one of the 
categories and will continue so long as the branch line is retained in 
one of these categories. The assignment and apportionment methodology 
set forth in Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall 
be applied.
    (2) For branch lines operated under an order directing service, 
under section 304(d)(3) of the 3R Act, data shall be collected from the 
effective date of the order until the order is withdrawn. The assignment 
and apportionment methodology set forth in Part 1155, Subchapter B 
(Regional Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.
    (3) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation 
agreement under section 1a(6)(a) of the IC Act, data shall be collected 
from the effective date of the agreement until the termination of the 
agreement. The assignment and apportionment methodology set forth in 
Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.
    (4) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation 
agreement under section 304 of the 3R Act, data collection shall 
commence on the effective date of the agreement and shall continue until 
the termination date of the agreement. The assignment and apportionment 
methodology set forth in Part 1155, Subchapter B (Regional Subsidy 
Standards), shall be applied.
    (b) Data to be collected. The data collected shall include the items 
of revenue, expense, and service units which are specified in Parts 1152 
and 1155, Subchapter B (National and Regional Subsidy Standards), as 
described in the account texts listed in section 950. The format for 
presentation of these data is specified in section 940.

930  Publication of data.
    (a) General. The railroad shall file on or before June 30 of each 
calendar year the certification included in these regulations as 
Appendix I. The railroad shall include a description of each branch line 
using the format set forth in Appendix I of these regulations. The 
description of each branch line requires the same data as that submitted 
under 49 CFR 1152.11. This section prescribes the branch line 
information required in conjunction with the system diagram maps 
specifying the line's designation, states and counties traversed, 
delineation of mileposts, and location of agency and terminal stations.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Access to records. The records, accounts, working papers, and 
other documents reflecting the revenues, cost, and service unit data of 
each branch line for which the railroad must maintain data shall be made 
available for inspection and examination by the Commission and, for 
lines situated within its State, by the designated State agency at a 
time and place mutually agreeable to the parties. The railroad shall 
also reproduce such records for the designated State agency, provided 
the agency pays the reasonable cost thereof.
    (d) Waivers and modifications. The Office may, with respect to 
individual requests, upon good cause shown, waive or modify any 
requirement of this section not required by law.

transfers of passengers or shipments upon the basis of arbitraries out 
of rates for transportation involving rail line haul.


[[Page 149]]


    106 Demurrage. This account shall include the revenue from the 
detention of cars incident to loading, unloading, reconsigning, and 
stops in transit upon the basis of lawful tariffs for demurrage. This 
account shall also include the revenue from the detention of trailers 
and containers used in TOFC/COFC service, incident to loading and 
unloading, upon the basis of tariff rates.

    Note: This account shall be maintained so as to reflect separately 
(1) revenue from detention of cars, and (2) revenue from detention of 
trailers and containers used in TOFC/COFC service.

    110 Incidental. This account is designed to show the amounts which 
the carrier becomes entitled to receive from services rendered 
incidentally with rail-line and water-line transportation; for the use 
of facilities of which the expenses for operation and maintenance are 
not separable from railway expenses and from incidental sources not 
provided for elsewhere. Among the items included in this account are 
revenues derived from (1) hotels and restaurants, (2) operations 
conducted at stations and on trains by individual or companies other 
than railway companies, (3) storage, (4) the sale of electric power, (5) 
renting property operated and maintained in connection with the property 
used in the carrier's transportation operations and from railway 
operations not provided for elsewhere.
    121 Joint facility, credit. This account shall include the carrier's 
proportion of revenue collected by others in connection with the 
operation of joint tracks, yards, terminals, and other facilities, 
including revenue from hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, sale of 
power, and other miscellaneous operations.

    Note A: The purpose of this account is to show the amounts of 
revenue from the operation of joint tracks, yards, terminals and other 
facilities operated by other companies, which under existing contracts 
or agreements are credited by the operating company to the tenant 
companies which participate therein. The bill rendered by any creditor 
company against a debtor company for the latter's proportion of the 
expense of maintenance and operation of joint facilities, which includes 
also a credit covering a proportion of the revenue to be paid over, 
shall show the distribution of the credit for such proportion of the 
revenue separately from the distribution of the expense of operation.
    Note B: No credits shall be made to this account representing 
amounts creditable by the operating company to primary accounts 101-103, 
105, and 110.

    122 Joint facility, debit. This account shall include that 
proportion of revenue from the operation of joint tracks, yards, 
terminals, and other facilities, which is creditable to other companies, 
including revenue from hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, sale of 
power, and other miscellaneous operations.

    Note A: The purpose of this account is to show the amount of revenue 
from operation of a terminal company or other carrier which, under the 
terms of existing contracts or agreements covering the joint use of 
tracks, yards, and other facilities, is credited to other carriers that 
participate in the benefits from such joint use. The bill rendered by a 
creditor company against a debtor company for the latter's proportion of 
expense of maintaining and operating joint facilities, which includes a 
credit covering the debtor company's proportion of the revenues from 
operation of such joint facilities, shall indicate separately the proper 
distribution of both the revenues and the expenses included in the bill, 
and such distribution shall be adhered to the debtor.
    Note B: No debits shall be made to this account representing amounts 
creditable by the operating company to primary accounts 101-103, 105, 
and 110.

                          Other Income Accounts

    506 Revenues from property used in other than carrier operations. 
This account shall include the total revenues derived from property used 
in other than carrier operations, the cost of which is includible in 
balance-sheet account 737, ``Property used in other than carrier 
operations.''
    510 Miscellaneous rent income. (1) This account shall include such 
rents of property owned and controlled by the accounting carrier as are 
not provided for in the foregoing accounts.
    (2) This account shall be charged with the cost of maintenance of 
the property rented, also specific incidental expenses in connection 
with such property, such as the cost of negotiating contracts, 
advertising for tenants, fees paid conveyancers, collectors' 
commissions, and analogous items.


[[Page 150]]


    Note A: If property the rent of which is chargeable to account 543--
``Miscellaneous rents,'' is sublet by the accounting company, the rent 
receivable therefore shall be credited to this account.
    Note B: Taxes on property the rent of which is creditable to this 
account shall be charged to account 553--``Taxes on property used in 
other than carrier operations.''
    Note C: The rent from property carried in balance-sheet account 
737--``Property used in other than carrier operations,'' shall not be 
included in this account, but in account 506--``Revenues from property 
used in other than carrier operations.''
    Note D: Rent and other income from real estate acquired for new 
lines or for additions and betterments shall be credited to the 
appropriate road and equipment accounts until the completion or coming 
into service of the property.
    519 Miscellaneous income. (1) This account shall include all items, 
not provided for elsewhere, properly creditable to income accounts 
during the current year. Among the items which shall be included in this 
account are:
    (i) Cancellation of balance sheet accounts representing unclaimed 
wages and vouchered accounts written off because of carrier's inability 
to locate the creditor.
    (ii) Profit from sale of land used for transportation purposes, of 
noncarrier property and of securities acquired for investment purposes.
    (2) Gains for extinguishment of debt shall be aggregated and, if 
material, credited to account 570 ``Extraordinary Items,'' upon approval 
by the Commission; however, gains from extinguishment of debt (excluding 
debt maturing serially), which is made to satisfy sinking fund 
requirements, shall be recorded in this account regardless of amount.
    599 Subsidy payments from preexisting contracts. This account shall 
include all payments made to the operating carrier of a subsidized line 
that (1) existed prior to the commencement of operations under a subsidy 
operating agreement and (2) would cease if freight service on the line 
were discontinued.
    (b) On-branch avoidable cost.
    (1) Actual and apportioned expense accounts.

which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they 
enter into the determination of pretax accounting income. Timing 
differences originate in one period and reverse or turn around in one or 
more subsequent periods. Some timing differences reduce income taxes 
that would otherwise be payable currently; others increase income taxes 
that would otherwise be payable currently.
    (f) Permanent differences means differences between taxable income 
and pretax accounting income arising from transactions that, under 
applicable tax laws and regulations, will not be offset by corresponding 
differences or turn around in other periods.

attributable to (1) revenue or expense transactions which enter into the 
determination of pretax accounting income in one period and into the 
determination of taxable income in another period, (2) deductions or

and (3) adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to other 
stockholders' equity accounts which enter into the determination of 
taxable income in a period but which do not enter into the determination 
of pretax accounting income of that period. A permanent difference does 
not result in a tax effect as that term is used in this definition.
    (h) Deferred taxes means tax effects which are deferred for 
allocation to income tax expense of future periods.
    (i) Interperiod tax allocation means the process of apportioning 
income taxes among periods.
    (j) Tax allocation within a period means the process of apportioning 
income tax expense applicable to a given period between income before 
extraordinary items and extraordinary items, and of associating the 
income tax effects of adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to 
other stockholders' equity accounts with these items.

[39 FR 33348, Sept. 17, 1974]
1-42  Terminology relative to equity accounting.

investee, provided that

[[Page 174]]

its assets, results of operations, and activities can be clearly 
distinguished, physically and operationally and for financial reporting 
purposes, from the other assets, results of operations, and activities 
of the entity. The fact that the results of operations of the segment 
being sold or abandoned cannot be separately identified strongly 
suggests that the transaction should not be classified as a disposal of 
a segment of business.
    (b) Measurement date means the date on which the management having 
authority to approve the action commits itself to a formal plan to 
dispose of a segment of the business, whether by abandonment or sale. 
The measurement date for disposals requiring Commission approval shall 
be the service date of the Order authorizing the disposal.
    (c) Disposal date refers to the date of closing the sale if the

any time deposit or certificate of deposit) maintained by a carrier (or 
by any person on behalf of the carrier) which constitutes support for 
existing borrowing arrangements of the carrier (or any person) with a 
lending institution. Such arrangements include both outstanding 
borrowings and the assurance of future credit availability. (The 
compensating balance requirement should be adjusted by the amount of 
float unless such adjustment would cause the compensating balance to be 
greater than the cash balance per carrier's books. The float adjustment 
is made by subtracting the float from the compensating balance 
requirement if the collected bank ledger balance exceeds the cash 
balance per carrier's books or by adding the float to the compensating 
balance requirement if the collected bank ledger balance is less than 
the cash balance per carrier's books.)
    (b) Float means deposits and withdrawals in transit which constitute 
a difference between the collected bank ledger balance and the cash 
balance per carrier's books.

41 FR 9159, Mar. 3, 1976]
1-45  Terminology relative to accounting for marketable equity 
securities.
    (a) Equity security encompasses any instrument representing 
ownership shares (e.g., common, preferred, and other capital stock), or 
the right to acquire (e.g., warrants, rights, and call options) or 
dispose of (e.g., put options) ownership shares in an enterprise at 
fixed or determinable prices. The term does not encompass preferred 
stock that by its terms either must be redeemed by the issuing 
enterprise or is redeemable at the option of the investor, nor does it 
include treasury stock or convertible bonds.
    (b) Marketable as applied to an equity security means an equity 
security as to which sales prices or bid and ask prices are currently 
available on a national securities exchange (i.e., those registered with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission) or in the over-the-counter 
market. In the over-the-counter market, an equity security shall be 
considered marketable when a quotation is publicly reported by the 
National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotations System 
or by the National Quotations Bureau Inc. (provided, in the latter case, 
that quotations are available from at least three dealers). Equity 
securities traded in foreign markets shall be considered marketable when 
such markets are of a breadth and scope comparable to those referred to 
above. This definition is not met by restricted stock (securities for 
which sale is restricted by a governmental or contractual requirement 
except where such requirement terminates within one year or where the 
holder has the power to cause the requirement to be met within one 
year). Any portion of the stock which can reasonably be expected to 
qualify for sale within one year, such as may be the case under Rule 144 
or similar rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is not 
considered restricted.
    (c) Market value refers to the aggregate of the market price of a 
single

[[Page 175]]

share or unit times the number of shares or units of each marketable 
equity security in the portfolio. When an entity has taken positions 
involving short sales, sales of calls, and purchases of puts for 
marketable equity securities and the same securities are included in the 
portfolio, these contracts shall be taken into consideration in the 
determination of market value of the marketable equity securities.
    (d) Cost, as applied to a marketable equity security, refers to the 
original cost unless a new cost basis has been assigned based on 
recognition of an impairment of value that was deemed other than 
temporary or as the result of a transfer between current and noncurrent 
classifications. In such cases, the new cost basis assigned shall be 
considered cost.

annual carrier operating revenues after applying the revenue deflator 
formula as shown in the Note. Upward and downward reclassification will 
be effected as of January 1 of the year immediately following the third 
consecutive year of revenue qualification.
    (2) Any carrier which begins new operations (obtains operating 
authority not previously held) or extends its existing authority 
(obtains additional operating rights) shall be classified in accordance 
with a reasonable estimate of its annual carrier operating revenues 
after applying the revenue deflator formula shown in the Note.
    (3) When a business combination occurs, such as a merger, 
reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be 
reclassified effective as of January 1 of the next calendar year on the 
basis of the combined revenues for the year when the combination 
occurred after applying the revenue deflator formula shown in the Note.
    (4) Carriers shall notify the Commission of any change in 
classification or when their annual operating revenues exceed the Class 
I limit by writing to the Bureau of Accounts, Interstate Commerce 
Commission, Washington, DC 20423. In unusual circumstances where the 
classification regulations and reporting requirements will unduly burden 
the carrier, the carrier may request from the Commission a waiver from 
these regulations. This request shall be in writing specifying the 
conditions justifying the waiver. The Commission then shall notify 
carriers of any change in classification or reporting requirements.
    (c) For classification purposes, the Commission shall publish in the 
Federal Register annually an index number which shall be used for 
adjusting gross annual operating revenues. The index number (deflator) 
is based on the Producer Price Index of Finished Goods and is used to 
eliminate the effects of inflation from the classification process.

    Note: Each carrier's operating revenues will be deflated annually 
using the Producers Price Index (PPI) of Finished Goods before comparing 
them with the dollar revenue limits prescribed in paragraph (a) of this 
section. The PPI is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
The formula to be applied is as follows:

[53 FR 4028, Feb. 11, 1988]
2-2  Records.
    (a) All the accounts defined in this system of accounts must be kept 
by the double entry method. Each carrier shall keep its general 
accounting books and all other books, records and memoranda which 
support in any way the entries to such accounting books and analyses of 
general ledger account balances so that it can furnish at any time full 
information as to any account. Moreover, it shall support each entry to 
each account with such detailed information as will provide a ready 
analysis and verification of the facts recorded therein. All 
expenditures must be definitely supported by vouchers, payrolls, 
receipted bills, canceled checks, receipts for petty cash payments, or 
other evidences of the expenditures incurred.
    (b) The books referred to in this part include not only books of 
account in a limited technical sense but all other records such as 
minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., 
which will be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any 
transaction.
    (c) No carrier shall destroy any books, records, memoranda, etc., 
which support entries to its accounts unless destruction is permitted by 
the regulations governing preservation of records, Part 1220 of this 
chapter.
    (d) Subdivisions of any account in this system of accounts may be 
kept, provided that such subdivisions do not impair the integrity of the 
accounts prescribed. The Commission reserves the right to order any 
carrier to subdivide any account in this system of accounts. The title 
of each such subdivision shall clearly indicate the account of which it 
is a part. When an account is subdivided in the general ledger, an 
account need not be maintained for the total of the subdivisions. When 
such subdivisions are carried in subsidiary ledgers, however, the 
general ledger shall contain the controlling accounts therefor so that a 
complete general ledger trial balance may be obtained.

[32 FR 20280, Dec. 20, 1967, as amended at 40 FR 50384, Oct. 29, 1975]
2-3  Accounting period.
    (a) Each carrier shall keep its books on the basis of either (1) an 
accounting year of 12 months ending on the 31st day of December in each 
year, or (2) an accounting year of thirteen 4-week periods ending at the 
close of one of the last 7 days of each calendar year.
    (b) A carrier electing to adopt an accounting year of thirteen 4-
week periods shall file with the Commission a statement showing the day 
on which its accounting year will close. A subsequent change in the 
accounting period may not be made except by authority of the Commission.
    (c) To avoid repetition, wherever calendar year appears in the 
system of accounts it is intended to include or an accounting year of 
thirteen 4-week periods and wherever month appears it is intended to 
include or 4-week period.
    (d) For each month all transactions applicable thereto, as nearly as 
can be ascertained (see instruction 2-8), including full accruals, shall 
be entered in the books of original entry (cash book, purchase journal, 
etc.), and posted to the general ledger. A trial balance of the general 
ledger accounts shall be prepared at the close of each month setting out 
the account number, title and amount of each ledger account. 
(Mechanical, EDP or ADP print-out documentation producing the equivalent 
of manually prepared trial balances shall identify balances by account 
numbers.) At the end of the calendar year the revenue, expense and other 
income accounts shall be closed into earned surplus or the noncorporate 
capital accounts; and balance sheet account balances shall be brought 
forward to the general ledger for the succeeding year.

[[Page 177]]

    (e) The final entries for any month shall be made in the general 
ledger not later than 60 days after the last day of the month for which 
the accounts are stated, unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, 
except that the period within which the final entries for the last month 
of the calendar year shall be made may be extended to such date in March 
of the following year as shall not interfere with the preparation and 
filing of annual reports.
    (f) No changes shall be made in the accounts for periods covered by 
quarterly and annual reports that have been filed with the Commission 
unless the changes have first been authorized by the Commission.

[38 FR 3602, Feb. 8, 1973]
2-4  Submission of questions.
    To maintain uniformity of accounting, carriers shall submit all 
questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration 
and decision.
2-5  Item lists; interpretation.
    Lists of items appearing in the texts of the several accounts are 
given for the purpose of indicating the application of the prescribed 
accounting in specific cases. The lists are not to be considered as 
comprising all items includible in the several accounts, but merely as 
representative of them. On the other hand, the appearance of an item in 
a list warrants the inclusion of such item in the account concerned only 
when the text of the account also indicates inclusion, inasmuch as the 
same item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in 
each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.
2-6  Opening entries.
    As of the effective date of this system of accounts the accounts 
prescribed herein shall be opened by appropriately transferring thereto 
the balances carried in the accounts previously maintained by the 
carrier. The carrier is authorized to make such subdivisions, 
reclassifications, consolidations of or additions to such balances as 
are necessary to meet the requirements of this system of accounts.
2-7  Extraordinary items, unusual or infrequent items, discontinued 
operations, prior period items, and accounting changes.
    (a) Extraordinary items. All items of profit and loss recognized 
during the year are includible in ordinary income unless evidence 
clearly supports their classification as extraordinary items. 
Extraordinary items are characterized by both their unusual nature and 
infrequent occurrence taking into account the environment in which the 
firm operates; they must also meet the materiality standard.
    Unusual means the event or transaction must possess a high degree of 
abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally 
related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity.
    Infrequent occurrence means the event or transaction shall be of a 
type not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future.
    (b) Unusual or infrequent items. Material events unusual in nature 
or infrequent in occurrence but not both, thus not meeting both criteria 
for classification as extraordinary, shall be includible in the accounts 
provided as separate components of income/expense from continuing 
operations. Such items are not to be reported net of income taxes.
    (c) Discontinued operations. The results of continuing operations 
shall be reported separately from discontinued operations and any gain 
or loss resulting from disposal of a segment of a business (see 
definition 1-43(a)) shall be reported in conjunction with the related 
results of discontinued operations and not as an extraordinary item. The 
disposal of a segment of a business shall be distinguished from other 
disposals of assets incident to the evolution of the entity's business, 
such as the disposal of part of a line of business, the shifting of 
production or marketing activities for a particular line of business 
from one location to another, the phasing out of a product line or class 
of service, and other changes occasioned by technological improvements. 
If a loss is expected from the proposed sale or abandonment of a 
segment, the estimated loss shall be provided for at the measurement 
date (see

[[Page 178]]

definition 1-43(b)). If a gain is expected, it shall be recognized when 
realized, which ordinarily is the disposal date (see definition 1-
43(c)).
    (d) Prior period adjustments. Only the following two items of profit 
and loss shall be accounted for and reported as prior period adjustments 
and excluded from the determination of net income for the current 
period:
    (1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior 
period, and
    (2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits 
of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased 
subsidiaries.
    With the exception of the two items just mentioned, all items of 
profit and loss recognized during a period shall be included in the 
determination of net income for that period.

    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules is needed or obtain an 
interpretation from its public accountant or the Commission.

    (e) Accounting changes. A change in accounting principle or 
accounting entity should be referred to this Commission for approval. 
The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should 
ordinarily be reflected in the account provided for in determining net 
income; in certain cases accounting changes may be reflected as prior 
period adjustments. Changes in accounting estimates should ordinarily be 
reflected prospectively.
    (f) Materiality. As a general standard an item shall be considered 
material when it exceeds 10 percent of annual income (loss) before 
extraordinary items. An item may also be considered in relation to the 
trend of annual earnings before extraordinary items or other appropriate 
criteria. Items shall be considered individually and not in the 
aggregate in determining materiality. However, the effects of a series 
of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable 
event or plan of action shall be aggregated to determine materiality.
    (g) Commission approval and accountant's letter. Items shall be 
included in the accounts provided for extraordinary items, unusual or 
infrequent items, discontinued operations, prior period adjustments and 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles only upon approval 
of the Commission. If the carrier retains the service of an independent 
accountant, a request for using these accounts shall be accompanied by a 
letter from the independent accountant approving or otherwise commenting 
on the request.

    Note: The carrier may refer to generally accepted accounting 
principles for further guidance in applying instruction 2-7.

[40 FR 53252, Nov. 17, 1975, as amended at 43 FR 37456, Aug. 23, 1978]
2-8  Unaudited items.
    (a) When the amount of any item affecting these accounts can not be 
accurately determined in time for inclusion in the accounts of the 
calendar year in which the transaction occurs, the amount of the item 
shall be estimated and included in the proper accounts. When the item is 
audited the necessary adjustments shall be made through the accounts in 
which the estimate was recorded. If, during the interval between the 
date of inclusion of the item in the accounts and the date on which it 
is audited, a substantial difference from the initial estimate is 
determined, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the current 
accounts to cover such difference. The carrier is not required to 
anticipate small items which would not appreciably affect these 
accounts.
    (b) If, owing to exceptional conditions, a carrier finds a 
modification of the instructions in paragraph (a) of this section 
necessary, it shall furnish a statement of its proposed plans to the 
Commission for approval before adoption.
2-9  Spreading of unusual income; revenue and expense items.
    When the amount of any unusual item includible in an income, 
operating revenue, or operating expense account for a single period is 
relatively so large that its inclusion in the accounts for that period 
would seriously distort those accounts it may be included in account 
1890, Other Deferred Debits, or account 2450, Other Deferred Credits, as 
appropriate, and distributed in equal amounts to the accounts for the 
current and remaining periods of the year.

[[Page 179]]

No such item shall be spread beyond the accounts of the current year 
without authority of the Commission.
2-10  Current assets.
    (a) In the group of accounts designated as Current Assets (accounts 
1000 to 1190, inclusive) there shall not be included any item the amount 
or collectibility of which is not reasonably assured or for which 
provision has not been made in a reserve. Items of current character but 
of doubtful value may be carried in these accounts at a nominal value or 
included in account 1890, Other Deferred Debits, at book cost or nominal 
value, or written off, as may be appropriate.
    (b) Adjustments to accomplish the writing down of items of doubtful 
value not covered by reserves shall be made through account 4680, 
Uncollectible Revenues, account 7500, Other Deductions, or other 
appropriate ordinary income account.
2-11  Discount or premium on securities of other companies.
    (See instruction 15.)
2-12  Discount; expense and premium on capital stock.
    (a) This system of accounts provides accounts for discounts, 
commissions and expenses on capital stock and another account for 
premium on capital stock. These accounts shall be subdivided for each 
class and series of capital stock issued by the carrier. Commission and 
expenses applicable to capital stock issues shall be included in the 
commission and expense account and shall not be deducted from premium on 
capital stock.
    (b) In stating the balance sheet, discount on capital stock shall 
not be netted against premiums.
    (c) General levies or assessments against stockholders shall be 
credited to the premium account for the particular class and series of 
capital stock so assessed, except that assessments with respect to 
nonpar stock without stated value shall be credited to the capital stock 
account.
    (d) Discounts and expenses on capital stock may be amortized by 
charges to account 2900, Unearned Surplus. However, in no event shall 
net debits exceed the accumulated net credits in unearned surplus. Any 
excess of debits may be retained in account 1900, Discount on Capital 
Stock, or account 1910, Commission and Expense on Capital Stock, as 
appropriate, until the stock is reacquired or retired, or the excess 
debits may be charged to account 2946, Other Debits to Surplus.
    (e) Discount and expenses on capital stock reacquired or retired 
shall be accounted for in accordance with instruction 14.
2-13  Discount; expense and premium on long-term obligations.
    (a) A separate subdivision shall be maintained in account 23700, 
Unamortized Discount on Debt, for the excess of discount over any 
premium related to each class of long-term debt issued or assumed by the 
carrier. Debt expense shall be included in account 1890, Other Deferred 
Debits. (See definitions 20, 23, 32.)
    (b) Corresponding subdivisions shall be maintained in account 2380, 
Unamortized Premium on Debt, for the excess of the premium over any 
discount related to each class of long-term debt issued or assumed by 
the carrier.
    (c) Each period there shall be credited to each subdivision of 
account 2370, Unamortized Discount on Debt, the amount applicable to 
such period under a plan of amortization, the application of which will 
equitably distribute the balance therein over the life of the security. 
Amounts thus credited shall be concurrently charged to account 7300, 
Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense.
    (d) Correspondingly, each period there shall be charged to each 
subdivision of account 2380, Unamortized Premium on Debt, the portion of 
such credit balance which is applicable to that period. Amounts thus 
charged shall be concurrently credited to account 7400, Amortization of 
Premium on Debt.--Credit.
    (e) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, 
the balances in each of these accounts or subdivisions thereof shall be 
carried until the reacquisition of the securities to which it relates. 
At that time (unless otherwise ordered by the Commission in the

[[Page 180]]

case of an exchange of securities) the portion of the balances in these 
accounts, or subdivision for the particular class of long-term debt 
reacquired, shall be transferred to account 6500, Other Nonoperating 
Income, or account 7500, Other Deductions, as appropriate. Such portion 
shall be based on the relation of the amount of the particular issue of 
long-term debt reacquired to the total outstanding before the 
reacquisition. This provision shall also apply to securities held alive 
in sinking or other funds under instruction 14.
    (f) Except for such discount or expense as may be applicable to the 
construction period, no discount or expense on long-term debt shall be 
included in any account as a part of the cost of acquiring any property 
or as a part of the cost of operation.

[32 FR 20280, Dec. 20, 1967, as amended at 41 FR 52468, Nov. 30, 1976]
2-14  Company securities owned.
    (a) Capital stock. (1) When an issue of capital stock or any part 
thereof is reacquired, either by purchase or donation, and is retired or 
cancelled, the par value shall be charged to account 2700, Preferred 
Capital Stock, or account 2710, Common Capital Stock. Any excess of 
reacquisition cost over par value shall be allocated between account 
2900, Unearned Surplus and account 2946, Other Debits to Surplus. Any 
excess of par value over reacquisition cost shall be credited to account 
2900, Unearned Surplus.
    (2) When an issue of capital stock or any part thereof is 
reacquired, either by purchase or donation, and is not retired or 
cancelled, nor properly includible in sinking or other funds, the 
reacquisition cost shall be charged to account 2947, Treasury Stock.
    (3) When treasury stock is resold, account 2947, Treasury Stock, 
shall be credited with the cost paid for it. Gains shall be credited to 
account 2900, Unearned Surplus. Losses shall be charged to account 2900, 
Unearned Surplus to the extent that previous net gains from sales or 
retirements of the same class of stock are included therein; otherwise, 
to account 2946, Other Debits to Surplus.
    (b) Equipment and long-term obligations. (1) Equipment and other 
long-term obligations reacquired by the carrier shall be entered in 
account 1920, Reacquired Securities, at face value. The difference 
between the face value and the amounts actually paid for the reacquired 
obligations shall be included in account 6500, Other Nonoperating 
Income, or account 7500, Other Deductions, as appropriate. (See 
instruction 7). Likewise, any unamortized debt discount, expense or 
premium, applicable to the reacquired obligations, shall be adjusted 
through account 6500 or account 7500, as appropriate.
    (2) When reacquired equipment and other long-term obligations are 
resold by the carrier, the amount included in account 1920, Reacquired 
Securities, shall be credited thereto and any difference between the 
total amount realized from the sale (less related commissions and 
expenses) and the credit to account 1920 shall be included in account 
6500 or account 7500, as appropriate, unless otherwise ordered by the 
Commission.

[32 FR 20280, Dec. 20, 1967, as amended at 40 FR 44564, Sept. 29, 1975]
2-15  Book cost of securities owned.
    (a) Securities of others acquired by the carrier shall be recorded 
in these accounts at cost at the time of acquisition. Cost does not 
include any amount paid for accrued interest or dividends.
    (b) (1) Accounts 1060 ``Temporary cash investments'', 1600 
``Investments and advances--Associated Companies'', and 1650 ``Other 
investments and advances'' shall be maintained in such a manner as to 
reflect the marketable equity securities' portion (see definition 1-45) 
and other securities or investments.
    (2) For the purpose of determining net ledger value, the marketable 
equity securities in account 1060 shall be considered the current 
portfolio and the marketable equity securities in accounts 1600 and 1650 
(combined) shall be considered the noncurrent portfolio. The net ledger 
value of each portfolio shall be the lower of its aggregate cost or 
market value (see definition 1-45). The amount by which aggregate cost

[[Page 181]]

exceeds market value shall be accounted for as the valuation allowance. 
Account 1060 ``Temporary cash investments'' shall be subdivided to 
include the valuation allowance for the marketable equity securities 
included therein. Account 1676 ``Allowance for net unrealized loss on 
noncurrent marketable equity securities'' is the valuation allowance for 
the marketable equity securities included in accounts 1600 ``Investments 
and advances--Associated companies'' and 1650 ``Other investments and 
advances''. Marketable equity securities accounted for by the equity 
method shall not be combined with other marketable equity securities 
when determining aggregate cost and market value.
    (3) Realized gains and losses (the difference between net proceeds 
from sale and cost) shall be included in income of the period in which 
they occur. Changes in the valuation allowance for marketable equity 
securities included in account 1060 shall be charged to account 7500 
``Other deductions'' or credited to account 6500 ``Other nonoperating 
income'' as appropriate, with a contra entry to the valuation allowance 
contained within account 1060. Changes in the valuation allowance for 
marketable equity securities included in account 1600 and 1650 shall be 
recorded in equity account 2946.5 ``Net unrealized loss on noncurrent 
marketable equity securities'' with a contra entry to valuation account 
1676.
    (4) If there is a change in the classification of a marketable 
equity security between current and noncurrent, the security shall be 
transferred at the lower of its cost or market value at date of 
transfer. If market value is less than cost, the market value shall 
become the new cost basis, and the difference shall be accounted for as 
if it were a realized loss and included in the determination of net 
income.
    (5) The accounting company shall write down the ledger value of any 
securities to the extent of impairment in their value or write off 
entirely if there is no reasonable prospect of realizing any value 
therefrom. For long term investments in marketable equity securities, 
when the decline in market value below cost is judged to be other than 
temporary, the cost basis of the individual security shall be written 
down to a new cost basis. The amount of the write-down shall be 
accounted for as a realized loss by a charge to account 7500 ``Other 
deductions'' and a credit to account 1675 ``Reserve for adjustment of 
investment in securities''. The new cost basis shall not be changed for 
subsequent recoveries in value.
    (c) When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a 
discount (that is when the total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, 
commissions, etc., is less than par), such discount may be amortized 
over the remaining life of the securities through periodic debits to the 
account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with 
entries recording interest accruals) and credits to the same account in 
which the interest revenue is credited. No debits shall be made in 
respect to discount upon securities held as investments or in special 
funds if there is reason to believe that such securities will be 
disposed of by redemption or otherwise at less than par or will not be 
paid at the date of maturity.
    (d) When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a 
premium (that is when the total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, 
commissions, etc., is in excess of par), such premiums may be amortized 
over the remaining life of the securities through periodic credits to 
the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident 
with entries recording interest accruals) and debits to the same account 
in which the interest revenue is recorded.
    (e) Profits and losses resulting from the sale of securities of 
others shall be included in accounts 6500, Other Nonoperating Income, or 
7500, Other Deductions, as appropriate.
    (f)(1) For financial statement purposes the carrier shall follow the 
principles of equity accounting for (1) all investments in corporate 
joint ventures (see definition 1-42(c)), and (2) all investments in 
voting stock of affiliated companies giving the carrier the ability to 
significantly influence the operating and financial policies of an 
investee (see definition 1-42(b)). For purposes of this instruction an 
investment of 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an 
investee

[[Page 182]]

will indicate the ability to exercise significant influence over an 
investee in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
    (2) Since the equity method is not to be effected by entries in the 
books of accounts but is to apply only in financial reports to the 
Commission, the carrier shall establish worksheet or memorandum 
accounts. Three basic worksheet or memorandum accounts are needed:
    (i) An investment account to include (1) equity in the undistributed 
earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition (see 
definition 1-42(g)); (2) accumulated amortization of the difference 
between cost and net assets at date of acquisition (see (f)(3) below); 
and other adjustments for disposition or writedown of investments.
    (ii) An income account to include (1) the investor's share of the 
investee's undistributed profits or losses for each reporting period 
subsequent to acquisition of the investment except that in the year of 
acquisition such amount shall be determined from the date of 
acquisition; (2) amortization for the reporting period of the difference 
between cost and net assets at date of acquisition. This account shall 
be closed at year-end to the retained income memorandum account 
discussed in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this instruction.
    (iii) A retained income account to include (1) equity in the 
undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of 
acquisition; (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost 
and net assets acquired at date of acquisition (see (f)(3) below).
    (iv) Other memorandum accounts will be needed for such adjustments 
as gains and losses on disposition of investments, recognition of 
impairments in value, the investor's share of extraordinary and prior 
period items reported in the investee's financial statements (see 
instruction 2-7), and provision for deferred taxes where it is 
reasonable to assume that undistributed earnings of an investee will be 
transferred to the investor in a taxable distribution. These memorandum 
accounts shall be closed at year-end to the retained income memorandum 
account discussed in paragraph (f)(2) (iii) of this instruction.
    (3) The carrier shall retain the following information for each 
investee in support of the worksheet or memorandum accounts:
    (i) Original cost of investment.
    (ii) Equity in net assets of investee at date of acquisition.
    (iii) Allocation of difference between cost and equity in net 
assets, namely, to specific assets of investee or to goodwill.
    (iv) Accumulated amortization of difference between cost and equity 
in net assets.
    (v) Unamortized balance of difference between cost and equity in net 
assets.
    (vi) Equity in undistributed earnings/losses for each year since 
date of acquisition.
    (vii) Dividends received since date of acquisition if determinable.
    (viii) Proceeds from sale of investments.
    (4) Any difference between the investor's cost and its share of the 
net assets of the investee at date of acquisition shall be allocated to 
specific assets of the investee to the extent the difference is 
attributable to them. When the difference is allocated to depreciable or 
amortizable assets, depreciation and amortization (through the 
investment and income memorandum accounts) should absorb the difference 
over the remaining life of the related assets. If the difference is not 
related to specific accounts, it should be considered goodwill and 
amortized over a reasonable period not to exceed 40 years. For 
investments made prior to November 1, 1970, amortization of goodwill is 
not required in the absence of evidence that the goodwill has a limited 
term of existence.
    (5) The financial statements of the investee that are used for 
equity accounting should be timely. If the accounting year of the 
investee differs from that of the investor then the most recent 
available financial statements may be used. The lag in reporting should 
be consistent from period to period.
    (6) Material profits or losses on transactions between the investor 
and investee shall be eliminated until realized by either company as if 
the two were consolidated.

[[Page 183]]

    (7) A transaction of the investee of a capital nature that affects 
the investor's share of the investee's stockholder's equity should be 
reported in the financial statements as if the two were consolidated.
    (8) The investor shall deduct any dividends applicable to 
outstanding cumulative preferred stock whether or not declared, and any 
other dividends declared when computing its share of undistributed 
earnings or losses.
    (9) The investor shall suspend application of the equity method when 
the investment (including the investment memorandum account) together 
with any net advances made to the investee is reduced to zero. 
Additional losses shall not be provided for unless the investor has 
guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to 
provide further financial support for the investee. If the investee 
subsequently reports net income the investor shall resume applying the 
equity method at such time as its share of that net income equals the 
share of net losses not recognized during the period of suspension.
    (10) When the investor's voting stock interest falls below the level 
of ownership described in paragraph (f)(1) of this instruction, the 
investment no longer qualifies for the equity method. Should dividends 
received on the investment in subsequent periods exceed the investor's 
share of earnings for such periods, the investment memorandum and income 
memorandum accounts shall be reduced by the excess amount.
    (11) When the level of ownership of an investment increases to that 
described in paragraph (f)(1) of this instruction, the equity method 
shall be applied. The memorandum accounts for the investment, income 
(for current year's equity in undistributed earnings less amortization), 
and retained income (for prior years' equity in undistributed earnings 
less amortization) shall be adjusted retroactively on a step-by-step 
basis determining the equity in net assets at date of acquisition, 
amortization adjustment, and equity in undistributed earnings or losses 
at each level of ownership. Where small purchases are made over a period 
of time and then a purchase is made which qualifies the investment for 
the equity method, the date of latest purchase may be used as date of 
acquisition. In those situations where the information needed to apply 
the equity method is not determinable, the date of acquisition may be 
considered as January 1, 1974.
    (12) Information having significance with respect to the investor's 
ownership in investees shall be disclosed in notes to financial 
statements of annual reports filed with the Commission in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles.

    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules for equity accounting is 
needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the 
Commission.

2-16  Clearing accounts; purpose.
    (a) Clearing accounts, designed to facilitate the distribution of 
certain expenditures which may affect both construction and operations 
or which may affect transportation and other operations, may be kept 
when necessary in making the proper distribution of items to the 
appropriate accounts.
    (b) Balances in clearing accounts shall be fully cleared not later 
than the end of the calendar year unless items held therein 
unquestionably relate to future periods. Items carried over shall be 
included in account 1890, Other Deferred Debits, or account 2450, Other 
Deferred Credits.
2-17  Deduction of reserves.
    In stating the balance sheet, reserves shall be shown separately and 
shall be deducted from the specific assets to which they apply. Reserves 
not applicable to specific assets shall be shown on the liability side.
2-18  Disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and long-term 
obligations.
    (a) Contingency gains and losses shall be disclosed by footnotes to 
the balance sheet. This includes any arrears in cumulative dividends 
showing the amount per share of each class of

[[Page 184]]

stock and the facts and amounts related to any default in principal, 
interest or sinking fund provisions if not shown in the balance sheet 
accounts.
    (b) Commitments under unconditional purchase obligations associated 
with suppliers' financing arrangements and future payments on long-term 
borrowings and redeemable stock shall be disclosed in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. Such disclosures shall not 
preclude accounting recognition if the substance of a financing 
arrangement is the acquisition of an asset or incurrence of a liability.

[47 FR 4266, Jan. 29, 1982]
2-19  Operating property to be recorded at cost.
    (a) Amounts chargeable to the accounts 1200 and 1300, designated as 
carrier operating property accounts, shall be the actual cost to the 
carrier of the items properly includible therein also including the 
excess cost of improvements over the estimated cost at current prices of 
property removed and replaced, and shall be exclusive of any cost for 
intangible items includible in any of the subdivisions of account 1500, 
Organization, Franchises and Permits, or account 1550, Other Intangible 
Property. (See, however, instruction 20.)
    (b) The book cost of the construction or acquisition of property 
chargeable to the carrier operating property accounts 1200 and 1300 
shall include the cost of direct labor, indirect labor, materials, 
transportation, contract work, rent of construction facilities, taxes 
and interest during construction; also such portion of engineering, 
supervision, law expenditures, injuries and damages, compensation and 
other insurance, as is applicable to the construction period; and other 
analogous elements applicable to the construction and acquisition of 
property. Unless provided for otherwise, interest costs shall be 
capitalized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
    (c) Any unit of property, including additions to or betterments of 
existing property, having a cost not in excess of $500.00, or having a 
life of one year or less, may be charged to the appropriate operation 
and maintenance expense or clearing account and not to the property 
account. However, if small tools, portable equipment and similar items 
are consumed directly in construction work, the cost may be included as 
part of the cost of the constructed unit. This is not to be construed as 
authorizing the parceling of expenditures to bring them within this 
limit, or the inconsistent application of any rule or practice adopted 
by the carrier regarding the same item or class of property. Changes in 
method of applying this rule, shall be reported to the Commission.
    (d) When operating property is purchased under any plan involving 
deferred payments, no charges shall be made to operating property 
accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned by 
such form of payment.
    (e) When the consideration given for property is anything other than 
cash, the cash value of such consideration shall be used, except that 
where physical property is received in exchange for physical property, 
such property shall be recorded at the net book cost of the property 
given in exchange. In the journal entry recording such a transaction the 
actual consideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to 
identify it. The carrier shall be prepared to furnish to the Commission 
the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the 
consideration if other than cash.

[32 FR 20280, Dec. 20, 1967, as amended at 46 FR 10920, Feb. 5, 1981; 46 
FR 45959, Sept. 16, 1981]
2-20  Acquisition of a distinct operating unit.
    (a) When a motor carrier system or portion thereof constituting a 
distinct operating unit (see definition 24) is acquired by purchase or 
merger or consolidation in a pooling of equity interests of stockholders 
the accounting therefor shall be as follows:
    (1) Purchase. (i) When purchase is made from a non-affiliated 
company the assets acquired, other than carrier operating property, non-
carrier operating property and other non-operating property includible 
in accounts 1200, 1300, 1400 and 1450, and the liabilities assumed shall 
be recorded in the appropriate accounts at the amounts carried

[[Page 185]]

on the books of the transferor at date of consummation of the 
transaction. Such amounts shall be adjusted, as may be necessary, to 
conform with the rules in this system of accounts. The carrier operating 
property, non-carrier operating property and other non-operating 
property acquired shall be recorded in the appropriate subaccounts under 
accounts 1200, 1300, 1400 and 1450 based upon the fair market value or 
the cost specified in the purchase agreement if the latter does not 
exceed the fair market value of such property acquired. When the 
properties are recorded at cost specified in the purchase agreement or 
fair market value such amounts must be supported by report of a 
disinterested qualified appraiser and such additional evidence as the 
Commission may require. When an appraisal has not been obtained the 
original cost of carrier operating property, non-carrier operating 
property and other non-operating property together with the related 
depreciation reserves as shown in the books of seller shall be recorded 
in the accounts in lieu of market value.
    (ii) When purchase is made from an affiliated company the assets 
acquired including carrier operating property, noncarrier operating 
property and non-operating property, together with the related 
depreciation reserves and the liabilities assumed shall be recorded in 
the appropriate accounts at the amounts carried on the books of the 
affiliated transferor, adjusted, as may be necessary to conform with the 
rules in this system of accounts.
    (iii) The amount of the consideration paid in excess of the net 
assets acquired shall be included in account 1550, Other Intangible 
Property.

Where the consideration paid is less than the net assets acquired 
recorded in accordance with the foregoing provisions the difference 
shall be credited to account 2720, Premiums and Assessments on Capital 
Stock, where the consideration is paid in capital stock, and to account 
2900, Unearned Surplus, where the consideration is paid in other than 
capital stock.
    (2) Merger or consolidation in a pooling of equity interests of 
stockholders. (i) When a distinct operating unit is acquired by merger 
or consolidation in a pooling of equity interests of stockholders, in 
which all or substantially all of such equity interests in the 
predecessor company continue, as such, in a surviving company (which may 
be the transferee or a new company, created for the purpose) the assets, 
liabilities and the earned surplus or deficit, if any, of the 
predecessor company shall be recorded in the accounts of the transferee 
at amounts carried on the books of the predecessor company at date of 
consummation of the transaction. Such amounts shall be adjusted, if 
necessary, to conform with the rules in this system of accounts. Where 
one of the constituent corporations is clearly dominant and its 
stockholders obtain 90 percent or more of the voting interest in the 
combined enterprise there is a presumption that the transaction is a 
purchase rather than a pooling of interests and the transaction shall be 
so accounted for unless otherwise directed or authorized by the 
Commission.
    (ii) When the total par value or stated value of no par capital 
stock of the surviving company is more than the aggregate total of the 
capital stock of the separate companies before merger or consolidation 
the excess shall be charged to account 2900, Unearned Surplus, or to 
account 2930, Earned Surplus, if unrestricted unearned surplus is not 
available for such purpose.

When the total par value or stated value of no par capital stock of the 
surviving company is less than the aggregate total of the capital stock 
of the separate companies before merger or consolidation, the difference 
shall be credited to account 2900, Unearned Surplus.
    (3) Records. Detailed records, including copy of appraisal reports, 
shall be maintained showing the basis used for computing amounts 
included in accounts 1200, 1300, 1400, 1450, 1550, 2900, 2930, and other 
accounts. Full supporting details showing the purchase price, the 
principals from whom the property was acquired, and agents who 
represented such principals shall be stated in the journal entries 
recording the acquisition of the property.

[[Page 186]]

2-21  Operating property retired.
    When carrier operating property (see definition 10) ceases to be 
used (see definition 40) it shall be retired. If not dismantled or 
otherwise disposed of, it shall be transferred to account 1400, Non-
Carrier Operating Property, or account 1450, Non-Operating Property, as 
appropriate. (See instruction 23.)
    (a) Property under ``unit plan'' of depreciation. When a unit of 
property on which depreciation charges were accrued under the unit plan 
(see definition 22) is retired from service, the book cost of such 
property shall be credited to the appropriate property account and 
concurrently charged, together with the cost of removal, to the 
depreciation reserve account. Any salvage or insurance recovered, 
including amounts provided for in any insurance or other reserve with 
respect to the retired property when such reserve covers the cause of 
retirement, shall be credited to the depreciation reserve. Any 
difference remaining in the depreciation reserve after the above entries 
shall be charged or credited as appropriate to account 5091, 
Depreciation Adjustment.
    (b) Property under ``group plan'' of depreciation. When a unit of 
property, on which depreciation charges were accrued under the group 
plan (see definition 22), is retired from service, the book cost thereof 
shall be credited to the appropriate property account and concurrently 
charged, together with the cost of removal, to the depreciation reserve 
account. Any salvage or insurance recovered, including amounts provided 
for in any insurance or other reserve with respect to the retired 
property, when such reserve covers the cause of retirement, shall be 
credited to the depreciation reserve account.
    (c) Minor items. When the property retired constitutes a minor item 
(see definition 28), the book cost of which has been or will be 
accounted for by its inclusion in the unit of property of which it is a 
part when such unit of property is retired, no adjustment of the 
operating property account or depreciation reserve is required therefor. 
When a minor item is retired and replaced, with property of like 
purpose, the entire cost of replacement shall be charged to the account 
appropriate for the cost of repairs of the property retired, except that 
if the replacement effects a betterment (see definition 7), there shall 
be charged to the property account, the excess cost of the replacement 
over the estimated cost at current prices of the items retired (see 
instruction 19 (c)): Provided, That property bettered shall not be 
carried in excess of the current cost new of equivalent property.
    (d) Land. When land is sold, the book cost shall be credited to the 
land account and any difference between the book cost and the sales 
price, less commissions and expenses on the sale, shall be adjusted 
through account 6500, Other Non-operating Income, or account 7500, Other 
Deductions, as appropriate.
    (e) Determination of book cost. The book cost of operating property 
retired shall be the amount at which such property is included in the 
operating property accounts including all items set forth in instruction 
19. Such costs shall be determined from the carrier's records when this 
can be done, as in the case of land, structures, revenue automotive 
equipment, service equipment, furniture, and other items of operating 
property for which individual cost records are available. When the 
actual book cost cannot be determined from the records, it shall be 
estimated. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each 
item due to the relatively large number and/or small cost of such items, 
the average book costs of all the items, with due allowance for 
differences in size or character, shall be used as the book cost of the 
items retired. The latter method may be applied in retirement of such 
items as spare parts, tools, etc.
    (f) Intangibles. The accounting for the retirement of items included 
in account 1511, Franchises, account 1541, Patents, and intangible 
elements with limited terms included in account 1201, Land and Land 
Rights, shall be as provided in the texts of account 2600, Reserve for 
Amortization--Carrier Operating Property, and account 5100, Amortization 
of Carrier Operating Property.

[[Page 187]]

    (g) Sale of property. When operating property used in transportation 
operations is sold together with the transportation business associated 
therewith, the book cost of the property shall be credited to the 
appropriate operating property accounts and the amounts carried with 
respect thereto in the depreciation and amortization reserve accounts, 
estimated if necessary, shall be charged to such reserves. The 
difference, if any, between (1) the net amount of such debit and credit 
items, and (2) the consideration received for the property, shall be 
included in account 6500, Other Non-operating Income, or account 7500, 
Other Deductions, as appropriate. (See instruction 7.)

[32 FR 20280, Dec. 20, 1967, as amended at 40 FR 53252, Nov. 17, 1975]
2-22  Leased property; expenditures.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the cost of 
initial improvements, including rearrangements, additions and 
betterments to property leased from others made in the course of 
preparing the property for motor carrier operations and the cost of any 
subsequent additions to and betterments of such leased property shall be 
charged to the operating property account 1271, Improvements to 
leasehold property. Depreciation on such expenditures shall be provided 
for in accordance with instruction 25.
    (b) When the cost of alterations to leased transportation property 
otherwise chargeable to account 1271, Improvements to leasehold 
property, is not in excess of $500.00 or the period of the lease is less 
than one year, the cost may be charged to the accounts chargeable with 
the cost of repairs to such property. Changes in method of applying this 
rule shall be reported to the Commission.

[46 FR 45959, Sept. 16, 1981]
2-23  Transfer of property.
    Property transferred between accounts 1200, Carrier Operating 
Property, 1300, Carrier Operating Property Leased to Others, and 
accounts 1400, Non-Carrier Operating Property, 1450, Non-Operating 
Property, shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to the carrier 
operating property accounts 1200 and 1300 at its book cost with the 
debits or credits to the appropriate accounts for the accrued 
depreciation and amortization to date of transfer.
2-24  Common property.
    (a) If the carrier is engaged in forms of enterprise other than 
motor carrier operations and any of its carrier operating property is 
used in common for two or more purposes to such an extent and in such 
manner that it is otherwise impracticable to segregate it in the 
accounts, an allocation of the book cost thereof shall be made and the 
portion so ascertained to be assignable to motor carrier operations 
shall be recorded in the carrier operating property accounts 1200 and 
1300. The remainder shall be recorded in accounts 1400 or 1450 as 
appropriate. It is not contemplated that minor or temporary changes in 
conditions shall necessitate frequent reallocations of common property.
    (b) The carrier shall be prepared to show at any time and to report 
to the Commission when required, and by carrier operating property 
accounts 1200 and 1300 the following:
    (1) The book cost of common property.
    (2) The allocation of such cost to carrier operations and other 
purposes for which the jointly operated property is used, and
    (3) The basis of the allocation.
    (c) The expenses of operation, maintenance, depreciation and 
amortization of common property shall be recorded in the accounts 
prescribed in this part and the allocation of such expenses to the 
carrier operations shall be supported in the same manner as the 
allocation of the cost of such property.
2-25  Depreciation accounting.
    (a) There shall be charged each month (or 4-week period) to account 
5000, Depreciation Expense, and credited to account 2500, Reserve for 
Depreciation--Carrier Operating Property, during the service life of 
depreciable property, included in account 1200, Carrier Operating 
Property, amounts which will approximate the loss in service value not 
restored by current

[[Page 188]]

maintenance or covered by insurance, the effect of which can be forecast 
with a reasonable approach to accuracy. The straight-line method of 
computing depreciation (see definition 38) shall be used and the current 
depreciation charge shall be obtained by applying the applicable portion 
of the annual percentage rate to the book cost balances, except that the 
mileage method (see definition 27) may be used on automotive equipment, 
in which event the rate per mile shall be applied to the number of miles 
traveled each period. In no event, however, shall the charges based on 
such mileage method be less during any calendar year than would result 
from the application of rates based on the straight-line method.
    Carriers engaged in seasonal operations may apportion the estimated 
annual depreciation charge over the months in which operations are 
actually conducted.
    (b) Depreciation charges on property included in accounts

1211  Structures
1221  Revenue Equipment
1231  Service Cars and Equipment

shall be computed on the unit plan (see definition 22) under the 
straight-line method. Depreciation charges on any unit of property which 
is depreciated under the unit plan shall cease when the estimated 
service value shall have been credited to the depreciation reserve.
    (c) Depreciation charges on property included in accounts

1241  Shop and Garage Equipment
1251  Furniture and Office Equipment
1261  Miscellaneous Equipment

shall be computed under either the unit plan or the group plan. (See 
definition 22.) If the group plan is used the current depreciation 
charge shall be determined by applying the applicable portion of the 
annual percentage rate to the sum total of the book cost balances of the 
property included in each account, or subdivisions thereof, at the rate 
determined from weighted averages of service lives of the property 
included therein.
    (d) Depreciation charges on property included in account 1271--
Improvements to Leasehold Property, shall be made upon the same basis as 
for similar depreciable property includible in other property accounts. 
However, where it is reasonably certain that the lease will not be 
renewed and the property will revert to the lessor it should be 
depreciated over the remaining period of the lease or its estimated 
service life, whichever is less.
    (e) Depreciation charges upon operating property constituting a 
distinct operating unit (see definition 24), leased from others under 
terms whereby the carrier has exclusive possession, shall be made on the 
same basis as for owned depreciable property. (See instruction 30.) 
Records shall be maintained similar to those for owned property showing 
the cost, service life and salvage value for each unit of depreciable 
operating property leased from others.
    (f) Depreciation charges on operating property constituting a 
distinct operating unit (see definition 24) leased to others for 
transportation operations, when the lessee has exclusive possession, 
shall be charged to account 5500, Income from Lease of Carrier Property, 
Credit, with concurrent credits to account 2500, Reserve for 
Depreciation--Carrier Operating Property.
    (g) Depreciation expense on non-carrier operating property and non-
operating property shall be charged to the appropriate Other Income 
account and credited to account 2610, Reserve for Depreciation and 
Amortization, Other Property.
2-26  Cost of repairs.
    (a) The cost of repairs chargeable to the various operation and 
maintenance expense accounts includes labor employed, materials used, 
and expenses incurred in all current maintenance (not including 
depreciation and amortization), such as:
    (1) Inspecting, testing, and reporting on the condition of operating 
property specifically to determine the need for repairs, minor 
replacements, rearrangements, and changes.
    (2) Testing for, locating, and clearing trouble.
    (3) Routine work to prevent trouble, such as general overhauling, 
removing carbon, grinding valves, adjusting and relining brakes, 
adjusting shock absorbers, cleaning and adjusting engines, etc.

[[Page 189]]

    (4) Replacing minor items of operating property. (See also 
instruction 21(c).)
    (5) Rearranging and changing the location of property not retired.
    (6) Restoring the condition of property damaged by wear and tear, 
storms, breakage, floods, fire, accident, or other casualties. (See also 
paragraph (b) of this section.)
    (7) Training employees, for repair work.
    (8) Inspecting and testing after repairs have been made.
    (b) Materials recovered in connection with repairs to property shall 
be credited to the same account to which the repair cost was charged.
    (c) If employees engaged in transportation, station or terminal 
service are also required to make repairs, an equitable proportion of 
their pay and expenses shall be charged to the account appropriate for 
the cost of such repairs. (See instruction 28.)
    (d) If the book cost of any property is carried in account 1281, 
Undistributed Property, the repairs to such property shall be charged to 
the accounts provided for repairs to property of the same nature and 
use, the book cost of which is carried in other operating property 
accounts. Repairs to property leased from others shall be treated in 
like manner.
2-27  Insurance.
    (a) Provision has been made under Operation and Maintenance Expenses 
for recording amounts of premiums paid outside insurance companies in 
accounts as follows:

4520  Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance.
4541  Workmen's Compensation, Insurance.
4550  Baggage and Express Insurance.
4570  Fire and Theft Insurance.
4580  Other Insurance.

    Premiums paid in advance shall be charged to account 1170, 
Prepayments, and equitably distributed to the appropriate accounts over 
the period for which the premiums have been paid, except minor premiums 
which may be charged direct and premiums chargeable to construction.
    (b) Carriers authorized by the Commission to accrue charges for the 
purpose of estimating losses sustained by others not covered by 
commercial insurance and representing liabilities to the carrier, such 
as bodily injury and property damage insurance and cargo loss and damage 
insurance, shall record periodic charges to the appropriate expense 
accounts in amounts sufficient to cover estimated losses based on the 
carrier's experience.
    (c) The following accounts have been provided under Operation and 
Maintenance Expenses for the purpose of estimating amounts sufficient to 
settle claims by others for the classes of risks cited above which are 
not covered by commercial insurance:

4530  Injuries and Damages.
4546  Workmen's Compensation--Provision for Claims.
4560  Baggage and Express Loss and Damage.
4570  Fire and Theft Insurance.
4580  Other Insurance.

    Accruals for estimated claims from injuries and damages, workmen's 
compensation and baggage and express loss and damage shall be included 
in account 2680, Injuries, Loss and Damage Reserves. The carrier shall 
not accrue amounts to cover risk of loss or damage to its property from 
fire, theft, or similar loss contingencies.
    Periodic charges to expense accounts for the purpose of creating 
accruals for the estimated liability for losses sustained by others not 
covered by outside insurance shall be determined currently by the 
carrier from its best source of information and the rates used may be 
based on percentage of revenue, mileage of buses, amount of payrolls or 
other equitable basis.

[32 FR 20280, Dec. 20, 1967, as amended at 37 FR 25845, Dec. 5, 1972; 41 
FR 32598, Aug. 4, 1976]
2-28  Distribution of pay and expenses of employees.
    The charges to investments, operation and maintenance expenses, and 
other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in 
activities chargeable to various accounts, shall be based upon the 
actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or in case that 
method is impracticable, upon the basis of a study of the

[[Page 190]]

time actually engaged during a representative period. The pay and 
expenses of an employee of one department who occasionally performs 
incidental services involving but small expense for another department 
may be included in the expense of the department in which the employee 
is regularly employed.
2-29  Joint expenses.
    Where the carrier owns the joint facility, any amounts received as 
reimbursement of operation and maintenance costs shall be credited to 
the appropriate joint facilities--credit account under maintenance and 
garage expenses; station and terminal expenses; or administrative and 
general expenses. Any amounts received for depreciation, taxes and 
return on the joint facility, shall be credited to account 5390, Joint 
Facility Rents--Credit. Similarly, any amounts paid by the carrier under 
joint facility arrangements for operating and maintenance costs shall be 
charged to the appropriate joint facilities--debit account in the 
operation and maintenance expense group of accounts and any amounts paid 
for depreciation, taxes and return on the joint facility, shall be 
charged to account 5340, Joint Facility Rents--Debit.
2-30  Rent and lease of carrier property.
    (a) Provision is made in the several subdivisions of account 5300, 
Operating Rents--Net, for rents receivable and payable for use of 
property other than that constituting a distinct operating unit or 
system. (See definition 24.)
    (b) Taxes payable by the lessee upon property rented or leased shall 
be included in account 5200, Operating Taxes and Licenses, by the 
lessee.
    (c) Other expenses payable by the lessee shall be included in the 
appropriate accounts on the books of the lessee.
    (d) Amounts payable for use of operating property constituting a 
distinct operating unit (see definition 24) leased from others under 
terms whereby the carrier has exclusive possession shall be apportioned 
between rent and depreciation. The portion covering rent shall be 
included in account 5400, Rent for Lease of Carrier Property--Debit, and 
the portion covering depreciation shall be included in account 5000, 
Depreciation Expense. (See instruction 25.)
    (e) The lessor shall credit the amount receivable for use of the 
property leased to account 5500, Income from Lease of Carrier Property--
Credit. The lessor shall charge the estimated depreciation accrual to 
account 5500 and credit account 2500, Reserve for Depreciation--Carrier 
Operating Property.
    (f) If settlement for either rent or depreciation is not made 
currently the amounts thereof shall be accrued by both lessor and lessee 
in harmony with the instructions in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section. The amounts accrued receivable, and payable, should be included 
in appropriate accounts classified under accounts 1890, Other Deferred 
Debits, and 2450, Other Deferred Credits, by the lessor and lessee, 
respectively.
2-31  Amortization of intangibles.
    (a) For intangible assets acquired after December 31, 1979, the cost 
of the asset shall be amortized by systematic charges to account 5100, 
Amortization of Carrier Operating Property, or account 7500, Other 
Deductions, as prescribed by the account texts for accounts in the 1500 
series. Systemtic charges shall be made over the period of useful life 
not to exceed 40 years from the date of acquisition. Such charges shall 
be based on the straight line method of amortization unless the carrier 
demonstrates that another method more adequately reflects the decline in 
economic service value of the asset.
    (b) For unamortized intangible assets acquired after October 31, 
1970, but before December 31, 1979, the cost of the assets shall be 
adjusted in the accounts to retroactively reflect the generally accepted 
accounting principle of amortization of intangible assets. Subsequent 
accounting shall be in accordance with paragraph (a) above.
    (c) For intangible assets held before November 1, 1970, the carrier 
shall consider the life expectancy of the asset to determine the 
appropriate accounting. Intangible assets with limited lives shall be 
amortized over their estimated

[[Page 191]]

period of future use. A retroactive adjustment shall be necessary if the 
particular intangible asset has never been amortized. Intangible assets 
with indeterminate lives may remain unamortized or may be amortized 
prospectively over a period of 40 years from date of acquisition.

[46 FR 59545, Dec. 7, 1981]
2-32  Accounting for income taxes.
    (a) The interperiod tax allocation method of accounting shall be 
applied where material timing differences (see definition 1-41(e)) occur 
between pretax accounting income and taxable income. Carriers may elect, 
as provided by the Revenue Act of 1971, to account for the investment 
tax credit by either the flow through method or the deferred method of 
accounting. See paragraphs (d) and (e) below. All income taxes (Federal, 
state and other) currently accruable for income tax return purposes 
shall be charged to account 8000, Income taxes on ordinary income, and 
account 9050, Income taxes on extraordinary items, as applicable.
    (b) Under the interperiod tax allocation method of accounting the 
tax effect of timing differences (see definition 1-41) originating in 
the current accounting period are allocated to income tax expense of 
future periods when the timing differences reverse. Similar timing 
differences originating and reversing in the current accounting period 
should be combined into groups and the current tax rates applied to 
determine the tax effect of each group. A carrier shall not apply other 
than current tax rates in determining the tax effect of reversing 
differences except upon approval of the Commission. When determining the 
amount of deferred taxes, rather than computing state and other taxes 
individually by jurisdiction, the Federal income tax rate may be 
increased by a percent equivalent to the effect of taxes imposed by the 
jurisdictions. In classifying a deferred charge or credit as current or 
noncurrent a carrier shall follow the classification criteria used for 
the related asset or liability which caused the timing difference. A 
deferred charge or credit that is not related to an asset or liability 
because (1) there is no associated asset or liability or (2) reduction 
of an associated asset or liability will not cause the timing difference 
to reverse shall be classified based on the expected reversal date of 
the specific timing difference. Such classification disregards any 
additional timing differences that may arise and is based on the 
criteria used for classifying other assets and liabilities.
    (c) The future tax benefits of loss carryforwards shall normally be 
recognized in the year in which such loss is applied to reduce taxes. 
Only in those unusual instances when realization is assured beyond any 
reasonable doubt should the future tax benefits of loss carryforwards be 
recognized in the year of loss. The tax effects of any realizable loss 
carrybacks shall be recognized in the determination of net income (loss) 
of the loss periods; appropriate adjustments of existing net deferred 
tax credits may also be necessary in the loss period.
    (d) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by 
the flow through method shall credit account 8000, Income taxes on 
ordinary income, or account 9050, Income taxes on extraordinary items, 
as applicable, and charge account 2120, Taxes accrued, with the amount 
of investment tax credit utilized in the current accounting period. When 
the flow through method is followed for the investment tax credit, 
account 8040, Provision for deferred taxes, shall reflect the difference 
between the tax payable (after recognition of allowable investment tax 
credit) based on taxable income and tax expense (with full recognition 
of investment tax credit that would be allowable based on accounting 
income) based on accounting income.
    (e) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by 
the deferred method shall concurrently with making the entries 
prescribed in (d) above charge account 8040. Provision for deferred 
taxes or account 9060, Provision for deferred taxes--extraordinary 
items, as applicable, and shall credit account 2460. Accumulated 
deferred income tax credits with the investment tax credit utilized as a 
reduction of the current year's tax liability but deferred for 
accounting purposes. The investment tax credit so deferred

[[Page 192]]

shall be a mortized by credits to account 8040, Provision for deferred 
taxes.

    Note A: Any change in practice of accounting for the investment tax 
credit shall be reported promptly to the Commission. Carriers desiring 
to clear deferred investment tax credits because of a change from the 
deferral method to the flow through method shall submit the proposed 
journal entry to the Commission for consideration and advice.
    Note B: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the accounting rules for income 
taxes is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant 
or the Commission.

47 FR 12350, Mar. 23, 1982]
2-33  Transactions with affiliated companies.
    (a) The records and supporting data of all transactions with 
affiliated companies shall be maintained in a separate file. The types 
of transactions referred to in this paragraph are for management 
services or any other type of services rendered, sale or use of 
facilities or any other type of assets or property. The file shall be 
maintained so as to enable the carrier, upon a Commission request, to 
furnish accurate information with supporting documentation about 
particular transactions within 15 days of the request. We do not intend 
the file to include data relating to ordinary carrier operations (e.g., 
lawful tariff charges).
    (b) Each bill rendered by an affiliated company shall state 
specifically the basis used for determining charges, unless the file 
contains other information to support the specific basis for charges.
    (c) Punched cards, magnetic tapes, discs, or other machine-sensible 
device used for recording, consolidating, and summarizing accounting 
transactions and records with a carrier's electronic or automatic data 
processing system may constitute a file within the meaning of this 
instruction.
    (d) The carrier shall record, as the cost of assets or services 
received from an affiliated supplier, the invoice price (plus any 
incidental costs related to those transactions) in those cases where the 
invoice price can be determined from a prevailing price list of the 
affiliated supplier available to the general public in the normal course 
of business. If no such price list exists, the charges shall be recorded 
at the lower of their cost to the originating affiliated supplier (less 
all applicable valuation reserves in case of asset sales), or their 
estimated fair market value determined on the basis of a representative 
study of similar competitive and arm's-length or bargained transactions.
    Any difference between actual transaction price and the above, as 
well as charges that are not transportation related, shall be considered 
of a financing nature and shall be recorded, accordingly, as 
nonoperating charges or credits. (See instruction 2-34).
    (e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as restraining the 
carrier from subdividing accounts (see instruction 2-2(d)) for the 
purpose of recording separately transactions with affiliated companies.

[40 FR 44564, Sept. 29, 1975]
2-34  Charges to be just and reasonable.
    All charges to the accounts prescribed in this system of accounts 
for carrier property, operating revenues, operating and maintenance 
expenses, and other carrier expenses, shall be just, reasonable and not 
exceed amounts necessary to the honest and efficient operations and 
management of carrier business. Payments shall not exceed the fair 
market value of goods and services acquired in an arm's-length 
transaction. Any payments in excess of such just and reasonable charges 
shall be included in account 7500, Other Deductions.

[40 FR 44564, Sept. 29, 1975]

2-35  Accounting for leases.
    (a) Leases shall be accounted for as capital leases whenever the 
lease meets one or more of the following four criteria:
    (1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by 
the end of the lease term,
    (2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option,

[[Page 193]]

    (3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated 
economic life of the property, and,
    (4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the 
minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair value of 
the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease less any 
related investment tax credit retained by the lessor.
    (b) If the lease does not meet any of the four criteria, the lease 
shall be classified and accounted for as an operating lease.
    (c) When accounting for capital leases the lessee shall record the 
asset and the related obligation. The amount recorded as the asset and 
the obligation shall be the present value at the beginning of the lease 
term of the minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that 
portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, 
maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor. However, if that amount 
exceeds the fair value of the leased property, the amount recorded as 
the asset and the obligation shall be the fair value. The lessee shall 
compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its 
incremental borrowing rate unless (1) it is practicable to learn the 
implicit rate computed by the lessor and (2) the implicit rate computed 
by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If 
both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit 
rate.
    (d) Amortization of the recorded asset shall be as follows:
    (1) If the lease meets either the first or the second criteria for 
capitalization, the asset shall be amortized in accordance with the 
lessee's normal depreciation policy.
    (2) If the lease does not meet the first or second criteria, the 
asset should be amortized over the lease term.
    (e) The accounting accorded the lease shall be subject to the same 
considerations as other obligations in classifying them with current and 
noncurrent liabilities in the classified balance sheet. Leases that meet 
the criteria requiring capitalization shall be recorded in those 
accounts that provide for carrier operating property or property used in 
other than carrier operations, as appropriate. The accounts shall 
segregate the amounts pertaining to capital leases.
    (f) If the lease qualifies as an operating lease it should be 
accounted for by charging the rent to expense over the lease term. The 
rental expense should be recognized on a straight line basis over the 
lease term unless another method is more representative of the use and 
the benefits derived.
    (g) The criteria specified in paragraph (a) should be applied to all 
leases regardless of the relationship between the lessor and the lessee 
unless it is clear that the terms of the lease transaction have been 
significantly affected by their relationship. In this situation, the 
accounting should be modified to recognize economic substance rather 
than legal form.
    (h) In the case of subsidiary companies or companies under common 
control whose principal business activity is leasing property or 
facilities to the carrier, the carrier is encouraged to request special 
authority to file consolidated or combined financial statements. If the 
carrier does not wish to file consolidated or combined financial 
statements, capitalization of the lease will be required if the lease 
meets the criteria that would require capitalization.

    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules for lease accounting is 
needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the 
Commission.

[42 FR 56613, Oct. 27, 1977]
2-36  Transfers from government authorities.

    When a Federal, State, or municipal government transfers cash or 
other assets to a motor carrier of passengers, the transaction shall be 
accounted for in accordance with the provisions set forth hereunder.
    (a) The following forms of government transfers shall be included in 
account 3700, ``Operating Revenues--Transfers from Government 
Authorities for Current Operations'' when received:
    (1) Payments as reimbursement for operating losses sustained on a 
specific route or in a certain region, such as

[[Page 194]]

support of busline commuter operations;
    (2) Subsidies designated by the donor to offset operating expenses 
of the recipient, and
    (3) Subsidies which may be applied at the discretion of the 
recipient to operating expenses and/or operating property.
    (b) Government transfers relating to the acquisition, addition to, 
or improvement of depreciable operating property shall be included in 
account 2410, ``Deferred Revenues--Transfers from Government 
Authorities'' when received. Account 2410 shall be periodically charged, 
and account 3800, ``Operating Revenues--Amortization of Deferred 
Transfers from Government Authorities'' shall be credited with amounts 
equal to the depreciation costs of the assets to which they apply.
    (c) Government transfers in the form of, or designated for the 
purchase of nondepreciable operating porperty shall be included in 
account 2900, ``Unearned Surplus'' in the manner described in the text 
of that account.
    (d) The provisions of this section do not apply to government 
payments for specific services rendered by the carrier in transporting 
passengers by bus line (other than services described in paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section). Such payments shall be included in account 
3000, ``Operating Revenues (Exclusive of Government Transfers).''
    (e) The provisions of this section do not apply to government 
transfers relating to other than carrier operations.
    (f) The provisions of this section do not apply to government 
transfers in exchange for debt and/or equity securities of recipients.
    (g) Government transfers shall generally be recorded when made 
available to the carrier. However, transfer relating to specific 
operations shall be recorded as earned.
    (h) Government transfers in the form of assets other than cash shall 
be recorded at fair value when received.

[43 FR 30560, July 17, 1978]
2-37  Business entertainment expenses.
    (a) Business entertainment expenses are to be accounted for as 
operating expenses when incurred in conjunction with sales or marketing 
related activities. Sales or marketing related activities are those that 
emphasize a carrier's ability to provide efficient, timely and 
competitive service. These activities include outlays designed to 
promote new business as well as outlays incurred in maintaining existing 
business. The entertainment expenditures must be reasonable in relation 
to the business conducted and the business purpose for the entertainment 
must be adequately supported. Examples of this type of activity include 
the following:
    (1) Salespersons' salaries and travel expenses, advertising, 
promotional and educational material;
    (2) The conduct of shipper symposiums, conferences, meetings and 
traffic related functions;
    (3) The use of direct mail solicitations and the publication and 
distribution of routing guides and service directories;
    (4) Incidental promotional materials such as road atlases, 
calendars, pens, scratchpads, and other materials of nominal value;
    (5) The conduct of business oriented lunches and dinners, public 
affairs programming, conferences and customer service calls;
    (6) Sponsoring sales promotion functions, involving a number of 
customers or potential customers.

It must be noted that an activity listed above is not to be 
automatically accounted for as an operating expense. A carrier must be 
able to justify that an activity was primarily sales or marketing 
related.
    (b) Business entertainment expenses are to be accounted for as non-
operating expenses when they cannot be shown to be related to the sales 
or marketing activity. These are expenses that are primarily related to 
recreation or to the convenience and comfort of the individuals rather 
than to the transaction of business. Examples of this type of activity 
include the following:
    (1) Recreational or resort entertainment, including but not limited 
to, fishing, hunting, tennis, golfing, skiing or other sporting or 
recreational trips or outings;
    (2) Expense paid transportation in any carrier owned, leased or 
furnished

[[Page 195]]

vehicles, planes, helicopters, boats, yachts, or other methods;
    (3) Expense paid lodging in any carrier owned, leased or furnished 
motels, hotels, apartments, condominiums, lodges, rooms and other places 
of overnight accommodation;
    (4) Paid admission to any sporting, cultural, educational, 
recreational, or entertaining occurrence or event;
    (5) Gifts such as athletic equipment, food or liquor, beverages of 
all types, smoking materials, clothing and personal accessories;
    (6) The furnishing of lunches, dinners, appetizers or beverages 
where there is no true business purpose;
    (7) Social occasions such as holiday parties.

It must be noted that an activity listed above is not to be 
automatically accounted for as a non-operating expense. If a carrier can 
justify that the activity was primarily sales or marketing related, it 
may be accounted for as an operating expense.

    Note: The examples listed above are not inclusive, but are intended 
as a guide to give carriers an indication of what will or will not be 
permitted to be recovered through the rate structure. In all instances 
the burden of proof will fall on the carrier involved.

    (b) When any materials or supplies, the cost of which has been 
charged to this account, are issued for use, the amount at which they 
stand charged herein shall be credited to this account and charged to 
the appropriate construction, operation and maintenance expense, or 
other account. Such amount may be based upon the average cost of all

                            Tangible Property

1200  Carrier operating property.
    (a) This account shall include the total of the amounts representing 
the cost (see instruction 19) of carrier operating property, included in 
accounts 1201 to 1291, inclusive, owned and used by the carrier in its 
motor carrier operations, and which has an expected life

[[Page 199]]

in service of more than 1 year, including such property owned by the 
carrier but held by nominees.
    (b) When property normally having a service life of more than 1 year 
is installed for temporary use in motor carrier operations, it shall be 
accounted for in the same manner as property installed for permanent 
use.
    (c) Records shall be kept so as to reflect separately the cost and 
date of acquisition of property jointly owned and property operated 
under a joint agreement; also the cost and date of acquisition of each 
structure, unit of equipment, or other major item of property (or at the 
option of the carrier of each body, chassis or other major part). When a 
major part of a unit of property, such as a body or chassis of equipment 
or portion of a structure has been replaced by either a new or rebuilt 
one, details shall appear in the supporting records showing also the 
cost of the property removed, the cost of the replacement, and the date 
of removal or replacement. If property such as a structure or unit of 
equipment is constructed new, or rebuit by the carrier to increase its 
capacity or otherwise add to its usefulness for motor carrier service, 
or if parts are purchased and assembled by the carrier, the cost records 
for construction and assembly shall be maintained in a sufficiently 
complete manner to show the cost of labor, materials and other expenses 
incurred in such work.
    (d) When a structure, unit of equipment, or other property is so 
rebuilt or remodeled as to create an expectation of service life fairly 
comparable with new property, the old property shall be retired 
(instruction 21). Charges to this account for the rebuilt or remodeled 
property shall be based upon the appraised value of the reused parts, or 
the net book cost at time of retirement of the retired unit, whichever 
is lower, plus the cost of rebuilding or remodeling. Provided, however, 
That in no event shall the total amount charged exceed the cost of 
similar new property.
    (e) The cost of removing old appliances and replacing them with new 
appliances shall be charged to the proper account under operation and 
maintenance expenses.
    (f) The cost of additions to and betterments of property leased from 
others shall be recorded in account 1271, Improvements to Leasehold 
Property. (See instruction 22.)

purposes as general office buildings, shops, garages, stations, 
terminals, waiting rooms, shelters, loading platforms, warehouses, and 
the like. This includes the first cost of acquiring leaseholds of land, 
easements, and rights-of-way, but no rents payable periodically in 
consideration of rights so obtained.
    (b) The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public 
improvements) shall not be included in the land accounts. If at the time 
of acquisition of an interest in land such interest extends to buildings 
or other improvements (other than public improvements), which are then 
devoted to carrier operations, the land and improvements shall be 
separately appraised and the cost allocated to land and buildings or 
improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are 
removed or wrecked without being used in carrier operations, the cost of 
removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the 
account in which the cost of the land is recorded.
    (c) Carriers shall keep the records so as to show separately the 
cost of each parcel of land or interest therein and the purpose or 
purposes for which used in motor carrier operations.

use in such service within 1 year, the cost of such land shall be 
charged to account 1400, Non-Carrier Operating Property, or to account 
1450, Non-Operating Property, as appropriate. If land originally charged 
to either of these accounts is later used for motor carrier operations, 
it shall be charged to Carrier Operating Property in service at its cost 
when acquired. (See instruction 23.)

unless identical in all provisions, nor shall there be carried any

    (c) When stock is issued for cash, that fact shall be stated; if for

be designated and the consideration for which it is issued shall be 
described with sufficient particularity to identify it. If such issuance 
is to the treasurer or other agent of the corporation for purpose of 
sale, that fact and the name of such agent shall be shown; and such 
agent shall show like details concerning the consideration realized 
therefor in his account of the disposition thereof, which when accepted

carrier by the proprietor thereof and shall be charged with all 
withdrawals from the business by its proprietor. At the end of each 
calendar year the net income for the year as developed in the income

entered in this account such items as in corporate organizations are 
handled through earned surplus accounts 2930 to 2946. (See optional

compensation for services performed, shall be charged to the appropriate 
operation and maintenance expense or other accounts.
    Note B: This account may be restricted to the amount considered by 
the proprietor to be the permanent investment in the business, subject

withdrawals of portions thereof not representing net income. When this 
option is taken the surplus accounts shall be maintained and entries 
thereto shall be made in accordance with the texts thereof.
2810  Partnership capital.
    This account shall be credited, where the business is conducted by 
an unincorporated firm, co-partnership or under any style other than 
that of an incorporated company or sole proprietorship, with the 
respective amounts paid into the business by the partners therein, and 
shall be charged with all withdrawals from the business by each partner.

developed in the income account shall be transferred to this account.

the members of the co-partnership to be their permanent investment in 
the business, subject to change only by additional investments by the 
copartners or the withdrawals of portions thereof not representing net 
income. When this option is taken the surplus accounts shall be 
maintained and entries thereto shall be made in accordance with the 
texts thereof.

                          List of Instructions


<R05>
Sec. 1242.00  Separation of common operating expenses.

    (a) Commencing with annual reports for the year 1978 or for any 
portion thereof until further order, all class I railroad companies 
including class I

[[Page 250]]

switching and terminal companies (Sec. 1240.1 of this chapter) subject 
to section 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended shall separate 
operating expenses common to both freight service and passenger service 
in accordance with the regulation in this part.
    (b) The carrier shall maintain records supporting its common 
operating expense apportionments to freight and passenger services. The 
carrier shall report common expense apportionments to the Commission as 
required.

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 1242.01  Expenses solely related to freight service and passenger service.

    The Uniform System of Accounts for Railroad Companies (49 CFR part 
1201) requires that carriers assign directly to freight service or to 
passenger service, including allied services, the expenses, taxes, and 
purchased services incurred solely for the benefit of either freight or 
passenger service.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.02  Common expenses.

    The Uniform System of Accounts also requires that carriers assign to 
common expense accounts the remaining expenses, taxes and purchased 
services which are not solely related to either freight or passenger 
service. The following instructions govern the separation of common 
expense accounts between freight and passenger services.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.03  Made by accounting divisions.

    The separation shall be made by accounting divisions, where such 
divisions are maintained, and the aggregate of the accounting divisions 
reported for the quarter and for the year.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.04  Special tests.

    When the separation of common expense accounts between freight and 
passenger services is based upon special tests or service unit factors, 
such tests shall be made at sufficiently frequent intervals to represent 
actual operating conditions. The service unit factors used are those of 
the reporting period.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.05  Operating expense account number notation.

    (a) The operating expense account numbers consist of a six-digit 
coding structure divided into three two-digit groups. The first two-
digit group denotes natural expenses; the second group denotes 
activities/subactivities for freight, passenger or common service; and 
the third group signifies applicable function assignment.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03MR91.050

    (b) For reporting purposes, four natural expense categories are 
utilized. The categories are: salaries and wages (account 11-XX-XX); 
material, tools, supplies, fuels and lubricants (account 21-XX-XX); 
purchased services (accounts 31-XX-XX to 41-XX-XX, inclusive); and 
general (accounts 61-XX-XX to 65-XX-XX, inclusive, 51-XX-XX, 52-XX-XX, 
53-XX-XX and 12-XX-XX).
    (c) The symbol ``XX'' in the first two-digit group is used 
throughout the separation instructions to denote more than one natural 
expense associated with the same activity/subactivity-function account 
structure. For reporting purposes, the natural expense account numbers 
represented by ``XX'' include:

11--Salaries and wages;
21--Materials, tools, supplies, fuels, and lubricants;
30 or 41--Purchased services:
    30--Summation of certain purchased service accounts;
    41--Other purchased services;
61--General.

    (d) The ``30'' natural expense designation indicates a summation of 
specific purchased service accounts that are reported in total rather 
than individually. The specific accounts under the way and structures 
activity except for administration functions include 39-1X-XX, repairs 
billed by others, Dr.; 40-1X-XX, repairs billed to others, cr.; and 41-
1X-XX, other purchased services. For the equipment activity excluding 
administration functions, the ``30'' designation denotes the summation 
of 39-2X-XX and 41-2X-XX.
    (e) The ``41'' natural expense designation (other purchased 
services) is the

[[Page 251]]

purchased service category of the ``XX'' code for the following:
    (1) Way and structures activity administration--function accounts,
    (2) Equipment activity administration--function accounts,
    (3) Transportation activity expense accounts, and
    (4) General and administration activity expense accounts.
    (f) The ``61'' general natural expense designation is applicable to 
all accounts with the ``XX'' symbol except transportation, train and 
yards accounts (XX-(33/43/53)-XX).
    (g) The natural expense account number ``50'' is used throughout the 
separation instructions to indicate the summation of accounts 52-XX-XX, 
Other casualties, and 53-XX-XX, Insurance, that are reported as one 
item, ``Casualties and Insurance,'' (50-XX-XX).
    (h) The number ``98'' in the function account group (last two 
digits) is used in the separation rules to designate the summation of a 
natural expense consisting of more than one functional assignment that 
is reported as one item. This includes Repairs Billed to Others, Cr.--
Equipment (40-2X-XX). For example, the locomotive subactivity contains 
accounts 40-(21/24/26)-40, 40-(21/24/26)-41, and 40-(21/24/26)-48 which 
are treated as 40-(21/24/26)-98.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.06  Instructions for separation.

    (a) Certain instructions for separating common expense accounts 
(dependent accounts) between freight and passenger services base the 
allocation on the proportional freight/passenger separation of other 
common expense accounts (independent accounts). The dependent account is 
frequently identified by an ``XX'' symbol in the natural expense 
position (first two digits) with corresponding independent accounts also 
identified by the ``XX'' natural expense symbol. Unless otherwise 
stated, the applicable natural expense associated with ``XX'' symbol 
shall be the same for both the dependent and independent accounts.
    (b) To illustrate, Sec. 1242.10 provides instructions for separating 
common Way and Structures, Administration--Track accounts (dependent 
accounts) designated by XX-19-02. The separation is based on certain 
other common Way and Structures accounts including Roadway--Running, XX-
17-10, and Roadway--Switching, XX-18-10.
    (c) As Sec. 1242.05 states, the ``XX'' symbol denotes the following 
natural expenses for Way and Structures administration functions:

11--Salaries and wages,
21--Materials, tools, supplies, fuels, and lubricants,
41--Other purchased services, and
61--General.

These natural expenses shall be individually applied to the separation 
rules in Sec. 1242.10. In each case, the independent accounts providing 
the basis for freight/passenger separation of the dependent account 
shall have the same natural expense designation. For example, the basis 
of separating account 11-19-02, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, 
Administration--Track, would be based on certain independent accounts 
including 11-17/18-10, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, Running/
Switching, Repair and Maintenance, Roadway.

                 Operating Expenses--Way and Structures


<R05>
Sec. 1242.10  Administration--track (account XX-19-02).

    Source: 46 FR 26784, May 15, 1981, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.1  Definitions.

    (a) Railroad--an individual railroad or terminal company subject to 
the Interstate Commerce Act and every receiver, trustee, executor, 
administrator or assignee of any such railroad. If a railroad and its 
railroad subsidiaries report to the Commission on a consolidated basis, 
they would collectively be considered as a railroad.
    (b) A railroad subsidiary--a railroad owned or controlled by another 
railroad.
    (c) A waybill, which may be referred to by other names such as mine 
tickets, is the document or instrument prepared from the bill of lading 
contract or shipper's instructions as to the disposition of the freight, 
and used by the railroad(s) involved as the authority to move the 
shipment and as the basis for

[[Page 262]]

determining the freight charges and interline settlements.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.2  Applicability.

    (a) Effective July 1, 1981 and thereafter, unless otherwise ordered, 
each railroad as defined in Sec. 1244.1 above is required to file 
waybill sample information for all line-haul revenue waybills terminated 
on its lines if it terminates at least 4,500 revenue carloads in any of 
the three preceding years, or if it terminates at least 5% of the 
revenue carloads terminating in any state in any of the three preceding 
years. A railroad required to file waybill sample information under this 
section shall herein be referred to as subject railroad.
    (b) Waybill terminations shall include all line-haul revenue 
movements terminating for waybilling purposes on the subject railroad's 
line whether the lading is destined for the terminating station as 
denoted on the waybill or the shipment is being rebilled or forwarded to 
the ultimate destination by another railroad or another mode of 
transportation (e.g., lake cargo, inbound transit, or other rebilled 
movements).
    (c) Each subject railroad shall also file the required waybill 
sample information for all of its railroad subsidiaries.
    (d) Each subject railroad shall also file the required waybill 
sample information for any other railroad for which it performs revenue 
billing and/or interline settlements under special agreement.
    (e) The surviving corporate entity of railroads (subject to the 
Interstate Commerce Act) who have merged or reorganized shall be 
required to report waybill sample information if its predecessor 
railroad or any of its predecessor railroads were required to report 
under this section.
    (f) In order to determine the number of carloads terminated in each 
state, railroads not otherwise submitting waybill information must 
report annually the number of carloads terminated by state for the last 
calendar year. These reports shall be submitted by March 1 of the year 
following the report year.
    (g) Transition. This final rule will apply to all subject waybills 
which are in the subject railroad's audit month of July 1981 and all 
audit months thereafter. The former rule will continue to apply to all 
subject waybills for the prior audit months up to and including June 
1981.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.3  Sampling of waybills.

    (a) Subject railroads shall file waybill sample information in one 
of the following two ways. (1) Authenticated copies of a sample of 
audited revenue waybills--the manual system (Sec. 1244.3(b)). (2) A 
computer tape containing specified information from a sample of 
waybills--the computerized system (Sec. 1244.3(c)).
    (b) The Manual System. (1) The sample of subject waybills shall be 
as follows:
    (i) All waybills with less than 6 carloads per waybill whose serial 
numbers are 1 or end in 01,
    (ii) All waybills with 6 to 25 carloads per waybill whose serial 
numbers end in 1; and,
    (iii) All waybills with 26 or more carloads per waybill whose serial 
numbers end in 1 or 7.
    (2) The expected sampling rates for the manual system are as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Expected
                Numbers of carloads on waybill                   sample 
                                                                  rate  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 to 5........................................................    1/100 
6 to 25.......................................................     1/10 
26 and over...................................................      1/5 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Upon giving the subject roads 60 days notice, the Commission may 
require random serial number endings in lieu of the respective endings 
shown in Sec. 1244.3(b). These random serial number endings would have 
the expected sample rates shown in Sec. 1244.3(b)(2).
    (4) If the subject waybills have no waybill numbers or serial 
numbers, or have seriously flawed waybill or serial numbers, then the 
subject railroad should serialize those documents in blocks of 1,000 or 
blocks of multiples of 1,000 (e.g., 1, 2, . . . 1,000; 1, 2, . . .) and 
use these constructed serial numbers for selection purposes.
    (c) The Computerized System. (1) The tape shall be required to 
conform to the standards and format specified in

[[Page 263]]

Statement No. 81-1, Procedure for Sampling Waybill Records by Computer, 
issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which may be revised from 
time to time.
    (2) The sampling rates for the computerized system are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  Sample
                  Number of carloads on waybill                    rate 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 to 2..........................................................    1/40
3 to 15.........................................................    1/12
16 to 60........................................................     1/4
61 to 100.......................................................     1/3
101 and over....................................................     1/2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Controls and Annual Counts. (1) Each subject railroad shall 
maintain a control procedure to ensure complete and accurate reporting 
for the waybill sampling. All pertinent waybill data shall be included 
on hard copy waybill submissions including inbound references for 
transit waybills. All such pertinent waybill data shall be legible.
    (2) All subject railroads shall maintain a record of the number of 
line-haul revenue carloads that terminated on their line in a calendar 
year and shall furnish this number when requested by the Commission.
    (3) All subject railroads using the manual system of reporting shall 
furnish the Commission, in accordance with instructions on the 
Transmittal Form OPAD-2, the total counts of line-haul revenue waybills 
terminated in each reporting period for the following three categories:
    (i) Waybills, with less than six carloads per waybill,
    (ii) Waybills with 6 to 25 carloads per waybill, and
    (iii) Waybills with 26 or more carloads per waybill.
    (4) All subject railroads on the computerized system of reporting 
shall furnish the Commission the control counts and tape specification 
information as required by the Statement No. 81-1.
    (5) Certification by a responsible officer of the subject railroad 
as to the completeness and accuracy of sample shall be made once a year 
in accordance with the instructions on the Transmittal Forms OPAD-1 or 
OPAD-2.

[46 FR 26784, May 15, 1981, as amended at 46 FR 45141, Sept. 10, 1981]


<R05>
Sec. 1244.4  Date of filing.

    (a) The reporting period for which subject railroads submit waybill 
sample information shall be the audit (accounting) month except as 
specified below:
    (1) Subject railroads using the computerized system may submit 
waybill sample information quarterly as specified in Statement 81-1.
    (2) Subject railroad using the manual system may submit waybill 
sample information quarterly if it submits fewer than 1,000 waybills per 
year.
    (b) Waybill sample information shall be forwarded no later than 60 
days from the end of the reporting period to the Commission.
    (c) When the submitted waybill sample information is returned to the 
submitting railroad for correction, that railroad shall resubmit 
corrected data to the Commission promptly but no later than 60 days 
after its receipt.
    (d) Transmittal Forms. (1) Subject railroads using the manual system 
of reporting shall complete the Transmittal Form OPAD-2, to accompany 
each waybill sample submission.
    (2) Subject railroads using the computerized system of reporting 
shall complete the Transmittal Form OPAD-1, to accompany each waybill 
tape submission.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.5  Retention of files.

    (a) Subject railroads which submit waybill sample data by the 
computerized system instead of the manual system shall retain the 
underlying hard copy waybills or facsimilies capable of producing 
legible copies, which shall be complete including inbound references for 
transit waybills, for a minimum period of four years.
    (b) This file of retained waybills shall be maintained in such a 
manner that the railroads on the computerized system may readily 
retrieve waybill copies using the waybill identifier code as shown on 
the submitted computerized waybill record.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.6  Special studies.

    (a) Although routine submission of hard copy waybills is eliminated 
when a railroad reports under the computerized system, the Commission 
may

[[Page 264]]

order that railroad to submit hard copies of the underlying waybills for 
special studies.
    (b) The Commission may order the subject railroads to supply 
additional data for submitted waybill copies or records for special 
studies.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.7  Analysis of waybill data.

    Users of the waybill sample when presenting waybill analysis before 
the Commission shall ensure that the appropriate weighting factors are 
applied to account for the stratified sampling. See Statement 81-1 for 
guidelines for weighting waybill data and for computing sampling errors.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.8  Procedures for the release of waybill data.

    (a) General. The procedures for the release of waybill data identify 
five classes of users of the ICC Waybill Sample, define the waybill 
information or data that each class of users may obtain, and set forth 
the applicable requirements for the data's release. They also formalize 
notice and protest procedures for the possible release of waybill data 
to other users to protect against the inappropriate release of 
confidential data. The Director of the Office of Transportation Analysis 
shall be responsible for releasing waybill data in accordance with these 
procedures.
    (b) Class of user, available data, and applicable release 
requirements. (1) Railroads. Each requesting railroad may obtain any 
waybill record from the ICC Waybill Sample covering traffic that 
originated, terminated, or was bridged by that railroad. The railroad 
shall not have access to waybill data pertaining to traffic in which it 
did not participate. Also, it must meet all ICC and legal requirements 
concerning release of shipper information in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
11910(a).
    (2) Federal agencies. Each requesting Federal agency (including 
quasi-governmental agencies) may obtain any waybill record from the ICC 
Waybill Sample subject to the following requirements:
    (i) The Federal agency shall make the information contained in the 
ICC Waybill Sample available only to its employees or those contractors 
working on the particular project or study requiring the waybill data.
    (ii) The Federal agency will ensure that railroads and shippers are 
afforded the same privilege and protection against disclosure of the 
waybill data as the Commission provides.
    (iii) The Federal agency will not release any data to the public 
unless the data elements are aggregated to contain at least three 
shippers and to prevent identification of an individual railroad.
    (iv) The Federal agency will refer any requests for waybill data and 
accompanying documentation to the ICC for processing and will so inform 
the requesting party of such referral to the Commission.
    (v) The Federal agency must sign an agreement annually with the 
Commission agreeing to these restrictions.
    (3) States. Each requesting State may obtain any waybill record 
pertaining to traffic that was originated, terminated, interchanged in, 
or that passed through its State subject to the same requirements 
imposed on federal agencies under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of 
this section.
    (4) Transportation practitioners, consulting firms, and law firms--
specific proceedings. Transportation practitioners, consulting firms and 
law firms may use data from the ICC Waybill Sample in preparing verified 
statements to be submitted in formal proceedings before the ICC and/or 
State Commissions (Commission) subject to the following requirements:
    (i) The ICC Waybill Sample is the only single source of the data or 
obtaining the data from other sources is burdensome or costly, and the 
data is relevant to issues pendng before the Commission.
    (ii) The requestor submits to the ICC a written waybill request that 
complies with Sec. 1244.8(e).
    (iii) All waybill data must be returned to the ICC, and the firm 
must not keep any copies.
    (iv) A transportation practitioner, consulting firm, or law firm 
must submit any evidence drawn from the ICC Waybill Sample to the 
Commission only unless the evidence is aggregated to the level of at 
least three shippers and will prevent the identification of

[[Page 265]]

an individual railroad. Nonaggregated evidence submitted to the 
Commission will be made part of the public record only if the Commission 
finds that it does not reveal competitively sensitive data. However, 
evidence found to be sensitive may be provided to counsel or other 
independent representatives for other parties subject to the usual and 
customary protective order issued by the Commission or appropriate 
authorized official.
    (v) For each Commission proceeding, a firm must sign a 
confidentiality agreement with the ICC agreeing to the above 
restrictions before any data will be released. This agreement will 
permit use of the released data for a period of one year from the date 
the agreement is signed by the user. If the data is required for an 
additional period of time because a proceeding is still pending before 
the Commission, the firm must sign a new confidentiality agreement 
covering the data needed for each additional year the proceeding is 
opened.
    (5) Public use. Nonconfidential waybill data may be obtained from 
the ``Public Use Waybill File''. Reports produced from the Public Use 
Waybill File may be used, published, or released. The Public Use Waybill 
File contains the following nonconfidential items:
    (i)  Waybill Date (Month, Day, Year).
    (ii)  Accounting Period (Month, Year).
    (iii)  Number of Carloads.
    (iv)  Car Ownership (Rail or Private).
    (v)  AAR Car Type.
    (vi)  AAR Mechanical Designation.

railroads and shippers will receive notice by Federal Register 
Publication. If railroad specific or shipper specific data are 
requested, those parties will be given written notice of the request.

[[Page 266]]

    (2) Form of notice. The notice shall identify the parties requesting 
the data; describe the type of waybill data requested; and state the 
purpose for which the data is requested. The notice shall include a 
statement that parties seeking information concerning the filing of 
objections should refer to Ex Parte No. 385 (Sub-No. 2), 49 CFR 1224.8, 
or contact the Interstate Commerce Commission's Office of Transportation 
Analysis.
    (3) Objections to release. (i) Objections to release of the 
confidential waybill data must be filed by the railroad and/or shipper 
no later than 14 calendar days from publication of the notice in the 
Federal Register.
    (ii) An original and 3 copies of each objection shall be filed with 
the Director, Office of Transportation Analysis, Interstate Commerce 
Commission, Washington, DC 20423.
    (iii) The objection shall identify the parties seeking the 
confidential waybill data, reiterate the purpose for which the data is 
sought, and state all grounds for objection to full or partial 
disclosure of the requested data.
    (4) Commission determination. (i) The Director of the Office of 
Transportation Analysis will consider all objections in determining 
whether to release the requested waybill data. Each railroad or shipper 
who filed objections will be sent written notice of the Director's 
decision not less than 14 calendar days prior to the disclosure date.
    (ii) The Commission reserves the right to deny the release of 
waybill data although no objections may be filed.
    (iii) Appeals must be filed with the Chairman within 10 days of the 
date of the Director's decision. Responses to appeals must be filed 
within 10 days thereafter (49 CFR 1011.7(b)(1)). The filing of an appeal 
will automatically stay the effect of the Director's decision.
    (e) Content of waybill requests. (1) All requestors under paragraphs 
(b)(4) and (c) of this section shall include the following information:
    (i) A complete and detailed explanation of the purpose for which the 
requested data are needed.
    (ii) A description of the specific waybill data or fields actually 
required (including pertinent geographic areas).
    (iii) A detailed justification as to why the specified waybill data 
are needed.
    (2) An original and 2 copies of the waybill request shall be filed

Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423.
    (f) Aggregation of confidential shipper data.
    (1) Any shipper data obtained from the Waybill Sample shall not be 
publicly released unless the data are aggregated to include at least 
three shippers.
    (2) To aggregate the waybill data to the level of three shippers, 
the three-FSAC Rule shall be used. Under this rule, there must be at 
least three different freight stations as identified by the Freight 
Station Accounting Code (FSAC) on one railroad or there must be at least 
two more FSAC's than there are railroads present in the waybill data 
being aggregated.
    (3) The three-FSAC Rule shall apply to every number and calculation 
publicly released.
    (4) The Director of OTA will consider requests to apply an 
alternative aggregation method provided the requestor establishes that a 
particular project necessitates an alternative approach and that 
approach effectively protects the identity of individual shippers.
    (g) Complaint procedures. (1) Complaints for alleged breaches of 
confidentiality or misuse of confidential waybill data must include the 
following:
    (i) Identification of all known parties involved in the alleged 
violation.
    (ii) The approximate date(s) of the alleged violations.
    (iii) A full and detailed description of the alleged violation.
    (iv) A description of any resulting harm to the complainant.
    (2) Prior to filing a complaint, a complainant, upon written 
request, may obtain a copy of the incoming waybill request and the 
applicable confidentiality agreement. This request must identify the 
party involved, give the

[[Page 267]]

approximate date the data was released, briefly describe the alleged 
violation, and substantiate the need for this information for purposes 
of filing a complaint.
    (3) An original and three (3) copies of the complaint shall be filed 
with the Director, Office of Transportation Analysis, Interstate 
Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. A copy of the complaint shall 
also be served on the alleged violator(s).
    (4) An answer must be filed within 20 days after service of the 
complaint.
    (5) All parties will be notified in writing of the Director's 
decision. If the Director determines that a violation has occurred, the 
offending parties will be denied access to the waybill sample for a 
period of time commensurate with the nature of the violation.
    (6) Appeals to the Director's determination shall be filed in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section.
    (h) Munitions shipments. All waybill requests for munition data at 
the 3-digit Standard Transportation Commodity Code (STCC) level or 
greater will be forwarded by the ICC to the Department of Defense's 
Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC). The ICC will not release 
this type of information without MTMC's consent.

<R05>
Sec. 1245.1  Rules governing classification of employees, service, and compensation.

    The rules governing the classification of railroad employees and 
reports of their service and compensation outlined in Sec. Sec. 1245.3 
and 1245.4 are required, and all Class I railroads within the scope of 
Section 11145 of the Interstate Commerce Act shall be governed by such 
rules in the preparation and submission of their annual and other 
periodic reports to the Interstate Commerce Commission in accordance 
with the forms adopted for such returns (Sec. 1245.2); and also with 
respect to any other matters covered by these rules.

[47 FR 53867, Nov. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1245.2  Reports of railroad employees, service and compensation.

    Beginning with the reporting period commencing January 1, 1983, and 
quarterly thereafter until further ordered, each Class I railroad is 
required to file a Quarterly Report of Railroad Employees, Service, and 
Compensation, (Form QRSC). In addition, such carriers shall also file an 
Annual Report of Railroad Employees, Service, and Compensation, (Form 
ARSC) for each calendar year. Both reports shall be filed with the 
Bureau of Accounts, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 
20423. The quarterly report shall be filed within thirty days after the 
end of each calendar quarter. The annual report shall be filed within 
forty five days after the end of the reporting year.

[47 FR 53867, Nov. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1245.3   Employees; definition, service hours, and compensation.

    (a) Definition of ``employees''. The word employees, as used in this 
part, is intended to include every person in the service of the 
reporting carrier subject to its continuing authority to supervise and 
direct the manner of rendition of his service. Persons engaged to render 
only specifically defined service and not subject to the continuing 
authority of the carrier to supervise and control their acts, such as 
customhouse brokers, lawyers retained only

[[Page 268]]

for specific cases and not under general or continuing retainer, etc., 
are not employees in the meaning of the term used in this part.
    (b) Counting employees. Since the number of employees fluctuates, 
carriers are required to classify and count all of their employees at 
twelve different times each year.
    (c) Joint employees. Each person jointly employed shall, if carried 
on the payrolls of the several joint employers, be counted by each 
employer and represented in its return of number of employees by a 
fraction based on the number of employers reporting him; if a person, 
for example, is reportable by three employers, each should include him 
in its number of employees as one-third of an employee. When the entire 
compensation of a joint employee is shown on the payroll of a single 
joint employer and is paid to the employee by that employer such 
employee should, for the purpose of returns, be treated as if employed 
solely by such employer.
    (d) Service hours. (1) The number of hours on duty, or held for 
duty, and the number of hours paid for are to be ascertained and 
recorded for every class of employee. For enginemen and trainmen, the 
actual number of miles run and miles paid for but not run are to be 
recorded, as well as the number of hours on duty and the number of hours 
paid for. (The service time of all classes of employees shall be 
recorded in hours instead of days or hours as heretofore.)
    (2) Whenever an employee works at more than one occupation, or in 
more than one class of service, both the number of hours worked and the 
compensation paid, should be separated and reported under the proper 
Reporting Divisions.
    (3) If an employee is paid a day's wage for a smaller number of 
hours than constitutes a day's work, the number of hours paid for as 
well as the actual number of hours the employee is on duty should be 
ascertained and recorded. Time allowed for meals, part holidays, 
holidays, absences on leave, vacations, etc., should be excluded from 
time actually worked, but if such time is paid for it should be 
appropriately reported as ``Time paid for but not worked'' on Form A or 
as a ``constructive allowance'' on Form B. These requirements apply to 
enginemen and trainmen paid on the basis of trips or of miles run, and 
to employees paid at piece rates, as well as to employees paid on 
hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other time basis. Service hours for 
officers and employees who do not receive payment for overtime should be 
reported as the number of hours in each month at 8 hours per day 
contemplated for the position.
    (e) Compensation. The compensation of employees as defined in the 
rules in this part is to be stated in such manner and detail as the 
forms adopted for periodical returns require.


<R05>
Sec. 1245.4  Forms required to be used.

    (a) The report of information to the Interstate Commerce Commission 
on railroad employees, service and compensation includes two forms. Form 
A relates to employees other than train and engine service employees. 
Form B relates to train and engine service employees.
    (b) With general reference to the statement of the compensation of 
employees in Forms A and B, it should be understood that the total 
compensation received by the employees in each Reporting Division, as 
well as the amount of work they perform, should be shown properly 
distributed under the prescribed column heads as indicated by the forms. 
It should be noted that if the work of an employee varies during a 
report period, his time and compensation should be apportioned 
accordingly. Amounts reported should be gross compensation paid.

    Illustrations. (a) In the course of a month, an employee works as a 
Machinist, and as such earns $200 and he works also as a Gang Foreman 
and earns $130. The pay received by him in the occupation of Machinist 
with corresponding time should be included in returns for Division 61, 
``Machinists'', and his other pay and time as indicated should be 
included in returns for Division 53, ``Gang Foremen and Gang Leaders''. 
(b) When an employee works at two or more of the occupations of 
engineer, fireman, conductor, and brakeman, his time and compensation 
should be assigned in accordance with the facts. For example, in a 
certain month an employee earns as a Through Freight Engineer $110, as a 
Local or Way Freight Engineer $140, as a Yard Engineer $100, and as a 
Local or Way

[[Page 269]]

Freight Fireman $75. The time and the compensation of this employee 
should be correspondingly distributed among Reporting Divisions 122, 
123, 124, and 127 as they are respectively applicable, without regard to 
the predominance of the time worked or the amount earned by him in one 
occupation.

    (c) As elsewhere indicated, the statement of the number of employees 
in the service of a company with respect to Reporting Divisions depends 
upon the allocation of the individual employees as of the day of count.
    (d) The Reporting Divisions shown in Forms A and B following will 
also be used in connection with the employees' schedule in the annual 
reports of railroads of classes I and II to the Commission. Railroads of 
class III and lessor companies shall report only the information 
required in the annual report forms prescribed for such companies.

<R05>
Sec. 1249.2  Classification of carriers--motor carriers of property, household goods carriers, and dual property carriers.

    (a) Common and contract motor carriers of property subject to the 
Interstate Commerce Act are grouped into the following three classes:
    Class I. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues 
(including interstate and intrastate) of $10 million or more after 
applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A.
    Class II. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues 
(including interstate and intrastate) of at least $3 million but less 
than $10 million after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A.
    Class III. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues 
(including interstate and intrastate) of less than $3 million after 
applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A.
    (b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by 
annual carrier operating revenues (excluding revenues from private 
carriage, compensated intercorporate hauling, and leasing vehicles with 
drivers to private carriers) after applying the revenue deflator formula 
in Note A. Upward and downward classification will be effected as of 
January 1 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year 
of revenue qualification.
    (2) Any carrier which begins new operations by obtaining operating 
authority not previously held or extends its existing authority by 
obtaining additional operating rights shall be classified in accordance 
with a reasonable estimate of its annual carrier operating revenues 
after applying the revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.
    (3) When a business combination occurs such as a merger, 
reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be 
reclassified effective as of January 1 of the next calendar year on the 
basis of the combined revenues for the year when the combination 
occurred after applying the revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.
    (4) Carriers shall notify the Commission of any change in 
classification and any change in annual operating revenues that causes 
them to exceed the class I limit by writing to the Office of Economics, 
Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. In unusual or 
extraordinary extenuating circumstances, where the classification 
process will unduly burden the carrier, such as partial liquidation, or 
curtailment or elimination of contracted services, the carrier may 
request from the Commission a waiver or an exception from these 
regulations. This request shall be in writing, specifying the conditions 
justifying the waiver or exception. The Commission shall notify the 
carriers of any change in classification.
    (5) Carriers not required to file an Annual Report (Form M-1 or Form 
M-2) may be required to file the Annual Carrier Classification Survey 
Form. All carriers will be notified of any classification changes.
    (c) For classification purposes, the Commission shall publish in the 
Federal Register annually an index number which shall be used to adjust 
gross annual operating revenues. This index number (deflator) shall be 
based on the Producers Price Index of Finished Goods. Its intended use 
is to eliminate the effects of inflation from the classification 
process. See Note A that follows:

    Note A: Each carrier's operating revenues will be deflated annually 
using the Producers Price Index (PPI) of Finished Goods before comparing 
those revenues with the dollar revenue limits prescribed in paragraph 
(a) of this section. The PPI is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. The formula to be applied is as follows:

<R05>
Sec. 1249.3  Classification of carriers--motor carriers of passengers.

    (a) Common and contract carriers of passengers subject to the 
Interstate Commerce Act are grouped into the following two classes:
    Class I--Carriers having average annual gross transportation 
operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of $5 million 
or more from passenger motor carrier operations after applying the 
revenue deflator formula as shown in the Note.
    Class II--Carriers having average annual gross transportation 
operating revenues (including interstate or intrastate) of less than $5 
million from passenger motor carrier operations after applying the 
revenue deflator formula as shown in the Note.
    (b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by 
annual carrier operating revenues after applying the revenue deflator 
formula as shown in the Note. Upward and downward reclassification will 
be effected as of January 1 of the year immediately following the third 
consecutive year of revenue qualification.
    (2) Any carrier which begins new operations (obtains operating 
authority not previously held) or extends its existing authority 
(obtains additional operating rights) shall be classified in accordance 
with a reasonable estimate of its annual carrier operating revenues 
after applying the revenue deflator formula shown in the Note.
    (3) When a business combination occurs, such as a merger, 
reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be 
reclassified effective as of January 1 of the next calendar year on the 
basis of the combined revenues for the year when the combination 
occurred after applying the revenue deflator formula shown in the Note.
    (4) Carriers shall notify the Commission of any change in 
classification or when their annual operating revenues exceed the Class 
I limit by writing to the Bureau of Accounts, Interstate Commerce 
Commission, Washington, DC 20423. In unusual circumstances where the 
classification regulations and reporting requirements will unduly burden 
the carrier, the carrier may request from the Commission a waiver from 
these regulations. This request shall be in writing specifying the 
conditions justifying the waiver. The Commission then shall notify 
carriers of any change in classification or reporting requirements.
    (c) For classification purposes, the Commission shall publish in the 
Federal Register annually an index number which shall be used for 
adjusting gross annual operating revenues. The index number (deflator) 
is based on the Producer Price Index of Finished Goods and is used to 
eliminate the effects of inflation from the classification process.

    Note: Each carrier's operating revenues will be deflated annually 
using the Producers Price Index (PPI) of Finished Goods before comparing 
them with the dollar revenue limits prescribed in paragraph (a) of this 
section. The PPI is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

or his/her alternate is not available to receive such documents, they 
shall be turned over to the Associate Director, Office of Compliance and 
Consumer Assistance, and secured, unopened, in the combination safe 
located in Room 5325 of the headquarters building until the Emergency 
Coordinator or alternate is available. All material not immediately 
deliverable to either the Emergency Coordinator, alternate, or the

stored with the original documents.
    (b) Any suspected or actual unauthorized disclosures of classified 
information shall be reported to the Emergency Coordinator or Alternate. 
An immediate investigation will be undertaken by the Emergency 
Coordinator or Alternate to establish all facts surrounding the 
disclosure. The Emergency Coordinator or Alternate shall ascertain the 
nature of the information disclosed and the extent to which it has been 
disseminated and will maintain records of disclosures as evaluated and 
investigated.
    (c) Any suspected or actual unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information will be reported as soon as possible to the Department of 
Justice and the Information Security Oversight Office.
    (d) Any unauthorized disclosure of classified information or any

Sec. 1280.6  Storage of classified documents.

    All classified documents shall be stored in the safe located in Room

1300.1  Scope; definitions.
1300.2  Disclosure requirement for existing rates.
1300.3  Response to request for establishment of a new rate.
1300.4  Notice requirement.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 721(a) and 11101(f).

    Source: 61 FR 35140, July 5, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.1  Scope; definitions.

    (a) The provisions of this part address the requirements imposed on 
rail carriers by 49 U.S.C. 11101(b), 11101(c), 11101(d) and 11101(f).
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of 
this part apply to any common carriage transportation or service 
provided by a rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface 
Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 10501.
    (c) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation 
or service provided by a rail carrier under a contract authorized under 
49 U.S.C. 10709 or former 49 U.S.C. 10713 (repealed effective January 1, 
1996).
    (d) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation 
or service provided by a rail carrier to the extent that such 
transportation or service is exempted from rate notice and disclosure 
requirements pursuant to an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502 or 
former 49 U.S.C. 10505 (repealed effective January 1, 1996).
    (e) For the purposes of this part, ``service terms'' means all 
classifications, rules, and practices that affect the rates, charges, or 
level of service for rail transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.2   Disclosure requirement for existing rates.

    (a) A rail carrier must disclose to any person, upon formal request, 
the specific rate(s) requested (or the basis for calculating the 
specific rate(s)), as well as all charges and service terms that may be 
applicable to transportation covered by the rate(s). For purposes of 
Sec. 1300.4(a)(1) of this part, a formal request under this part is one 
that clearly notifies the railroad that the requester seeks not only 
immediate information but also notification of any future increases in 
the rate(s) involved or changes in pertinent service terms.
    (b) The information provided by a rail carrier under this section 
must be provided immediately. (It is expected that the response will be 
sent within hours, or at least by the next business day, in most 
situations.) Such information may be provided either in written or 
electronic form as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot 
agree, such information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) 
form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it 
is to be provided in writing.
    (c) A rail carrier may, at its option, require that all requests 
submitted under this section be in written or electronic form, although 
the carrier may permit oral requests.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.3  Response to request for establishment of a new rate.

    Where a shipper or a prospective shipper or person acting on behalf 
of a shipper or a prospective shipper requests that the carrier 
establish a rate in the absence of an existing rate for particular 
transportation, the carrier must promptly establish and provide to the 
requester a rate and applicable service terms. The information may be 
provided either in written or electronic form, as agreed to by the 
parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided 
in electronic (non-passive) form where both parties have the requisite 
capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing. The response

[[Page 294]]

should be provided as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 
business days from receipt of the request. If a carrier determines that 
additional information is required from the requester before a rate or 
term can be established, the carrier must so notify the requester as 
soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days after receipt of 
the request. Once the additional information is received, the carrier 
must set the rate and related service terms, and relay them to the 
requester, as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business 
days from the receipt of the additional information. (However, the 
parties may agree to a different time period, in which case these time 
periods would not apply.) A rail carrier may, at its option, require 
that requests submitted under this section be in written or electronic 
form, although the carrier may permit oral requests.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.4  Notice requirement.

    (a) A rail carrier may not increase any rates or charges, or change 
any service terms (except for changes that are equivalent to rate 
reductions), unless 20 days have expired after written or electronic 
notice has been provided to all persons who, within the previous 12 
months:
    (1) Have formally requested under Sec. Sec. 1300.2 or 1300.3 of this 
part the affected rates or service terms; or
    (2) Have made arrangements with the carrier for a future shipment 
that would be subject to the increased rates or changed service terms.
    (b) The notice required by this section may be in written or 
electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot 
agree, the information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) 
form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it 
is to be provided in writing.
    (c) For purposes of this section, a mailed notice is deemed 
``provided'' on the date such notice is postmarked.
    (d) The notice required by this section must clearly identify the 
increases in rates or charges or the changes in service terms.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.5  Additional publication requirement for agricultural products and fertilizer.

    (a) With respect to transportation of agricultural products 
(including grain, as defined in 7 U.S.C. 75, and all products thereof) 
and fertilizer, a rail carrier shall publish, make available, and retain 
for public inspection its currently effective rates, schedules of rates, 
charges, and other service terms, and any scheduled changes to such 
rates, charges, and service terms. This requirement is in addition to 
the requirements imposed by Sec. Sec. 1300.2, 1300.3, and 1300.4 of this 
part.
    (b) The information published under this section must include an 
accurate description of the services offered to the public; must provide 
the specific applicable rates (or the basis for calculating the specific 
applicable rates), charges, and service terms; and must be arranged in a 
way that allows for the determination of the exact rate, charges, and 
service terms applicable to any given shipment (or to any given group of 
shipments). Increases, reductions and other changes must be symbolized 
or highlighted in some way to facilitate ready identification of the 
changes, the nature of those changes and their effective dates.
    (c) A rail carrier must make the information available at offices 
where it normally keeps rate information. Access to the information at 
such offices must be provided to any person, without charge, during 
normal business hours.
    (d) A rail carrier must also make the required publications 
available to all persons (hereinafter referred to as subscribers) who 
have subscribed to a publication service operated either by the rail 
carrier itself or by an agent acting at the rail carrier's direction. 
Such publications may be made available either in printed or in 
electronic form as agreed to by the parties. Any scheduled changes must 
be published in a manner that provides timely notice to subscribers. A 
rail carrier may impose reasonable charges for such publications. 
Publications may be limited to the specific information requested by the 
subscriber, and charges for such limited publications should be set 
accordingly.

material.
    (f) Carrier liability. The tender of a tariff and its receipt by the 
Commission does not relieve the carriers of liability for violations of 
the Act, other laws or the Commission's regulations.

    (5) The reasons and justification for the proposal shall be stated.
    (6) If relief is requested from notice requirements, the reasons why 
that notice cannot or should not be given shall be stated.
    (7) Applications requesting authority to change, cancel or postpone 
matter which is the subject of a protest or petition for investigation

the protestants have registered objections to the proposal. See 
Sec. 1312.40(e).
    (g) Telegraphic request. When, because of an emergency, special 
tariff authority is requested by telegram, the telegram shall state the

than the next working day.
    (h) Appeals to special tariff authority decisions may be filed. See 
49 CFR 1118.4.
    (i) Authority to reject publication. The granting and use of special 
tariff authority does not limit the Commission's jurisdiction over the

<R05>
Sec. 1312.3  Size of paper and where to send tariff publication and other documents.

    Except as authorized in Sec. 1312.30(c) (Distance Guides), tariff 
publications and other documents shall be prepared on durable paper, 
measuring not more than 8\1/2\ x 11 inches, and shall be sent to:

Interstate Commerce Commission, Bureau of Traffic--Section of Tariffs,

Packages containing tariff publications shall be prominently marked 
``Tariffs.'' Packages containing applications for special tariff 
authority to depart from these rules shall be prominently marked

<R05>
Sec. 1312.4  Filing tariffs.

    (a) Number of copies and fees for filing. Carriers and agents shall 
send 2 copies of each tariff publication for official filing, unless the 
Commission requests more. When a tariff publication is published in more 
than one agent's name, only two copies of the publication are required. 
An agent's or carrier's tariff publication containing joint rates or 
provisions constitutes a sufficient filing for each of the participating 
carriers. It is not required that 2 copies be filed in the name of each 
agent. Fees shall be paid in accordance with part 1002.
    (b) Letters of transmittal. (1) A letter of transmittal shall be 
sent in the same package with the tarriff publication(s).
    (2)(i) A letter of transmittal shall be signed by the person issuing 
the tariff or an athorized representative. Authorizations shall not be 
filed with the Commission unless specifically requested or the existence 
of such authorization is questioned in a challenge to the tariff. Absent 
challenge, the Commission will assume agents have the necessary 
authority from their principals.
    (ii) A letter of transmittal shall clearly indicate in the upper 
left-hand corner thereof:
    (A) The assigned alpha code of the carrier or agent issuing the 
tariff publication(s);
    (B) The number of series transmitted;
    (C) The filing fee enclosed, the account number to be billed, or the 
credit card to be charged; and
    (D) The tariff transmittal number, if the filer utilizes transmittal 
numbers.

If the filing fee is charged to a credit card, the information must 
include the credit card number and expiration date, and an authorized 
signature.
    (3) If one transmittal letter is used to cover more than one package 
of tariff publications, the letter shall state the number of packages. 
The original letter shall be sent in one package and a copy of the 
letter sent with each of the other packages.
    (4) If a receipt is desired, mark the letter ``Receipt Requested'' 
and send an extra copy of the letter with a postage paid, self-addressed 
return envelope. Do not enclose loose stamps.
    (5) Letters of transmittal must contain the certification required 
by Sec. 1312.6.
    (6) When a tariff publication containing rates on household goods as 
defined in Sec. 1056.1(b)(1) of this title is published

[[Page 301]]

for the account of household goods carriers as defined in Sec. 1056.1(b) 
or for motor carriers of property to effect a general increase or 
decrease under the Ex Parte No. MC-82 procedures, on not less than 45 
days' notice, the letter shall so indicate.
    (7)(i) The letter of transmittal accompanying each tariff 
publication which contains a rate, charge, or provision which the 
carrier wishes to have filed pursuant to zone of rate freedom provisions 
of 49 U.S.C. 10708(d)(1) applicable to motor common carriers of property 
and household goods freight forwarders, shall indicate this by including 
an appropriate statement.
    (ii) If the application of the proposed rate, charge, or provision 
would result in an increase in charges, the letter must state that the 
proposed increase in the aggregate is not above the rate in effect 1-
year prior to the effective date of the proposed increase by more than 
the proper percentage in paragraph (b)(7)(vi) of this section.
    (iii) If the application of the proposed rate, charge, or provision 
would result in a reduction in charges, the letter must state that the 
proposed reduction in the aggregate is not below the lesser of the rate 
in effect on July 1, 1980 (or the date, if after July 1, 1980, on which 
a rate, charge, or provision first became effective for a service not 
provided by the household goods freight forwarder, or the carrier, on 
July 1, 1980), or the rate in effect 1-year prior to the effective date 
of the proposed reduction, by more than the proper percentage in 
paragraph (b)(7)(vi) of this section.
    (iv) The carrier or household goods freight forwarder will also be 
required in the letter to certify that the rates or provisions do not 
exceed the amount allowed by section 10708(d)(3) (A or B), and the rates 
or provisions fall within the appropriate zone; also, if the rate is 
above the rate in effect one year earlier by more than the proper 
percentage in paragraph (b)(7)(vi) of this section, the carrier or 
household goods freight forwarder must include in the statement whether 
the proposed rate has been subject to general rate increases during the 
previous year, what percent increase was taken, the bureaus which 
published the increase, and the effective date.
    (v) The letter need not identify the number of the item (or page) 
and tariff in which the rate, charge, or provision may be found that was 
in effect one year prior to the date of the proposed rate, or on July 1, 
1980, or later, as appropriate. However, if the rate is protested, the 
household goods forwarder or carrier, in its reply to the protest, must 
make such identification.
    (vi) At the end of each one-year period after October 23, 1986, the 
zone of rate freedom percentage will be automatically increased by 5 
percentage points, in the absence of Commission action to the contrary. 
The following table sets for the effective date of each zone expansion 
for the 10 years following adoption of these rules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           Date                              Percentage 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oct. 23, 1986............................................        20     
Oct. 23, 1987............................................        25     
Oct. 23, 1988............................................        30     
Oct. 23, 1989............................................        35     
Oct. 23, 1990............................................        40     
Oct. 23, 1991............................................        45     
Oct. 23, 1992............................................        50     
Oct. 23, 1993............................................        55     
Oct. 23, 1994............................................        60     
Oct. 23, 1995............................................        65     
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At all times the zone of rate freedom percentage (relating to the 
upper limit of the zone) will be increased or decreased, as the case may 
be, by the percentage change in the Producers Price Index (as published 
by the Department of Labor) that has occurred during the one-year period 
prior to the effective date of the proposed rate.
    (8) The letter of transmittal accompanying each tariff publication 
which contains a fare, rate, charge, or provision which the carrier 
wishes to have considered pursuant to the zone of rate freedom 
provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10708(d)(4) applicable to motor common carriers 
of passengers shall indicate this by including an appropriate statement.
    (i) If application of the proposed fare, rate, charge, or provision 
would result in an increase in charges, the letter shall state that the 
proposed increase in the aggregate is not more than 10 percent above 
that in effect one year prior to the effective date of the proposed 
increase. On November 19, 1983,

[[Page 302]]

the figure increased to 15 percent. On November 19, 1984, the figure 
increased to 20 percent. When only some increases are within the zone, 
they should be designated individually.
    (ii) If the application of the proposed fare, rate, charge, or 
provision would result in a reduction in charges, the letter shall state 
that the proposed reduction in the aggregate shall be no more than 20 
percent below the lesser of that in effect on November 19, 1982 (or, in 
the case of any charges which the carrier or carriers first establish 
after such date for a service not provided by the carrier or carriers on 
such date, such charge on the date such charge first becomes effective) 
or the charge in effect one year prior to the effective date. On 
November 19, 1983, the figure changed to 25 percent; and, on November 
19, 1984, the figure changes to 30 percent. When only some decreases are 
within the zone, they should be designated individually.
    (iii) After November 19, 1985, the Commission may not investigate, 
suspend, revise, or revoke any rate proposed by a motor common carrier 
of passengers on the grounds that such rate is unreasonable on the basis 
that it is too high or too low, unless the proposed rate is established 
collectively in accordance with the procedures of an agreement approved 
by the Commission under 49 U.S.C. 10706(b). After November 19, 1985, 
statements required in the immediate preceding two paragraphs above 
shall no longer be required. In publishing and filing a tariff under 49 
U.S.C. 10762, the carrier shall disclose whether such rate is the result 
of collective ratemaking procedures pursuant to an agreement approved by 
the Commission under 49 U.S.C. 10706(b).
    (iv) If a fare, rate, charge, or provision filed under the zone of 
rate freedom provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10708(d)(4) is protested, the 
carrier shall, in its reply to the protest, identify the number of the 
item (or page) and tariff in which the fare, rate, charge, or provision 
may be found that was in effect one year prior to the effective date of 
the proposed rate, or on November 19, 1982, or both, as appropriate.
    (c) Tariff publications not consecutively numbered or lettered. A 
tariff publication submitted for filing, which is not in sequence, shall 
be accompanied by an explanation.
    (d) Concurrences and powers of attorney. Concurrences and powers of 
attorney shall not be filed with the Commission. However, a carrier may 
not participate in a tariff issued in the name of another carrier or an 
agent unless a power of attorney or concurrence has been executed. 
Absent effective concurrences or powers of attorney, tariffs are void as 
a matter of law. Should a challenge to a tariff be made on this basis, 
carriers will be required to submit the necessary proof. See also 
Sec. 1312.10.
    (e) Period of notice required. (1) As a general rule, tariff 
publications shall be filed on statutory notice; i.e.:
    (i) For railroad tariffs:
    (A) 20 days for rates or provisions published in connection with new 
service or changes resulting in increased rates or decreased value of 
service;
    (B) 10 days for changes resulting in decreased rates or charges or 
changes resulting in neither increases nor reductions;
    (C) For contracts and contract summaries filed pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 
10713 see Sec. 1312.41; and,
    (D) 45 days for publications naming surcharges or cancelling joint 
rates under 49 U.S.C. 10705a;
    (E) For independently set rates of rail carriers the general rule is 
1-day's notice for reductions and new rates. See Sec. 1312.39(h) for 
details.
    (ii) For all other carriers:
    (A) 30 days' notice is required.
    (B) For independently set rates of motor common carriers and 
household goods freight forwarders the rule generally is 1 day's notice 
for reductions and 7 workdays' for increases see Sec. 1312.39(f) for 
details.
    (C) For independently set rates of motor carriers of passengers, 
including regular route passenger, package express and special and 
charter operations, the rule generally is 1-day's notice for reductions 
and increases of passenger rates. See Sec. 1312.39(i) for details.

However, numerous exceptions authorizing shorter notice are contained in 
these rules, and special permission for shorter notice may also be 
requested.

[[Page 303]]

    (2) Notice means the number of days a publication shall be on file 
with the Commission prior to its effective date. The date the 
publication is received by the Commission is the 1st day of notice.
    (f) Return of tariffs by the Commission. The Commission will not 
return a tariff publication unless it is formally rejected (see 
paragraph (g) of this section) or under the following circumstances:
    (1) The package containing the tariff publication arrives with 
postage or other delivery charges due; or
    (2) The tariff publication which the Commission receives is missing 
an essential part; or
    (3) A carrier or agent requests returns before the effective date 
and subscribers are promptly notified.
    (g) Rejection of tariff publication. A tariff publication submitted 
for filing may be rejected by the Commission if the publication--
    (1) Fails to give lawful notice of changes in rates or provisions 
which it proposes to establish;
    (2) Fails to meet the requirements of the regulations in this part; 
or
    (3) Violates any decision or order of the Commission or of a court.

When a tariff publication is rejected, the party who tendered it will be 
furnished a written explanation of reasons. The rejected tariff 
publication ordinarily will be returned, but the Commission may retain 
copies for its own use. Appeals of the rejection may be filed.

system is explained. See Sec. 1312.17 for rules governing identification 
of amendments.
    (2) Each page shall show the name of the issuing carrier or agent 
and the complete mailing address. Ocean carriers filing tariffs jointly 
with this Commission and the Federal Maritime Commission shall show the 
name officially recognized by that agency.
    (3) Each page shall show the issued date and the general effective 
date. With the original issue of the looseleaf tariff, issued and 
effective dates need be shown only on the original title page, not on 
each original page. The name of the month shall be spelled out, followed 
by the day and year by number. If the page contains matter (including 
reissued matter) effective upon a date other than the general effective 
date, the notation ``(Except as otherwise provided)'' shall be shown 
directly with the general effective date.
    (e) Items and numbering systems. (1) Numbering systems shall be 
understandable and not duplicative.
    (2) Original tariffs shall allow sufficient unused item numbers to 
allow for expansion.
    (3) If two or more items contain related subject matter, or one or 
more items are subordinate to another, compound numbers (an original 
number followed by a hyphen or decimal, then a new series of numbers, 
i.e., Item 400, Item 400-1, Item 400-2 or Item 400, Item 400.1, Item 
400.2) are permitted. Compound numbers may be used in amendments if new 
matter has to be added, provided the initial number (item 400 in the 
example) has not already been used in a compound number series.
    (4) Sections of a tariff or notes outside or inside of items shall 
be numerically or alphabetically designated. Item numbers for class rate 
tables, if assigned, shall be in numerical sequence.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.8  ICC tariff designations.

    (a) ICC designation. The ICC designation is--
    (1) The characters ``ICC''; followed by
    (2) The tariff, carrier or agent code; followed by
    (3) The tariff number.
    (b) ICC designations to be shown on tariff publications. (1) The ICC 
designation shall be shown on the title page of all new or reissued 
tariff publications.
    (2) Tariffs published to apply on emergency movements authorized 
under section 10928 of the Act may be filed without the carrier code if 
the carrier has not been issued a code. For example, a motor carrier's 
tariff may show a designation ``ICC 900'' if no code has been assigned 
and the number ``900'' has not been previously used. The tariffs shall, 
however, fully comply with all other requirements of this section.
    (c) Assignment of tariff, carrier and agent codes. (1) Tariff, 
carrier and agent codes shall consist of a minimum of two and a maximum 
of four alphabetical characters.
    (2) The codes shall be assigned by the transportation industry as 
follows:

Railroads: Executive Committee, Western Railroad Association, Suite 
1200, 222 Riverside Plaza, Chicago, IL 60606
Water Carriers: Waterways Freight Bureau, Suite 402, 1334 G St., NW., 
Washington, DC 20005
All Other Modes: (Passenger and Property), National Motor Freight 
Traffic Association, Inc., 1616 P St., NW., Washington, DC 20036

The fee assessed, if any, may be no more than the processing cost.
    (3) Only one code shall be assigned to each carrier or agent, except 
as authorized in paragraphs (c)(5) and (6) of this section.
    (4) A court appointed receiver, trustee, executor, administrator, 
assignee, etc., who assumes possession and operating control of a 
carrier's lines, in whole or in part, shall use the old carrier's code. 
In all other cases where the regulations in this part require the filing 
of an adoption notice, the code of the new carrier shall be used on the 
adoption notice and on all original tariffs filed thereafter in the new 
carrier's name. If a carrier's or agent's name is changed without a 
change in ownership

[[Page 307]]

of the carrier or identity of the agent, a new code shall be assigned, 
unless the Commission authorizes the use of the same code. (Exception: A 
code assigned for use on a specific tariff of an agent shall continue to 
be used on that tariff.)
    (5) Consideration shall be given to requests for the assignment of 
specific codes for classifications and other governing tariffs, issued 
by agents, which have a substantial nationwide application for a 
substantial number of participating carriers. Whenever possible, the 
assigned code shall coincide with the first letter of the primary words 
in the title of the tariff. Only one code shall be assigned to a tariff.
    (6) Consideration shall be given to requests for assignment of an 
extra code(s) to a carrier. The additional code(s) shall be constructed 
by the use of the base code assigned to the carrier, together with an 
appropriate letter suffix. In no case shall the code exceed four 
characters. If the base code consists of four characters, the letter 
suffix shall be added to the first three characters of the base code.
    (7) The industry shall file with the Commission in tariff form a 
list of the assigned alphabetical codes and the names of the carriers 
and agents to which they are assigned. The tariff shall be amended every 
3 months if the list has changed during that period. The amendments 
shall show the changes, additions and cancellations made during that 
period. The tariff shall comply with the amendment limitations provided 
in Sec. 1312.17 of this part. Partial amendments to the list may be 
shown in each supplement, and more than one partial amendment may be in 
effect at the same time.
    (d) Tariff numbers. (1) A tariff number assigned to a tariff shall 
consist of not more than four numerals. For rail general increase master 
tariffs, the number may be the letter ``X'' followed by the docket 
number of the ex parte proceeding.
    (2) For property tariffs of rail carriers, the first digit or letter 
shall conform to the following grouping:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  First digit or letter of tariff

                                     commodities).                      
4.................................  Specific commodity rate tariffs

                                     terminal service).                 
X.................................  May be used for master tariff of    
                                     general increases.                 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) For tariffs of motor common carriers of property other than 
household goods carriers the first digit shall conform to the following 
grouping:

4.................................  Commodity column or distance rate   
                                     tariffs.

                                     provisions).                       
8.................................  Reserved for future assignment.     
9.................................  Tariffs containing rates or         
                                     provisions covering emergency      
                                     movements authorized by this       
                                     Commission under section 10928 of  
                                     the Act.                           
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any tariff assigned any first digit other than 7 may contain some, but 
not solely, import or export provisions.
    (4) When a tariff could be construed as being of more than one type 
because of the provisions it contains, the governing factor in 
assignment of the digit or letter will be the category that represents 
the principal portion of the contents or which signifies its primary 
purpose.
    (5) The first digit of a tariff number assigned to tariffs of motor 
carriers of passengers or water carriers of property containing rates or 
provisions covering emergency movements authorized by the Commission 
under section 10928 of the Act shall be ``9''.
    (6) For all tariffs not governed by paragraphs (d) (2), (3), (4), or 
(5) of this section, the carrier or agent shall assign groupings for 
each of the particular types of tariffs involved, and the number 
assigned to a tariff shall conform to that grouping.

[[Page 308]]

    (7) The assigned number will remain the same from reissue to reissue 
of the tariff. The first time a tariff is issued, its tariff number 
shall not have a letter suffix. The first reissue of the tariff shall 
have the letter suffix A, the next reissue B, and so on through Z, after 
which the letter suffix A will again be used and the process repeated. A 
carrier or agent may not use any number on its tariffs that differs in 
any respect from that used in the ICC designation, and whole numbers 
(not fractional or decimal) shall be used.
    (e) Use in tariffs. A tariff which refers to another tariff shall 
identify the other tariff by its ICC designation and name the issuing 
carrier or agent.
    (f) ICC designations; rejected tariffs. When the ICC designation of 
a rejected tariff does not include a letter suffix, the designation on 
the tariff issued in its place shall bear the letter suffix A. When the 
ICC designation of a rejected tariff includes a letter suffix, the 
designation on the tariff issued in its place shall bear the next 
consecutive letter suffix. The rejected tariff may not be referred to in 
any subsequent tariffs as having been amended, canceled, or withdrawn, 
but the tariff which is published in its place shall bear the following 
notation:

    Issued in place of (here identify the rejected tariff), rejected by 
the Commission.

<R05>
Sec. 1312.9  Codes for identification of places.

    (a) Definition. As used in this part, the term code for 
identification of places means any numeric or alphabetic system used to 
represent, or identify, places, points, facilities, or locations.
    (b) Use. Codes for identification of places may be used instead of, 
or in addition to, the naming of places, points, facilities, or 
locations; provided that an explanation of the code is contained in the 
same tariff using the code, or in a separate tariff specifically named 
as a governing publication.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.10  Powers of attorney, concurrences, transfer of agent. [See also Sec. 1312.4(d)]

    (a) Powers of attorney. Powers of attorney may be given by a carrier 
to a carrier or an agent for the purpose of publishing and filing 
tariffs. A power of attorney may be given by Class III rail carriers to 
larger carriers with which they connect or by rail subsidiaries to 
parent rail carriers authorizing the larger or parent rail carriers to 
publish tariffs, to give and receive concurrences, and to give powers of 
attorney to agents on behalf of the Class III or subsidiary rail 
carrier. The power may be as broad or limited as expressed in the 
document, and alternate agents may be named. Powers of attorney shall 
not be filed at the Commission, but shall be maintained and produced if 
requested by any person. Revocation or amendment of the power of 
attorney should be reflected through lawfully published tariff revisions 
effective concurrently. In the event of failure to so revise the 
applicable tariff or tariffs, the rates in such tariff or tariffs will 
remain applicable until lawfully changed. If the scope of a power of 
attorney is questioned by any person, the document shall be produced.
    (b) Concurrences. (1) A concurrence is used to show that one carrier 
has agreed to participate in joint rates or provisions published in a 
tariff filed by another carrier or agent. A concurrence does not give a 
carrier authority to publish local rates or provisions for the carrier 
issuing the concurrence. If two or more carriers execute powers of 
attorney to the same agent, it is not necessary for those carriers to 
exchange concurrences.
    (2) Concurrences shall not be filed with the Commission, but shall 
be maintained and produced if requested. Revocation or amendment of the 
concurrence should be reflected through lawfully published tariff 
revisions effective concurrently. In the event of failure to do so, the 
rates in such tariff remain applicable until lawfully changed. If the 
concurrence is questioned, the document shall be produced by any person.
    (c) Transfer of authority from one agent to another. When a new 
agent is to take over all effective tariffs of another agent (including 
where a name of a corporation is changed), powers of attorney shall be 
appropriately amended.
    (d) Take-over publications. (1) When an agent is appointed to take 
over an

[[Page 309]]

agency, or when an alternate agent takes over the duties of the 
principal agent, the new or alternate agent shall immediately issue a 
supplement to each of the superseded agent's effective tariffs. Instead 
of showing an effective date on the title page, the following statement 
or one to similar effect shall be shown:

    On and after [date the authority was transferred], this publication 
is the issue of [new or alternate agent's name].

    (2) In the case of a new agent, only the carriers that have issued 
new powers of attorney may be shown in the take-over publication as 
participants. All other carriers previously shown as participants shall 
be shown as canceled, either by listing each and stating its 
participation is canceled or by showing the following statement or one 
to similar effect at the beginning of the list:

    The following is the list of carriers participating in this tariff 
as of [take-over date]. All carriers previously shown as participants 
but not shown are canceled.

    (3) A take-over supplement shall remain in effect for the life of 
the tariff, except the list of participating carriers may be amended.
    (4) A take-over supplement is exempt from the provisions of 
Sec. 1312.18 limiting the number and volume of supplements.
    (5) Where joint-agent publications (see Sec. 1312.11) are involved, 
there are four major situations:
    (i) The issuing agent is taken over by an agent not already shown as 
joining in the publication.
    (ii) A joint agent is taken over by an agent other than the issuing 
agent.
    (iii) A joint agent is taken over by the issuing agent; or
    (iv) The issuing agent is taken over by a joint agent shown on the 
publication.
    (A) In the case of paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, the new 
agent issues the take-over supplement.
    (B) In the case of paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section, the issuing 
agent of the tariff issues the supplement showing the name of the new 
agent for the one taken over.
    (C) In the case of paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, the 
issuing agent of the tariff issues the supplement, with the former agent 
and its ICC designation deleted.
    (D) In the case of paragraph (d)(5)(iv) of this section, the new 
agent becomes the issuing agent, issues the take-over supplement, with 
the former issuing agent and its ICC designation deleted. In each case, 
the supplement shall contain only matter necessary to explain the action 
with the list of participating carriers, if any, appropriately amended.
    (6) Amendments (including the take-over supplement) filed by the new 
agent to tariffs issued by the former agent shall, in connection with 
the ICC designation, show that they are in the series of the former 
agent.
    (7) New tariffs issued by the new agent shall be in the new agent's 
own ICC designation series. If a new tariff cancels a tariff taken over 
by the new agent, the cancellation shall indicate the series of the 
tariff canceled.
    (8) An alternate agent, after take over, shall continue to use the 
ICC designation series of the former agent, and shall, in connection 
with the ICC designation, identify it by name of the former agent.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.11  Tariffs issued by joint agents not applicable to contract carriers or household goods freight forwarders.

    (a) May be filed. Two or more agents may issue a tariff(s). Each 
agent shall act only for carriers who have given it powers of attorney 
or who have given concurrences to carriers issuing powers of attorney. 
Each agent need not obtain powers of attorney from all participating 
carriers. Each carrier shall be shown as participating under authority 
given to one of the issuing agents.
    (b) Title pages and looseleaf pages. The title page of each original 
joint issue tariff and supplement and each joint issue looseleaf page--
    (1) May show a separate ICC designation in the series of each agent; 
and
    (2) Shall show at the bottom--
    (i) ``Issued By'' followed by the name, title, and mailing address 
of the principal agent or issuing party; and
    (ii) Below that, ``Jointly With'' followed by the name, title, and 
mailing

[[Page 310]]

address of the other agent(s) joining in the issue.

For bound tariffs only, the names, addresses, and ICC designations of 
agents other than the principal agent may be shown on the reverse side 
of the title page of the tariff publication instead of on the title 
page. Except as provided in Sec. 1312.10, an agent may be added or 
deleted as an issuing party only by reissue of the tariff. In either 
case, the former tariff shall be canceled only by supplement.
    (c) List of participating carriers. Any list of carriers 
participating in the tariff shall be arranged as provided in 
Sec. 1312.13 and shall be published in--
    (1) The tariff itself:
    (2) A separate jointly issued participating carrier tariff; or
    (3) Each issuing agent's separate participating carrier tariff.

<R05>
Sec. 1312.12  Title page of original tariffs.

    (a) Title page required. Original tariffs shall have a title page 
which contains at a minimum the information required by paragraphs (b) 
through (k) of this section.
    (b) ICC designation and cancellation notice. The tariff's ICC 
designation shall be shown. Immediately under it, the ICC designation of 
the tariff(s) being canceled, if any. If there are numerous tariffs 
being canceled, the ICC designations of those tariffs may be shown--
    (1) If a bound tariff, on the first page after the title page which 
contains tariff matter; or
    (2) If a looseleaf tariff, on the first page after the ``check 
sheet(s),'' or, if the ``correction number, checkoff'' type of check 
sheet is also employed, the first page following that. If the 
cancellations are not shown on the title page, reference to the location 
of the listing of the canceled tariffs should be shown.
    (c) Looseleaf tariffs. The title page of an original looseleaf 
tariff shall be designated as an ``Original Title page.''
    (d) Name and certificate number. The name of the issuing carrier or 
agent and complete mailing address shall be shown. Ocean carriers filing 
tariffs jointly with this Commission and the Federal Maritime Commission 
shall show the name officially recognized by that agency. The name of 
the carrier shall be followed by the number of its certificate or 
permit, if any. Sub numbers of certificates and permits need not be 
shown. If the agent is a corporation or association, its name shall be 
shown. If the agent is an individual, the association's name (if any) 
for whom the agent acts may also be shown.
    (e) Type of rates or fares, modes of transportation and territorial 
application--rate or fare tariffs. (1) (This paragraph applies to motor 
passenger contract carriers.) The title page shall state that the tariff 
is a ``Contract Carrier Schedule of Minimum Rates [or ``Fares''] and 
Charges Applying On'', and show a short, specific description of the 
commodities, or types of fares, and the territory covered.
    (2) (This paragraph applies to common carriers.) A tariff naming 
rate shall provide the following information:
    (i) The type of rates, the modes of transportation, and the 
territory covered. The terms local, joint, proportional, and distance 
shall be used to identify the rates.
    (ii) Tariffs shall use appropriate terms to identify the rates in 
the tariff as specifically as possible; for example: export, import, 
coastwise, intercoastal, assembling, distribution, class, commodity, 
commodity-column (column-commodity), passenger, commutation, truckload, 
carload, trainload, less-than-truckload, less-than-carload, or any 
quantity.
    (iii) Each mode of transportation shall be identified, such all-
rail, all-motor, motor-water, motor-rail or rail-motor-water routes.
    (f) Governing tariffs. A classification, a rules tariff or another 
type of governing tariff shall show a brief descripition of the tariff 
and its contents.
    (g) Nomenclature for tariff. A brief reference (e.g., ``Iron and 
Steel Tariff,'' ``Charter Coach Tariff''), by which the tariff can be 
readily identified may be shown.
    (h) Reference to item containing a list of governing tariffs. A 
tariff governed by one or more other tariffs shall refer to

[[Page 311]]

the item containing the list of the governing tariffs, in the following 
manner:

    For governing publications, see Item ----.

    (i) Tariffs issued under decision, order or other authority. A 
reference to the decision or order by number, or a reference to the 
regulation by section number, and the number of days' notice (where less 
than statutory notice is authorized) shall be shown if the entire 
tariff--
    (1) Is issued to comply with a mandatory decision of the Commission 
or an order of a court requiring a specific action;
    (2) Is issued under authority of a permissive decision allowing less

or
    (3) Is published under a regulation of this part permitting less 
than statutory notice or departure from an outstanding decision, or 
both.
    (j) Issue and effective dates. The issue date and the general 
effective date shall be shown. If a tariff contains matter (including 
reissued matter) effective upon a date other than the general effective

Sec. 1312.13  Contents of tariffs.

    (a) General requirements. No provision may be published in tariff 
publications which exceeds the carrier's operating authority. An 
original tariff shall contain the provisions required by paragraphs (b) 
through (l) of this section. Any matter not specifically prohibited may 
be included.
    (b)  Checksheets--looseleaf tariffs only. A checksheet, may be used 
to list in numerical order the numbers of the original looseleaf pages 
comprising the tariff. (This page shall always show an updated listing 
of each page and supplement and shall accompany the pages and 
supplements being filed.) If the tariff uses the ``correction number, 
check-off'' type of checksheet as looseleaf page amendments are filed, 
it must be accompanied by in numerical order, a list of correction 
numbers beginning with No. 1. See Sec. 1312.17 Amendments.
    (c) Participating carriers. (1) (This paragraph does not apply to 
carriers' local tariffs.) Unless a separate participating carrier's 
tariff is filed, a list of the participating carriers shall be provided, 
showing the names of the carriers; the city and state of the principal 
office of the carrier; and the lead docket number of each carrier's 
operating authority, if any.
    (2) A carrier may not without authorization file local rates or 
provisions to apply for another carrier not joint rates or provisions to 
which it is not a party.
    (d) Statement of operating authority in rate tariffs. (This 
paragraph does not apply to railroad, pipeline or passenger carriers.) 
The operating authority under which rates are published shall be clearly 
shown in the tariff containing the rates, in a referred to ``scope 
tariff'' (see Sec. 1312.24) or in a rules tariff.

shown, along with the type of tariff, its issuing agent or carrier, and 
its ICC designation.
    (2) Governing publications shall be on file with the Commission 
except that rules published in the CFR and other publications containing 
standardized codes or terms that are published by the Federal government 
and available from the government need not be reproduced, only 
referenced.
    (3) Governing publications shall not result in conflicting rates, 
charges or provisions.
    (f) Rules and other provisions which govern the tariff. (1) Rules or 
provisions stating conditions which in any way affect the rates named in 
the tariff shall be published either in the rate tariff under the 
heading ``Governing Provisions'' or other tariffs. A provision affecting 
a particular item or rate shall be specifically referred to. Provisions 
affecting more than one but not all of the rates in the tariff or 
applying for only some of the participating carriers may be included 
with explanatory statements.

    (ii) A carrier or agent may assign a title and number of its 
choosing for matter not listed, provided the title and number chosen do 
not conflict with those listed.
    (iii) If a title does not properly identify a rule's content, 
qualifying words, phrases or subtitles may be added. When qualifying 
words or phrases are used, the prescribed title shall be followed by a 
dash and the added words. Subtitles or references to excepted 
classification rules shall follow the title.
    (iv) When a rule is split into two or more parts, the prescribed 
item number may be subdivided. The first part of the rule (which shall 
contain the general rule, if any) must be assigned the prescribed item 
number without a numerical suffix. Each subdivision shall be assigned a 
compound number, which shall be constructed by use of the prescribed 
number followed by a decimal or a hyphen, then a new series of numbers, 
for example: Item 70.1, or 70-1, in numerical sequence. Each subdivision 
must show the prescribed title.
    (v) Exceptions to a rule may be included in the general rule or 
arranged in items immediately following the rule to which exception is 
taken. In the latter case, exception items are to use the standard item 
number of the general rule followed by a suffix--for example, exceptions 
to item 85 would use items 85.1, 85.2, etc., or 85-1, 85-2, etc.
    (vi) Tariffs subject to the provisions contained in Sec. 1312.37 are 
not subject to the requirements of this paragraph.
    (3) Governing provisions should be given brief, but descriptive, 
titles.
    (4) Tariffs containing rates for the transportation of dangerous 
articles (hazardous materials) may reproduce the Department of 
Transportation's regulations governing the acceptance and transportation 
of those articles refer to a separate tariff which contains the 
regulations, or refer to the CFR location of the governing rules.
    (5) Rules and regulations of passenger carriers concerning their 
practices, procedures and regulations for the sale, honoring, exchange, 
validation, refund, and time limits for usage of tickets shall be 
published in the fare tariffs, or the fare tariff shall refer to a 
separate tariff containing these provisions.
    (g) Exceptions to class ratings. (1) The exceptions to class ratings 
in a classification or exceptions tariff applying only for the rates 
published in one tariff shall be published in that tariff, be clear, be 
published in a separate section, be arranged in the same order, describe 
the commodity in the same words, or as close as possible, used in the 
classification, and use the generic heading, if any, used in the 
classification, and indicate the quantity application.
    (2) Different class ratings on the same article or commodity based 
on different minimum quantities may be published if the class ratings 
are published in one item.
    (3) An exception class rating may be published to apply on the 
movement of a plant to a new location without naming each article to be 
transported, provided application is clear.
    (h) Exceptions to classification or exceptions tariff rules. 
Exceptions to rules in a classification or exceptions tariff applying 
only for the rates published in one tariff, should be published in that 
tariff, in the ``Governing Provisions'' section [but see 
Sec. 1312.27(b)] and shall--
    (1) Be arranged in the same order as they appear in the 
classification;
    (2) Unless the exception is to make the rule (or part of the rule) 
not applicable, be complete in themselves by republication of the 
complete rules, section or other identifiable unit affected;

[[Page 314]]

    (3) Identify the classification rule (and exceptions tariff rule, if 
any) and the part being changed;
    (4) Republish the entire rule if relatively small;
    (5) If the exception is to make the rule (or portion of the rule) 
not applicable, identify the rule or portion affected.
    (i) Application for individual carriers. Tariffs shall contain 
statements indicating the proper application of the rates and provisions 
for particular carriers.
    (j) Statements of rates and fares. Rate tariffs shall contain a 
statement of rates applicable for the transportation of the articles on 
which rates are named. Fare tariffs shall contain a statement of fares 
applicable for the transportation of passengers which the tariff is 
intended to cover. Tariffs must be presented in a manner that allows all 
tariff users to have knowledge of the exact rate of fare applicable to 
any given shipment.
    (k) Statement of routes. A clear statement of routes over which the 
published rates apply shall be shown, prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of Sec. 1312.15.
    (l) Explanation of reference marks, notes, and abbreviations. (1) 
Reference marks, abbreviations and note references used in a tariff 
shall be explained either in the item to which they apply or in a 
separate item. Use shall be consistent throughout the tariff unless the 
deviation is specifically explained. See also Sec. Sec. 1312.17 and 
1312.18.
    (2) Standard carrier codes may be included as part of the List of 
Participating Carriers if one is published within the tariff, provided a 
statement to that effect is included under the explanation of 
abbreviations.
    (3) In addition to U.S. Postal Service State name abbreviations and 
acronyms of Federal agencies, the following commonly used abbreviations 
are acceptable without explanation.

[32 FR 20541, Dec. 20, 1967, as amended at 54 FR 38998, Sept. 22, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1312.14  Statement of rates and fares (see also Sec. 1312.41).

    (a) Shall be clear and explicit. (1) Rates, fares, and provisions 
shall be

[[Page 315]]

clearly stated and arranged in a systematic manner which establishes the 
rate, charge or attendant provisions for each service offered or 
performed by the serving carrier. Rates and charges shall be explicitly 
stated per unit in U.S. dollars or cents. A rate for a given service may 
be expressed as a definite percentage of another explicitly stated rate 
in the same or other tariffs. The disposition of fractions and other 
tariff elements required to determine the applicable rate, charge or 
provision shall be clearly explained. Tariffs of motor passenger 
contract carriers shall provide an explicit statement of the minimum 
rates, fares, or charges actually maintained. Rates may be stated in any 
measurable unit. Rates may be stated as applying e.g., per car, per 
vehicle, per mile, per vehicle-mile, per container, per package, per 
passenger, per unit of time or other variable unit, provided the measure 
of the service is fixed by defining the unit specifically, or in maximum 
terms, such as a stated maximum weight of contents permitted per vehicle 
or container of a certain maximum cubic capacity or measurement, or 
stated maximum dimensions or weight per individual package. Rates for 
rail, water, and motor passenger service (including one-way, roundtrip, 
commutation, etc.) may be stated per passenger or other identifiable 
unit. Rates based on quantity shall be stated as having any quantity, 
less-than-truckload, truckload, less-than-carload, carload, trainload, 
volume or any other clearly defined quantity application.
    (2) (This paragraph only applies to transportation of property by 
railroads.) Rates may be shown as applying from or to ``all points'' in 
a State to territory located on the lines of the carrier parties to the 
tariff, without naming the points in the tariff, provided the tariff is 
governed by a station list tariff or otherwise adequately describes the 
territorial scope. Points may be excepted from the application of the 
rates by listing them. Intermediate point rules (Sec. 1312.33) may not 
be used in connection with origin or destination points provided in 
accordance with this paragraph, as to do so would be redundant.
    (3) Rates may be published to apply from or to a named plant site, 
construction site, or other site, if its location is identified. Rates 
may be published for the account of a specifically named shipper or 
receiver.
    (b) Arbitraries. A tariff may provide rates from or to designated 
points by the addition or deduction of arbitraries or differentials to 
or from rates in the tariff from or to named base points. Provision for 
this shall be shown either in a separate item in the same tariff, which 
shall specifically name the base point and clearly and definitely state 
the manner in which the arbitraries or differentials shall be applied, 
or in a separate rate basis tariff.
    (c) Class rates. Class rate tariffs shall provide a rate for class 
ratings shown in the classification or exceptions tariff except class 
rates for certain classes may be omitted provided there is a statement 
that the next lower class or the next higher class (not both) for which 
rates are published shall be used.
    (d) Alternation and precedence of rates, and maximum charges. 
Alternation of rates is permitted. The extent of alternation must be 
clearly defined by explicitly delineating the levels of rates subject to 
alternation. For example:

--Rates named in section 2 of this tariff alternate with rates named in 
sections 3 and 4 of this tariff.
--Rates named in this tariff alternate with rates named in tariff ------
, issued by ------.
--Commodity rates named in Section of -- of this tariff alternate with 
class rates named in tariff ------, issued by ------------; alternation 
extends to class rates as discounted through use of discount provisions 
named in tariff ------, issued by ------------.

    (e) Mixed shipments. If two or more commodities are listed in 
connection with a rate or rating application, there shall be a clear 
statement as to whether the rate or rating applies only on straight 
shipments, on a specific mixture of the articles, or on straight or 
mixed shipments. If one or more of the commodities are to be subject to 
a rate or a minimum quantity or both, different from the others, how the 
minimum charge per mixed shipment is to be determined shall be clearly 
stated. This is also required if two or more rates or ratings, based on 
different minimum quantities, are provided for

[[Page 316]]

the same commodity. Where different rates or ratings are so provided, 
there shall be a statement published explaining how the deficit, if any, 
in the applicable minimum weight shall be rated.
    (f) Commodity rates. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (g), 
(h) and (i) of this section, when commodity rates are established, the 
commodity description shall be specific and the rates may not be applied 
to analogous articles unless so provided. As far as possible, uniform 
commodity descriptions should be used in all tariffs.
    (g) Generic terms. Rates, tariffs, or sections of tariffs may be 
published to apply commodities without naming the individual articles by 
publication of an appropriate description.
    (h) Reference to items or lists for commodities or descriptions. (1) 
Commodity rate items may contain rates on a number of articles without 
naming the articles in the item by use of a generic term and reference 
to an item (not a rate item) in the tariff or in a separate tariff 
(sufficiently identified on its title page) which contains a complete 
list of the articles (and minimum weights, if any). The list shall bear 
a commodity caption (for example ``Packinghouse products, namely''), 
which shall be worded the same as the generic term used in the rate 
item, and the commodities in each list shall be arranged alphabetically.
    (2) The rate item may except certain commodities in the list.
    (3) A rate tariff may refer to a classification instead of, or in 
addition to, a separate list tariff for description of articles on which 
rates published by reference to generic terms will apply. The reference 
may be restricted to the descriptions in certain identified items under 
the generic heading used. A rate item may refer to classification items 
for a detailed description, and for governing conditions, if the 
commodity term used in the rate item embraces the commodities in the 
classification items. The rate tariff shall clearly indicate the 
application of notes, qualifying conditions and other matter published 
in connection with the classification items.
    (i) Application of aggregate of intermediate rates and combination 
rates. (1) Except where a carrier elects to permit alternation, when a 
rate, whether local or joint, from origin to destination has been 
established via a route as a ``one-factor rate,'' it becomes the only 
legal rate for through transportation via that route, whether it is 
greater or less than the aggregate of intermediate rates, if any.
    (2) The lowest combination of rates applicable via the route of 
movement is the legal rate if no one-factor rate is in effect. The 
combination shall be treated as a unit from origin to destination.

    Note: This section does not require equalizing via one route or 
gateway the combination of rates applicable over another route or via a 
different gateway.

    (j) Proportional rates. (This paragraph does not apply to contract 
carriers or household goods freight forwarders.) Tariffs containing 
proportional rates shall clearly show their application. If a 
proportional rate is intended for use on traffic destined to a 
restricted territory or points, the territory shall be clearly defined.
    (k) Tank-line gauge books and equipment register. When rates are 
published with minimum weights dependent upon, for example, the length 
of the car used, or the marked cubical or gallon capacity of the car 
used, that measurement or mark becomes an intergral part of the rate and 
carriers shall file tariffs showing the numbers, dimensions, capacities, 
and ownership of freight cars, and other information required by law to 
be filed with respect to such cars. The information may be published in 
separate publications and be filed by duly authorized agents. Successive 
issues and amendments may be made effective on 1 day's notice.

Sec. 1312.15  Routing not applicable to household goods freight forwarders or contract carriers.

    (a) Routing to be specified. Except as authorized in paragraph (b) 
of this section, the routing to be used shall be specified in a complete 
and clear manner, identifying each carrier and the point of interchange 
in proper order from origin to destination. For motor

[[Page 317]]

carriers, highway numbers need not be listed.
    (b) Open routing. (This paragraph applies to tariffs of railroads.) 
Routing may be provided by publishing a statement substantially as 
follows in the rate tariff:

    The rates in this tariff apply over all routes made by use of the 
lines of any of the carriers parties to this tariff, except as otherwise 
specifically provided on pages ----, in individual rate items, or in 
connection with individual rates.

The exceptions may be stated either by showing that the rate applies 
only via specified routes (affirmative routing), or by showing that the 
rate does not apply via specified routes (negative routing). Affirmative 
routing may be shown in a routing guide, but negative routing may not.
    (c) Where to publish routes. The routes shall be published in the 
rate tariff, in a separate routing tariff or tariffs (a ``routing 
guide''), or in a separate routing tariff or tariffs which are governed 
by an explanation of routes tariff or tariffs. Routes may be published 
in both rate tariffs and routing tariffs.
    (d) Notations in tariff publications. (1) A routing guide shall 
contain the following or similar statement on its title page:

    The routes in this tariff may be used only when rate tariffs provide 
for their application.

    (2) If all of the routes are provided in the rate tariff, the 
following or similar notation shall be shown in the rate tariff under 
the heading ``Routing Instructions'':

    The rates in this tariff apply only via the routes specified on 
pages [or ``in items''].

    (3) If all of the routes are provided in the routing guide, the 
following or similar notation (with appropriate tariff reference) shall 
be shown in the rate tariff under the heading ``Routing Instructions'':

    The rates in this tariff apply only via the routes specified in 
[here show ICC designation] for carrier parties to this tariff.

    (4) If the rate tariff contains routing and also refers to a routing 
guide, an appropriate notation shall be published in the rate tariff 
under the heading ``Routing Instructions.'' The notation shall clearly 
state the circumstances when the routing in the rate tariff applies and 
when the routing in the routing guide applies.
    (e) Number of routing guides. A rate may not be subject to more than 
one routing guide except--
    (1) Joint rates of a rail subsidiary or a Class III rail carrier 
with two or more connecting or parent rail carriers may refer to the 
routing guides of each of the connecting or parent carriers;
    (2) If territorial routing guides are published, an interterritorial 
rate may refer to one guide for each of the separate territories 
involved; and
    (3) Reference may be made to separate routing guides of any of the 
participating carriers for internal routing over each of the carrier's 
lines.
    (f) Combined routing guide/participating carrier tariff. A routing 
guide may be combined with a participating carrier tariff, or a combined 
participating carrier and points of service tariff, provided the routing 
provisions are separate and the requirements of this section are 
otherwise complied with.
    (g) Emergency routing clause. The following provision or one of 
similar effect may be published under the heading ``Routing 
Instructions'' in connection with joint rates on property:

                            Emergency Routing

    The joint rates in this tariff apply via the routes and through the 
transfer points authorized in this tariff, except:

    When, because of pronounced traffic congestion (not an embargo), 
detours or other similar emergencies, or through carriers' error, 
carriers forward shipments by other transfer points of the same carriers 
or over the lines of other carriers parties to this tariff, the rate 
specified in this tariff will apply if it results in lower charges than 
the otherwise applicable rate over the actual route of movement.

    (h) Cancellation of or surcharges to joint routes or rates. (This 
paragraph applies only to rail carriers.) Cancellations of joint rates 
or routes or surcharges to them under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 10705a 
shall have a clear statement to that effect in the tariff publication.

<R05>
Sec. 1312.16  Sectional tariffs.

    Tariffs may be arranged in ``sections'' to separate different kinds 
of rates or provisions, provided the sections are consecutively numbered 
or lettered and differentiation among sections is clear.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.17  Amendments.

    (a) How made. An amendment is a change in, addition to, or 
cancellation from a tariff. Supplements are tariff publications to be 
used to amend bound tariffs (see Sec. 1312.18) and new or revised pages 
are tariff publications to be used to amend looseleaf tariffs (see 
paragraph (d) of this section). Supplements may also be used to amend 
looseleaf tariffs as provided in paragraph (d)(16) of this section.
    (b) Lists of participating carriers. (This paragraph does not apply 
to participating carrier tariffs.)
    (1) In bound tariffs, the list shall be amended by--
    (i) Publishing a complete new list containing all changes and 
canceling the prior list; or
    (ii) Publishing a cumulative list of all changes, alphabetically 
arranged either by code or carrier name, and the statement: ``The list 
of participating carriers is as shown in the tariff except for the 
following changes.'' Only one cumulative list may be in effect at one 
time. A carrier's participation shall be canceled by showing the 
carrier's complete name, together with the word ``Cancel'' or other 
suitable provision. Changes shall be carried forward in subsequent 
amendments to the list as reissued matter.
    (2) In a looseleaf tariff, the list shall be amended either by (i) 
republication of the page(s) on which the list appears, indicating the 
cancellations, additions and changes. The canceled carriers' names shall 
be republished on a separate page(s) at the end of the list, indicating 
when the cancellation was first effective, until all provisions in the 
tariff referring specifically to the carrier(s) have been removed from 
the effective pages. The pages containing the list shall refer to the 
page(s) containing the list of canceled carriers; or (ii) reissuing the 
affected page(s) with an appropriate symbol to show elimination of a 
carrier.
    (3) Concurrent with the cancellation of a carrier from the 
participating carrier list, all provisions specifically referring to 
that carrier shall be appropriately amended unless--
    (i) The cancellation is in connection with the publication of a 
complete adoption of the rates of that carrier by another (see 
Sec. 1312.20); or
    (ii) The method permitted in paragraph (b)(4) of this section is 
used.
    (4) A carrier's participation may be canceled by publishing a 
blanket cancellation notice directly with the list of participating 
carriers, and referring to the notice when canceling the carrier's name 
from the list. If this method is used, all provisions specifically 
referring to that carrier shall be amended as soon as possible. During 
the interim, an item or provision which specifically refers to that 
carrier may not be republished unless the reference is concurrently 
removed.
    (c) Amendments to bound tariffs. (1) Provisions shall be amended by 
publication of the entire item or segment in a supplement, except as 
otherwise authorized.
    (2) When an item is to be amended, the new item shall be given the 
same number with a letter suffix, starting with the letter A, continuing 
through Z, then starting with AA, BB, and so on. Except as provided in 
paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the new item shall specifically cancel 
all uncanceled items in the same series. For example: ``Item 40-A 
cancels Item 40''; ``Item 40-C cancels Item 40-B and Item 40-A'' (if 
Item 40-A had not been canceled previously).
    (3) Items need not specifically cancel the previous items in the 
same series if the tariff contains a rule explaining the process in 
which items are superseded. For example, the rule may provide that the 
use of the next letter suffix automatically cancels the prior item.

The rule shall be maintained for the life of the tariff. Specific 
cancellation shall be made of items containing rates or provisions under 
suspension or held in force by reason of suspension.
    (4) When provisions of a numbered segment, other than an item, are 
to be amended, the new segment shall be given the same number, without a 
suffix, and specifically cancel all prior

[[Page 319]]

uncanceled segments bearing the same number. The cancellation shall be 
made by referring to the segment number and its location, i.e., 
``Section 3, cancels Section 3 on pages 50-56 of the tariff.''
    (5) When the provisions of an unnumbered segment are to be amended 
or canceled, the previous segment shall be canceled by clearly 
indicating the matter and referring to its location.
    (6) Amendment in part without bringing forward the item or segment 
in its entirety, may be made of items or segments containing only--

Tables of contents;
Lists of--participating carriers, commodities, or points of service;
Indexes of--commodities, origins, or destinations;
Statements of carriers' operating authorities;
Explanations of--routing, abbreviations, reference marks, or notes;
Package descriptions; or
Tables of--rates, rate base numbers, or other figures comprising more 
than two pages.

    (7) If a reference mark in a rate table is amended, the rates need 
not be republished provided the changed reference is explained in the 
explanation of reference marks and a list of items that use the mark is 
included.
    (8) When amending a figure at the intersection of a headline and 
sideline point of tables of rates, rate base numbers or other figures, 
either the entire vertical column or entire horizontal column of figures 
in which the change appears shall be reproduced. In no case, however, 
shall the format of the tables be changed during the life of the tariff.
    (9) Partial amendments shall be published so that it is clear what 
matter is being added, changed or canceled.
    (10) The following notation or one to similar effect shall be shown 
with a partial amendment of an item or segment containing station index 
numbers:

    The index numbers of stations in this supplement correspond with the 
index numbers of the same stations shown on pages ---- to ----, 
inclusive, of the tariff, with the following additions and deletions.

    (11) Additions to an item may be published without bringing forward 
the entire item by stating, e.g., ``Refer to item 100 and add . . . .''
    (12) Canceled matter may not be reproduced in an item or segment 
effecting a cancellation except to the extent necessary to identify the 
subject matter.
    (13) An expiration or cancellation statement of an entire item or 
segment shall be treated the same as any other reissued matter in 
subsequent supplements.
    (14) If part or all of the matter in an item or segment is 
transferred to another tariff or to a different location in the same 
tariff, that item or segment shall--
    (i) Be revised in the regular manner; and
    (ii) Show where the transferred matter will thereafter be found.
    (d) Amendments to looseleaf tariffs. (1) New pages added at the end 
of the tariff shall be designated as ``Original'' and consecutively 
numbered beginning with the number following the number of the last page 
of the original tariff.
    (2) Other new pages shall be designated as ``Original'' and given 
the same number as an existing page (if the tariff contains pages 
printed on both sides of the sheet, use the higher number) followed by a 
single suffix letter, in alphabetical sequence starting with ``A''. No 
other system or variation may be used.
    (3) Both sides of a sheet shall be given page numbers when adding 
new pages to a tariff containing pages printed on both sides of the 
sheets. If one side is intentionally left blank, the page shall contain 
a statement to that effect.
    (4) Amendment of a title page shall be made by reprinting it and 
giving it a revision number. The first amendment shall be designated as 
``1st Revised Title Page'', and so on in consecutive numerical order. 
Revised title pages shall show the following under their effective 
dates: ``Original Tariff effective (here show the effective date of the 
original tariff).'' The revised page shall specifically cancel all the 
uncanceled title pages to the same tariff. The cancellation shall be 
shown with the new designation, for example, ``1st Revised Title Page 
cancels Original Title Page.''
    (5) (This paragraph does not apply to title pages.)

[[Page 320]]

    (i) Amendment of a page shall be made by reprinting it and giving it 
a revision number. The first amendment shall be designated as ``1st 
Revised Page ----,'' and so on in consecutive numerical order. Suffixes 
or prefixes may be used. See Sec. 1312.7(b). The revised page 
designations shall be shown in the same corner as original page 
designations are shown.
    (ii) If the pages being amended are to a tariff which contains pages 
printed on both sides of the sheets, both sides of the sheets shall be 
reprinted. If changes are not being made in the tariff matter on one 
side of the sheet, the following notation shall be shown with the new 
revision number: ``Change in revision number ---- only.''
    (iii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, 
revised pages shall cancel all uncanceled pages in the same series. The 
cancellation shall be shown with the new designation, for example, ``2nd 
Revised Page 10 cancels 1st Revised Page 10.''
    (6) If a page is rejected, its designation (i.e., ``original'', 
``1st Revised'', etc.) may not be used again in that page series. The 
rejected page may not be referred to on a subsequent page as having been 
canceled, amended or withdrawn. The page issued in its place shall use 
the next revision number and bear the following:

    Issued in place of (here identify the rejected page), rejected by 
the Commission.

    (7) Pages, other than title pages, need not specifically cancel 
previous pages in the same series if the tariff contains the following 
statement or one to similar effect:

    Unless otherwise provided, amendment of a page will be made by 
reprinting the page and showing a revision number. The revision numbers 
will be used in consecutive numerical order beginning with ``1st Revised 
Page''. A revised page cancels any uncanceled revised or original pages 
which bear the same page number.

The statement shall be maintained for the life of the tariff. Specific 
cancellation shall be made of pages containing rates or provisions under 
suspension or held in force by reason of suspension.
    (8) Except as otherwise authorized, looseleaf tariffs may not be 
further amended when the number of sheets (including check sheets) 
containing canceled pages would exceed six times the number of sheets 
(including check sheets) containing effective pages. This limitation may 
be exceeded if necessary to comply initially with a Commission decision 
or if specifically authorized.
    (9) If a revised page omits rates or other provisions which had been 
shown on the page it cancels, the disposition of the omitted matter 
shall be indicated. If the matter is transferred to another tariff or to 
another page in the same tariff, that shall be stated. If transferred to 
another page, the page to which it is transferred shall contain the 
following notation directly with the transferred matter--

    For [here state whether rates, rules, provisions, etc., as 
appropriate] previously in effect, see page(s) ----.

or an explanation of the transfer in some other manner. If matter is 
canceled or expired and not transferred, the page shall so indicate, 
identifying the canceled or expired matter only to the extent necessary 
to show what is affected.
    (10)(i) If five or more pages of a tariff are to be reissued at one 
time with the same effective date to cancel all provisions or to 
transfer all provisions to other pages, the reissue and the cancellation 
may be accomplished by a single printing, showing the individual 
cancellations. (If for a tariff which has pages printed on both sides of 
the sheets, this method may only be used when both pages of any 
particular sheet are being canceled or transferred.)
    (ii) The reissued matter shall clearly show the designation of the 
page(s) to which matter is being transferred. See paragraph (d)(9) of 
this section.
    (iii) Where the page designation for that tariff would otherwise 
appear (i.e., the upper left-hand or upper right-hand corner), the 
following shall be shown, completed;

Revised Page____________________________________________________________
Cancels Page____________________________________________________________

    (iv) The automatic cancellation provisions of paragraph (d)(7) of 
this section may not be used with this procedure.

[[Page 321]]

    (v) This procedure may not be used when new or other provisons are 
to be substituted on the pages. However, the pages may be subsequently 
reissued individually in the regular manner.
    (11) The check sheet (see Sec. 1312.13(b)) shall be reissued and 
filed with the filing of any amendment. The revised check sheet shall--
    (i) List all effective pages in numerical sequence;
    (ii) Show the latest designation of each page;
    (iii) Indicate those pages which have been revised or added since 
the previous check sheet;
    (iv) Indicate those pages or supplements which contain only matter 
under suspension or held in force by reason of suspension; and
    (v) List all effective, or filed and yet to be effective, 
supplements.
    (12) If the ``correction number, check off'' type of check sheet is 
used, looseleaf page amendments issued and filed at one time shall show 
the same correction number. The first filing shall bear correction No. 
1, the second correction No. 2, and so on in consecutive order. In lieu 
of the foregoing, carriers or agents utilizing the ``correction, check 
off'' type of check sheet may issue and file looseleaf page amendments 
with sequentially numbered correction numbers. An explanation of the 
correction numbering system shall be given.
    (13) Supplements (except supplements canceled by other supplements 
of like or similar character or content) shall be canceled by reissue of 
the check sheet containing the updated list of pages, adding the words 
``also cancels Supplement No. --'' immediately following the words 
``cancels ---- page ----''.
    (14) Any indexes or tables of contents shall be amended concurrently 
with changes in the contents of the tariff to show additions, 
cancellations, and changes as to points and commodities.
    (15) Supplements to looseleaf tariffs may be used for the following 
purposes--
    (i) Conversion or percentage supplements to provide general rate 
changes, see paragraph (j) of this section and Sec. 1312.18(h).
    (ii) Transfer or cancellation of provisions, see Sec. 1312.19.
    (iii) Suspended matter, see Sec. 1312.21.
    (iv) Seasonal rates or fares, see Sec. 1312.36.
    (v) Transfer of operations--(change in name and control), see 
Sec. 1312.20.
    (vi) Take-over publications (transfer of agent), see Sec. 1312.10; 
or
    (vii) Postponement of tariffs or tariff matter, see Sec. 1312.39.
    (e) Reinstatement of canceled or expired provisions shall be by 
republication. If provisions have been eliminated by cancellation or 
expiration, they may only be reinstated by republication.
    (f) Changes are to be indicated. (for suggested reference marks see 
Sec. 1312.13.)
    (1) [Reserved]
    (2) When a change of the same character is made in a substantial 
number of rates a statement may be used in place of symbolizing each of 
the individual rate changes. The statement shall note the nature of the 
change. The statement shall be in distinctive type at the top of the 
title page of the publication or the top of the page(s), containing the 
rates, with exceptions, if any, so noted. An appropriate reference mark 
shall be used to indicate any other change not indicated by the general 
statement on the publication.
    (3) When tariff matter subject to a reference mark or the wording 
required by this paragraph is reissued without change, the reference 
mark or wording shall be omitted.
    (g) Reissued matter. (1) Matter brought forward without change from 
one supplement to another in the same tariff shall be designated as 
``Reissued'' and the supplement number from which it is reissued shown, 
and the effective date of that supplement. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (g) (2) and (4) of this section, this shall be accomplished 
in one of the following ways:
    (i) The information shall be published with the reissued matter, for 
example, ``Reissued from Supplement 1, effective June 1, 1990'', or
    (ii) With the reissued matter, show in a square or substitute (see 
Sec. 1312.13) the number of the supplement from which it is reissued; 
and
    (iii) under the explanation of reference marks in the supplement, 
show the supplement number in the square

[[Page 322]]

or substitute and explain it, for example, ``[1] Reissued from 
Supplement 1, effective June 1, 1990''; or under the explanation of 
reference marks in the original tariff, show the empty square or 
substitute, with the following or similar explanation:

    Reissued from supplement bearing the number [enclosed within the 
square]. To determine its original effective date, see that supplement.

    (2) If the reissued matter is brought forward from a supplement and 
its effective date had been changed by another supplement, this 
information shall be shown in the following manner:

    Reissued from Supplement ----, effective ----, per Supplement ----.

This statement shall either be shown directly with the reissued matter, 
or elsewhere on the same page with the reissued matter referring to it. 
The number-in-the-square method or substitute may not be used in this 
instance.
    (3) Matter in looseleaf tariffs being brought forward without change 
from one page to the next revision of that page shall only be referenced 
when republishing the cancellation of participating carriers as required 
by paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The reissue of the canceled 
carriers may be indicated by--
    (i) Showing the square reference mark or substitute with the 
revision number of the page from which the carriers' names are being 
reissued; and
    (ii) Publishing under the explanation of reference marks in the 
tariff, the following or similar note:

    Reissued without change from the issue of the same page bearing the 
revision number [enclosed within the square]. To determine the original 
effective date see that revised page.

    (4) If the effective date shown for a provision in the prior 
supplement or looseleaf page being canceled is a date later than the 
general effective date of the new supplement or looseleaf page in which 
the provision is being reissued, the number in a square reference mark 
or substitute may not be used. The reference to the prior supplement or 
looseleaf page and the later effective date shall be stated in full 
directly with the reissued provision.
    (h) Change in the explanation of reference marks and notes. (This 
paragraph does not apply to the explanation of the reference marks used 
in referring to an item showing expiration dates.)
    (1) A change in or cancellation of an explanation of a general 
reference marks or general note or of an item or other provision the 
explanation refers to, shall be accompanied by--
    (i) The republication of all provisions which refer to the reference 
mark or note; or
    (ii) The publication, directly with the changed or canceled 
explanation, item or other provision, of a list of each tariff provision 
which refers to the reference mark or note, identifying the provisions 
by item or page number, and supplement number, if any; or
    (iii) The publication, directly with the changed or canceled 
explanation, item or other provision, of a statement generally described 
the effect of the change or cancellation. If this method is used, a 
notation shall be made at the top of the page(s) containing the change 
or cancellation that the page(s) contains a changed or canceled 
reference mark or note, or tariff provision referred to by the mark or 
note.
    (2) If new reference marks are added, they need be explained only in 
the items where they apply rather than amending the original explanation 
of reference marks.
    (3) Two explanation of reference mark provisions may be in effect 
where the second is used to change or add references and the first 
remains unchanged.
    (i) Matter issued under decision or other authority. Amendments 
published under authority of a Commission decision requiring specific 
action or a Commission decision or regulation of this part which permits 
less than statutory notice or departure from outstanding requirements 
shall --
    (1) Refer to the authority and make clear to what tariff it applies;
    (2) State the number of days' notice authorized (if less than 
statutory notice); and
    (3) Briefly identify the relief authorized.

[[Page 323]]

    (j) Conversion supplements to provide general rate changes. (This 
paragraph does not apply to property tariffs of railroads.) Conversion 
supplements are published to convert a substantial portion of the rates 
in a tariff, or the rates in a described category (i.e., commuter fares, 
truckload rates, etc.) to a higher or lower general level, without 
publishing the items or provisions containing the rates.
    (1) The supplement shall show the base rates (i.e., the rates being 
changed) and the new rate.
    (2) The supplement shall contain an application provision reading 
substantially as follows:

    Except as provided in subsequent amendments to this tariff, all 
rates and charges in this tariff, as amended, or as may subsequently be 
amended, are, or will on their effective dates be, [specify whether 
increased or reduced] as follows for the period this supplement is in 
effect.

If there are exceptions to the application, reference to the location of 
the exceptions shall be shown. If not all of the rates are being 
changed, the provisions shall state the exact category of rates being 
changed, or list the items or sections of the tariff which contain them. 
Immediately following the statement, a clear and explicit application of 
each column of changes shall be published.
    (3) The supplement shall provide the method of determining the 
application of the general increase or reduction on combination rates, 
rates made by use of arbitraries, or other multiple-factor rates.
    (4) The supplement shall contain a provision stating the 
mathematical procedure or formula to be used in arriving at the new 
rates when the supplement does not include all the tariff rates and 
charges to be changed. The supplement shall also provide a method of 
disposing of resulting fractions.
    (5) The base rates and new rates shall be stated in the same 
monetary unit as used in the tariff. If the tariff names rates in more 
than one monetary unit, a statement of how the change is to be applied 
to the remainder of the rates shall be published.
    (6) The supplement may not provide for the application of one 
increase or reduction, and then subject the resultant rate to another 
rate increase or reduction.
    (7) Only matter concerning the application of the conversion may be 
published in the supplement.
    (8) The title page shall indicate whether changes are increases and/
or reductions. The different categories of changes shall be 
appropriately referenced.
    (9) Only one conversion supplement to a tariff may be in effect at 
one time.
    (10) An exception item or note may be republished from the 
conversion supplement into a regular supplement of a bound tariff in 
order to add, eliminate or change provisions. If exceptions are 
published in a conversion supplement to a looseleaf tariff, they may not 
be amended. The exceptions, however, may be published in the tariff 
proper (provided the conversion supplement makes proper reference) and 
then amended in the regular manner.
    (11) Amendments containing rates or charges becoming effective 
during the effectiveness of a conversion supplement shall state whether 
or not they are subject to the provisions of the conversion supplement 
or the application item, identifying the supplement or item.
    (12) Part of the same general adjustment may be effected by specific 
publication of the rates in a companion supplement or looseleaf page 
amendment, provided--
    (i) The issue and effective dates are the same as the conversion 
supplement; and
    (ii) They are not made subject to the conversion supplement 
provisions.
    (13) Conversion supplements and companion amendments are exempt from 
the supplemental volume provisions of Sec. 1312.18.
    (14) The provisions of this paragraph do not authorize the 
publication and filing of master tariffs or connecting link supplements, 
and conversion supplements may not be filed to tariffs which refer to a 
master tariff for the application of increases or reductions. Special 
tariff authority must be obtained for publication of master tariffs or 
connecting-link supplements.
    (k) Rail cost recovery increases. (1) Rail carriers or their agents 
may publish cost recovery tariffs in master tariff

[[Page 324]]

format to provide increases in rail rates and charges as authorized by 
the Commission under Ex Parte No. 290 (Sub-No. 2), Railroad Cost 
Recovery Procedures. The increases may apply to joint rates and single-
line traffic to the extent adopted by individual carriers. A connecting-
link, blanket, other supplement or general tariff item shall connect the 
affected tariffs to the master tariffs. Annual, accumulated master 
tariffs may be published to expire no later than September 30 of the 
second calendar year following the year in which the tariff became 
effective, by which date all increases shall be transferred to the base 
tariffs. Extension of any expiration dates may, however, be requested. 
The terms of Sec. 1312.18 as to supplemental volume are waived. Blanket 
supplements shall conform to the terms of Sec. 1312.18(h).
    (2) Tariffs containing adjustments under the provisions of this rule 
may be filed to become effective on not less than ten days' notice when 
the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor adopted by the Commission does not 
differ from that proposed by the Association of American Railroads. When 
the Rail Cost Adjustment Factor adopted by the Commission differs from 
that proposed by the Association of American Railroads the notice period 
shall be not less than five days. Reductions to rates published in the 
initial RCCR tariff may be published on one day's notice during the 
period between the publication of the tariff and the first day of the 
calendar quarter for which that tariff applies.
    (3) All cost recovery tariffs filed with the Commission shall state 
that they are being in conformity with the rules in 49 CFR 1135.1 and 
1312.17, and shall be amended under the same timetable applicable to 
cost recovery rate increases, to reflect declines in the cost index. Any 
declines in the index below the level in effect on December 31, 1985, 
will be addressed by postponing authorizations for future cost recovery 
rate increases pursuant to a ``banking'' procedure described more fully 
in Ex Parte No. 290 (Sub-no. 2), Railroad Cost Recovery Procedures, 
served October 17, 1986.
    (l) Supplements to transfer rate changes from master tariffs or 
conversion or percentage supplements into base rates. (1) A supplement 
(not a conversion supplement) may be filed to a bound tariff for the 
purpose of incorporating in the base rates all applicable changes 
effected by the use of a conversion or percentage supplement or a master 
tariff. The supplement may contain matter from prior supplements 
provided those supplements are canceled.
    (2) The title pages of supplements issued under authority of this 
paragraph shall bear an explanation note citing this paragraph.
    (3) If different increases or reductions apply on related articles 
shown in an item or descriptive listing of commodities, the rates may be 
brought forward into the supplement on the basis of the increases or 
reductions applying to the predominant article in the item or 
description, provided a statement is included in the supplement that 
this has been done. The rate changes shall be appropriately referenced 
except as specified in paragraph (l)(4) of this section for exceptions 
concerning symbolization.
    (4) Symbolization of the increases and reductions resulting from the 
normal rounding-off of fractions or from the use of predominant article 
authority may be omitted in the supplement, providing the supplement is 
filed on not less than 45 days' notice and the title page of the 
supplement also bears the following or a similar statement:

    This supplement contains changed bases of rates, charges and 
provisions which result in increases and reductions. The supplement also 
contains variations in wording which result in no change in the rates 
and charges. These changes are not shown by the use of uniform symbols 
which have been omitted under authority of 49 CFR 1312.17.

    (5) Supplements issued under authority of this paragraph shall be 
exempt from the provisions of Sec. 1312.18 governing the volume of 
supplemental matter permissible.

tariff. General rules, in addition to rules applicable to tariffs as a 
whole, are provided below. In addition, certain ``special supplements'' 
are authorized, viz:

Suspension supplements, Sec. 1312.21.
Postponing supplements, see Sec. 1312.39.
Bridge supplements, see paragraph (f) of this section.
Blanket supplements, see paragraph (g) of this section.

General increase or reduction supplements, see Sec. 1312.17 (j) and (k) 
and paragraph (h) of this section.
Cancellation supplements, see Sec. 1312.19.

    (b) Designation and title page requirements. (1) Supplements to a 
tariff shall be consecutively numbered:
    (2) If a supplement is rejected, its number may not be used again, 
and a supplement issued in its place shall bear the following notation 
with the supplement designation:

    Issued in place of Supplement ----, rejected by the Commission.

    (3) With the supplement identification, the publications the 
supplement cancels shall be shown, as follows:

    Cancels Supplement(s) ----.

    (4) The title page shall list all prior supplements still in effect 
on the effective date of the supplement, with any special supplements so 
indicated.
    (5) A supplement may contain matter having different effective dates 
provided it is clearly explained on the title page.
    (c) Reference marks. Reference may be made to an item or section in 
the original tariff containing the explanations. See Sec. 1312.17 
governing partial amendment of reference marks.
    (d) Updated list of items and units in effective supplements. 
Supplements shall, as necessary, contain cumulative lists of items and 
numbered segments that have been added, changed or canceled by 
supplement (including partial amendments or ``script-clause'' 
amendments), together with reference to the latest supplement in which 
each is published.
    (e) Number of supplements, pages permitted and duration of tariffs. 
(1) Except as otherwise provided, the total number of pages of effective 
regular supplements may not exceed 70 percent of the number of original 
pages. There is no separate limit on the number of supplements.
    (2) The restriction on the number of supplemental pages does not 
apply to a tariff which is reissued within two years, provided the 
following notation is shown on the title page of the original tariff:

    ``A reissue of this tariff will become effective no later than ----
----.''

The date of the next reissue shall be shown, and the notation may not be 
changed or cancelled.
    (3) A supplement may exceed the limitation of paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section if it is to comply with a Commission order and contains no 
other matter.
    (f) Bridge supplements. More than one bridge supplement (a 
publication amending both a bound tariff and its reissue), may be in 
effect at one time provided the contents are separated as to each tariff 
and clearly identified as to the tariff being amended showing the item 
or other segment of each tariff that is being added, changed or 
canceled. The limitations of paragraph (e)(1) of this section do not 
apply.
    (g) Blanket Supplements. A blanket supplement (a common supplement 
issued jointly to two or more tariffs of the same carrier or agent) may 
be filed if, in addition to compliance with other rules--
    (1) The number of copies ordinarily required for each tariff 
supplement is filed; and
    (2) The supplement contains, under a heading ``List Of Tariffs 
Supplemented Hereby'', the number of each supplement and ICC designation 
of each tariff being supplemented. Any additional provisions (such as 
cancellation notices, items containing matter held in effect, etc.) 
shall be similarly shown.
    (h) Percentage supplements to provide general rate changes. (1) A 
supplement, which expresses the amount of change as a percentage by 
which the tariff's rates and charges are to be increased or reduced, may 
be filed to any tariff to provide a general change in the level of all 
or substantially all rates and charges, or all or substantially all the 
rates and charges in a specific category in the tariff.

[[Page 326]]

    (2) The supplement shall clearly explain its application and shall 
state where any exceptions to its application are listed. It shall show 
how to compute the increased or reduced rates from the percentages 
shown; how to dispose of fractions; how to compute multiple-factor rates 
made by the use of arbitraries or other means. Only matter concerning 
the percentage change may be published in the supplement.
    (3) The title page of a percentage supplement shall describe the 
nature of the changes effected by the supplement. Only one percentage 
supplement may be in effect at one time and shall be subject to a two-
year expiration date which shall be shown on the supplement's title 
page. Tariff amendments containing rates or charges becoming effective 
during the effectiveness of a percentage supplement shall state whether 
they are subject to the provisions of the percentage supplement.

Sec. 1312.19  Cancellation of tariff and transfer of provisions.

    (a) Cancellation of an entire tariff. (1) Except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(4) of this section, a tariff shall be canceled by issuing 
a supplement. The supplement shall--
    (i) State on its title page that it cancels the tariff;
    (ii) Refer by ICC designation to the tariff(s), if any, which 
applies in place of the canceled provisions; and
    (iii) Identify provisions being transferred (not discontinued) and 
the tariffs to which they are being transferred.
    (2) Tariff publications to which a transfer is made shall so 
indicate.
    (3) If, in connection with transfer of provisions, a carrier is 
being added as a participant in an agent's tariff, carrier's name and 
alpha code must be added to the list of participating carriers.
    (4) When the provisions of a tariff are to be transferred to a new 
tariff only, issued by the same carrier or agent(s), the cancellation 
shall be made by the new tariff by showing on its title page, or within 
(as provided in Sec. 1312.12(b)), that it cancels the prior issue. If 
some of the provisions of the prior issue are being discontinued, the 
new tariff shall indicate the tariff(s) containing provisions, if any, 
which will apply in the place of the prior issue.
    (b) Cancellation of part of a tariff. Cancellation of a part of a 
tariff shall be made by publishing amendments in the regular manner, or 
by a statement in a special supplement, if--
    (1) The statement identifies the canceled material (by item, 
section, page, etc.);
    (2) Matter being transferred to another tariff(s) is identified and 
the tariff(s) to which it is transferred is identified;
    (3) Reference is made to the tariff(s) (if any) which will apply in 
place of the discontinued matter;
    (4) Tariff publications to which matter is being transferred 
indicate the tariff which formerly contained the matter; and
    (5) The effective date of the cancelling supplement and the 
publication(s) effecting any transfer is the same. The special 
supplement shall remain in effect for the life of the tariff, or, in the 
case of looseleaf tariffs, when all the affected pages have been 
reissued (the reissued pages shall refer to the special supplement for 
the initial cancellation of the involved provisions). The special 
supplement to a bound tariff may contain cancellations in the regular 
manner and is exempt from the supplemental limitations in this part. In 
a bound tariff, a reissue of an item or segment affected by the 
statement form of cancellation shall specifically cancel the prior item 
or segment and make reference to the special supplement for the initial 
cancellation.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.20  Transfer of operations--change in name and control.

    (a) General. (1) As used in this section--
    (i) Old carrier refers to the carrier or party whose name is changed 
or whose operating authority is transferred;
    (ii) New carrier refers to the new name of the old carrier or to the 
party to which the operating authority is transferred; and
    (iii) Adoption publications refers to adoption notices, and 
combination

[[Page 327]]

adoption notices and adoption supplements.
    (2) When a carrier's name is lawfully changed or its operating 
authority transferred, tariff adjustments must be made. The procedure to 
be followed depends on the particular circumstances.
    (b) Purpose of adoption notices. (1) Adoption notices shall be filed 
to reflect new ownership or control when--
    (i) A carrier's name is lawfully changed;
    (ii) A carrier's operating authority is transferred, entirely or 
partially; or
    (iii) A fiduciary (receiver, trustee, etc.) assumes possession and 
control of a carrier's property; and when the carrier wishes (for 
whatever period) to use the old carrier's tariffs.
    (2) In addition to the adoption notice, an adoption supplement shall 
be filed to reflect the new carrier's adoption of the old carrier's 
tariff(s).
    (c) When adoption notice only is required. The new carrier shall 
file an adoption notice, in its own name and in tariff form, if the old 
carrier has no effective tariffs of its own (or predecessor's) issue to 
be adopted, but does have rates or other provisions in an agent's or 
another carrier's tariff(s) to be adopted.
    (d) Form of adoption notice. (1) The adoption notice shall be 
prepared substantially as follows (names and numbers used for 
illustration only):

ICC JDTI 100

John Doe Transport, Inc., Adoption Notice [identify what is adopted and 
from whom]

    Issued: [show date prepared]
    Effective: [show date]
    Issued by [identify publisher and address].

    (e) Combination adoption notice and adoption supplement. If the old 
carrier has one or more effective tariffs (not adoption notices) of its 
own (or predecessor's) issue, the new carrier shall file, in its own 
name and in tariff form, a combination publication which shall serve as 
both its adoption notice and adoption supplement (see paragraph (o) of 
this section when new carrier amends old carrier's tariff in part). The 
publication shall be prepared as provided in paragraph (f) of this 
section. Two copies of the publication (serving as an adoption notice 
tariff) plus two additional copies for each tariff supplemented shall be 
filed.
    (f) Form of combination adoption notice and adoption supplement. (1) 
If filing of a combination adoption notice and adoption supplement is 
required under paragraph (e) of this section, and the old carrier's 
authority is adopted entirely, the combination publication shall be 
prepared as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, except--
    (i) The upper right corner shall identify the publication as the new 
carrier's adoption notice and also as an adoption supplement to each of 
the old carrier's tariff(s) involved.

[Example:
Adoption Notice Tariff......................................ICC JDTI 100
Adoption Supplement 8 to...................................ICC ABCD 200*

    *Show transferor's name]; and

    (ii) The combination publication shall contain a second paragraph 
prepared substantially as follows:

    On the effective date shown below, each tariff supplemented by this 
publication became the tariff of John Doe Transport, Inc., as stated in 
its adoption notice shown above.

    (2) If filing of a combination adoption notice and adoption 
supplement is required under paragraph (e) of this section, and the old 
carrier's authority is adopted partially, the combination publication 
shall be prepared as shown in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, with the 
necessary changes to reflect partial adoption.
    (3) Adoption supplements shall be assigned the next unused 
supplement number to the tariff supplemented. If the tariff is adopted 
partially, the old carrier shall reserve two supplement numbers for each 
new carrier, to be used for adoption and cancellation supplements (see 
paragraph (o) of this section for reservation of supplement numbers).
    (g) ICC designation to be used. The ICC designation assigned to 
adoption notices shall be in the new carrier's series, except that 
adoption notices filed by a fiduciary shall be in the old carrier's 
series and the designation shall be identified by naming the old carrier 
followed by ``series.'' If no code has been assigned, a ``blank code 
such as ``MF-A1000'' may be used.
    (h) Effective date of adoption publications. (1) The effective date 
of adoption publications is the date of consummation of the transaction 
for which such

[[Page 328]]

publications are required. Adoption publications shall be filed promptly 
and, if possible, prior to their effective date, but in no case later 
than 60 days thereafter.
    (2) Each agent or carrier to whom the old carrier issued a 
concurrence or power of attorney being adopted shall be furnished a copy 
of the adoption publication.
    (3) If the transfer of operating authority to the new carrier 
requires approval by the Commission, the effective date of the 
publication may not be prior to the effective date of the approval.
    (i) When name of old carrier need not be shown. If a carrier re-
adopts tariffs of its own issue, which had been adopted by another 
party, it need not identify those tariffs as being in its own series.
    (j) Temporary control. (1) If a party's authority to assume 
operating control of a carrier under section 11349 of the Act is not 
made permanent, the old carrier shall reassume operating control by 
filing an adoption notice.
    (2) The effective date of the adoption publication is the date the 
other party's authority to assume operating control of the carrier 
expires or is vacated.
    (k) Fiduciaries. (1) When a fiduciary assumes possession or 
operating control of a carrier, tariff publications and other 
instruments shall show the name of the carrier, followed by the name and 
capacity of the fiduciary. (Also see 49 CFR 1181.5--Operations by 
fiduciaries.)
    (2) Upon termination of the fiduciary's possession or control, the 
party assuming control of the carrier's property shall comply with the 
regulations in this section.
    (l) Concurrences and powers of attorney. If the old carrier's 
operating authority is adopted entirely, its effective concurrences and 
powers of attorney become those of the new carrier and remain effective 
until canceled, revoked, or replaced by the new carrier.
    (m) Tariffs issued by other carriers or by agents. (1) If the old 
carrier is listed in a participating carrier tariff, the participating 
carrier tariff shall be amended as provided in Sec. 1312.25.
    (2) If tariff provisions contained in a tariff not issued in the old 
carrier's name need to be adopted, and the tariff contains its own list 
of participating carriers, the tariff shall be amended on lawful notice 
to reflect the adoption, in the manner required by paragraphs (m)(3) and 
(4) of this section.
    (3) If adopted entirely, the old carrier's name shall be brought 
forward and its participation canceled. Directly with the cancellation 
shall be reference to a statement substantially as follows:

    [New carrier's name] by its adoption notice [ICC designation] which 
became effective on [date], is substituted for [old carrier's name] 
wherever it appears in this tariff.

    (4) If adopted partially, the old carrier's name may be canceled 
only if there are no provisions remaining in the tariff for its account. 
If not already shown as a participant, the new carrier shall be added. 
Directly with the old carrier's name (or cancellation of its 
participation) shall be reference to a statement substantially as 
follows:

    [New carrier's name] by its adoption notice [ICC designation] which 
became effective on [date], to the extent that they contain rates or 
other provisions applying [describe the authority transferred], is 
substituted for [old carrier's name] wherever it appears in this tariff.

    (n) Cancellation of provisions in partially adopted tariffs. (1) 
Rates or other provisions in a tariff in the old carrier's name, which 
apply locally and are involved in the partial transfer of authority to a 
new carrier, shall be canceled and published in tariffs of the new 
carrier's (or its agent's) issue.
    (2) Items, units, or looseleaf pages may not be reissued to effect 
the cancellation. Instead, the cancellation shall be made by a statement 
substantially as follows:

    Provisions formerly shown in [identify provisions by item number, 
segment, page, section, table, etc.] which were adopted by [new 
carrier's name] are canceled. Apply provisions in [identify provisions 
by item number, segment, page, section, table, etc.] of [issuing 
carrier's or agent's name and ICC designation of tariff].

    (3) The cancellation statement shall be published in a special 
supplement to

[[Page 329]]

the tariff, whether bound or looseleaf, which--
    (i) Shall be filed on lawful notice within 120 days of the adoption 
publication's effective date;
    (ii) Is exempt from limitations on volume of supplemental matter 
imposed by this part;
    (iii) Shall become effective concurrently with the establishment of 
corresponding provisions for the new carrier's account; and
    (iv) Shall remain in effect for the life of the tariff.
    (4) Rates and other provisions covering the adopted authority shall 
be filed on lawful notice in the new tariff(s) to become effective 
concurrently with the cancellation of the corresponding provisions from 
the old carrier's tariffs.
    (o) Reservation of supplement numbers for new carrier's use. Two 
unused supplement numbers shall be reserved for each new carrier's use. 
One of the numbers shall be assigned to the adoption publication and the 
other to the cancellation supplement.
    (p) Subsequent supplements or looseleaf pages. (1) Subsequent 
supplements or looseleaf pages to adopted tariffs issued by the old 
carrier (or its predecessor) shall show the name of the carrier in whose 
ICC designation series the tariff was issued originally, except when the 
old carrier re-adopts its own tariff.
    (2) Subsequent supplements or pages shall be filed by--
    (i) The new carrier if the tariff was adopted entirely; or
    (ii) The old carrier if the tariff was adopted partially, except as 
provided in paragraph (n) of this section.
    (q) Describe former tariff when canceling. When canceling tariffs 
issued or adopted by the old carrier, the new carrier shall identify the 
tariffs in the cancellation notice by--
    (1) ICC designation;
    (2) Issuing carrier's name; and
    (3) Reference to the series in which the tariff was published, if 
the old carrier published tariffs in more than one series.
    (r) Adoption supplements are noncounting. Adoption supplements are 
exempt from the limitations on volume of supplemental matter as 
contained in Sec. 1312.18.

Sec. 1312.21  Suspended matter.

    (a) Effect of suspension. When the Commission suspends one or more 
rate(s), provision(s) or publication(s), that suspended matter is 
postponed until the suspension period runs out.
    (b) Supplement required. (1) A supplement announcing the suspension 
shall be filed to the involved tariff(s). Two methods of publishing may 
be used. One is to issue a separate supplement for each suspension 
proceeding; the other is to issue a consolidated suspension supplement 
which contains notices of all suspension proceedings involving the 
tariff. Only one consolidated supplement to a tariff may be in effect at 
one time. The title page of either type of supplement shall--
    (i) Identify the Commission's suspension docket number;
    (2) Show an issue date but not an effective date; and
    (3) Comply with the requirements governing tariff amendments, except 
as otherwise provided in this section.
    (c) Content of supplement. The supplement shall:
    (1) Identify the rates, provisions or publications which have been 
suspended;
    (2) State that those rates, provisions or publications are ``under 
suspension and may not be used until [here show either the date to which 
the matter has been suspended, or a later date, or state ``this 
suspension notice is canceled'']'';
    (3) Identify the rates, provisions or publications that will apply 
in place of the suspended matter;
    (4) Correct by statement any cancellations which would have the 
effect of canceling the suspended matter or the matter held in force; 
and
    (5) Correct the listing of effective supplements on previous 
supplements' title pages.
    (d) Additional requirements for consolidated supplements. (1) The 
consolidated supplement shall provide information for each suspension 
proceeding.

[[Page 330]]

    (2) The matter shall be amended and reissued in the regular manner, 
except as follows:
    (i) If it is necessary to issue a publication to reflect changes in 
a corrected decision of the Commission, the supplement shall be reissued 
and explained with the appropriate changes made.
    (ii) If the suspended matter is made effective, canceled, or 
reissued the involved matter shall be canceled (in the regular manner) 
in the same supplement as the change or reissue of the suspended matter.
    (iii) If the suspended matter becomes effective because of the 
expiration of the suspension or postponement period, the explanatory 
matter shall be canceled (in the regular manner) in the next regular 
supplement to the tariff.
    (e) Additional requirements for separate suspension supplements. (1) 
Separate supplements announcing individual suspensions to a bound tariff 
shall be canceled by the--
    (i) Supplement containing the change or reissue of the suspended 
matter; or
    (ii) By the next regular supplement if the suspended matter becomes 
effective because of the expiration of the suspension of postponement 
period.
    (2) Separate supplements announcing individual suspensions to a 
looseleaf tariff shall be canceled by reissuing the check sheet with an 
effective date concurrent with the change or reissue.
    (3) Suspension information may not be canceled in full unless all of 
the involved matter under suspension is canceled, becomes effective or 
is reissued.
    (f) Extension of suspension period. If the Commission extends the 
suspension period, the suspension notice shall be republished, canceling 
the first notice, and the statements adapted to the new action taken, 
with reference to the facts of the first suspension. Subsequent handling 
of the matter shall proceed as prescribed for suspension matters in this 
section.
    (g) Suspended matter reissued prior to notice. If suspended matter 
has been reissued prior to the filing of the explanatory notice, the 
notice shall cancel (by statement) the reissued matter. The cancellation 
statement shall have the same effective date as the reissued matter.
    (h) Changed suspended matter. If suspended matter has been changed 
prior to the filing of a suspension notice, the matter shall be 
republished in the regular manner to remove any violation of the 
suspension decision, as provided in paragraph (i) of this section. Also 
see paragraph (k) of this section.
    (i) Reissuing suspended matter after notice. (1) If a suspension 
notice has been filed, the matter under suspension and the matter held 
in force by reason of the suspension may be reissued (without change) in 
the regular manner provided the explanatory notice is brought forward 
from the suspension supplement.
    (2) If suspended matter or matter held in force is reissued, the 
publication shall be made in a manner that insures that if the 
suspension or postponement period ends, the matter held in force is 
canceled or superseded by the effectiveness of the suspended matter.
    (3) Original tariffs or supplements containing reissued suspended 
matter shall identify the suspended matter.
    (j) Postponement of suspended matter. (1) A postponement notice may 
be filed at any time on 1 day's notice during the suspension period, 
provided--
    (i) It becomes effective prior to the end of the suspension period;
    (ii) It states that the postponed matter may not be used during the 
postponement period; and
    (iii) The specific date to which the matter is postponed is shown, 
or the statement ``postponed until this notice is canceled'', is shown.
    (2) Suspended matter postponed to a specific date may be further 
postponed if done prior to the end of the previous postponement period, 
and the previous notice is canceled.
    (3) The postponement notice may be canceled at any time after the 
end of the suspension period.
    (k) Changes and cancellation during the suspension period. Suspended 
matter or matter held in force may be changed or canceled during the 
suspension period, as follows:
    (1) Suspended matter may be canceled in whole or in part on 1 day's 
notice if--

[[Page 331]]

    (i) The cancellation is to become effective prior to the end of the 
suspension (or postponement) period, or the effective date of a final 
decision in the proceeding, whichever is earlier; and
    (ii) At the time of filing, all parties of record and the Office of 
Proceedings, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423, shall 
be notified (with reference to the involved docket number) of the tariff 
publication(s) and its effective date. The notice to the Office of 
Proceedings shall certify that the parties of record have been notified, 
and a copy of that notice (if in writing) shall be sent with the tariff 
publications submitted for official filing.
    (2) When suspended matter is canceled, it may not be republished to 
become effective on less than statutory notice, absent special 
permission.
    (3) The matter held in force shall be republished (without change) 
in the same publication containing, and concurrently with, the 
cancellation of the suspended matter if the matter held in force--
    (i) Is in the same tariff as the suspended matter and was to be 
specifically canceled by it; or
    (ii) Is in a prior issue of the tariff containing the suspended 
matter.
    (4) Cancellation of suspended matter in a bound tariff shall be made 
in a supplement. Cancellation of suspended matter in a looseleaf tariff 
shall be made by looseleaf page amendment, unless the tariff only 
contains the suspended matter, then cancellation shall be made by 
supplement. If a tariff contains only the suspended matter (or if the 
suspended matter is a conversion supplement), the cancellation may be 
made by publishing a notice of cancellation in the supplement, and 
either bringing forward the matter held in force, or referring to its 
location.
    (5) Postponement provisions shall be canceled concurrently with, and 
on the same notice as, the cancellation of the suspended matter. The 
postponement provisions shall be canceled in the same supplement as the 
cancellation of the suspended matter, or, if cancellation of the 
suspended matter is by looseleaf page amendment, by the check sheet.
    (l) Commission vacates suspension or finds suspended matter 
justified. (1) If the Commission vacates a suspension or finds the 
matter justified, the suspended matter may be made effective on 1 day's 
notice, but not earlier than the effective date of the Commission's 
decision.
    (2) Suspended matter in a bound tariff, or nonreissued suspended 
matter in a looseleaf tariff, may only be made effective by publishing a 
notice in a supplement to the tariff. Reissued suspended matter in a 
looseleaf tariff may only be made effective by publishing a notice on a 
reissue of the involved page(s). The notice shall identify the suspended 
matter, state the effective date, and cancel any postponement notice. If 
the suspended matter was to specifically cancel the matter held in force 
in the same tariff, or the matter held in force was to have expired, the 
matter held in force shall be specifically canceled with the same 
effective date and on the same notice.
    (3) If a new tariff had provided for cancellation of another tariff, 
but that cancellation was nullified because of the suspension, the other 
tariff shall be canceled by a statement in a supplement to the new 
tariff. Otherwise, if a tariff contains only matter held in force by the 
suspension and the matter is required to be canceled, the cancellation 
of the tariff shall be made by supplement to that tariff.
    (4) Changes or additions to a tariff containing matter held in force 
because of the entire suspension of another tariff may be brought 
forward without change into the other tariff. The publication shall be 
by supplement to a bound tariff and by looseleaf page amendment to a 
looseleaf tariff. If this is done, the tariff containing the matter held 
in force shall be concurrently canceled by supplement.
    (m) Suspended matter ordered canceled. If suspended matter is 
ordered canceled, the cancellation may be made on 1 day's notice, unless 
otherwise ordered.
    (n) Tariff amendments required or permitted to be filed and matter 
held in force under the authority of this section are, for the life of 
the tariff, exempt from the provisions of this part pertaining to the 
volume of effective

[[Page 332]]

supplements or looseleaf page amendments.
    (o) Reference to Commission suspension decisions. Publications 
issued under authority of this section shall refer to this section and 
to the investigation and suspension docket number.
    (p) Court orders. Restraining orders, injunctions, enjoinders, or 
other court orders having the effect of suspending the operation of 
tariff provisions shall, to the extent possible, be reflected in tariffs 
in the same manner as suspension decisions.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.22  Rates or other provisions prescribed by the Commission.

    If the Commission requires publication of certain rates or 
provisions, a carrier or agent shall--
    (a) Publish the rate or provisions on statutory notice, unless 
otherwise specifically authorized, with reference in the tariff 
publication to the decision in the manner required by this part;
    (b) Notify the Commission when the decision has been complied with, 
referring to the docket number of the decision (the volume and page 
number of any printed Commission reports shall also be shown); and
    (c) Identify, in the notice of compliance, the item, page, 
supplement and tariff where the complying provisions are published.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.23  Expiration dates.

    (a) How and where expiration dates are to be shown. (1) An original 
tariff or a supplement may be shown to expire by placing the following 
on the title page: ``This tariff [supplement] expires with [here show 
date] unless sooner canceled, changed, or extended.''
    (2) An expiration date of an original tariff or a prior supplement 
may be added or changed in a supplement by providing an explanatory 
statement on the title page. If the supplement is reissued, the amended 
or added expiration date statement shall be reissued in the regular 
manner.
    (3) An item or other part of a tariff may be shown to expire by 
publishing the following statement within the item: ``Expires [here show 
date].''
    (4) Matter may also be shown to expire by referencing it with a 
reference mark which shall be explained as ``Subject to the expiration 
date shown in item [here show expiration date item number].'' The 
expiration date item, reserved for this purpose only, shall identify the 
matter referred to and show the expiration dates.
    (b) Extension of expiration dates. An expiration date may be 
canceled or extended to a later date. However, the extension may not be 
made effective after the expiration date. Also see Sec. 1312.39.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.24  Tariffs listing carriers' operating authority applicable to motor carriers of property.

    (a) A separate tariff containing a description of carriers' 
operating authorities (a ``scope'' tariff) may be filed. A ``scope 
tariff shall contain a statement explaining that the application of 
rates and provisions in tariffs governed by it is limited to the extent 
of the carrier's operating authority published in the ``scope'' tariff.
    (b) A description of the carrier's operating authority may not be 
used as a substitute for describing commodities or territories for rate 
application.
    (c) If rate tariffs are governed by more than one scope tariff, each 
scope tariff shall be referred to in the rate tariff as a governing 
publication.
    (d) A scope tariff may be combined with a participating carrier 
tariff, a rate basis tariff, and/or a rules tariff.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.25  Participating carrier tariffs.

    (a) Separate tariffs may be filed by agents. (1) An alphabetical 
list of carriers participating in agent's tariffs, along with a 
description of the underlying tariffs, may be filed in a separate tariff 
(not a rate tariff). The title page of the participating carrier tariff 
shall state that it applies only in connection with tariffs referring to 
it. If the tariff governs tariffs issued jointly by two or more agents, 
it shall be a joint issue (see Sec. 1312.11).
    (2) Except for statements explaining the extent of carriers' 
participation in governed tariffs (for example, only for local hauls or 
only for joint hauls) the tariff may not contain provisions governing 
rate application.
    (b) List of carriers. (1) The list of participating carriers shall 
be constructed in the manner required by this part.

[[Page 333]]

Carriers' code designations may be shown directly with the carriers' 
names.
    (2) All governed tariffs in which a carrier participates shall be 
referred to by ICC designation directly with the carrier's name. The 
participation of all carriers in the participating carrier tariff may be 
provided by a statement, rather than listing the tariff designation 
directly with the carriers' name.
    (c) List of tariffs. An agent's participating carrier tariff shall 
contain a current and correct list of its tariffs, including those which 
contain their own list of participating carriers or which are issued 
jointly with another agent(s). If the participating carrier tariff is a 
joint issue, only the tariffs of the principal agent need be listed. The 
tariffs shall be listed in numerical order by ICC designation, with a 
separate section for each agent if joint issues are involved. Each 
tariff listed shall be described so that its general application may be 
determined without examining the tariff itself.
    (d) Cancellation of participating carriers. (1) Except as provided 
in paragraph (f) of this section, when a carrier's participation in a 
participating carrier tariff or governed tariff is canceled, all 
reference to the carrier in the involved tariff(s) shall be canceled.
    (2) The cancellation may be accomplished either by--
    (i) Amending all matter to eliminate reference to the carrier; or
    (ii) Publishing a blanket cancellation notice.
    The blanket cancellation shall be published in the participating 
carrier tariff and shall be referred to in the cancellation of the 
carrier's name. A provision referring to the canceled carrier may not be 
republished without concurrent cancellation of the reference to that 
carrier and all matter shall be amended as soon as possible.
    (3)(i) In a bound tariff the canceled carrier's name (and reference 
to the blanket cancellation notice, if used) shall be carried forward as 
reissued matter in the list of participating carriers.
    (ii) In a looseleaf tariff, the carrier's name (and reference to the 
blanket cancellation notice, if used) and the date the cancellation 
became effective shall be republished in successive issues of the list 
of participating carriers until all provisions referring to the carrier 
are amended.
    (e) Reinstatement of participating carriers. If a carrier's 
participation is canceled, and reinstated at a later date, the tariff 
shall so explain. This explanation shall be referred to directly with 
the reinstated carrier's name until the participating carrier tariff is 
reissued.
    (f) Adoptions. (1) If a carrier adopts another carrier, wholly or 
partially, the adoption shall be announced and explained in the 
participating carrier tariff. This announcement shall be continued in 
the tariff and reissues until a carrier adopted wholly is no longer 
referred to in any provision of the governed tariffs, and until a 
carrier adopted partially is no longer referred to in those provisions 
in the governed tariff affected by the partial adoption.
    (2) The name of a wholly adopted carrier shall be canceled from the 
list of participating carriers. The name of a partially adopted carrier 
may not be canceled from the list of participating carriers unless its 
remaining rates and provisions are not published in the agent's 
tariff(s). Reference to the adoption and the cancellation shall be 
continued until the participating carrier tariff is reissued.
    (g) Participating carrier tariff may include other provisions. 
Provisions authorized to be published in a routing guide, points of 
service, and/or a ``scope'' tariff, may be published in a participating 
carrier tariff provided application of each category is clear.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.26  Rate basis tariffs.

    (a) Separate tariffs may be filed. Rate groups or rate bases for 
determination of rates between points named in the rate tariff may be 
filed in a separate tariff. The tariff may contain routing and operating 
authority provisions, waybilling instructions and divisions. No tariff 
may be governed by more than two rate group or rate basis tariffs, one 
for origin points and one for destination points.
    (b) Points and rate group or basis to be listed. Railroad basing 
tariffs may list the location of each station or refer by ICC 
designation to a station list tariff.

[[Page 334]]

Directly with each point listed shall be published either its assigned 
rate group or reference to an item providing that information. 
Exceptions to the rate group may be published.
    (c) Arbitraries or differentials. Amounts to be added to 
(arbitraries) or subtracted from (differentials) base rates may be 
published either directly with each point or in an item referred to 
directly with each point. Provisions governing arbitraries or 
differentials which differ from those governing the base rates shall be 
referred to directly with the arbitraries or differentials (see 
Sec. 1312.14).


<R05>
Sec. 1312.27  Classification, exceptions, rules, dangerous articles and station list tariffs.

    (a) Classification. (1) A classification of commodities may be 
published as a separate tariff. The classification shall list the 
various commodities and assigned class of each. Whatever organization is 
used within the tariff shall be clear.
    (2) Rules having general application may be published in a 
classification. The rules shall precede the itemized list of articles.
    (3) The classification shall, if applicable, include a statement 
that exception exist and take precedence.
    (b) Exceptions tariffs. (1) Exceptions to the classification 
provisions may be published in a separate tariff.
    (2) Exceptions tariffs shall be published as required by the rules 
governing tariff content generally. The title page shall contain the 
following statement:

    This tariff applies only in connection with tariffs referring to it 
by ICC designation.

    (c) Rules tariffs. Governing provisions may be published in a 
separate tariff or tariffs provided the application and any exceptions 
are clearly explained.
    (d) Dangerous articles tariffs. The Department of Transportation's 
regulations governing the acceptance and transportation of dangerous 
articles and hazardous materials may be reproduced and filed in a 
separate tariff.
    (e) Participation in governing publications. Carriers participating 
in tariffs which refer to, and are governed by, separate tariffs 
(classifications, exceptions, rules etc.), shall also participate in 
those governing separate tariffs, unless specifically stated in the 
governed tariffs that provisions in the separate tariffs will not apply 
for their account. This does not require participation in local drayage 
tariffs or in terminal and special services tariffs applicable only for 
the issuing carrier. Carriers participating in a rate tariff solely to 
provide substituted service at another carrier's option need not 
participate in the governing tariffs. See Sec. 1312.38.
    (f) List of stations showing facilities, additions and abandonments. 
(1) A tariff publication may be filed containing a list of stations with 
the railroad location of each, alphabetically and geographically 
arranged with index numbers, prepay requirements, station facilities, 
additions of stations, abandonments of stations, changes in names of 
stations, and restrictions as to acceptance and delivery of freight. No 
rates or charges and no matter that will in any way increase or decrease 
the rate or charge in tariffs making reference to this publication may 
be shown. Changes in the tariff may be made on not less than 1 day's 
notice, except that announcement of the restrictions as to the 
acceptance or delivery of freight shall be made effective on not less 
than statutory notice.
    (2) Changes made on less than statutory notice under the authority 
of this paragraph shall state that they are so made.
    (3) Rate tariffs that are to be governed by the separate tariff 
publication shall so state, and their application clearly explained.
    (4) When a station has been abandoned as of a date specified in the 
tariff authorized by this section, the rates from or to the station are 
inapplicable and shall be eliminated in the next amendment of the rate 
tariffs. When the elimination is made by supplement, the following 
notation shall be used:

    Eliminate -------- station abandoned. For effective date see [the 
governing tariff issued under this rule].

This notation must be continued in connection with the name of the 
station as long as the tariff remains effective, and indicated as a 
reissue from the supplement in which it was first

[[Page 335]]

published, but without stating the effective date of the supplement.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.28  Accessorial, terminal and other services.

    (a) General rules. Carriers or their agents shall publish and file 
with the Commission all rules and charges governing accessorial 
services, terminal services, allowances, absorptions, and other 
practices or privileges. The rules shall be published in clear terms, 
and the rate, if any, shall be stated separately. The amount of the 
charges shall be included or be readily ascertainable if the carrier is 
acting as collection agent for a third party or is advancing payment, 
e.g., as for tolls, ferry charges, and special permits.
    (b) Method of publication. (1) Rules and charges referred to in 
paragraph (a) of this section may be published either in--
    (i) The line-haul rate tariff;
    (ii) Separate tariffs which are referred to in the rate tariff by 
specific ICC designation; or
    (iii) Separate tariffs combined with a clause in the rate tariff 
which identifies the services offered in connection with the rate and 
indicates that other tariffs of the carrier contain the application 
charges.
    (2) A rate tariff issued in a carrier's name may refer to their 
agent's terminal services tariffs as well as its own, provided 
application of the various tariffs is clear.
    (c) Pickup and delivery service. (1) All carriers of property shall, 
as appropriate, specify whether rates include pickup and delivery and, 
if so, the relevant geographic area, and governing conditions.
    (2) If pickup and delivery service is performed beyond the limits of 
the point at which the rate applies, the larger area shall be described 
in the rate tariff.
    (d) Switching charges. (This paragraph applies only for railroads.) 
(1) Carriers performing switching service on interstate shipments shall 
file a tariff or tariffs containing their charges for that service. The 
switching tariff shall name the stations, warehouses, teams or 
industrial tracks, or other points at which shipments will be received 
or delivered within the switching limits, or shall otherwise clearly 
define the switching limits. Charges may be published in more than one 
tariff, provided application of each is clear. The tariff shall explain 
the amount to be paid by the shipper and the amount to be absorbed, as 
applicable.
    (2) Absorption provisions shall be published in a rate, switching or 
absorption tariff of the line haul carrier and all provisions on the 
same tariff shall be published only in one tariff, except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
    (3) The carrier whose charges are absorbed and the amount absorbed 
shall be stated. If charges are partially absorbed, the rate tariff 
shall state that the unabsorbed charges will be in addition to the line 
haul charges.
    (4) If absorption provisions are published in a switching or 
absorption tariff, exceptions to those provisions may be published in 
rate tariff. If published, the exception and the general absorption 
provision shall each state that the provisions in the rate tariff are 
exceptions to, and apply in place of the general absorption provisions. 
The exceptions provisions need not name the carrier whose charges are 
absorbed.

<R05>
Sec. 1312.29  Rates and liability based on value provisions.

    Released rate provisions established in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
10730 shall be published in the same tariff as the matter they govern. 
The tariff shall, to the extent required by statute refer specifically 
to an action of the Commission.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.30  Distance rates.

    (a) Distance rates may be filed. Distance or mileage (hereafter 
referred to as distance) class or commodity rates may be filed.
    (b) Method of showing distances. Distance rates may be published to 
apply per vehicle per mile, or other unit per mile, or by establishing a 
rate table or segment showing a scale of distances for which charges 
will be applied. If the latter method is used, a rate shall be provided 
for each distance. Each State or area covered by the application of the 
rates shall be listed. The listing

[[Page 336]]

may be brief but informative as to the territorial coverage.
    (c) Determination of distances. (1) A tariff containing distance 
rates shall contain provisions for the determination of distances by--
    (i) Publishing the distances between all locations covered by the 
distance rates in the tariff;
    (ii) Referring to a map(s) attached to the tariff; or
    (iii) Referring to a distance guide(s).
    (2) If maps are referred to, the rate tariff shall include a rule 
specifying the manner in which distances are obtained from maps. The 
rule shall include a definite means for determining distances between 
all locations within the territorial coverage of the rates, regardless 
of whether or not all the locations are shown on the map and regardless 
of whether or not actual distances are shown between all locations.
    (3) When a map to a tariff is superseded by another, the new map 
shall be attached to and made a part of a supplement to a bound tariff, 
or a looseleaf page to a looseleaf tariff, which shall specifically 
cancel the old map and give effect to the new.
    (4) Except as provided in Sec. 1312.13(e)(2), only distance guides 
officially on file with the Commission may be referred to. More than one 
may be referred to provided the rate tariff clearly specifies the 
circumstances under which each guide will apply. An agent's tariff may 
refer to another agent's distance guide.
    (5) Distance guides shall provide distance tables or combinations of 
tables and maps. Tables shall provide specific distances between a 
substantial number of the points and be shown as having precedence over 
the distances determined by the use of maps. Each guide shall provide 
rules stating its application. The rules shall include a means for 
determining distances between all locations with the territorial 
coverage of the guide, regardless of whether all the locations are shown 
in the guide or whether distances are shown between all locations. If 
distances between certain points or areas are to be determined only 
through a certain gateway or interchange point, those points or areas 
and the gateway or interchange point shall be identified. Distance 
guides filed in ``paper'' format may exceed the maximum size limitations 
imposed by Sec. 1312.3 but may not exceed 14 \1/2\ by 17\1/2\ inches in 
size. Carriers may file automated distance determination systems which 
are linked by reference in abbreviated distance guides or rate tariffs 
to computer stored information provided the following conditions are 
met:
    (i) Carriers or their tariff publishing agents shall make 
arrangements with the Commission for the receipt, storage and use of the 
systems through existing Commission techology and facilities.
    (ii) In the event that a system is not compatible with Commission 
technology, the necessary implementing equipment and programs shall be 
placed on file with the Commission for use by Commission personnel and 
the public at no cost.
    (iii) Proposed changes in the systems shall be given notice and 
reflect the nature of the change, as required by 49 U.S.C. 10762(c)(3) 
and Sec. 1312.4(e) and Sec. 1312.17(f). However, if an electronic 
distance determination system is not inherently capable of giving notice 
and symbolization of changes within the program, then printed tariff 
amendments to the distance guides or rate tariffs will be required. The 
amendments shall show the currently effective provisions as well as the 
proposed changes thereto.
    (iv) The distance guides or rate tariffs shall provide all the 
information necessary to access and utilize the systems.
    (6) Railroad distance rate tariffs or distance guides shall also 
provide:
    (i) A list of the points between which the rates apply;
    (ii) The shortest distances between those points;
    (iii) An indication of which of those points are junction points 
where traffic may be interchanged without transfer of the lading; and
    (iv) The names of the connecting carriers at each of those 
junctions.
    (7) A rail carrier or its agent may file a separate tariff 
containing the information required by paragraph (c)(6) of this section 
to govern local rates. The distances shall be shown--
    (i) Form each point to each point;

[[Page 337]]

    (ii) Form each point to each junction point; or
    (iii) Form each junction point to each other junction point and from 
each point to the nearest junction point in each direction.
    (8) An agent may file a separate tariff to govern joint rail rates. 
The distances shall be shown from each junction point to each other 
junction point and from each point to the nearest junction point in each 
direction. The latter distances need not be shown if the rate tariff 
refers to local distance tariffs of each carrier which contain the 
distances.

<R05>
Sec. 1312.31  Commodity rates determined by the use of rate base numbers.

    This rule applies only for common carriers of property. ``Column 
commodity rates'' or ``commodity rate column'' shall be the terms used 
in captions for, and references to, commodity rates determined by use of 
rate base numbers or other basing systems. The basing system shall be in 
the same or other tariffs.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.32  Application of rates from or to intermediate points.

    This section does not apply to household goods freight forwarders, 
pipelines, contract carriers, or on irregular route motor common carrier 
authority.
    (a) Intermediate application of rates. Tariffs may publish 
appropriate rules to provide for the application of rates from or to 
points located between origins and destinations from or to which the 
rates apply.
    (b) Rules must be complete. The rules must be clear and complete. 
The rules shall give consideration to situations where branch or 
diverging routes or points are involved. The rules shall also 
specifically provide for the application or nonapplication of effective 
rates specifically applying from or to the intermediate points.
    (c) Intermediate point rules to be published in connection with 
regular-route authority. A statement shall be published indicating under 
what circumstances, if any, the rules will apply for off-route points, 
and for points located on either side of the highway which may be served 
under the implied authority of the carrier's certificate.

<R05>
Sec. 1312.33  Class rates from or to unnamed points applicable only to motor carriers of property.

    (a) Class tariffs shall provide class rates for all points within 
the territorial coverage of the tariff which the participating carriers 
are authorized to serve; and which are shown on official State maps or 
equivalent commercial maps.
    (b) If the class-rate intermediate rule is not used or will not 
cover all unnamed points a carrier may serve, a rule describing how to 
compute rates on unnamed points may be published. Application of the 
various rules, if more than one is used, shall be clear.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.34  Continuous service rates not applicable to passenger carriers.

    (a) Rates may be filed which are published to apply when carrier's 
equipment is used exclusively by and in the continuous service of a 
single shipper during a specified period of time. All necessary 
definitions and conditions shall be provided.
    (b) If other than regulated, interstate traffic is used to meet the 
continuous use requirements, the tariff shall so state and explain all 
requirements.
    (c) Continuous service periods may not begin prior to the effective 
date of the tariff.
    (d) The tariff shall provide for other charges if the continuous 
service conditions are not met. Provisions may be published for the 
execution of an indemnity bond to guarantee payment. If charges are 
required to be collected for a deficit in the minimum charge or for any 
time during the period the equipment is not used, it shall be clear what 
rate is to apply on the deficit or nonuse. Consideration shall also be 
given as to whether the deficit or the nonuse rate will change (e.g., 
through general increase) during the period.
    (e) The tariff shall provide that the carriers will keep complete 
and accurate records of the movements, that the information in these 
records will be available to the shipper and where and when it will be 
available.

[[Page 338]]

    (f) The tariff shall state whether and how the rates or conditions 
will be revised and the procedure to use due to disabilities such as 
strikes, breakdown of equipment, fire, etc., identifying the 
disabilities and indicating the rate or condition revisions.
    (g) Provisions may be published permitting discontinuance during the 
period for specified reasons. The provisions shall clearly state any 
penalty charge and the amount to be assessed for the discontinuance 
privilege.
    (h) Retroactive application of tariff amendments is not permitted.

Sec. 1312.35  Time-volume rates not applicable to passenger carriers.

    (a) Rates may be filed which are published to apply only when a 
specific quantity of freight is shipped by a consignor or received by a 
consignee during a specified period of time. All necessary definitions 
and conditions shall be provided.
    (b) If other than regulated interstate traffic is used to meet the 
time-volume service requirements, the tariff shall so state and explain 
all requirements.
    (c) Time/volume periods may not begin prior to the effective date of 
the tariff.
    (d) The tariff shall provide for other charges if the time/volume 
conditions are not met. Provisions may be published for the execution of 
an indemnity bond to guarantee payment. If the tariff provides for the 
collection of charges on a deficit, consideration shall also be given as 
to whether the deficit rate will change (e.g., through general increase) 
during the period. If charges are required to be collected for any 
deficit in weight between the actual weight of a particular shipment and 
the minimum weight on which charges for that shipment are assessed as 
the volume shipments move, the tariff shall so provide.
    (e) The tariff shall provide that the carrier(s) will keep complete 
and accurate records of the movements, that the information will be 
available to the shipper and where and when it will be available.
    (f) The tariff shall state whether and how the minimum quantity 
requirements will be reduced and the procedure to use due to 
disabilities such as strikes, breakdown of equipment, fire, etc., 
identifying the disabilities and indicating the rate or condition 
revisions.
    (g) Provision may be published permitting discontinuance for 
specified reasons. The provisions shall clearly state any penalty charge 
and the amount to be assessed for the discontinuance privilege.
    (h) Retroactive application of tariff amendments is not permitted.

Sec. 1312.36  Seasonal water rates.

    (a) Discontinuance and restoration of service. If tariffs contain 
rates applicable to water routes which are seasonally closed to 
navigation, they shall contain provisions governing the discontinuance 
and restoration of service.
    (b) Title page notation. The title page of the tariff shall briefly 
state the service limitations and refer, if necessary, to specific 
provisions.
    (c) Supplements announcing discontinuance of service. Only one 
supplement announcing discontinuance of transportation service may be 
effective at one time. The supplement may be filed to a bound or 
looseleaf tariff without regard to the supplement limits of this part, 
and may be filed on 1 day's notice.
    (d) Reissues. If a tariff discontinuing service as of a specific 
date becomes effective after the actual date service was discontinued, 
the tariff shall so state, refer to the prior supplement and ICC tariff 
designation, and state that a further supplement announcing 
discontinuance of service for that season will not be filed.

Sec. 1312.37  Export and import traffic and joint rates with ocean carriers.

    (a) Definitions. The term domestic carrier as used in this section 
means a common carrier by rail, motor, water, or household goods freight 
forwarder subject to the Act.
    (b) Through routes and joint rates. A domestic carrier may establish 
a through route and joint rate with a non-vessel or vessel operating 
ocean

[[Page 339]]

carrier for the transportation of property between any place in the 
United States and any place in a foreign country. Tariffs for such 
service shall be filed with the Commission is either long form or 
abbreviated form, as follows:
    (1) The long-form tariff shall name the through routes and joint 
rates, and may be filed in the name of the ocean carrier, a conference 
of ocean carriers, the domestic carrier, or the publishing agent of the 
carriers.
    (2) An abbreviated tariff shall refer to a specific tariff(s) on 
file with the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) containing the joint 
through rates on which the domestic carrier participates, and shall be 
filed in the name of the domestic carrier or the publishing agent of the 
domestic carrier.
    (c) Tariff provisions. (1) Tariffs filed with the Commission under 
the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall comply with all of 
the other requirements of this part. Rail carriers are exempt from this 
tariff filing requirement. See 49 CFR 1039.21, International joint 
through rates. The division or rate to be received by the domestic 
carrier for its share of the revenue covering a through shipment or 
aggregate of shipments may, but need not, be shown in the tariff.
    (2) Abbreviated tariffs filed under the provisions of paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, shall comply with the relevant format 
requirements, including those pertaining to ``participating carrier'' 
publications.
    (3) A tariff filed in the name of a conference need not show 
``Agent'' after the name of the conference unless the conference 
publishes as an agent.
    (4) ``Cargo, N.O.S.'' may be used as a commodity description 
provided the term is clearly defined in the tariff.
    (d) Changes on less than statutory notice. (1) Abbreviated tariffs, 
or amendments thereto, filed under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of 
this section, may be filed to become effective on a specified date on 
not less than one-day's notice.
    (2) For tariffs filed under the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of 
this section, that include the division or rate accruing to the domestic 
carrier, the following changes may be published by amendment to the 
tariff to become effective on a specified date not prior to the date 
filed with the Commission:
    (i) A change in a published rate or other provision which results in 
reduction or in no change in charges, provided that there is no change 
in the separately stated division or rate accruing to the domestic 
carrier or a provision governing or affecting that division or rate. 
This includes a change in a rate that results in lessening or canceling 
a proposed (i.e., published but not yet effective) increase; and
    (ii) The establishment of a rate on a specific commodity not 
previously named in a tariff which results in a reduction or no change 
in charges.
    (3) Changes in charges for terminal services, canal tolls, or other 
additional charges may be made effective upon a specified date not prior 
to the date filed with the Commission, provided the charges are not 
under the control of the carrier or conference, and the agency assessing 
the charges to the carrier increases the charges without notice or 
without adequate notice to the carrier or conference. If the tariff 
separately states the division, rate, or charge accruing to the domestic 
carrier, and if a change occurs in the division, rate, or charge, the 
amendment shall contain a statement explaining the change.
    (e) Port combination bases. Domestic and ocean carriers may enter 
into joint arrangements and domestic carriers may at the same time 
maintain an effective rate applicable only from and to the ports, usable 
in combination with the ocean carriers' independently established rates. 
In the absence of a statement in tariffs limiting the application of 
export or import rates, the rates will apply. The domestic carriers may 
also publish in their tariffs, as information, the ocean carriers' rates 
that will apply to or from a foreign country in connection with the 
domestic carriers' rates. When this is done, the ocean carriers' rates 
are in no manner subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission.
    (f) Through export and import billing. When export and import 
shipments are forwarded under through billing, the through bills of 
lading shall clearly separate the liability of the domestic

[[Page 340]]

carriers and the ocean carriers. The name of the domestic carrier shall 
appear on the face of the bill of lading when that carrier originates 
the shipment. Tariffs which provide for the use of a specified kind of 
bill of lading shall reproduce all of its terms and conditions.

[49 FR 38615, Oct. 1, 1984, as amended at 51 FR 3071, Jan. 23, 1986; 51 
FR 27046, July 29, 1986; 51 FR 44297, Dec. 9, 1986]


<R05>
Sec. 1312.38  Substitution of service.

    Paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section only apply to 
property carriers. The provisions of this section may not be used in 
connection with joint rates and provisions for which concurrences are in 
effect unless they so provide.
    (a) Substituted service may be provided. (1) If a rail, water, or 
motor carrier (hereafter referred to as Carrier A) desires to have the 
option to substitute the services of a carrier of a different 
transportation mode (hereafter referred to as Carrier B) for part of its 
movement of a shipment, it may do so subject to the requirements of this 
section.
    (2) Either the rate tariff or a governing tariff shall contain the 
substituted service provisions.
    (3) A separate tariff entitled ``Substituted Freight Service 
Directory'' may be filed, governing the rate tariff(s), provided it 
contains only matter relating to the substituted service.
    (b) Service conditions. Substituted service provisions may be 
published if--
    (1) The shipment moves on the bill of lading that would be used if 
Carrier A was performing the service;
    (2) Carrier A assumes the responsibility for the lading while it is 
in the possession of Carrier B; and
    (3) Movement of the lading has been made prior to, or will be made 
subsequent to, the service performed by Carrier B.
    (c) Tariff conditions. The tariff provisions for substituted service 
shall include--
    (1) The name of Carrier B;
    (2) The points between which the substituted service will be 
performed;
    (3) A statement that the rate applicable via Carrier A will apply; 
and
    (4) A statement that the substituted service will not be performed 
if the shipper advises the carrier that it does not want service to be 
substituted. Carrier B does not need to be shown as a participant in 
Carrier A's rate or governing tariffs, nor in the routing provisions.
    (5) When publishing substitution of trailer-on-flatcar service for 
motor service, tariffs need not show the rail carrier's name or points 
of interchange with the rail carriers.
    (d) Changes in tariff provisions. Additions, deletions and other 
changes in substituted service provisions (not rates) may be made on 1 
day's notice.
    (e) Optional honoring of ticket arrangements. (This paragraph only 
applies to passenger carriers.) Provisions may be published affirming an 
agreement of two or more carriers for the acceptance by one carrier of a 
ticket sold over the route of another carrier. The carriers' names shall 
be shown, along with the names of the points between which the tickets 
will be honored, and any restrictions or exceptions stated.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.39  Miscellaneous provisions which may be filed on less than statutory notice.

    (a) Restorations of carrier participation. Amendments to restore a 
carrier's participation in a tariff may be filed on 5 days' notice 
provided the relisting of the carrier is indicated to become effective 
not later than the date the cancellation was published to become 
effective.
    (b) Amendment of participating carrier list in a classification or 
dangerous articles tariff. Additions, corrections and other changes to 
the list of participating carriers in classifications and dangerous 
articles tariffs may be made on 1 day's notice. This authority may not 
be used to cancel the participation of a carrier.
    (c) Rates for or newly established water carrier service. (1) (This 
paragraph does not apply to the transportation of passengers.) Rates and 
provisions applicable at, from, to or via points on new lines may be 
established on 10 days' notice. If the establishment of local rates 
under this authority results in the establishment of combination through 
rates, the combination through rates

[[Page 341]]

may be displaced by lower rates, either single factor or combination, on 
10 days' notice. If class rates are initially established under this 
authority, lower commodity rates to displace the class rates may later 
be established on 10 days' notice.
    (2) (This paragraph applies only to the transportation of 
passengers.) Rates and provisions applicable at, from or to points on 
new lines may be established in the first instance on 1 day's notice.
    (d) Extension of expiration dates or postponement of effective dates 
of comeback provisions. Amendments to extend the expiration dates of 
provisions, and to postpone the effective date of comeback provisions 
(provisions which are paired with and published to supersede those 
indicated to expire with the preceding day) may be published on 1 day's 
notice provided no change is made in the extended or postponed 
provisions.
    (e) Effective Dates. The effective date of a publication, rate, or 
provision may be postponed on 1 day's notice, and in statement form.
    (f) Roundtrip excursion fares. Fares for a roundtrip excursion 
limited to a designated period may be established upon posting and 
filing the tariff on 1-day's notice.
    (g) Transportation of circus and show outfits. Rates for specified 
movements of circuses and other show outfits may be established by 
filing the tariffs with the Commission on 1 day's notice. The tariffs 
shall publish the charges specifically, or may consist of a proper title 
page, containing the statement ``as per copy of contract attached,'' 
with a copy of the contract attached.
    (h) Freight rate tariffs and classifications of railroads, motor 
common carriers of property and freight forwarders-notice for 
independent rate changes--(1) New and reduced rates. Except as otherwise 
provided in paragraphs (h)(2), (4) and (5) of this section, each 
independently established new or changed rate, charge, rule, or other 
provision shall be filed with the Commission in Washington, DC at least 
1 day before the date upon which it is to become effective.
    (2) Increased rates. Each independently established increased rate 
or charge and each independently established change in a rule or other 
provision which effects a reduction in the value of service or increase 
in a rate or charge shall be filed with the Commission in Washington, DC 
at least 7 workdays before the date upon which it is to become 
effective. This provision does not apply to rail freight rate tariff 
increases. Such filings shall be made on statutory notice, i.e., 20 
days. See Sec. 1312.4(e)(1)(i)(A).
    (3) Independently established for carrier's account. The rate, 
charge, rule, or other provision shall be published either in a tariff 
filed in the carrier's name or under independent action instructions for 
only the particular carrier's account in a tariff filed in a tariff 
publishing agent's name.
    (4) Joint intermodal traffic. This paragraph (h) applies to single-
factor, motor-water property rates, charges, rules and other provisions, 
but does not apply to any other single-factor rate, charge, rule, or 
other provision having application over any segment of the lines of 
another transportation mode.
    (5) This section supersedes others. The provisions of this section 
take precedence over all the provisions of this part 1312 that govern 
filing notice. The other provisions will continue to apply to filings 
that have been docketed with rate bureaus in advance of filing with the 
Commission (collectively agreed upon rate filings).
    (6) Mixed filings. Tariffs or amendments that contain new or reduced 
rates in addition to rate increases shall be filed with the notice 
applicable for rate increases, with the new and reduced rate filings 
appropriately symbolized and excepted from the notice applicable for 
rate increases.
    (i) Tariffs of Motor Carriers of Passengers--Changes--New, Reduced 
and Increased Rates. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h)(5) of 
this section, each independently established new or changed rate, 
charge, rule, or other provision must be filed with the Commission in 
Washington, DC, at least 1 day before the date upon which it is to 
become effective. Similarly, each independently established change in a 
rule or other provision that effects a reduction in the value of service 
or increase in a rate or charge must be

[[Page 342]]

filed with the Commission in Washington, DC, at least 1 day before the 
date upon which it is to become effective.

Sec. 1312.40  Claims rules.

    Each carrier or its agent shall file with the Commission its rules 
and practices with respect to--

    (a) The loss or damage to property (see 49 CFR part 1005); and
    (b) Overcharge, duplicate payment or overcollection of freight 
charges (see 49 CFR part 1008).

The rules and regulations may be published in a rate or rules tariff, a 
classification, or in a separate tariff containing no other matter, or 
the tariff may refer to the relevant CFR provisions.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.41  Range tariffs.

    (a) A range tariff presents a series of rates or discounts with each 
rate or discount potentially applicable to any given shipment; the 
particular rate or discount made applicable to particular shipment(s) is 
given effect by the filing of a second tariff. Under these circumstances 
the rate or discount made applicable by the filing of the second tariff 
takes precedence over other filed tariffs otherwise applicable to the 
shipment(s).
    (b) To initiate range tariff pricing, a carrier or agent shall:
    (1) File with the Commission a tariff setting forth the series 
(range) of rates or discounts potentially applicable to shipments moving 
on, or subsequent to, the effective date of the tariff. The tariff shall 
show on its title page the term INITIATING RANGE TARIFF;
    (2) Provide an explanation of the application of the tariff, 
including any conditions, limitations or restrictions that attend use of 
the tariff; the explanation shall be contained in an Item 150 designated 
``Application of Tariff'';
    (3) File not more than one initiating range tariff to be in effect 
at any one time; however, different ranges of rates or discounts may be 
established within the one tariff provided the application of the 
different ranges is clearly explained to avoid ambiguity of 
applicability;
    (4) File initiating range tariffs with the Commission in the manner 
required by Sec. 1312.3 and Sec. 1312.4(a) and (b) of this part; and
    (5) Establish and maintain with the Commission a tariff filing fee 
account pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 1002.2(a)(1)(ii) of this 
chapter, for use in making activating range tariff filings under 
paragraph (c) of this section.
    (c) To activate for particular shipment(s) a particular rate or 
discount (from among the range of rates or discounts provided in the 
initiating range tariff established under paragraph (b) of this 
section), a carrier or agent shall:
    (1) Prior to transporting a specifically identified shipment(s), 
file a tariff with the Commission stating the actual rate or discount 
that applies to the shipment(s). The tariff shall show on its title page 
the term ACTIVATING RANGE TARIFF and shall refer to the initiating range 
tariff (previously established under paragraph (b) of this section) as a 
control tariff;
    (2) Publish activating rates or discounts in a tariff in the 
carrier's own name or in a tariff filed in the name of a duly authorized 
agent, immediately followed by the carrier's or agent's code and the 
characters ``6R''; immediately under this designation shall be shown the 
actual date of filing with the Commission, which shall serve as the date 
on which the tariff becomes applicable for traffic moving subsequent to 
the filing.

Example: ICC ABCD 6R
Filed: 7/1/93

Each page of the activating range tariff shall show this same 
information. Each page shall be sequentially numbered with the final 
page stating ``end'' following the last page number;
    (3) Show on the title page of each activating range tariff a 
specific date of expiration that shall not exceed 7 days from the date 
of the tariff's filing. In the event an expiration date is not 
designated, the tariff shall expire 7 days from the date of filing;
    (4) Identify the specific traffic to be accorded service under the 
stated rate

[[Page 343]]

or discount with whatever information is needed to identify specifically 
the intended shipments, but in any event, at a minimum, identify either 
the shipper's name or the commodity description and origin and 
destination points; and
    (5) File with the Commission:
    (i) One copy of each activating tariff submitted by fax transmission 
to (202) 927-5888; to avoid the necessity of filing a separate 
transmittal letter (see Sec. 1312.4(b) of this part), the title page of 
every activating range tariff shall provide the name, title and phone 
number of the party authorized to submit the publication for filing with 
the Commission, and the fee account number established for the filing 
carrier or agent; or
    (ii) Two copies of each activating tariff transmitted by hand in 
accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1312.3 and 1312.4(a) and (b) of 
this part.
    (d) Except as expressly provided in this section, range tariffs are 
subject to the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1312.1 through 1312.40 of this 
part.

<R05>
Sec. 1313.1  Definitions of the terms contract and amendment.

    (a) A contract made pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10713 is a written 
agreement, including any amendment, entered into by one or more rail 
carriers with one or more purchasers of rail service, to provide 
specified services under specified rates, charges and conditions.
    (b) A contract filed under these rules must:
    (1) Specify that the contract is made pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10713, 
and
    (2) Be signed by duly authorized parties.
    (c) The term amendment includes written contract modifications 
signed by the parties.
    (d) An amendment is treated as a new contract. [To the extent 
contract extensions or amendments change any term of the contract, 
remedies are revived and review is again available.] An amendment is 
lawful only if it is filed and approved in the same manner as the 
original contract and is consistent with these rules, including the 
filing of a complete contract summary.


<R05>
Sec. 1313.2  Jurisdiction; contract approval/disapproval.

    (a) Jurisdiction. (1) The contract or amendment and transportation 
are subject to Commission jurisdiction until Commission approval under 
49 U.S.C. 10713 and applicable regulations.
    (2) Railroad transportation contracts (other than agricultural 
commodity contracts) made by the United States Department of Defense are 
exempt from the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10713.
    (b) Contract approval date. Except as provided in Sec. 1313.7(a)(2):
    (1) The contract is approved on the 30th day after the filing of the 
contract summary if the Commission does not institute a proceeding to 
review the contract.

[[Page 344]]

    (2) If the Commission institutes a proceeding to review a contract, 
it has jurisdiction for 60 days after the contract summary is filed. 
Under these circumstances the contract will be approved:
    (i) On the date the Commission approves the contract, if the date of 
approval is 31 or more days after the filing date of the contract 
summary;
    (ii) On the 31st day after the contract summary filing date if the 
Commission denies the complaint against the contract by the 30th day 
after the contract summary filing date; or
    (iii) On the 60th day after the contract summary filing date, if the 
Commission fails to disapprove the contract.
    (c) Contract disapproval. If the Commission finds that the contract 
violates the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10713, it will:
    (1) Disapprove the contract; or
    (2) In the case of agricultural contracts (including forest products 
and paper) where the Commission finds unreasonable discrimination by a 
carrier in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 10713 and Sec. 1313.17(b)(3), allow 
the carriers the option to:
    (i) Provide rates and services substantially similar to the contract 
at issue, with such differences in terms and conditions as are justified 
by the evidence; or
    (ii) Cancel the contract.
    (d) Applicable rates/charges if contract disapproved. If the 
Commission disapproves or rejects the contract or amendment, the 
appropriate non-contract tariffs or the contract provisions otherwise in 
effect under previously approved contracts will be applicable.

<R05>
Sec. 1313.3  Contract implementation date.

    (a) Transportation or service performed under a contract or 
amendment may begin, without specific Commission authorization, on or 
after the date the contract summary (or amended contract summary) is 
filed and before Commission approval as defined in 49 CFR 1313.2, 
subject to the following conditions:
    (1) The contract or contract amendment shall specifically state that 
the transportation or service may begin on the date of filing.
    (2) The contract summary shall separately reflect the date of 
commencement of service.
    (b) Except as provided under paragraph (c) of this section, 
transportation or service may not begin under a contract or an amendment 
to a contract before the filing date of either the contract summary or 
the amended contract summary, respectively.
    (c) Railroad transportation or service is exempt from the 
requirements of 49 U.S.C. 10761, 11902, 11903, and 11904 to the extent 
that a railroad may apply a contract or amended contract rate rather 
than an otherwise applicable tariff or prior contract rate and pay 
reparations or waive undercharges under the following conditions:
    (1) A transportation contract summary or amended contract summary 
under 49 U.S.C. 10713 has been filed with the Commission and has been 
approved by the Commission or by operation of law.
    (2) The shipment at issue falls within the terms of the contract or 
amendment; and
    (3) The shipment was transported before the contract or amendment 
was approved but:
    (i) After the contract or amendment was signed; or
    (ii) After the parties agreed on the rate to be charged and they 
either agreed to be bound by the contract or amendment or intended the 
movement to be covered by the contract and amendments.
    (d) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, all transportation 
under the contract may begin only in accordance with 49 CFR 1313.2.

[53 FR 5380, Feb. 24, 1988, as amended at 57 FR 40621, Sept. 4, 1992; 57 
FR 43291, Sept. 18, 1992]


<R05>
Sec. 1313.4  Common carrier responsibility; limitations on future contracts.

    (a) The terms of a contract approved by the Commission determine 
completely the obligations of the parties to the contract with respect 
to the services provided under the contract. The contract does not 
affect the parties' responsibilities for any services which are not 
included in the contract.

[[Page 345]]

    (b) Service under a contract approved by the Commission is deemed a 
separate and distinct class of service and the equipment used to fulfill 
the contract shall not be subject to car service limitations under 49 
U.S.C. 11123.
    (c) Limitation of rail carrier rights to enter future contract. The 
Commission may limit the right of a rail carrier to enter into future 
contracts if the Commission determines that additional contracts would 
impair the ability of the rail carrier to fulfill its common carrier 
obligations under 49 U.S.C. 11101. The Commission will handle these 
determinations on a case-by-case basis and may investigate, either on 
its own initiative or upon the filing of a verified complaint by a 
shipper which demonstrates that it individually had been or will be 
harmed by a carrier's inability to fulfill its common carrier 
obligations as a result of existing contracts.


<R05>
Sec. 1313.5  Remedies for breach of approved contracts.

    (a) The exclusive remedy for an alleged breach of a contract 
approved by the Commission shall be an action in the appropriate State 
Court or United States District Court, unless the parties otherwise 
agree in the contract.
    (b) The Commission may not require a rail carrier to violate the 
terms of a contract that has been approved under 49 CFR 1313.2, except 
to the extent necessary to comply with 49 U.S.C. 11128.


<R05>
Sec. 1313.6  Limitation on equipment; and relief.

    (a) A rail carrier may enter into contract for the transportation of 
agricultural commodities (including forest products but not including 
wood pulp, wood chips, pulpwood, or paper) that involve the use of 
carrier owned or leased equipment not in excess of 40 percent of the 
total number of the carrier's owned or leased equipment, by major car 
type, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) In the case of a proposed contract between a class I carrier and 
a shipper originating an average of 1,000 cars or more per year during 
the prior 3-year period by major car type on a particular carrier, not 
more than 40 percent of carrier owned or leased equipment used on the 
average during the prior 3-year period may be used for the contract 
without prior Commission authorization.
    (c) If the rail equipment standards of 49 U.S.C. 10713(k) are 
exceeded, prior relief must be obtained from the Commission and must be 
specifically identified in the contract summary.
    (d) The Commission may grant relief from the limitations of 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if:
    (1) A rail carrier or other party requests such relief; or the 
Commission on its own initiative considers granting such relief; and
    (2) The Commission determines that making additional equipment 
available does not impair the rail carrier's ability to meet its common 
carrier obligations under 49 U.S.C. 11101.


<R05>
Sec. 1313.7  Contract filing, title pages, and numbering.

    (a) Filing of Rail Contracts. (1) Rail carriers providing 
transportation subject to Subchapter I of Chapter 105 of Title 49, 
United States Code, must file with the Commission an original contract

than the parties to the contract and authorized Commission personnel, 
except by informal discovery under 49 CFR 1313.14 and/or by Commission

available from the Commission's Bureau of Traffic and Contract Advisory 
Service.

    (b)(1) Changes in prior contract summaries must be underscored and 
must be followed by the words ``addition,'' ``deletion,'' ``extension,'' 
``cancellation,'' or other appropriate descriptive phrase in 
parentheses. If the change to the contract is only in confidential 
matter, a statement to that effect must be made in the amended contract 
summary and must indicate the particular feature to which the change 
applies (i.e., rate, special feature, etc.). If ``not applicable'' is 
permitted in the original summary under Sec. Sec. 1313.10-1313.12, the 
amended summary may use ``not applicable'' with a notation that a change 
pertained only to confidential data.
    (2) Amended contract summaries filed under this provision may not 
substitute phrases such as ``not applicable'' or ``no change'' where 
disclosure was required in the original contract (such as in the 
commodity description); amended contract summaries must set forth all 
non-confidential terms in the contract, whether amended or not.
    (3) An amendment that shortens the life of a contract must be 
publicized in a contract summary for the amendment.

that petitioner is a shipper or port, has standing to file a complaint 
under 49 U.S.C. 10713(d)(2) (A) or (B), and that petitioner is affected 
by the contract. The following information will be considered in making 
a determination on whether to permit discovery.
    (1) Standing. Identify the provision(s) in 49 U.S.C. 10713(d) under 
which petitioner has standing to file a complaint.
    (2) Affected party. An affected party is one that is an actual or 
potential participant in the relevant market. The following information 
is relevant to making that determination and should be provided.
    (i) Nature and volume of petitioner's relevant business.
    (ii) Relevant commodities petitioner ships or receives;
    (iii) Comparisons between petitioner's commodities, locations of 
shipping facmlities and serving carriers, actual or potential traffic 
patterns and serving carrier(s), with the traffic patterns and serving 
carrier(s) identified in the contract summary. State whether petitioner 
is a consignor or consignee.
    (iv) Showing of an ability to ship the commodity in question at a 
time generally simultaneous with the contract at issue.
    (v) Any additional information petitioner considers appropriate to 
support its request, including prior negotiations, if any.
    (vi) Demonstrate how and to what degree the petitioner's relevant 
business may be affected by the contract terms as disclosed in the 
summary.
    (vii) Proof of actual injury is not required to satisfy this rule.
    (3) Demonstrated need. (i) With regard to the grounds for complaint 
under 49 U.S.C. 10713(d)(2)(B), the demonstrated need test applies to 
contracts for forest products and paper, non-agricultural port traffic, 
and other commodities. The test does not apply to agricultural commodity 
contracts.
    (ii) A petitioner seeking disclosure of non-agricultural contract 
information must show that the contract terms it seeks are relevant to 
its potential challenge to the contract.
    (iii) As car data is published in the contract summary, a petition 
for further disclosure on the basis that the contract may impair the 
contracting carrier's common obligation must establish a nexus between 
the information sought and the common carrier obligation. Before 
information regarding special features will be disclosed, a petitioner 
must show how the special feature or certain forms of that special 
feature could impair the contracting carrier's common carrier obligation 
and how that impairment may affect the petitioner. On receiving such a 
petition, the carrier must furnish to the petitioner and the Commission 
the data required by Sec. 1313.10(b)(6)(i)(D).

shall be served in the same manner on complainant/petitioner.
    (5) Replies to the petition are due within 5 days from the date of

    (8) Protective order. If confidential contract data or data 
disclosed pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1313.15, 1313.16, or 1313.17 are filed 
with the Commission in a complaint, petition, reply or other pleading, 
the party filing these data should submit them as a separate package, 
clearly marked on the outside ``Confidential Material Subject to 
Protective Order.'' The order in paragraph (a)(9) of this section 
applies to the parties specified in the order who receive confidential 
information through proceedings before the Commission or through 
informal discovery.
    (9) Order. Petitioner and carriers, and their duly authorized agents 
agree to limit to the discovery/complaint proceeding involving the 
contract, the use of contract information or other confidential 
commercial information which may be revealed in the contract, the 
complaint, reply, or any other pleading relating to the contract. This 
agreement shall be a condition to release of any contract term by a 
petitioner/complainant and shall operate similarly on a carrier in 
possession of confidential information which may be contained in a 
complaint, petition for discovery, or request for informal disclosure. 
Any information pertaining to parties to the contract, or subject to the 
contract (including consignors, consignees and carriers), or pertaining 
to the terms of the contract, or relating to the petitioner's/
complainant's confidential commercial information, must be kept 
confidential. Neither the information nor the existence of the 
information shall be disclosed to third parties, except for: consultants 
or agents who agree, in writing, to be bound by this regulation; 
information which is publicly available; information which, after 
receipt, becomes publicly available through no fault of the party 
seeking to disclose the information after it has become publicly 
available, or is acquired from a third party free of any restriction as 
to its disclosure. The petitioner/complainant or carrier must take all 
necessary steps to assure that the information will be kept confidential 
by its employees and

[[Page 352]]

agents. No copies of the contract terms or other confidential 
information are to be retained by the parties not originally privy to 
the data subsequent to the termination of the proceeding or the 
expiration of Commission jurisdiction under 49 CFR 1313.2.
    (b)(1) Complaint proceedings, complainants and replies. On receipt 
of a skeletal complaint by the 18th day after the contract filing date, 
a complaint proceeding will be instituted to extend this Commission's 
jurisdiction to 60 days after the contract filing date regardless 
whether a petition for discovery is filed or approved. The decision will 
provide for automatic dismissal of the proceeding and approval of the 
contract if complainant(s) fail to submit the case-in-chief by the due 
date established in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.
    (2) The skeletal complaint must contain the correct, unabbreviated 
names and addresses of the complainant(s) and defendant. The complainant 
must set out the statutory provisions under which it has standing to 
file a complaint.
    (3) If discovery is granted, the carrier must furnish the required 
information by the 1st working day after the Commission issues a final 
decision.

    (5) The amended complaint and case-in-chief are due 39 days after 
the filing of the contract.
    (6) Replies of the carrier defendant(s) are due 46 days after the

<R05>
Sec. 1313.17  Grounds for contract review and complaints.

    (a) Within 30 days of the contract filing date, the Commission may, 
on its own motion or on complaint, begin a proceeding to review the 
contract. Review can be based only on allegation of violations as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (b) A contract may be reviewed only on the following grounds:
    (1) In the case of a contract, other than a contract for the 
transportation of agricultural commodities (including forest products 
and paper), a complaint may be filed:
    (i) By a shipper only on the grounds that the shipper individually 
will be harmed because the proposed contract unduly impairs the ability 
of the contracting carrier to meet common carrier obligations under 49 
U.S.C. 11101; or
    (ii) By a port on the grounds that the port individually will be 
harmed because the proposed contract will result in unreasonable 
discrimination against the port.
    (2) In the case of a contract for the transportation of agricultural 
commodities (including forest products and paper), in addition to the 
grounds for a complaint described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this 
section, a complaint may be filed on the grounds that the shipper 
individually will be harmed because:
    (i) The rail carrier(s) unreasonably discriminated by refusing to 
enter into a similar contract with the shipper for rates and services 
for the transportation of the same type of commodity under similar 
conditions to the contract at issue and that the shipper was ready, 
willing, and able to enter into such a contract at a time essentially 
contemporaneous with the period during which the contract was offered; 
or
    (ii) The proposed contract constitutes a destructive competitive 
practice.
    (3) Unreasonable discrimination as used in these rules means, when 
applied to shippers of agricultural commodities (including forest 
products and paper), that the railroad has refused to enter into a 
contract with the shipper for rates and services for the transportation 
of the same type of commodity under similar conditions to the contract 
at issue, and that the shipper was ready, willing, and able to enter 
into such a contract at a time essentially contemporaneous with the 
period during which the contract at issue was offered; and, when applied 
to a port, has the same meaning as the term has under 49 U.S.C. 10741.
    (4) The definitions for agricultural commodities, forest products, 
and paper will be decided on a case-by-case basis.

<R05>
Sec. 1320.2  Extension of credit to shippers.

    (a) Authorization to extend credit. (1) A carrier that meets the 
requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may--
    (i) Relinquish possession of freight in advance of the payment of 
the tariff charges, and
    (ii) Extend credit in the amount of such charges to those who 
undertake to pay them (such persons are called shippers in this part).
    (2) For such authorization, the carrier shall take reasonable 
actions to assure payment of the tariff charges within the credit 
periods specified--
    (i) In this part, or
    (ii) In tariff provisions published pursuant to the regulations in 
paragraph (d) of this section.
    (b) When the credit period begins. The credit period shall begin on 
the day following presentation of the freight bill.
    (c) Length of credit period. Unless a different credit period has 
been established by tariff publication pursuant to paragraph (d) of this 
section, the credit period is 15 days. It includes Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal holidays.
    (d) Carriers may establish different credit periods in tariff rules. 
Carriers may publish tariff rules establishing credit periods different 
from those in paragraph (c) of this section. Such credit periods shall 
not be longer than 30 calendar days.
    (e) Service charges. (1) Service charges shall not apply when credit 
is extended and payments are made within the standard credit period. The 
term standard credit period, as used in the preceding sentence, means--
    (i) The credit period prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, 
or
    (ii) A substitute credit period published in a tariff rule pursuant 
to the authorization in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (2) Carriers may, by tariff rule, extend credit for an additional 
time period, subject if they wish to a service charge for that 
additional time. The combined length of the carrier's standard credit 
period (as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section) and its 
additional credit period shall not exceed the 30-day maximum credit 
period prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section. When such a tariff 
rule is in effect, shippers may elect to postpone payment until the end 
of the extended credit period if, in consideration therefor, they 
include any published service charges when making their payment.
    (3) Carriers may, by tariff rule, establish service charges for 
payments made after the expiration of an authorized credit period. Such 
a rule shall--

[[Page 354]]

    (i) Institute such charges on the day following the last day of an 
authorized credit period, and
    (ii) Notify shippers--
    (A) That its only purpose is to prevent a shipper who does not pay 
on time from having free use of funds due to the carrier,
    (B) That it does not sanction payment delays, and
    (C) That failure to pay within the authorized credit period will, 
despite this provision for such charges, continue to require the 
carrier, before again extending credit, to determine in good faith 
whether the shipper will comply with the credit regulations in the 
future.
    (4) Tariff rules that establish charges pursuant to paragraph (e) 
(2) or (3) of this section may establish minimum charges.
    (f) Discounts. Carriers may, by tariff rule, authorize discounts for 
early freight bill payments when credit is extended.
    (g)(1) Collection expense charges. Carriers may, by tariff rule, 
assess reasonable and certain liquidated damages for all costs incurred 
in the collection of overdue freight charges. Carriers may use one of 
two methods in their tariffs:
    (i) The first method is to assess liquidated damages as a separate 
additional charge to the unpaid freight bill. In doing so, the tariff 
rule shall disclose the exact amount of the charges by stating either a 
dollar or specified percentage amount (or a combination of both) of the 
unpaid freight bill. The tariff shall further specify the time period 
(which shall at least allow for the authorized credit period) within 
which the shipper must pay to avoid such liquidated damages.
    (ii) The second method is to require payment of the full, 
nondiscounted rate instead of the discounted rate otherwise applicable. 
The difference between the discount and the full rate constitutes a 
carrier's liquidated damages for its collection effort. Under this 
method the tariff shall identify the discount rates that are subject to 
the condition precedent and which require the shipper to make payment by 
a date certain. The date certain may not be set to occur by the carrier 
until at least after the expiration of the carrier's authorized credit 
period.
    (2) The damages, the timing of their applicability, and the 
conditions, if any, as provided by the tariff-rule methods allowed under 
paragraphs (g)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section also:
    (i) Shall be clearly described in the tariff rule;
    (ii) Shall be applied without unlawful prejudice and/or unjust 
discrimination between similarly situated shippers and/or consignees;
    (iii) Shall be applied only to the nonpayment of original, separate 
and independent freight bills and shall not apply to aggregate balance-
due claims sought for collection on past shipments by a bankruptcy 
trustee, or any other person or agent;
    (iv) Shall not apply to instances of clear clerical or ministerial 
error such as non-receipt of a carrier's freight bill, or shipper's 
payment check lost in the mail, or carrier mailing of the freight bill 
to the wrong address;
    (v) Shall not apply in any way to a charge for a transportation 
service if the carrier's bill of lading independently provides that the 
shipper is liable for fees incurred by the carrier in the collection of 
freight charges on that same transportation service;
    (vi) shall be applied only after the authorized credit period, and 
when the carrier has issued a revised freight bill or notice of 
imposition of collection expense charges for late payment within 90 days 
after expiration of the authorized credit period.
    (3) As an alternative to the tariff-rule methods allowed under 
paragraphs (g)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, a carrier may, wholly 
outside of its tariff, assess collection charges though contract terms 
in a bill of lading. By using the carrier and its bill of lading, the 
shipper accepts the bill of lading terms.
    (h) Discrimination prohibited. Tariff rules published pursuant to 
paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section shall not result in 
unreasonable discrimination among shippers.

Sec. 1320.3  Presentation of freight bills.

    (a) ``To be prepaid'' shipments. (1) On ``to be prepaid'' shipments, 
the carrier shall present its freight bill for all transportation 
charges within the time period prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section, except--
    (i) As noted in paragraph (d) of this section, or
    (ii) As otherwise excepted in this part.
    (2) The time period for a carrier to present its freight bill for 
all transportation charges shall be 7 days, measured from the date the 
carrier received the shipment. This time period does not include 
Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.
    (b) ``Collect'' shipments. (1) On ``collect'' shipments, the carrier 
shall present its freight bill for all transportation charges within the 
time period prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) and of this section, except--
    (i) As noted in paragraph (d) of this section, or
    (ii) As otherwise excepted in this part.
    (2) The time period for a carrier to present its freight bill for 
all transportation charges shall be 7 days, measured from the date the 
shipment was delivered at its destination. This time period does not 
include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.
    (c) Bills or accompanying written notices shall state penalties for 
late payment, credit time limits and service charge and/or collection 
expense charge and discount terms. When credit is extended, freight 
bills or a separate written notice accompanying a freight bill or a 
group of freight bills presented at one time shall state that ``failure 
timely to pay freight charges may be subject to tariff penalties'' (or a 
statement of similar import). The bills or other notice shall also state 
the time by which payment must be made and any applicable service charge 
and/or collection expense charge and discount terms.
    (d) When the carrier lacks sufficient information to compute tariff 
charges. (1) When information sufficient to enable the carrier to 
compute the tariff charges is not then available to the carrier at its 
billing point, the carrier shall present its freight bill for payment 
within 7 days following the day upon which sufficient information 
becomes available at the billing point. This time period does not 
include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.
    (2) A carrier shall not extend further credit to any shipper which 
fails to furnish sufficient information to allow the carrier to render a 
freight bill within a reasonable time after the shipment is tendered to 
the origin carrier.
    (3) As used in this paragraph, the term ``shipper'' includes, but is 
not limited to, freight forwarders, and shippers' associations and 
shippers' agents within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 10562 (3) and (4).
    (e) Freight bill presentation on railroad transported export traffic 
loaded into vessels. The term delivered at its destination as used in 
paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall mean the time when the vessel is 
completely loaded, when--
    (1) The traffic in export traffic that is loaded into vessels 
either--
    (i) Direct from railroad cars or piers, or
    (ii) From such cars or pirers by means of lighters, and
    (2) The freight bills are presented to vessel owners or their 
representatives.

<R05>
Sec. 1320.4  Effect of mailing freight bills or payments.

    (a) Presentation of freight bills by mail. When carriers present 
freight bills by mail, the time of mailing shall be deemed to be the 
time of presentation of the bills. The term freight bills, as used in 
this paragraph, includes both paper documents and billing by use of 
electronic media such as computer tapes or disks, when the mails are 
used to transmit them.
    (b) Payment by mail. Wnen shippers mail acceptable checks, drafts, 
or money orders in payment of freight charges, the act of mailing them 
within the credit period shall be deemed to be the collection of the 
tariff charges within the credit period for the purposes of the 
regulations in this part.
    (c) Disputes as to date of mailing. In case of dispute as to the 
date of mailing, the postmark shall be accepted as such date.

[[Page 356]]


<R05>
Sec. 1320.5  Additional charges.

    When a carrier--
    (a) Has collected the amount of tariff charges represented in a 
freight bill presented by it as the total amount of such charges, and
    (b) Thereafter presents to the shipper another freight bill for 
additional charges--

the carrier may extend credit in the amount of such additional charges 
for a period of 30 calendar days from the date of the presentation of 
the freight bill for the additional charges.


<R05>
Sec. 1320.6  Computation of time.

    Time periods involving calendar days shall be calculated pursuant to 
49 CFR 1104.7(a).


<R05>
Sec. 1320.7  Charges under average demurrage agreements.

    (a) Conditions for special credit rules regarding demurrage charges. 
The rules in paragraph (b) of this section shall apply to demurrage 
charges, if--
    (1) The amount of demurrage charges is determinable under average 
agreements made in accordance with tariff provisions, and
    (2) The carrier takes reasonable actions to assure payment of the 
tariff charges within the credit period.
    (b) Special credit rules for demurrage charges. When both conditions 
in paragraph (a) of this section are met, the carrier may--
    (1) Delay presentation of bills for such demurrage charges for a 
period not exceeding 15 calendar days after the end of the authorized 
demurrage period, and
    (2) Extend credit, in the amount of the demurrage charges accrued 
during the demurrage period, for 15 calendar days from the date of 
presentation of the bill for such charges.


<R05>
Sec. 1320.8  Household goods shipments by motor common carriers.

    (a) Exceptions--Household goods ``collect on delivery'' shipments. 
The regulations in the other sections of this part and in paragraph (c) 
of this section do not apply when the carrier is required by 49 CFR 
1056.3(d) to relinquish possession of an otherwise ``collect on 
delivery'' household goods shipment in advance of payment of all of the 
charges.
    (b) Charge card reversed transactions. The regulations of this part 
apply when--
    (1) Charges for household goods movements are paid by use of charge 
cards pursuant to 49 CFR 1056.19, and
    (2) The shipper forces an involuntary extension of credit by the 
carrier by causing the charge card issuer to reverse the charge 
transaction and charge payments back to the carrier's account.
    (c) Exceptions--House goods credit shipments. The provisions in 
paragraphs (c) (1) through (3) of this section are exceptions to the 
other regulations in this part. They apply to credit extensions for 
household goods transportation by motor common carriers (except as 
provided in paragraph (a) of this section)--
    (1) A freight bill shall be presented within 15 days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) of the date of delivery of a 
shipment at its destination.
    (2) The credit of period is 7 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, 
and legal holidays).
    (3) Motor Common carriers of household goods must provide in their 
tariffs that--
    (i) The credit period shall automatically be extended to a total of 
30 calendar days for any shipper who has not paid the carrier's freight 
bill within the 7-day period.
    (ii) Such shipper will be assessed a service charge by the carrier 
equal to 1 percent of the amount of the freight bill, subject to a $10 
minimum charge, for such extension of the credit period, and
    (iii) No such carrier shall grant credit to any shipper who fails to 
pay a duly presented freight bill within the 30-day period, unless and 
until such shipper affirmatively satisfies the carrier that all future 
freight bills duly presented will be paid strictly in accordance with 
the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission for the 
settlement of carrier rates and charges.

approved by the Commission. Failure to do so will result in lack of 
immunity for that activity.
    (b) The bureaus are required to maintain detailed minutes of all 
meetings where immunized matters are discussed. The bureaus will be 
subject to withdrawal of their immunity for serious continuing 
violations of Commission standards, and individual tariff publications 
will be subject to rejection, suspension, or investigation for 
improprieties in the rate bureau process.
    (c) Absent Commission approval, no other changes may be made in any 
approved agreement.
    (d) For the purposes of the statute, the following definitions shall 
apply:
    (1) A general increase is a proposed general adjustment of 
substantially all the rates published in a rate bureau's tariff(s).
    (2) A broad change in tariff structure modifies in a relatively non-
uniform fashion the relationship between most

[[Page 359]]

rates published in a rate bureau's tariff, and applies to a large area, 
either nationally or regionally.
    (3) An innovative fare will be determined on a case-by-case basis; 
the Commission will, on request, issue opinions on whether particular 
rate proposals may be regarded as innovative. Two examples of an 
innovative fare are:
    (i) A fare for unlimited passenger travel; and
    (ii) An experimental fare providing for transportation at the 
passenger's option over the line of one or more carriers.
    (4) A promotional fare generally has three characteristics:
    (i) Limited duration;
    (ii) Attractive price or level of service quality; and
    (iii) Some added feature in addition to those normally offered.
