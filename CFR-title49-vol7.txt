                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, October 1, 1998), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

OBSOLETE PROVISIONS

    Provisions that become obsolete before the revision date stated on 
the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text 
of provisions in effect on a given date in the past by using the 
appropriate numerical list of sections affected. For the period before 
January 1, 1986, consult either the List of CFR Sections Affected, 1949-
1963, 1964-1972, or 1973-1985, published in seven separate volumes. For 
the period beginning January 1, 1986, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Statutory 
Authorities and Agency Rules (Table I), and Acts Requiring Publication 
in the Federal Register (Table II). A list of CFR titles, chapters, and 
parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are 
also included in this volume.
    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

<R05>
Sec. 1200.1  Financial statements released by carriers.

    Carriers desiring to do so may prepare and publish financial 
statements in reports to stockholders and others, except in reports to 
this Board, based on generally accepted accounting principles for which 
there is authoritative support, provided that any variance from this 
Board's prescribed accounting rules contained in such statements is 
clearly disclosed in footnotes to the statements.

[32 FR 20123, Dec. 20, 1967]


<R05>
Sec. 1200.2  Adoption of generally accepted accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

    (a) Accounting Series Circulars. Following the release of a 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards by the FASB, and provided 
that the Bureau of Accounts of the Board considers such standards 
appropriate for the Board's accounting regulations, the Bureau of 
Accounts shall issue an Accounting Series Circular (ASC) requiring 
carriers under the Board's jurisdiction to follow the new standards in 
their accounts and reports filed with the Board. The Bureau shall also 
specify in the ASC the proper accounting procedures that the carriers 
shall follow.
    (b) Carriers' and Interested Parties' Comments on the ASC. The ASC 
issued by the Bureau of Accounts will remain effective until revoked by 
the Bureau of Accounts. After an ASC is issued, the Bureau of Accounts 
shall allow carriers and interested parties 45 days following the 
service date of the ASC during which the respondents may submit to the 
Bureau their comments and reasons either supporting or opposing the ASC.
    (c) Formal Adoption of the New Accounting Standards. After 
considering the comments submitted in response to the ASC, and based on 
the proposal of the Bureau of Accounts, the Board will decide whether or 
not to adopt the new accounting standards specified in the ASC by 
revising the Uniform Systems of Accounts, (49 CFR 1201 through 1210).
    (d) Accounting Standards Not Appropriate for Board's Use. The Bureau 
of Accounts may determine that a new FASB Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards is not appropriate for use by carriers under the 
Board's jurisdiction. In such instances, the Bureau shall issue an ASC 
to advise the carriers that the new standards shall not be used in their 
reports filed with the Board. The carriers and interested parties shall 
be allowed 45 days following the ASC's service date to submit comments 
to the Board. The Board will then determine whether or not to revise the 
Uniform Systems of Accounts to conform to the new accounting standards.

                    List of Instructions and Accounts


<R03>
REGULATIONS PRESCRIBED--Table of Contents

<R05>


    (i) Regulations prescribed. Carriers by railroad subject to 
provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act and not independently operated 
as electric lines, and each lessor of such a carrier, shall comply with 
regulations in this part as presented hereinafter.
    (ii) Definitions.
    1. Abandonment means the withdrawal from transportation service of a 
branch line or other track segment or facility, representing a permanent 
reduction in plant.
    2. Accounts means the accounts prescribed in this system of 
accounts.
    3. Actually issued as applied to funded debt securities or capital 
stock issued or assumed by the company, means those which have been sold 
to bona fide purchasers or holders for a valuable consideration 
(including those issued in exchange for other securities or other 
property) and such purchasers or holders secured them free from control 
by the carriers. Also securities issued as dividends on stock.
    4. Actually outstanding as applied to funded debt securities or 
capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier means those which have 
been actually issued and are neither retired and canceled nor reacquired 
and held by or for the accounting company.
    5. (a) Affiliated companies means companies or persons that 
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries control, or 
are controlled by, or are under common control with, the accounting 
carrier.
    (b) Control (including the terms controlling, controlled by, and 
under common control with) means the possession directly or indirectly, 
of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and 
policies of a company, whether such power is exercised through one or 
more intermediary companies, or alone, or in conjunction with, or 
pursuant to an agreement, and whether such power is established through 
a majority of minority ownership or voting of securities, common 
directors, officers or stockholders, voting trusts, holding trusts, 
associated companies, contract or any other direct or indirect means.
    6. Amortization means the gradual extinguishment of an amount in an 
account by distributing such amount over a fixed period dependent on the 
requirements of regulatory bodies, over the life of the asset or 
liability to which it applies, or over the period during which it is 
anticipated the benefit will be realized.
    7. Carrier as used herein and when not otherwise indicated in the 
context means any carrier to which this system of accounts is 
applicable.
    8. Consolidation means the formation of a new company. See 
instruction 2-15.
    9. Board means the Surface Transportation Board.
    10. Compensating balance means the portion of any demand deposit (or 
any time deposit or certificate of deposit) maintained by a carrier (or 
by any person on behalf of the carrier) which constitutes support for 
existing borrowing arrangements of the carrier with a lending 
institution. Such arrangements include both outstanding borrowings and 
the assurance of future credit availability. (The compensating balance 
requirement should be adjusted by the amount of float unless such 
adjustment would cause the compensating balance to be greater than the 
cash balance per carrier's books.) The float adjustment is made by 
subtracting the float from the compensating balance requirement if the 
collected bank ledger balance exceeds the cash balance per carrier's 
books or by adding the float to the compensating balance requirement if 
the collected bank ledger balance is less than the cash balance per 
carrier's books.
    (a) Float means deposits and withdrawals in transit which constitute 
a difference between the collected bank ledger balance and the cash 
balance per carrier's books.
    11. Cost center refers to an organizational subdivision for which 
cost data are desired and for which provision is made to accumulate 
costs such as a terminal, yard, or track segment. A

[[Page 12]]

cost center may correspond to a given area of responsibility for which 
costs are presently accumulated for planning and control. A cost center 
is the smallest segment of activity or area of responsibility for which 
costs are accumulated and directly traceable.
    12. Cost of renewal means the cost of additional material applied 
(other than the value assigned second-hand parts remaining in the 
rebuilt unit) plus the cost of labor used in the rebuilding process, 
exclusive of the portion applicable to dismantling and repair of old 
parts reused.
    13. Cost of removal means cost of demolishing, dismantling, tearing 
down or otherwise removing property.
    14. Debt issue cost means all costs in connection with the issuance 
and sale of evidences of debt, such as fees for drafting mortgages and 
trust deeds; fees for issuing or recording evidences of debt; cost of 
engraving and printing bonds and certificates of indebtedness; fees paid 
trustees, specific costs of obtaining governmental authority; fees for 
legal services; fees and commissions paid underwriters, brokers and 
salespeople for marketing such evidences for debt; fees and costs of 
listing on exchanges; and other like costs.
    15. Discount as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock 
issued or assumed by the carrier, means the excess of the par or face 
value of the securities plus interest or dividends accrued at the date 
of the sale over the cash value of the consideration received from their 
sale.
    16. Equity security encompasses any instrument representing 
ownership shares (e.g., common, preferred and other capital stock), or 
the right to acquire (e.g., warrants, rights, and call options) or 
dispose of (e.g., put options) ownership shares in an enterprise at 
fixed or determinable prices. The term does not encompass preferred 
stock that by its terms either must be redeemed by the issuing 
enterprise or is redeemable at the option of the investor, nor does it 
include treasury stock or convertible bonds.
    (a) Marketable, as applied to an equity security, means an equity 
security as to which sales prices or bid and ask prices are currently 
available on a national securities exchange (i.e., those registered with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission) or in the over-the-counter 
market. In the over-the-counter market, an equity security shall be 
considered marketable when a quotation is publicly reported by the 
National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotations System 
or by the National Quotations Bureau, Inc. (provided, in the latter 
case, that quotations are available from at least three dealers). Equity 
securities traded in foreign markets shall be considered marketable when 
such markets are of a breadth and scope comparable to those referred to 
above. This definition is not met by restricted stock (securities for 
which sale is restricted by a governmental or contractual requirement 
except where such requirement terminates within one year or where the 
holder has the power to cause the requirement to be met within one 
year). Any portion of the stock which can reasonably be expected to 
qualify for sale within one year, such as may be the case under Rule 144 
or similar rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is not 
considered restricted.
    (b) Market value refers to the aggregate of the market price of a 
single share or unit times the number of shares or units of each 
marketable equity security in the portfolio. When an equity has taken 
positions involving short sales, sales of calls, and purchases of puts 
for marketable equity securities and the same securities are included in 
the portfolio, those contracts shall be taken into consideration in the 
determination of market value of the marketable equity securities.
    (c) Cost, as applied to a marketable equity security, refers to the 
original cost unless a new cost basis has been assigned based on 
recognition of an impairment of value that was deemed other than 
temporary or as the result of a transfer between current and noncurrent 
classifications. In such cases, the new cost basis assigned shall be 
considered cost.
    17. (a) Income taxes means taxes based on income determined under 
provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code and foreign, state 
and other taxes (including franchise taxes) based on income.

[[Page 13]]

    (b) Income tax expense means the amount of income taxes (whether or 
not currently payable or refundable) allocable to a period in the 
determination of net income.
    (c) Pretax accounting income means income or loss for a period, 
exclusive of related income tax expense.
    (d) Taxable income means the excess of revenues over deductions or 
the excess of deductions over revenue to be reported for income tax 
purposes for a period.
    (e) Timing differences means differences between the periods in 
which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they 
enter into the determination of pretax accounting income. Timing 
differences originate in one period and reverse or turn around in one or 
more subsequent periods. Some timing differences reduce income taxes 
that would otherwise be payable currently; others increase income taxes 
that would otherwise be payable currently.
    (f) Permanent differences means differences between taxable income 
and pretax accounting income arising from transactions that, under 
applicable tax laws and regulations, will not be offset by corresponding 
differences or turn around in other periods.
    (g) Tax effects means differentials in income taxes of a period 
attributable to (1) revenue or expense transactions which enter into the 
determination of pretax accounting income in one period and into the 
determination of taxable income in another period, (2) deductions or 
credits that may be carried backward or forward for income tax purposes 
and (3) adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to other 
stockholders' equity accounts which enter into the determination of 
taxable income in a period but which do not enter into the determination 
of pretax accounting income of that period. A permanent difference does 
not result in a tax effect as that term is used in this definition.
    (h) Deferred taxes means tax effects which are deferred for 
allocation to income tax expense of future periods.
    (i) Interperiod tax allocation means the process of apportioning 
income taxes among periods.
    (j) Tax allocation within a period means the process of apportioning 
income tax expenses applicable to a given period between income before 
extraordinary items and extraordinary items, and of associating the 
income tax effects of adjustments of prior periods and direct entries to 
other stockholders' equity accounts with these items.
    18. (a) Investor means a business entity that holds an investment in 
voting stock of another company.
    (b) Investee means a corporation that issued voting stock held by an 
investor.
    (c) Corporate joint venture is a company owned and operated as a 
separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the 
members of the group. Joint facilities for purposes of this system of 
accounts are not considered corporate joint ventures.
    (d) Dividends when applied to distributions received from investees 
unless otherwise specified, means dividends received or receivable in 
cash, other assets, or another class of stock and does not include stock 
dividends or stock splits.
    (e) Earnings or losses of an investee and financial position of an 
investee refer to net income (or net loss) and financial position of an 
investee determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles.
    (f) Undistributed earnings of an investee means net income less 
dividends declared whether received or not.
    (g) Date of acquisition is the date on which the investor assumes 
the rights of ownership. Ordinarily, this is the date assets are 
received and other assets are given or securities issued.
    19. Joint facility means any owned or leased carrier operating 
property occupied or operated jointly by the carrier and one or more 
other carriers, under an arrangement whereby the cost and income are 
apportioned to the parties to the joint agreement. Portions of a 
structure or other property used exclusively by each of two or more 
carriers are not joint facilities.
    20. Ledger value of an account means the undepreciated or 
unamortized cost of acquisition of the item to the carrier, recorded in 
the general ledger. In case the cost of any item of property is

[[Page 14]]

not shown separately in the ledger, the ledger value of that item shall 
be its proportionate share of the value of the entire group in which the 
particular property is included.
    21. Merger means the acquisition of one company by another. See 
instruction 2-15.
    22. Minor items of property means the associated parts or items of 
which units of property are composed.
    23. Net railway operating income: Operating revenue remaining after 
deducting operating expenses, income taxes on ordinary income, and the 
provision for deferred income taxes. Also, in arriving at NROI, deduct 
the Income from Lease of Road and Equipment and add the Rent for Leased 
Road and Equipment, formerly accounts 509 and 542, respectively.
    24. Net salvage value means salvage value of property retired less 
the cost of removal.
    25. Nominally issued as applied to funded debt securities or capital 
stock issued or assumed by the carrier, means those which have been 
signed, certified by trustees, or otherwise executed, and placed with 
the proper officer for sale and delivery, or pledged, or otherwise 
placed in some special fund of the accounting company, but which have 
not been sold or issued directly to the trustees of such fund in 
accordance with contractual requirements.
    26. Nominally outstanding as applied to funded debt securities or 
capital stock issued or assumed by the carrier, means those which, after 
being actually issued, have been reacquired by or for the accounting 
company under such circumstances which require them to be considered as 
held alive and not retired and canceled.
    27. Premium as applied to funded debt securities or capital stock 
issued or assumed by the carrier, means the excess of the cash value of 
the consideration received from their sale over the sum of their par 
(stated value of no par stock) or face value and interest or dividends 
accrued at the date of sale.
    28. Programmed track replacements are costs incurred as part of a 
track replacement program or planned expenditures. Programmed track 
replacements are generally performed by relatively large work gangs 
which, on the basis of programmed and authorized work orders, use heavy 
mechanized equipment to replace rail, ties and other track material. For 
guidance on what not to capitalize, see the notes to the text of 
Accounts 8, 9 and 11.
    29. Property retired means units of property which have been 
removed, sold, abandoned, destroyed, or which for any cause have been 
permanently withdrawn from service; also minor items of property not 
replaced.
    30. Rail Transportation Property. Rail transportation property is 
all property and other assets, irrespective of ownership, that comprise 
the entire operating unit devoted to rail transportation service. This 
definition comprises the following accounts:

701  Cash
703  Special deposits
704  Loans and notes receivable
705  Accounts receivable--interline and other balances
706  Accounts receivable--customers
707   Accounts receivable--other
708.5  Receivable with affiliated companies
709  Accrued accounts receivable
710  Working funds
711  Prepayments
712  Material and supplies
713  Other current assets
714  Deferred income tax charges
731  Road and equipment property
732  Improvements on leased property

    31. Salvage value means the amount received from the sale of 
operating property retired less any expenses in connection with the sale 
or in preparing the property for sale. If the property is retained for 
reuse, the salvage value shall be recorded in account 712, Materials and 
Supplies, or other appropriate account at an amount not to exceed its 
recorded cost (actual or average), or current market value, whichever is 
lower.
    32. Segment of a business refers to a component of an entity whose 
activities represent a separate major line of business or class of 
customer. A segment may be in the form of a subsidiary, a division, or a 
department, and in some cases a joint venture or other non-subsidiary 
investee, provided that its assets, results of operations, and 
activities can be clearly distinguished, physically and operationally 
and for financial reporting purposes, from the other assets, results of 
operations, and

[[Page 15]]

activities of the entity. The fact that the results of operations of the 
segment being sold or abandoned cannot be separately identified strongly 
suggests that the transaction should not be classified as a disposal of 
a segment of business.
    (a) Measurement date means the date on which the management having 
authority to approve the action commits itself to a formal plan to 
dispose of a segment of the business, whether by abandonment or sale. 
The measurement date for disposals requiring Commission approval shall 
be the service date of the Order authorizing the disposal.
    (b) Disposal date refers to the date of closing the sale, if the 
disposal is by sale or the date that operations cease if the disposal is 
by abandonment.
    33. Service life means the period between the date when operating 
property is placed in service and the date of its retirement.
    34. Service value means the ledger value of operating property less 
its salvage value (see definition 17).
    35. Track maintenance is material and labor costs of routine track 
repairs such as sporadic tie replacement, repair of broken rails, 
tightening track bolts and track spikes. A more complete list of 
maintenance items are included in notes to the text of Accounts 8, 9 and 
11.
    36. Work equipment means equipment which can be coupled in a train 
for movement over the carrier's tracks, and which is used in the 
carrier's work service. See equipment listing for account 57, Work 
equipment.

    1-1  Classification of carriers. (a) For purposes of accounting and 
reporting, carriers are grouped into the following three classes:
    Class I: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $250 
million or more after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula 
shown in Note A.
    Class II: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of less 
than $250 million but in excess of $20 million after applying the 
railroad revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.
    Class III: Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues of $20 
million or less after applying the railroad revenue deflator formula 
shown in Note A.
    (b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by 
annual carrier operating revenues after the railroad revenue deflator 
adjustment. Upward and downward reclassification will be effected as of 
January 1 in the year immediately following the third consecutive year 
of revenue qualification.
    (2) If a Class II or Class III carrier's classification is changed 
based on three years' adjusted revenues the carrier shall complete and 
file the Classification Index Survey Form with the Commission by March 
31 of the year following the end of the period to which it relates.
    (3) Newly organized carriers shall be classified on the basis of 
their annual carrier operating revenues after railroad revenue deflator 
adjustment for the latest period of operation. If actual data are not 
available, new carriers shall be classified on the basis of their 
carrier operating revenues known and estimated for a year (after 
railroad revenue deflator adjustment).
    (4) When a business combination occurs, such as a merger, 
reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be 
reclassified effective January 1 of the next calendar year on the basis 
of the combined revenue for the year when the combination occurred 
(after railroad revenue deflator adjustment).
    (5) In unusual circumstances, such as partial liquidation and 
curtailment or elimination of contracted services, where regulations 
will unduly burden the carrier, the carrier may request the Board for an 
exception to the regulations. This request shall be in writing 
specifying the conditions justifying an exception.
    (c) Class I carriers shall keep all of the accounts of this system 
which are applicable to their operations. Class II and III carriers are 
not required to maintain the accounts of this system.

[[Page 16]]

    (d) All switching and terminal companies, regardless of their 
operating revenues will be designated Class III carriers.
    (e) Unless provided for otherwise, all electric railway carriers, 
regardless of operating revenues, will be designated Class III carriers.
    Note A: The railroad revenue deflator formula is based on the 
Railroad Freight Price Index developed by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. The formula is as follows:

Current Year's Revenues  x  (1991 Average Index/Current Year's Average 
Index)
    Note B: See related regulations 49 CFR 1241.15 Railroad 
classification survey form.

[57 FR 27185, June 18, 1992; 57 FR 31754, July 17, 1992]

    1-2  Classification of accounts. (a) Accounts are prescribed to 
cover cost of property used in transportation operations and operations 
incidental thereto and for revenues, expenses, taxes, rents, and other 
items of income for such operations. Separate accounts are prescribed 
for investment in property not used in transportation operations and for 
other investments and income therefrom; for unusual and infrequent 
items; for operations and disposal of discontinued segments; for 
extraordinary items and accounting changes; and for assets, liabilities 
and capital includable in the balance sheet statement. Retained earnings 
accounts form the connecting link between the income account and the 
equity section of the balance sheet. They are provided to record the 
transfer of net income or loss for the year; certain capital 
transactions; and, when authorized by the Board, other items.
    (b) The cost of property, and the revenues, expenses, taxes and 
rents for miscellaneous operations involving the use of such facilities 
as hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, storage warehouses, power 
plants, cold storage plants, etc., shall not be included in the accounts 
prescribed for transportation operations unless the operation of the 
facilities is conducted by the railway companies in connection with 
furnishing transportation services. Likewise, the cost of property, the 
revenues, expenses, taxes, and rents arising from the operation of 
stockyards shall not be included in accounts prescribed for 
transportation operations unless operation of the facilities is 
conducted in connection with transportation of livestock. It is not 
intended that cost of property and income arising from incidental public 
stockyards service rendered by stockyards primarily devoted to 
transportation services shall be excluded from transportation operation 
accounts.
    (c) Joint facility accounts are provided for the joint users of 
tracks, bridges, yards, wharves, stations, and other facilities in which 
to record items in settlement for use of such facilities. When the 
compensation for the use of facilities is a fixed amount or is based 
upon a charge per passenger, ton, car or other unit, the amount shall be 
fairly apportioned by the operating company among the joint facility 
operating expense and income accounts. The creditor shall show the 
distribution of these charges upon its bills, and such distribution 
shall be adhered to by the debtor. Train service in connection with the 
line haul of traffic, including that operated under a joint arrangement 
for the benefit of two or more carriers, is not considered a joint 
facility operation.
    (d)(1) Extraordinary Items. All items of profit and loss recognized 
during the year are includable in ordinary income unless evidence 
clearly supports their classification as extraordinary items.
    Extraordinary items are characterized by both their unusual nature 
and infrequent occurrence taking into account the environment in which 
the firm operates; they must also meet the materiality standard.
    Unusual means the event or transaction must possess a high degree of 
abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally 
related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity.
    Infrequent occurrence means the event or transaction shall be of a 
type not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future.
    (2) Unusual or Infrequent Items. Material events unusual in nature 
or infrequent in occurrence but not both, thus not meeting both criteria 
for classification as extraordinary, shall be includable in the accounts 
provided as separate components of income/expense from continuing 
operations.

[[Page 17]]

    (3) Discontinued Operations. The results of continuing operations 
shall be reported separately from discontinued operations and any gain 
or loss resulting from disposal of a segment of a business (see 
definition 23(a)) shall be reported in conjunction with the related 
results of discontinued operations and not as an extraordinary item. The 
disposal of a segment of a business shall be distinguished from other 
disposals of assets incident to the evolution of the entity's business, 
such as the disposal of part of a line of business, the shifting of 
production or marketing activities for a particular line of business 
from one location to another, the phasing out of a product line or class 
of service, and other changes occasioned by technological improvements. 
If a loss is expected from the proposed sale or abandonment of a 
segment, the estimated loss shall be provided for at the measurement 
date (see definition 23(b)). If a gain is expected, it shall be 
recognized when realized, which ordinarily is the disposal date (see 
definition 23(c)).
    (4) Prior period adjustments. Only the following two items of profit 
and loss shall be accounted for and reported as prior period adjustments 
and excluded from the determination of net income for the current 
period:
    (1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior 
period, and
    (2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits 
of preacquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased 
subsidiaries.
    With the exception of the two items just mentioned, all items of 
profit and loss recognized during a period shall be included in the 
determination of net income for that period.
    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules is needed or obtain an 
interpretation from its public accountant or the Board.
    (5) Accounting Changes. Errors in financial statements result from 
mathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting 
principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the 
financial statements were prepared. In contrast, a change in an 
accounting estimate results from new information or subsequent 
developments and from better insight or judgment. Correction of an error 
should be accomplished through a prior period adjustment [See 
Instruction 1-2(d)(4)]. Changes in an accounting estimate should be 
accounted for in the period of change (and future period if the change 
affects both)(See Instruction 1-7). A change in an accounting principle 
or accounting entity should be referred to this Board for approval. The 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should ordinarily 
be reflected in the account provided for in determining net income.
    (6) Materiality. As a general standard an item shall be considered 
material when it exceeds 10 percent of annual income (loss) before 
extraordinary items. An item may also be considered in relation to the 
trend of annual earnings before extraordinary items or other appropriate 
criteria. Items shall be considered individually and not in the 
aggregate in determining materiality. However, the effects of a series 
of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable 
event or plan of action shall be aggregated to determine materiality.
    (7) Board Approval and Accountant's Letter. Items shall be included 
in the accounts provided for extraordinary items, unusual or infrequent 
items, discontinued operations, prior period adjustments and cumulative 
effect of changes in accounting principles only upon approval of the 
Board. If the carrier retains the service of an independent accountant, 
a request for using these accounts shall be accompanied by a letter from 
the independent accountant approving or otherwise commenting on the 
request.
    Note: The carrier may refer to generally accepted accounting 
principles for further guidance in applying paragraph (d) above.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977 as amended at 43 FR 37455, Aug. 23, 1978; 52 
FR 4321, 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-3  Records. (a) Each carrier shall keep its books of account, and 
all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in 
such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full 
information as to any item included in any account. Each entry

[[Page 18]]

shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready 
identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant 
thereto.
    (b) All expenditures including the expense accounts of officers and 
employees shall be supported by vouchers, payrolls, receipted bills, 
canceled checks, receipts for petty cash payments, or other evidences of 
the expenditures incurred.
    (c) The books referred to herein include not only books of accounts 
in a limited technical sense but all other records such as minute books, 
stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which will be 
useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.
    (d) No carrier shall destroy any books, records, memoranda, etc., 
which support entries to its accounts unless destruction is permitted by 
the regulations governing preservation of records, Part 1220 of this 
chapter.
    (e) In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary 
accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts may be kept, provided the 
integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
    (f) Cost detail shall be maintained by cost centers for purposes of 
cost assignments effective 1-1-79. This provides for cost control and 
cost planning at any designated area of responsibility. These cost 
centers shall be similarly defined as the railroads' existing 
responsibility centers. Cost center information shall therefore be kept 
at the same level of detail presently collected, categorized, and 
maintained in railroad internal managerial accounting systems. This 
detailed information shall not be reported to the Board on an ongoing 
basis. However, the carrier shall keep the detailed information to 
provide a ready analysis and verification of the costs collected by cost 
center.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987; 61 
FR 9113, Mar. 7, 1996]

    1-4  Accounting period. (a) Each carrier shall keep its books on a 
monthly basis so that known transactions, as nearly as may be 
ascertained, shall be entered in the accounts not later than 60 days 
after the last day of the period for which the accounts are stated, 
except that the time within which the final entries for the year ending 
December 31 shall be made may be extended to such date in the following 
March as shall not interfere with the preparation and filing of annual 
report.
    (b) A trial balance of the general ledger accounts shall be prepared 
at the close of each month setting out the account number, title, and 
amount of each ledger account. (Mechanical, electronic or automatic data 
processing printout documentation producing the equivalent of manually 
prepared trial balances shall identify balances by account numbers.) At 
the end of the calendar year, the revenue, expense, and other income 
accounts shall be closed into retained earnings account, and the balance 
sheet account balances shall be brought forward to the general ledger 
for the succeeding year.
    (c) No changes shall be made in the accounts for periods covered by 
quarterly and annual reports that have been filed with the Board unless 
the changes have first been authorized by the Board.
    1-5  Accrual method of accounting. The accounting for operating 
revenues, operating expenses, income and other items each month and year 
shall be, as nearly as practicable, upon the basis of accruals 
consistently applied. Any change in practice of accounting for accruals 
or any unusual accruals involving material amounts shall be reported 
promptly to the Board.
    1-6  Charges to be just and reasonable. All charges to the accounts 
prescribed in this system of accounts for carrier property, operating 
revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, and other carrier 
expenses, shall be just, reasonable and not exceed amounts necessary to 
the honest and efficient operation and management of carrier business. 
Payments shall not exceed the fair market value of goods and services 
acquired in an arm's length transaction. Any payments in excess of such 
just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 551, 
Miscellaneous income charges.
    1-7  Changes in accounting estimates. Changes in accounting estimate 
arising during the current year which are applicable to prior years 
shall be included in the same account which would have

[[Page 19]]

been charged or credited if the item had been taken up or the adjustment 
made in the year to which it pertained. [See Instruction 1-2(d)(5) for 
Accounting Changes].

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-8  Accounting for computer systems and word processing costs. (a) 
Capitalized costs for computer systems and word processing equipment 
shall be charged to property account 59, when such costs are not 
dedicated to a particular function (See Account 59). Related 
depreciation expenses for capitalized costs shall be charged to account 
62-23-00, Depreciation, Other Equipment.
    (b) Repair and maintenance costs related to computer systems and 
word processing equipment shall be charged to function 46 of the Other 
equipment subactivity by appropriate natural expense (labor, material, 
purchased services, other). Repairs performed by an outside company 
shall be charged to operating expense account 39-23-46.
    (c) Operating costs related to computer systems and word processing 
equipment shall be charged to function 87, Management services and data 
and word processing, when the equipment benefits more than one activity. 
When the equipment benefits one activity only, such operating costs 
shall be charged to the activity/function benefited.

[52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-9  Transactions with affiliated companies. (a) The records and 
supporting data of all transactions with affiliated companies shall be 
maintained in a separate file. The types of transactions referred to in 
this paragraph are for management services or any other type of services 
rendered, sale or use of facilities or any other type of assets or 
property. The file shall be maintained so as to enable the carrier, upon 
a Board request, to furnish accurate information with supporting 
documentation about particular transactions within 15 days of the 
request. We do not intend the file to include data relating to ordinary 
carrier operations (e.g. lawful tariff charges or interchange of 
equipment).
    (b) Each bill rendered by an affiliated company shall state 
specifically the basis used for determining charges, unless the file 
contains the information to support the specific basis for charges.
    (c) Punched cards, magnetic tapes, discs, or other machine-sensible 
devices used for recording, consolidating, and summarizing accounting 
transactions and records with a carrier's electronic or automatic data 
processing system may constitute a file within the meaning of this 
instruction.
    (d) The carrier shall record, as the cost of assets or services 
received from an affiliated supplier, the invoice price (plus any 
incidental costs related to those transactions) in those cases where the 
invoice price can be determined from a prevailing price list of the 
affiliated supplier available to the general public in the normal course 
of business. If no such price list exists, the charges shall be recorded 
at the lower of their cost to the originating affiliated supplier (less 
all applicable valuation reserves in case of asset sales, or their 
estimated fair market value determined on the basis of a representative 
study of similar competitive and arm's-length or bargained transaction. 
Any difference between actual transaction price and the above, as well 
as charges that are not transportation related, shall be considered of a 
financing nature and shall be recorded, accordingly, as nonoperating 
charges or credits. (See instruction 1-6.)
    (e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as restraining the 
carrier from subdividing accounts (see instruction I-3(e)) for the 
purpose of recording separately transactions with affiliated companies.
    (f) Carriers reporting information on a consolidated or combined 
basis in railroad Annual Report Form R-1 shall maintain a file with 
appropriate records and supporting data. This shall include work sheets 
showing revenues, expenses, earnings, investment in assets and 
accumulated depreciation for all affiliated railroads and rail-related 
affiliated companies. The work sheets shall also disclose any 
eliminations. Carriers shall also disclose the methodology used to 
support segregation of

[[Page 20]]

rail-related or other items as appropriate. Further, a file shall be 
maintained to support and reconcile entity sales, transfers and 
reclassifications as well as taxes deducted from gains or losses.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 53 FR 46620, Nov. 18, 1988]

    1-10  Accounting for income taxes. (a) The interperiod tax 
allocation method of accounting shall be applied where material timing 
differences (see definition 20(e)) occur between pretax accounting 
income and taxable income. Carriers may elect, as provided by the 
Revenue Act of 1971, to account for the investment tax credit by either 
the flow through method or the deferred method of accounting. See 
paragraphs (d) and (e) below. All income taxes (Federal, state and 
other) currently accruable for income tax return purposes shall be 
charged to account 556, Income taxes on ordinary income, and account 
590, Income Taxes on Extraordinary Items, as applicable.
    (b) Under the interperiod tax allocation method of accounting the 
tax effect of timing differences (see definition 20) originating in the 
current accounting period are allocated to income tax expense of future 
periods when the timing differences reverse. Similar timing differences 
originating and reversing in the current accounting period should be 
combined into groups and the current tax rates applied to determine the 
tax effect of each group. A carrier shall not apply other than current 
tax rates in determining the tax effect of reversing differences except 
upon approval of the Board. When determining the amount of deferred 
taxes, rather than computing state and other taxes individually by 
jurisdiction, the Federal income tax rate may be increased by a percent 
equivalent to the effect of taxes imposed by the jurisdictions. In 
classifying a deferred charge or credit as current or noncurrent a 
carrier shall follow the classification criteria used for the related 
asset or liability which caused the timing difference. A deferred charge 
or credit that is not related to an asset or liability because (a) there 
is no associated asset or liability or (b) reduction of an associated 
asset or liability will not cause the timing difference to reverse shall 
be classified based on the expected reversal date of the specific timing 
difference. Such classification disregards any additional timing 
differences that may arise and is based on the criteria used for 
classifying other assets and liabilities.
    (c) The future tax benefits of loss carryforwards shall normally be 
recognized in the year in which such loss is applied to reduce taxes. 
Only in those unusual instances when realization is assured beyond any 
reasonable doubt should the future tax benefits of loss carryforwards be 
recognized in the year of loss. The tax effects of any realizable loss 
carrybacks shall be recognized in the determination of net income (loss) 
of the loss periods; appropriate adjustments of existing net deferred 
tax credits may also be necessary in the loss period.
    (d) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by 
the flow through method shall credit account 556 Income taxes on 
ordinary income, or account 590, Income taxes on extraordinary items, as 
applicable, and charge account 760, Federal income taxes accrued, with 
the amount of investment tax credit utilized in the current accounting 
period. When the flow through method is followed for the investment tax 
credit, account 557, Provision for Deferred Taxes, shall reflect the 
difference between the tax payable (after recognition of allowable 
investment tax credit) based on taxable income and tax expense (with 
full recognition of investment tax credit that would be allowable based 
on accounting income) based on accounting income.
    (e) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by 
the deferred method shall concurrently with making the entries 
prescribed in (d) above charge account 557, Provision for deferred 
taxes, or account 591, Provision for deferred taxes--extraordinary item, 
as applicable, and shall credit account 786, Accumulated deferred income 
tax credits, with the investment tax credit utilized as a reduction of 
the current year's tax liability but deferred for accounting purposes. 
The investment tax credit so deferred shall be amortized by credits

[[Page 21]]

to account 557, Provision for deferred taxes.
    Note A: Any change in practice of accounting for the investment tax 
credit shall be reported promptly to the Board. Carriers desiring to 
clear deferred investment tax credits because of a change from the 
deferral method to the flow though method shall submit the proposed 
journal entry to the Board for consideration and advice.
    Note B: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the accounting rules for income 
taxes is needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant 
or the Board.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 47 FR 12350, Mar. 23, 1982; 52 
FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-11  Items in texts of accounts. The items appearing in the texts 
of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly 
indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The items are 
intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an 
item in the text of a primary account warrants the inclusion of the item 
in the account mentioned only when the whole text also indicates 
inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one 
primary account. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by 
the entire text of each primary account.
    1-12  Distribution of pay and expenses of employees. (a) The pay and 
expenses of officers or employees regularly assigned to specific duties 
who perform incidental services of a different nature involving small 
expense may be included in the appropriate expense accounts for the 
duties to which such officers or employees are regularly assigned.
    (b) When it is necessary to apportion the pay of officers and 
employees among various accounts, the carrier shall apportion the pay on 
the basis of the directly assignable pay to the various accounts.
    1-13  Payroll related expenses. (a) Fringe benefits (account series 
12-00-00) distributed to the activities using one of the following 
techniques (in order of preference):
    (1) Apply appropriate factors to the total of the fringe expense 
account, in such a way as to distribute an equitable proportion of cost 
to each activity. These factors shall be developed to take into account 
variables such as the following:
    (i) The effect of seniority on the expense. For example, profit 
sharing or pensions may be available to only certain categories of 
employees, which may be more predominant in one activity than another.
    (ii) The effect of the type of work performed. For example, 
workmen's compensation expense may vary for each category of employees 
because of the rate charged or the claims experience of the category.
    (iii) Any other variable which may have an appreciable effect on the 
equity of the apportionment.
    (2) Distribute the amount in the same proportion as the pay charged 
to each activity in account series 11-00-00 (salaries and wages).
    (3) Distribute the amounts using any other equitable basis which the 
carrier can substantiate.
    (b) All carriers shall be prepared to describe the basis of 
apportionment used to distribute expenses included in this instruction.
    (c) Any carrier which finds it impracticable to distribute expenses 
as required by this instruction should furnish the Board with full 
particulars of the conditions which prevent the proper distribution. 
Upon receipt of such information carrier will be advised of the 
procedure to be followed.
    1-14  Submission of questions. To maintain uniformity of accounting, 
carriers shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Board 
for consideration and decision.
    1-15  Transfers from government authorities. When a Federal, State, 
or municipal government transfers cash or other assets to a railroad, 
the transaction shall be accounted for in accordance with the provisions 
set forth hereunder.
    (a) The following forms of government transfers shall be included in 
account 502, Railway Operating Revenues--Transfers from Government 
Authorities for Current Operations when received:
    (1) Payments as reimbursement for operating losses sustained on a 
specific line, or in a certain region. Examples

[[Page 22]]

include support of commuter operations of a railroad, and local rail 
service assistance subsidies granted to a railroad under authority of 
the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976;
    (2) Subsidies designated by the donor to offset operating expenses 
of the railroad, and
    (3) Subsidies which may be applied at the discretion of the 
recipient to operating expenses and/or operating property.
    (b) Government transfers relating to the acquisition, addition to, 
or improvement of depreciable operating property shall be included in 
account 783, Deferred Revenues--Transfers from Government Authorities 
when received. Account 783 shall be periodically charged, and account 
503, Railway Operating Revenues--Amortization of Deferred Transfers from 
Government Authorities shall be credited with amounts equal to the 
depreciation costs of the assets to which they apply.
    (c) Government transfers in the form of, or designated for the 
purchase of nondepreciable operating property shall be included in 
account 796, Other Capital Surplus in the manner described in the text 
of that account.
    (d)(1) Transfers from the Federal Government to Amtrak and ConRail 
relating to the acquisitions, addition to, or improvement of depreciable 
or nondepreciable operating property shall be included in account 796 in 
the manner described in the text of that account.
    (2) Transfers from the Federal Government to Amtrak and ConRail 
other than those described in paragraph (d)(1) shall be accounted for in 
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
    (e) The provisions of this section do not apply to the following 
forms of government transfers:
    (1) Government contributions in connection with construction 
projects in which government agencies and railroads participate. 
Transfers of this type shall be accounted for in accordance with the 
provisions of instruction 2-17. Paragraph (b) of that instruction lists 
applicable construction projects.
    (2) Government payment for specific services rendered by the carrier 
in transporting property or persons by rail line other than services 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Such payments shall be 
included in account 501, Railway Operating Revenues (Exclusive of 
Transfers from Government Authorities).
    (3) Government transfers relating to other than carrier operations.
    (4) Government transfers in exchange for debt and/or equity 
securities of recipients.
    (f) Government transfers shall generally be recorded when made 
available to the railroad. However, transfers relating to specific 
operations shall be recorded as earned.
    (g) Government transfers in the form of assets other than cash shall 
be recorded at fair value when received.

[43 FR 30558, July 17, 1978, as amended at 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    1-16  Business entertainment expenses. (a) Business entertainment 
expenses are to be accounted for as operating expenses when incurred in 
conjunction with sales or marketing related activities. Sales or 
marketing related activities are those that emphasize a carrier's 
ability to provide efficient, timely and competitive service. These 
activities include outlays designed to promote new business as well as 
outlays incurred in maintaining existing business. The entertainment 
expenditures must be reasonable in relation to the business conducted 
and the business purpose for the entertainment must be adequately 
supported. Examples of this type of activity include the following:
    (1) Salespersons' salaries and travel expenses, advertising, 
promotional and educational material;
    (2) The conduct of shipper symposiums, conferences, meetings and 
traffic related functions;
    (3) The use of direct mail solicitations and the publication and 
distribution of routing guides and service directories;
    (4) Incidental promotional materials such as road atlases, 
calendars, pens, scratchpads, and other materials of nominal value;
    (5) The conduct of business oriented lunches and dinners, public 
affairs programming, conferences and customer service calls;

[[Page 23]]

    (6) Sponsoring sales promotion functions, involving a number of 
customers or potential customers.

It must be noted that an activity listed above is not to be 
automatically accounted for as an operating expense. A carrier must be 
able to justify that an activity was primarily sales or marketing 
related.
    (b) Business entertainment expenses are to be accounted for as non-
operating expenses when they cannot be shown to be related to the sales 
or marketing activity. These are expenses that are primarily related to 
recreation or to the convenience and comfort of the individuals rather 
than to the transaction of business. Examples of this type of activity 
include the following:
    (1) Recreational or resort entertainment, including but not limited 
to, fishing, hunting, tennis, golfing, skiing or other sporting or 
recreational trips or outings;
    (2) Expense paid transportation in any carrier owned, leased or 
furnished vehicles, planes, helicopters, boats, yachts, or other 
methods;
    (3) Expense paid lodging in any carrier owned, leased or furnished 
motels, hotels, apartments, condominiums, lodges, rooms and other places 
of overnight accommodation;
    (4) Paid admission to any sporting, cultural, educational, 
recreational, or entertaining occurrence or event;
    (5) Gifts such as athletic equipment, food or liquor, beverages of 
all types, smoking materials, clothing and personal accessories;
    (6) The furnishing of lunches, dinners, appetizers or beverages 
where there is no true business purpose;
    (7) Social occasions such as holiday parties.

It must be noted that an activity listed above is not to be 
automatically accounted for as a non-operating expense. If a carrier can 
justify that the activity was primarily sales or marketing related, it 
may be accounted for as an operating expense.
    Note: The examples listed above are not inclusive, but are intended 
as a guide to give carriers an indication of what will or will not be 
permitted to be recovered through the rate structure. In all instances 
the burden of proof will fall on the carrier involved.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPERTY ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    2-1  Items to be charged. (a) To the road and equipment property 
accounts shall be charged the cost of purchasing land, the cost of 
purchasing and constructing buildings, facilities and equipment, and the 
cost of additions and betterments to property, Cost means the amount of 
cash disbursed, or the fair value of other assets distributed, or the 
present value of amounts to be paid. Where the fair market value of 
resources given up (assets, services or items of stockholder's equity) 
is not clearly determinable, the cost may be determined by the fair 
market value of the resources acquired. The carrier shall be prepared to 
furnish the Board with the particulars of its method of determining cash 
value when the consideration is other than monetary. The amount of 
liabilities incurred with suppliers in the normal course of business, 
which are due in customary trade terms not exceeding approximately one 
year, shall be recorded at the maturity value. Acquisition date is the 
date title passes to the carrier.
    (b) The cost of road and equipment purchased under a plan involving 
other deferred payments (debt or capital lease) shall be recorded at the 
discounted present value of the payment, net of executory costs such as 
insurance, maintenance, and taxes. The interest rate used to discount 
the payments should be the prevailing market rate for similar debt 
instruments of issues with similar credit ratings. In any event, the 
rate used for valuation purposes will normally be at least equal to the 
rate at which the carrier can obtain financing of a similar nature from 
other sources at the date of

[[Page 24]]

the transaction (the carrier's incremental borrowing rate). In the case 
of a capital lease, when it is practical to ascertain the implicit rate 
computed by the lessor, and that rate is less than the carrier's 
incremental borrowing rate, the carrier should use the implicit rate. 
Acquisition date for a capital lease is the date the lease agreement is 
signed. If the property covered by the lease has yet to be constructed 
or has not been acquired by the lessor at the date the lease agreement 
or commitment is signed, the acquisition date shall be the date the 
property under construction is completed or the date the property not 
yet acquired is acquired by the lessor. (See Instruction 2-20.)
    (c) Where actually incurred, interest cost is to be added to the 
cost of road and equipment deemed qualifying assets during the period of 
time required to get them ready for their intended use (acquisition 
period). Qualifying assets are those that are (1) either constructed or 
otherwise produced for a carrier's own use (including assets constructed 
or produced for the carrier by others for which deposits or progress 
payments have been made) or (2) assets intended for sale or lease that 
are constructed or otherwise produced as discrete projects. The amount 
of interest to be capitalized for qualifying assets shall be based upon 
the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the asset during the 
acquisition period at the rate used on specific new borrowings 
associated with the qualifying asset. If average accumulated 
expenditures for the asset exceed the amount of specific new borrowings 
associated with the asset, the rate to be applied to such excess shall 
be a weighted average of the rates applicable to other borrowings of the 
enterprise. The total amount of interest cost capitalized in an 
accounting period shall not exceed the total amount of interest cost 
incurred by the enterprise during that period.
    (d) Suitable records shall be maintained showing expenditures during 
the year for original road and equipment and road extensions; for merger 
and purchase of existing lines and reorganizations; for additions and 
betterments; and credits for property retirement.
    (e) When the carrier exchanges road and equipment for other road and 
equipment with no other consideration involved, the road and equipment 
received shall be recorded at the ledger value of the road and equipment 
relinquished. Where the carrier receives a monetary consideration in the 
exchange, the carrier shall recognize gain on the exchange to the extent 
that the consideration received exceeds a proportionate share of the 
recorded cost of the road and equipment surrendered. The portion of the 
cost applicable to the realized amount shall be based on the ratio of 
the monetary consideration to the total consideration received (monetary 
consideration plus the estimate fair value of the road and equipment 
received) or, if more clearly evident, the fair value of the road and 
equipment transferred. Where the carrier pays a monetary consideration 
in the exchange, it shall not recognize any gain on the transaction but 
shall record the road and equipment received at the amount of the 
monetary consideration paid plus the recorded costs of the road and 
equipment surrendered. If a loss is indicated by the terms of an 
exchange transaction, the carrier shall recognize the entire loss on the 
exchange. Immaterial gains and losses on these exchanges shall be 
included in account 519, Miscellaneous Income, or 551, Miscellaneous 
Income Charges, as appropriate. Material amounts shall be recorded in 
accordance with Instruction 1-2(d).

[52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-2 Minimum rule applicable to additions to property. An exception 
to the rule in Instruction 2-1 is that when the cost of acquisition of 
units of road property and of additions to existing units of road 
property (other than land and tracks) is less than $5,000, such costs 
may be charged to operating expenses. This amount (rounded to the 
nearest $100) will be adjusted by the June Producer Price Index for all 
commodities when an aggregate adjustment is $500 or more. The revision 
will be published in the Federal Register and be effective as of January 
1 of the following year. The carrier shall not

[[Page 25]]

parcel expenditures under a general plan bringing the accounting for 
such expenditures within this minimum rule. An amount of less than the 
current minimum capitalization level, for the railroad as a whole or for 
individual property accounts may be adopted for purposes of this rule 
provided the carrier first notifies the Board of the amount it proposes 
to adopt and thereafter makes no change in the amount unless authorized 
by the Board. An amount adopted shall be adhered to in reporting 
property changes for valuation purposes.

[55 FR 42016, Oct. 17, 1990]

    2-3  Land. (a) Accounts are provided for the cost of land used in 
transportation operations and also for land used in other than 
transportation operations. When land is retired from transportation 
operations but is retained by the carrier the original cost (estimated, 
if not known) shall be transferred to the account prescribed for 
property used in other than transportation operations. It is not 
contemplated that irregular parcels of land acquired in connection with 
acquisition of right-of-way which have no value as commercial property 
shall be thus transferred, either for the purpose of making right-of-way 
boundaries run more or less regular or for the purpose of eliminating 
from transportation property account the cost of unoccupied lands 
between tracks in yards and terminals. When any land, the cost of which 
is included in the accounts, is sold or otherwise retired, the ledger 
value shall be credited to the appropriate property investment account. 
The profit or loss from sale or loss from retirement or land shall be 
included in the accounts prescribed for such amounts.
    (b) [Reserved]

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4324, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-4  Structures. Accounts are provided for the cost of several 
classes of buildings and facilities, including fixtures permanently 
attached to and made a part thereof. When a building or other structure 
is used or held primarily for transportation operations and is an 
integral part of the carrier's transportation plant, but a part thereof 
is used or held for commercial purposes such as for rental to others or 
for use in other than transportation operations by the carrier, the 
entire cost of the building or other structure is includable in the 
accounts for transportation property. When a building or other structure 
is used or held primarily for commercial purposes or for use in other 
than transportation operations by the carrier, the entire cost of the 
building or structure is includable in account 737, Property used in 
other than carrier operations. Reclassification of property from its 
primary classification as transportation or other than transportation 
property, as the case may be, to the other classification is not 
required where changes in use are of a temporary nature or for a short 
period of time. The accounting for costs of maintenance, taxes, other 
operating costs, and for revenues and rentals shall be consistent with 
the classification of the building or other structure.
    2-5  Equipment. Accounts are provided for several classes of 
equipment, such as locomotives, passenger-train cars, freight-train 
cars, highway revenue equipment, work equipment, floating equipment, and 
the necessary appurtenance, furniture, and fixtures first to equip for 
service, including the cost of inspection, setting up, and trying out, 
and transportation over foreign lines; also the cost of additions and 
betterments, such as improved appliances, parts, or appurtenances. When 
retired equipment is held without being torn down, the estimated value 
of the salvage therefrom shall be included in account 741, Other assets, 
until the salvage is recovered, except that the estimated scrap value of 
retired equipment held for sale in the ordinary course of business, and 
on which sale and realization of the proceeds within one year is 
assured, is includable in account 713, Other current assets.
    2-6  Components of construction cost. The cost of constructing 
property includable in the property accounts shall include the direct 
and other costs as described hereunder.
    (a) Cost of labor. This includes the amount paid for labor expended 
by the carrier's own employees, including the cost of labor expended for 
preliminary work, such as sinking test holes or

[[Page 26]]

making soundings for tunnels, grading, buildings, and other structures; 
and cost of labor expended in laying and taking up tracks for temporary 
use in construction, except the cost of labor expended on tracks 
provided for the protection of traffic during the progress of addition 
and betterment work. The cost of labor shall also include the accounting 
company's expenditures for associated fringe benefits, such as vacation 
and holiday pay, health and welfare group insurance, pensions and 
retirement plans, payroll taxes and unemployment insurance. Office 
expenses and traveling and other personal expenses of employees, when 
borne by the carrier, shall be considered a part of the cost of the 
labor, as shall also the cost of fidelity bonds and employer's liability 
insurance premiums. When officers or employees are especially assigned 
to construction work their pay and their traveling and incidental 
expenses while thus engaged shall be included in the cost of the work. 
No charge shall be made against road and equipment accounts for the pay 
of officers and employees who merely render services incidentally in 
connection with extensions, additions, or betterments, although 
traveling and incidental expenses incurred by such officers and 
employees solely on account of such work shall be included in the 
account to which the cost of the work is chargeable.
    (b) Cost of materials and supplies. This includes the purchase price 
of materials and supplies, including small tools, at the point of free 
delivery plus the cost of inspection and loading assumed by the carrier; 
a suitable proportion of store expenses; also sales and excise taxes on 
materials and supplies except as otherwise provided in the text of 
account 712, Material and supplies. In calculating the cost of materials 
used, proper allowance shall be made for the value of unused portions 
and of cuttings, turnings, borings, etc.; for the value of the material 
recovered from temporary tracks, scaffolding, cofferdams, and other 
temporary structures used in construction; and for the value of small 
tools recovered and used for other purposes.
    (c) Cost of work-train service. This includes amounts paid to others 
for rent and maintenance of equipment used; cost of labor of enginemen, 
trainmen, and enginehousemen, including wages of engine crews and train 
crews held in readiness for such service; and cost of fuel and other 
supplies consumed in connection with the operation of work trains. It 
shall also include the cost of maintaining the carrier's own equipment 
used in construction service. Amounts representing constructive rent or 
return upon the investment in owned equipment shall not be included as a 
part of the cost of work-train service.
    (d) Cost of special machine service. This includes the cost of labor 
expended and of materials and supplies consumed in maintaining and 
operating power shovels, scrapers, rail unloaders, ballast unloaders, 
pile drivers, dredges, ditchers, weed burners, and other labor-saving 
machines; also rents paid for use of such machines.
    (e) Cost of transportation. This includes the amounts paid to other 
companies or individuals for the transportation of men, materials and 
supplies, special machine outfits, appliances, and tools in connection 
with construction. Freight charges paid foreign lines for the 
transportation of construction material to the carrier's line shall be 
included, so far as practicable, as a part of the cost of the material.
    (f) Cost of contract work. This includes amounts paid for work 
performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, and 
costs incident to the award of the contract.
    (g) Cost of protection from casualties. This includes expenditures 
for protection against fire, such as payments for discovery or 
extinguishment of fires, cost of detecting and prosecuting incendiaries, 
witness fees in relation thereto, amounts paid to municipal corporations 
and other for fire protection, and other analogous items of expenditure 
incurred directly in connection with construction work.
    (h) Cost of injuries and damages. This includes expenditures on 
account of injuries to persons or damage to property when incurred 
directly as a result of

[[Page 27]]

construction projects, and shall be included in the cost of the work in 
connection with which the injury or damage occurs. It also includes that 
portion of premiums paid for insuring property applicable to the period 
prior to the completion or coming into service of the property insured. 
Insurance recovered on account of compensation paid for injuries to 
persons incident to construction shall be credited to the accounts to 
which such compensation is charged, and insurance recovered on account 
of damages to property incident to construction shall be credited to the 
accounts chargeable with the expenditures necessary for restoring the 
damaged property. The cost of injuries and damages incident to the 
removal of old structures, or parts thereof, shall be charged to 
operating expenses, except that such costs in connection with the 
removal of old structures which are incumberances on newly acquired 
lands shall be included in accounts 2, Land for transportation purposes, 
or 3, Grading, as appropriate.
    (i) Cost of privileges. This includes compensation for temporary 
privileges, such as the use of public property or streets, in connection 
with the construction of the property of the carrier.
    (j) Material excavated. The cost of disposing of material excavated 
in connection with construction shall be considered as a part of the 
cost of work, except that when such material is used for filling, the 
cost of removal and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the 
work in connection with which the removal occurs and the work in 
connection with which the material is used.
    (k) Interest cost. [See Instruction 2-1(c)].

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-7  Additions to and retirements of property--General. (a) In 
accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of road and 
equipment property (excluding land) used in transportation operations, 
such property changes shall be considered as consisting of: (1) Units of 
property, and (2) other than units of property as prescribed in 
Instruction 2-19. Track property changes will be distinguished by units 
of property as approved by the Commission.
    (b) The cost of removal of retired property, both depreciable and 
other than depreciable, when borne by the carrier, shall be charged, as 
appropriate, to account 11-13-39, Personnel--Salaries and Wages--Way and 
Structures--Other--Dismantling retired property, or 11-23-39. 
Personnel--Salaries and Wages--Equipment--Other Equipment--Dismantling 
retired property, and other appropriate accounts (including 
subactivities 11 and 12). <SUP>1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1</SUP> The references to solely related freight operating expense 
activity/subactivity numbers and titles used throughout the system are 
for convenience and brevity. Refer to the specific account texts to 
determine the appropriate solely related passenger and/or common expense 
activity/subactivity numbers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (c) An equitable proportion of a balance in property accounts 76, 
Interest During Construction, and 80, Other elements of investment, 
applicable to retired property shall be cleared from these accounts 
concurrently with the retirement accounting. Unless provided for 
otherwise, interest costs shall be capitalized in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
    (d) When retired property is held and not removed, the estimated 
value of the salvage therefrom shall be included in account 741, Other 
assets, until the salvage is recovered, except that the estimated scrap 
value of retired property held for sale in the ordinary course of 
business, and on which sale and realization of the proceeds within one 
year is assured, is includible in account 713, Other current assets.
    (e) The accounting for track additions and retirements (with and 
without replacement) shall be guided by Instruction 2-10.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 10920, Feb. 5, 1981; 48 
FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983; 49 FR 2254, Jan. 19, 1984; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 
1987]

    2-8  Additions to and retirements of units of property. (a) When a 
unit of road or equipment property is added to the plant, the cost 
thereof shall be included in the appropriate primary account. When a 
unit of property is retired, with or without replacement, the

[[Page 28]]

cost thereof shall be written out of the property account at time of 
retirement.
    (b) When a unit of road or equipment property (or a minor item not 
replaced) classified as depreciable and included in the accounts 
prescribed for depreciable property is retired the service value shall 
be charged to account 735, Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment 
property.
    (c) When road property (other than a minor item constituting 
repairs) classified as other than depreciable property is retired, the 
cost thereof shall be cleared from the property account and the service 
value shall be charged to account 61-13-99, General--Other Expenses--Way 
and Structures--Other--Other. When the retirement requires Board 
approval, the carrier shall clear the cost from the property account 
upon the effective date of the abandonment. Subactivities 11 and 12 also 
apply.
    (d) When property included in the depreciable accounts but excluded 
from the depreciation base is retired, the service value (including 
engineering expenditures assignable to retired property but not included 
in the depreciation base) shall be charged to operating expense.
    2-9 Additions and retirements of other than units of property. (a) 
When an item of road or equipment property, other than a complete unit, 
is added to the plant and the addition is not a replacement, the cost 
thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as an addition of a 
complete unit of property, subject to the minimum rule applicable to 
road property (see Instruction 2-2). When an item of property other than 
a complete unit (minor item) is replaced, independent of the complete 
unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be treated as 
maintenance and charged to operating expenses. If the replacement 
constitutes an improvement then the cost of replacement should be 
accounted for as a rebuilding expenditure under Instruction 2-12.
    (b) When second-hand property acquired is in such physical condition 
that it is necessary to rehabilitate the property to bring it up to the 
standard required by the carrier, the cost of such rehabilitation shall 
be included in the appropriate account for the property.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 55 FR 42016, Oct. 17, 1990]

    2-10  Additions to and retirements of track.
    (a) When track or its components are added to the plant, the cost 
shall be included in the track primary account. When track components 
are replaced as part of a track replacement program, the replacement 
cost shall be accounted for as an addition to the track property 
account. The cost of track components which are retired with or without 
replacement shall be written out of the track property account at the 
time of retirement.
    (b) When track is retired the service value (ledger value less net 
salvage) shall be charged to account 735, Accumulated depreciation; Road 
and equipment property.
    (c) All repairs of tracks shall be accounted for as operating 
expenses.
    (d) Track investment written out of the accounts shall be at 
original cost or estimated standard or average cost for that density 
category. Material to be reused shall be put in an investment pool at 
unrecovered cost and, when reused, included in the appropriate density 
category at the average cost of the investment pool.

[48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983]

    2-11  Expenses in connection with additions and betterments. The 
cost of removing old material from equipment and from buildings, 
bridges, wharves, tracks, and other fixed improvements, shall be charged 
to the appropriate operating expense accounts. Such charges shall 
include the cost of removing old foundations and filling old 
excavations, and restoring condition of grounds after addition and 
betterment work; and maintaining or protecting traffic during the 
progress of addition and betterment work, including the cost of 
constructing, maintaining, and removing temporary tracks required for 
maintaining traffic during the progress of the work.

[[Page 29]]


    2-12  Units of property rebuilt or converted--(a) Rebuilding 
expenditures. Carriers shall be governed by the following provisions 
when determining and accounting for depreciable road and equipment 
property rebuilding expenditures:
    (1) Rebuilding expenditures are those cost actually incurred which 
substantially extend the service life or substantially increase the 
utility of depreciable road and equipment property. The rebuilding 
expenditures shall be material in nature relative to the current 
replacement cost of a similar new unit of road or equipment property. 
Expenses resulting from delayed maintenance and repairs shall not be 
considered in determining materiality.
    (2) The phrase extend the service life means to extend the life of a 
property unit past its estimated service life.
    (3) The term increased utility means that the road or equipment 
property has become more useful, more efficient, more durable, or has 
greater capacity.
    (4) Rebuilt or converted road or equipment property shall be 
accounted for as an addition to the appropriate property accounts, with 
the old units accounted for as retired from service. The charge to the 
appropriate property accounts shall be composed of (i) the cost 
(estimated if necessary) less a fair allowance for depreciation, or 
salvage value, whichever is lower, of the parts reused, (ii) the cost of 
labor expended in rebuilding or in the conversion process, (iii) the 
cost of additional materials applied, and (iv) any other expenses 
incurred directly with the rebuilding or conversion. In no case shall 
the total amount charged to the property accounts for these units exceed 
the current replacement costs of similar new units that would be used 
for the same purpose. When a unit of road property or equipment is 
transferred from one class of service to another, with or without 
physical conversion, the unit shall be accounted for as retired from its 
original account and be recorded in a primary investment account 
appropriate to its new class of service.
    (5) If it is necessary to repair the secondhand or reused parts 
remaining in a rebuilt unit, the repair cost may be added to the value 
assigned parts in determining the related cost to be capitalized. 
Associated dismantling costs shall be included in operating expenses.
    (b) Repair expenses. Expenses pertaining to road and equipment 
property, which represent normal or delayed repairs and maintenance, 
shall be expensed in the year incurred.
    (c) File and Storage. Carriers shall keep records of each rebuilding 
program readily available. These records shall be provided to 
representatives of the Board when requested. The retention period shall 
be as required by 49 CFR part 1220, Preservation of Records.

[44 FR 67426, Nov. 26, 1979. Redesignated at 48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983, 
and amended at 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    2-13  Changes in line of road and relocation of yard tracks.
    (a) When changes are made in a line of road for the purpose of 
reducing curves or grades, or to eliminate bridges, tunnels, tracks in 
the installation of a centralized traffic control system, or other 
physical features, the part of the line so changed shall be considered 
property retired and its ledger value credited to the property accounts. 
The new line of road, including land, grading, ballast, track elements, 
and other transportation facilities serving the road shall be considered 
an addition and the cost charged to the property accounts. The cost of 
track changes which do not involve change in the existing roadbed shall 
be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be 
dismantled in the process, but the resulting track extensions or 
reductions shall be accounted for as additions or retirements as 
appropriate.
    (b) The cost of shifting or rearranging tracks within a yard shall 
be charged to operating expenses, even though the tracks may be 
dismantled in the process, but resulting increases or decreases in 
grading, ballast, or track length shall be accounted for as additions or 
retirements, as appropriate. Where tracks in whole or in part within a 
yard are determined to be no longer permanently used, the ledger value 
of such tracks shall be eliminated from the property account. If yard 
tracks and facilities are constructed in another location to take

[[Page 30]]

the place of tracks retired, such tracks and facilities shall be 
accounted for as additions and the cost thereof shall be included in the 
property account.

[48 FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983]

    2-14  Track connections. (a) When the accounting carrier bears the 
construction cost of a connecting track situated on the property of 
another carrier, but acquires the salvage rights to the track, the cost 
of the track construction shall be charged to account 731, Road and 
equipment property.
    (b) When carriers (1) share the cost of constructing a connecting 
track of which a portion is situated on each carrier's right-of-way, and 
(2) own and obtain the salvage rights to the track segment located on 
their respective properties, the construction cost borne by each carrier 
shall be charged to account 731, Road and equipment property.
    (c) The cost of constructing a track connection on the right-of-way 
of another carrier which acquires the ownership of and salvage rights to 
the track, shall be charged by the carrier bearing such cost to accounts 
37-11-00, Purchased service--Joint facility--Debit--Way and Structures--
Running, or 37-12-00, Purchased services--Joint facility--Debit--Way and 
Structures--Switching. The owner carrier shall charge the amount of the 
construction cost to account 731, Road and equipment--property, with 
contra credit to accounts 38-11-00, Purchases services--Joint facility--
Credit--Way and Structures--Running, or 38-12-00, Purchases services--
Joint facility--Credit--Way and Structures--Switching. Material amounts 
for such costs shall be referred to the Board for consideration and 
decision.
    (d) The cost of constructing a side track under a deposit refund 
agreement shall be charged to account 731, Road and equipment property. 
The deposit shall be credited to account 782, Other liabilities. Deposit 
amounts refunded during the agreement period shall be charged to account 
782, Other liabilities. Upon termination of the agreement, the amount of 
any unrefunded deposit shall be credited to the applicable primary 
property accounts on an equitable basis.
    2-15  Merger, consolidation, and purchase of a railway operating 
entity or system. (a) When a railway or portion thereof constituting an 
operating unit or system is acquired by merger or consolidation in a 
pooling of interests or by purchase the cost of acquisition represented 
by cash, capital stock or other securities issued or assumed, 
liabilities assumed, and other consideration, shall be recorded in the 
accounts in the manner stated hereunder. Separate instructions are 
provided for a merger of subsidiaries.
    (b) Pooling of interests:
    (1) When the acquisition results from a merger or consolidation 
constituting a pooling of interests, in which all or substantially all 
of the equity interest in predecessor companies continue, as such, in a 
surviving company or a new company created for the purpose, the road and 
equipment, the other assets, and the liabilities of the predecessor 
companies, together with the balances in the accumulated amortization 
and depreciation accounts and the retained earnings accounts shall be 
recorded in the appropriate balance sheet accounts at the amounts shown 
in the accounts of predecessor companies, adjusted as may be necessary 
to conform with the accounting rules of the Board. Such adjustments 
shall be included in retained earnings or the other accounts that would 
have been appropriate had the adjustments been made in the books of 
account of the predecessor company.
    (2) When the total par or the stated value of no par capital stock 
issued or outstanding pursuant to the pooling of interests is more than 
the aggregate amount of the capital stock of the separate companies 
before such pooling of interests, the excess shall be charged to account 
795, Other capital, if unrestricted capital is available for such 
purpose; otherwise, the excess shall be charged to retained earnings.
    (3) When the total par or stated value of no par capital stock 
issued or outstanding pursuant to the pooling of interests is less than 
aggregate amount of the capital stock of the separate companies before 
such pooling of interests, the difference for reduction in capital stock 
shall be credited to account 795, Other capital.
    (c) Purchase:
    (1) When the acquisition results from a purchase (except from 
subsidiaries

[[Page 31]]

controlled through ownership of the majority share of voting stock) 
including mergers or consolidations other than pooling of interests, the 
amount includible in account 731, Road and equipment property, shall be 
the cost at the date of acquisition to the purchaser of the 
transportation property acquired. The cost assigned the property, as 
well as other assets acquired, shall be the amount of the cost 
consideration given. Where property and other assets are acquired for 
other than cash, including liabilities assumed and shares of stock 
issued, cost shall be determined by either the fair value of the 
consideration given or the fair value of the assets acquired, whichever 
is more clearly evident. In addition to any liabilities assumed, 
provision shall be made for such estimated liabilities as may be 
necessary.
    (2) When the costs of individual units or classes of transportation 
property are not specified in the agreement, the cost assigned such 
property shall be apportioned among the appropriate primary accounts 
using the percentage relationship between the fair values for each class 
of property acquired and the total of such values.
    (d) Merger of subsidiaries:
    The acquisition and merger of property of subsidiaries controlled 
through ownership of the majority shares of voting stock is to be 
accounted for as a pooling of interests or as a purchase depending on 
the circumstances in each case. Where control was initially acquired 
through issuance of capital stock to stockholders of the subsidiary the 
rule applicable to pooling of interests ordinarily is applicable. Where 
control was initially acquired through purchase of stock the rule 
applicable to purchase of property may be appropriate even though the 
shares were purchased gradually from time to time over a period of 
years, in which event recognition of retained earnings since date of 
acquisition assignable to such shares may be proper. The journal entry 
pertaining to acquisition of property of subsidiaries shall be submitted 
to the Board for consideration based on the principles herein and 
procedures for which there is authoritative support, and the accounting 
for the merger shall become final only after approval by the Board.
    2-16  Reorganization of railway. (a) When a railway reorganization 
or receivership has been consummated, the assets acquired, liabilities 
assumed, and the capital stock or other securities issued or assumed, 
and other consideration, shall be recorded in the accounts in the manner 
stated hereunder. An adjustment of capitalization resulting in 
modification and reformation of classes of securities pursuant to 
voluntary action of the holders of securities but not resulting in a 
formal reorganization following a bankruptcy or other receivership 
proceedings (sometimes called a quasi-reorganization) is not covered by 
this instruction 2-16. Reduction of capital stock and other 
contributions to capital by stockholders shall be recorded in accordance 
with the instructions in the text of account 795, Other capital.
    (b) The amounts includable in primary road and equipment property 
accounts shall be recorded at cost as shown in the predecessor 
companies' accounts except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c) and 
(d) of this instruction 2-16. The remaining assets and the liabilities 
of the predecessor companies, adjusted as necessary to conform with the 
accounting rules of the Board, together with the balances in the 
accumulated amortization and depreciation accounts, shall be recorded in 
the appropriate balance sheet accounts.
    (c) When the amount recorded for assets acquired is more than the 
par or stated value of no par capital stock issued and other 
consideration paid, including liabilities assumed, the difference shall 
be applied to such extent as necessary and is available to provide first 
for any deficiency in past accrued depreciation on property classified 
as depreciable; and, second, for any estimated loss from retirement of a 
branch line, segment of track or other important facility indicated by 
supporting records to be imminent. The remaining amount of the 
difference, if any, shall be applied proportionately to reduce the 
amounts includable in the property accounts in accordance with paragraph 
(b) of this instruction 2-16, based on the percentage relationship 
between

[[Page 32]]

such difference and the aggregate cost of the property shown in the 
predecessor companies' accounts.
    (d) When the amount applicable to the assets acquired is less than 
the par or stated value of no par capital stock issued and other 
consideration paid, including liabilities assumed, the accounting shall 
be referred to the Board for consideration and decision.
    2-17  Construction projects in which governmental agencies, 
individuals, or others, and the carrier participate. (a) The amount 
includible in the property account for construction projects in which 
the carrier and governmental agencies, individuals, or others 
participate shall be (1) the payment made by the carrier for its share 
of the cost of construction plus (2) the recorded cost (estimated if 
unknown) of property relinquished as a direct result of the arrangement 
and retired from service less the value of salvage recovered therefrom 
by the carrier and less depreciation accrued on depreciable property, 
which is part of the carrier's cost of the project. The amount so 
includable in the property account shall be distributed equitably among 
the primary accounts applicable to railway property constructed. This 
amount shall first be applied to railway facilities includable in 
accounts other than 4, Other right-of-way expenditures, or 39, Public 
improvements--Construction, then any remaining balance shall be included 
in account 4 or 39, as appropriate. In no case shall the amount included 
in the primary accounts for the railway facilities acquired exceed the 
actual cost of constructing such facilities. The property account shall 
not include any cost or value for facilities or land contributed or paid 
for by governmental agencies, individuals or others. Property acquired 
as a specific contribution to capital by stockholders does not come 
under this rule. (See text of account 795, Other capital.)
    (b) Construction projects as used in this section means widening of 
highways, construction of spillways, drainage canals, farm and other 
private passes, pipelines, drains or other facilities across the right-
of-way; construction of overhead highway bridges, and railroad bridges 
over public highways and across streams, which provide a railroad use in 
the operation of trains and a public use in the uninterrupted passage of 
highway and river traffic; installation of warning signals to protect 
highway traffic; and industrial side tracks. Also, reconstruction and 
relocation of tracks and appurtenant facilities such as occur in 
connection with carrying out flood control, reclamation, and other 
public improvement projects where it becomes necessary to abandon part 
of the line of railroad and relocate the tracks.
    2-18  Leased property improvements and retirements. The cost to 
lessee of structures, facilities, additions and betterments on leased 
property and for retirement of property the cost of which is included in 
account 732 Improvements on leased property, shall be accounted for in 
conformity with the principles in the instructions for property owned. 
When lessor's property is retired and replaced and lessee is not 
obligated to reimburse the lessor for the retired property other than 
through the replacement, the lessee shall (1) charge the cost of the 
replacement to account 732, Improvements on leased property, (2) 
discontinue accruing depreciation for lessor's retired property, and (3) 
when recording final settlement with the lessor, consider jointly the 
amount accrued in account 772, Accrued liability; Leased property, for 
lessor's retired property and the respective amounts for the replacement 
included in accounts 732, Improvements on leased property, and 733, 
Accumulated depreciation; Improvements on leased property. When lessee 
is obligated to reimburse the lessor currently or at the termination of 
the lease for property retired other than through replacement, the 
lessee shall include the amount of the obligation in the appropriate 
liability account. The lessee shall furnish the lessor such information 
as is required to enable the lessor to perform necessary accounting. The 
accounting by the lessee and the lessor shall be consistent with 
contractual arrangements.

rule applicable to additions to property. See instruction 2-2 pertaining 
to the minimum rule.
    (b) This list of units will be revised from time to time as may be 
necessary to meet conditions. A carrier desiring to include in any 
account an appropriate unit not now specified therein may, upon approval 
of the Board, make such authorized addition to this list of units.
    (c) Rules applicable to units of property rebuilt or converted and 
to changes in line of road or tracks which involve accounting for units 
or property retired are set forth in instructions 2-12 and 2-13.

    2-20  Accounting for leases. (a) Leases shall be accounted for as 
capital leases whenever the lease meets one or more of the following 
four criteria:
    (1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by 
the end of the lease term,
    (2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option,
    (3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated 
economic life of the property, and,
    (4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the 
minimum lease payments equals or exceeds 90 percent of the fair value of 
the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease less any 
related investment tax credit retained by the lessor.
    (b) If the lease does not meet any of the four criteria, the lease 
shall be classified and accounted for as an operating lease.
    (c) When accounting for capital leases the lessee shall record the 
asset

[[Page 36]]

and the related obligation. The amount recorded as the asset and the 
obligation shall be the present value at the beginning of the lease term 
of the minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that 
portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, 
maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor. However, if that amount 
exceeds the fair value of the leased property, the amount recorded as 
the asset and the obligation shall be the fair value. The lessee shall 
compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its 
incremental borrowing rate unless (1) it is practicable to learn the 
implicit rate computed by the lessor and (2) the implicit rate computed 
by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If 
both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit 
rate.
    (d) Leased assets that meet the criteria for classification as a 
capital lease shall be subject to depreciation over their useful lives 
in the same manner as assets owned. If the capital lease meets the 
criteria of either Instruction 2-20(a)(1) or 2-20(a)(2), the asset shall 
be amortized in a manner consistent with the lessee's normal 
depreciation policy for owned assets. If the lease does not meet either 
of these two criteria, the asset shall be amortized in a manner 
consistent with the lessee's normal depreciation policy except that the 
period of amortization shall be the lease term.
    (e) The accounting accorded the lease shall be subject to the same 
considerations as other obligations in classifying them with current and 
noncurrent liabilities in the classified balance sheet. Leases that meet 
the criteria requiring capitalization shall be recorded in those 
accounts that provide for carrier operating property or property used in 
other than carrier operations, as appropriate. The accounts shall 
segregate the amounts pertaining to capital leases.
    (f) If the lease qualifies as an operating lease it should be 
accounted for by charging the rent to expense over the lease term. The 
rental expense should be recognized on a straight line basis over the 
lease term unless another method is more representative of the use and 
the benefits derived.
    (g) The criteria specified in paragraph (a) should be applied to all 
leases regardless of the relationship between the lessor and the lessee 
unless it is clear that the terms of the lease transaction have been 
significantly affected by their relationship. In this situation, the 
accounting should be modified to recognize economic substance rather 
than legal form.
    (h) In the case of subsidiary companies or companies under common 
control whose principal business activity is leasing property or 
facilities to the carrier, the carrier is encouraged to request special 
authority to file consolidated or combined financial statements. If the 
carrier does not wish to file consolidated or combined financial 
statements, capitalization of the lease will be required if the lease 
meets the criteria that would require capitalization.
    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules for lease accounting is 
needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the 
Board.

    2-21  Freight train car repair costing. Class I railroads shall 
report the costs of repairing freight train cars by car types.
    (a) The accounting for freight train car repair costs shall agree 
with the applicable instructions and texts of accounts in 49 CFR Part 
1201 relating to the equipment repair process (see Note A).
    (b) Railroads may assign either actual costs, standard costs, or a 
combination of both to the accounting process. Standard costs, if used, 
shall recognize the differences in performing repairs on various types 
of equipment, and the differences related to specific repair facilites. 
Standard costs shall be based on adequate operational data which are 
reviewed at least annually. The resulting variances (price, efficiency, 
capacity, etc.) shall be reasonably allocated back to the car types to 
derive the amounts reported in Form R-1.
    (c) Railroads shall report repair costs by the freight train car 
types shown in

[[Page 37]]

Schedule 415 of Form R-1. In assigning repair costs, railroads may use 
either one of the following methodologies:

                     Level I: Job Order Cost System

    Railroads may use a job order cost system for assigning repair costs 
to the car types for freight train cars. Under this methodology, 
railroads shall directly match direct labor and materials with the 
specific unit of equipment that was repaired. Actual costs, standard 
costs, or a combination of both may be used as stated above.

             Level II: Alternative Repair Costs Methodology

    Railroads not using the job order cost system shall report freight 
train car repair costs by using the methodology described below:

    (1) The repair costs relating to heavy, program, or project repairs 
of freight train cars shall be directly assigned to the car types 
repaired by using actual or standard costs. A heavy repair is defined as 
a repair that is relatively so material in cost, repair time, or 
physical damage that management's involvement in the determination of 
the repair to be made is necessary and relatively greater than usual. 
Program or project repairs are those repairs which are performed under a 
predetermined plan where estimates costs, time periods, and car types to 
be repaired are identified.
    (2) The repair costs relating to light and running repairs of system 
cars shall be allocated to the car types by using the Association of 
American Railroads' Car Repair Billing System (CRBS) as the process for 
distributing light and running repairs. The CRBS will be the tracking 
system for recording the number of repairs, the car types and types of 
repairs. Then by applying the CRBS standard costs to the particular 
repairs, standard costs relationships by car type can be developed and 
used to distribute actual light and running repair cost pools to the car 
types.
    (3) Railroads shall match repair costs billed by and paid to foreign 
roads with the car types that were repaired. Foreign billings for light 
and running repairs are usually conducted through CRBS, and therefore, 
the car types can be identified. For heavy off-line repairs, car type 
identification is possible because system management is generally 
involved with the authorization of such heavy repairs and car 
identification numbers are generally included in the billing process.
    (4) Repair costs relating to foreign freight train cars shall also 
be reported by car types. However, a separate breakdown between foreign 
and system repair costs is not required for Board reporting purpose. Car 
type identification for light and running repairs to foreign cars can be 
obtained from CRBS tapes. The cost of heavy repairs to foreign cars 
should be accumulated by car types. The resulting expense credits from 
foreign railroads should be assigned to the car types to which they 
relate.
    (5) Railroads shall match any resulting expense credits with the car 
types to which they relate. This can occur, for example, when a railroad 
is charged with the repair costs of system cars, but the responsibility 
of the repair ultimately rests with and is paid by a foreign road.
    (d) Railroads shall submit to the Board any repair cost by car type 
methodology which does not agree with item (c) above. The Board shall 
review the methodology and determine if it is acceptable for reporting 
purposes.
    (e) Railroads may submit justification and supporting documents 
requesting waiver from provisions required by this instruction. This 
provision is intended to provide relief for those smaller Class I 
railroads that might be unduly burdened by the cost of developing and 
maintaining the required system. Waivers shall be directed to the 
Board's Accounting and Valuation Board.
    (f) Equipment repair cost records, including the allocation methods 
used, shall be maintained and made available to the Board upon request.
    Note A: The following accounts and reference pertain to the freight 
train car repair process:

    2-22  Map specifications.
    (a) Class I Railroad companies shall maintain current maps of its 
property and shall promptly record any changes that may take place.
    (b) Class I companies shall furnish, on request, copies of maps 
showing its property as it exists on such date or dates as may be fixed 
by the Board.
    (c) Class I companies shall maintain planimetric maps that show

INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    4-1  Method. (a) There shall be charged monthly to operating 
expenses or other appropriate accounts and credited to account 735, 
Accumulated depreciation; Road and equipment property, during the 
service life of depreciable road and equipment property, includable in 
accounts classed as depreciable, amounts which will approximate the loss 
in service value not restored by current repairs or covered by 
insurance. The charges for accruing depreciation currently shall be 
computed in conformity with the group plan by applying to the cost of 
property such percentage rates as will distribute the service value by 
the straight-line method in equal annual charges to operating expenses 
or other accounts during the estimated life of the property. In the case 
of track accounts 8, 9 and

[[Page 40]]

11, service value shall reflect net salvage value. For road property, 
the cost shall be original cost or estimated original cost, as used in 
the valuation records, adjusted to current date. If a carrier submits 
proof that the actual cost of depreciable property is substantially 
different from cost figures in the valuation records, the carrier may, 
with the approval of the Board, use such cost figures as the 
depreciation base.
    (b) The term group plan means the plan under which depreciation 
charges are accrued upon the basis of the cost of depreciable property 
includable in accounts classed as depreciable using the service lives of 
the individual depreciable units in the accounts and properly weighing 
to determine the composite annual rate of depreciation.
    (c) For the purpose of the group plan of depreciation accounting, 
the following primary accounts are classed as depreciable accounts:

Road accounts:
    3. Grading.
    4. Other right-of-way expenditures.
    5. Tunnels and subways.
    6. Bridges, trestles and culverts.
    7. Elevated structures.
    8. Ties.
    9. Rails and other track material.
    11. Ballast.
    13. Fences, snowsheds, and signs.
    16. Station and office buildings.
    17. Roadway buildings.
    18. Water stations.
    19. Fuel stations.
    20. Shops and enginehouses.
    22. Storage warehouses.
    23. Wharves and docks.
    24. Coal and ore wharves.
    25. TOFC/COFC terminals.
    26. Communication systems.
    27. Signals and interlockers.
    29. Power plants.
    31. Power transmission systems.
    35. Miscellaneous structures.
    37. Roadway machines.
    39. Public improvements-construction.
    44. Shop machinery.
    45. Power plant machinery.
Equipment accounts:
    52. Locomotives.
    53. Freight-train cars.
    54. Passenger-train cars.
    55. Highway revenue equipment.
    56. Floating equipment.
    57. Work equipment.
    58. Miscellaneous equipment.
    59. Computer systems and word processing equipment.

    (d) When abandonment of a branch line or other important segment of 
the track structure or other part of the plant for which depreciation 
charges are not includable in the accounts as foreseeable within a 
reasonable period of time due to exhaustion of traffic, obsolescence or 
other causes, application may be made to the Board for authority to 
record a suitable provision in anticipation of a probable loss.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 48 FR 4183, Feb. 18, 1983; 52 
FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987]

    4-2  Rates of depreciation. (a) A separate composite annual 
percentage rate for each depreciable property account, or a subgroup in 
that account, shall be used in computing annual depreciation expenses 
and accumulated depreciation. The composite rates shall be based on the 
results of a depreciation study performed by each railroad. A 
depreciation study shall, in general, contain the following components:
    (i) Actuarial or semiactuarial methods for determining service lives 
for road and equipment properties;
    (ii) Salvage value calculations for road and equipment properties;
    (iii) Accumulated depreciation for each account or subaccount as 
appropriate;
    (iv) Other factors and related calculations involving the 
depreciation process; and
    (v) A commentary on any adjustments and judgmental factors used in 
the study.
    (b) Railroads shall submit to the Board for review and approval a 
report on depreciation studies and proposed depreciation rates every 
three years for equipment property, and every six years for road 
property. Railroads can, however, submit depreciation studies prior to 
its scheduled year, in which case a new cycle will begin.
    (c) In computing monthly depreciation charges, the annual percentage 
rates shall be applied to the depreciation base as of the first of each 
month and the results shall be divided by twelve.
    (d) Class II railroads are exempt from the three-year and six-year 
cyclical reviews, but shall submit depreciation studies when requested 
by the Board.

[[Page 41]]

Class III railroads are not required to submit depreciation studies.
    (e) A separate track depreciation rate shall apply to each primary 
property account in each track density category as provided in 
Instruction 4-3(d). Track depreciation rates shall be developed by 
estimating the average life based on an acceptable depreciation 
methodology, consistently applied, including as an option the units of 
production method based on gross ton-miles per mile of track.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 20210, Apr. 3, 1981; 48 
FR 7184, Feb. 18, 1983; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    4-3  Depreciation records to be kept. (a) The carrier shall maintain 
for each class of property in convenient and accessible form engineering 
and other data bearing on prospective service lives.
    (b) The carrier also shall keep such records of depreciable property 
and property retirements as will reflect the service life of each class 
of property which has been retired, or will permit the determination of 
service life indications by past experience of useful life tenure of 
comparable property, turnover, or other appropriate methods; also such 
records as will reflect the percentage of value of the salvage for 
property retired from each class of depreciable property.
    (c) For purposes of analysis the carrier shall maintain subsidiary 
records in which the accumulated depreciation account is broken down 
into component parts corresponding to each primary account to show the 
current credits and debits and the balance for each account. Such 
detailed information shall be reported annually to this Board. For 
balance sheet purposes, the accumulated depreciation account shall be 
treated as a single composite account for depreciable property.
    (d) Carriers shall be prepared to justify all track depreciation 
rates by keeping appropriate data on the service lives and salvage 
values of track components which went into the life and net salvage 
computation of each primary account in each density category.
    (e) The investment and related accumulated depreciation for accounts 
3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 39 must be maintained by distinct traffic density 
categories. Each line segment shall be identified on January 1 of each 
year as belonging to one of the following traffic density classes, based 
on the average traffic density in the preceding three years:

                                 Density

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Class                             Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I  ...  Lines carrying at least 20 million gross ton-miles per mile on
         an annual basis and not designated as belonging to Density
         Class III.
II  ..  Lines carrying less than 20 million gross ton-miles per mile on
         an annual basis and not designated as belonging to Density
         Class III.
III  .  Lines identified as potentially subject to abandonment pursuant
         to Section 10904 of the Interstate Commerce Act.
IV  ..  Yard and way switching tracks.
V  ...  Electronic yards.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Note A: For purposes of designating line segments as belonging to 
one of the density classes, the carrier shall consider all traffic 
carried over the segment whether in the carrier's trains or in the 
trains of other carriers (estimated if not known).
    Note B: When a carrier operates systems of parallel tracks on a 
single roadbed, the density associated with the related segment of a 
rail route shall be the aggregate gross ton-miles on all individual 
tracks.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 20210, Apr. 3, 1981; 48 
FR 7183, Feb. 18, 1983; 52 FR 4321, Feb. 11, 1987]

    4-4  Leased property--depreciation. (a) The carrier shall include in 
operating expenses charges for depreciation on road property and 
equipment used but not owned, the rent for which is includable in the 
lease rental accounts, and shall maintain the same records of service 
lives, salvage values, etc., as provided for owned road property and 
equipment. The excess of the total compensation paid over the amount 
chargeable for depreciation shall be included in the rent account. If 
settlement between the carrier and the lessor is not currently made, the 
amount of the depreciation accrued during the period of the lease shall 
be credited by the carrier to account 772. Accrued liability; Leased 
property. The necessary adjustments of the difference between the 
balance thus accrued in that account and the actual amount of settlement 
shall be made appropriately through accounts 519, Miscellaneous income, 
or 551, Miscellaneous income

[[Page 42]]

charges, at the time settlement for depreciation on the property is made 
with the lessor.
    (b) The carrier shall not include in the depreciation account in 
operating expenses any charges for depreciation of equipment used but 
not owned when the rents therefor are not included in the lease rental 
accounts but shall include such charges in the appropriate other rent 
expense accounts.
    4-5  Jointly used property--depreciation. The owning carrier shall 
include in the depreciation accounts in operating expenses the charges 
for depreciation on units of depreciable property jointly used with one 
or more other carriers. The owning carrier shall credit and each using 
carrier shall charge the appropriate joint facility accounts in 
operating expenses with the amounts billed by the owning carrier against 
each using carrier for its proportion of the service loss on property 
retired from service whether billed currently as depreciation or when 
retirements occur as the loss in service value. The using carriers shall 
be required to account for depreciation or retirement of units of road 
property jointly used but not owned to the extent of their contract 
liability. The same principle shall apply to terminal companies and 
their nonowner tenants in accounting for depreciation accruals or 
retirement charges recorded in the accounts of the terminal companies.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INCOME AND BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    5-1  Current assets. (a) In the group of accounts designated as 
current assets shall be included cash, those assets which are readily 
convertible into cash or are held for current use in operations, current 
claims against others and amounts accruing to the carrier which are 
subject to settlement in the ordinary course of business within one 
year. There shall not be included in this group of accounts any amount 
the collection of which is not reasonably assured within one year 
because of the known financial conditions of the debtor or otherwise. 
Such items shall be included in account 741, Other assets, at an amount 
not in excess of a reasonable estimate of realizable value. Items of 
current character but of doubtful value shall be written down or written 
off by charge to account 63-61-00, General--Uncollectible accounts--
General and administrative, or account 553, Uncollectible accounts, as 
appropriate. Adjustment of these items of doubtful value shall be made 
by direct reduction of the asset account in which such items are carried 
or by provision in account 709.5, Allowance for uncollectible accounts, 
for the estimated uncollectible amount.
    (b) The carrier shall transfer the estimated realizable value of 
obsolete material to account 741, Other assets, equitably distribute the 
loss due to obsolescence among the accounts ordinarily chargeable for 
such classes of material, and concurrently credit account 712, Material 
and Supplies.
    5-2  Recorded value of securities owned. (a)(1) The investment in 
securities other than those issued or assumed by the accounting company 
shall be recorded in these accounts at cost, but excluding amounts paid 
for accrued interest and accrued dividends.
    (2) Accounts 702, Temporary Cash Investments, 721, Investments in 
Affiliated Companies, and 722, Other Investments, shall be maintained in 
such a manner as to reflect the marketable equity securities' portion 
(see definition 26) and other securities or investments.
    (3) For the purpose of determining net ledger value, the marketable 
equity securities in account 702 shall be considered the current 
portfolio and the marketable equity securities in accounts 721 and 722 
(combined) shall be considered the noncurrent portfolio. The net ledger 
value of each portfolio shall be the lower of its aggregate cost or 
market value. (See definition 26.) The amount by which aggregate cost 
exceeds market value shall be accounted for as the valuation allowance. 
Account 702, Temporary Cash Investments, shall be subdivided to include 
the valuation allowance for the marketable equity securities included 
therein. Account 724, Allowance for Net Unrealized Loss on Noncurrent 
Marketable Equity Securities--Cr., is the valuation allowance for the 
marketable equity securities recorded in account 721, Investments in 
Affiliated Companies, and

[[Page 43]]

722, Other Investments. Marketable equity securities accounted for by 
the equity method shall not be combined with other marketable equity 
securities when determining aggregate cost and market value.
    (4) Realized gains and losses (the difference between net proceeds 
from sale and cost) shall be included in the determination of net income 
of the period in which they occur. Changes in the valuation allowance 
for marketable equity securities included in account 702 shall be 
charged to account 551, Miscellaneous Income Charges, or credited to 
account 519, Miscellaneous Income, as appropriate, with a contra entry 
to the valuation allowance contained within account 702. Changes in the 
valuation allowance for marketable equity securities included in 
accounts 721 and 722 shall be recorded in equity account 798.1, Net 
Unrealized Loss on Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, with a 
contra entry to valuation account 724.
    (5) If there is a change in the classification of a marketable 
equity security between current and noncurrent, the security shall be 
transferred at the lower of its cost or market value at date of 
transfer. If market value is less than cost, the market value shall 
become the new cost basis, and the difference shall be accounted for as 
if it were a realized loss and included in the determination of net 
income.
    (6) The accounting company shall write down the ledger value of any 
securities to the extent of impairment in their value or write off 
entirely if there is no reasonable prospect of realizing any value 
therefrom. For long term investments in marketable equity securities, 
when the decline in market value below cost is judged to be other than 
temporary, the cost basis of the individual security shall be writen 
down to a new cost basis. The amount of the write-down shall be 
accounted for as realized loss by a charge to account 551, Other Income 
Charges, and a credit to account 723, Reserve for Adjustment of 
Investment in Securities. The new cost basis shall not be changed for 
subsequent recoveries in value.
    (b)(1) For financial statement purposes the carrier shall follow the 
principles of equity accounting for (1) all investments in corporate 
joint ventures (see definition 21(c)), and (2) all investments in voting 
stock of affiliated companies giving the carrier the ability to 
significantly influence the operating and financial policies of an 
investee (see definition 21(b)). For purposes of this instruction an 
investment of 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an 
investee will indicate the ability to exercise significant influence 
over an investee in the absence of evidence to the contrary.
    (2) Since the equity method is not to be effected by entries in the 
books of accounts but is to apply only in financial reports to the 
Board, the carrier shall establish worksheet or memorandum accounts. 
Three basic worksheet or memorandum accounts are needed:
    (i) An investment account to include (1) equity in the undistributed 
earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition (see 
definition 21(g)); (2) accumulated amortization of the difference 
between cost and net assets at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below); 
and other adjustments for disposition or writedown of investments.
    (ii) An income account to include (1) the investor's share of the 
investee's undistributed profits or losses for each reporting period 
subsequent to acquisition of the investment except that in the year of 
acquisition such amount shall be determined from the date of 
acquisition; (2) amortization for the reporting period of the difference 
between cost and net assets at date of acquisition. This account shall 
be closed at year-end to the retained earnings memorandum account 
discussed in paragraph (iii) below.
    (iii) A retained earnings account to include (1) equity in the 
undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of 
acquisition; (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost 
and net assets acquired at date of acquisition (see (b)(3) below).
    (iv) Other memorandum accounts will be needed for such adjustments 
as gains and losses on disposition of investments, recognition of 
impairments in value, the investor's share of extraordinary and prior 
period adjustments reported in the investee's financial statements (see 
instruction 1-2(d)), and provision for deferred taxes where

[[Page 44]]

it is reasonable to assume that undistributed earnings of an investee 
will be transferred to the investor in a taxable distribution. These 
memorandum accounts shall be closed at year-end to the retained earnings 
memorandum account discussed in paragraph (iii) above.
    (3) The carrier shall retain the following information for each 
investee in support of the worksheet or memorandum accounts:
    (i) Original cost of investment.
    (ii) Equity in net assets of investee at date of acquisition.
    (iii) Allocation of difference between cost and equity in net 
assets, namely, to specific assets of investee or to goodwill.
    (iv) Accumulated amortization of difference between cost and equity 
in net assets.
    (v) Unamortized balance of difference between cost and equity in net 
assets.
    (vi) Equity in undistributed earnings/losses for each year since 
date of acquisition.
    (vii) Dividends received since date of acquisition if determinable.
    (viii) Proceeds from sale of investments.
    (4) Any difference between the investor's cost and its share of the 
net assets of the investee at date of acquisition shall be allocated to 
specific assets of the investee to the extent the difference is 
attributable to them. When the difference is allocated to depreciable or 
amortizable assets, depreciation and amortization (through the 
investment and income memorandum accounts) should absorb the difference 
over the remaining life of the related assets. If the difference is not 
related to specific accounts, it should be considered goodwill and 
amortized over a reasonable period not to exceed 40 years. For 
investments made prior to November 1, 1970, amortization of goodwill is 
not required in the absence of evidence that the goodwill has a limited 
term of existence.
    (5) The financial statements of the investee that are used for 
equity accounting should be timely. If the accounting year of the 
investee differs from that of the investor then the most recent 
available financial statements may be used. The lag in reporting should 
be consistent from period to period.
    (6) Material profits or losses on transactions between the investor 
and investee shall be eliminated until realized by either company as if 
the two were consolidated.
    (7) A transaction of the investee of a capital nature that affects 
the investor's share of the investee's stockholder's equity should be 
reported in the financial statements as if the two were consolidated.
    (8) The investor shall deduct any dividends applicable to 
outstanding cumulative preferred stock whether or not declared, and any 
other dividends declared when computing its share of undistributed 
earnings or losses.
    (9) The investor shall suspend application of the equity method when 
the investment (including the investment memorandum account) together 
with any net advances made to the investee is reduced to zero. 
Additional losses shall not be provided for unless the investor has 
guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to 
provide further financial support for the investee. If the investee 
subsequently reports net income the investor shall resume applying the 
equity method at such time as its share of that net income equals the 
share of net losses not recognized during the period of suspension.
    (10) When the investor's voting stock interest falls below the level 
of ownership described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the 
investment no longer qualifies for the equity method. Should dividends 
received on the investment in subsequent periods exceed the investor's 
share of earnings for such periods, the investment memorandum and income 
memorandum accounts shall be reduced by the excess amount.
    (11) When the level of ownership of an investment increases to that 
described in paragraph (b)(1) of this instruction, the equity method 
shall be applied. The memorandum accounts for the investment, income 
(for current year's equity in undistributed earnings less amoritzation), 
and retained earnings (for prior years' equity in undistributed earnings 
less amortization) shall be adjusted retroactively on a step-by-

[[Page 45]]

step basis determining the equity in net assets at date of acquisition, 
amortization adjustment, and equity in undistributed earnings or losses 
at each level of ownership. Where small purchases are made over a period 
of time and then a purhase is made which qualifies the investment for 
the equity method, the date of latest purchase may be used as date of 
acquisition.
    (12) Information having significance with respect to the investor's 
ownership in investees shall be disclosed in notes to financial 
statements of annual reports filed with the Board in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
    (c) When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a 
discount (i.e., when total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, 
commissions, etc., is less than par), such discounts may be amortized 
over the remaining life of the securities through periodic debits to the 
account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with 
entries recording interest accruals) and credits to the same account in 
which interest income is credited. No debits shall be made in respect to 
discounts upon securities held as investments or in special funds if 
there is reason to believe that such securities will be disposed of by 
redemption or otherwise at less than par or will not be paid at date of 
maturity. When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a 
premium (i.e., when the total cost including brokerage fees, taxes, 
commissions, etc., is in excess of par), such premium may be amortized 
over the remaining life of the securities through periodic credits to 
the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident 
with entries recording interest accruals) and debits to the same 
accounts in which the interest income is recorded.
    Note: The carrier shall follow generally accepted accounting 
principles where an interpretation of the rules for equity accounting is 
needed or obtain an interpretation from its public accountant or the 
Board.
    5-3  Discounts, expenses, and premiums on debt. (a) Ledger accounts 
shall be provided to cover the discounts, expenses, and premiums on the 
sale or resale of each subclass of funded debt and of receivers' and 
trustees' securities issued for the benefit of or assumed by the 
company. (For explanation of subclass see account 765, Funded debt 
unmatured.) The net debit balances remaining in the ledger accounts for 
discount and premium shall be included in account 770.1, Unamortized 
debt discount, and the net credit balances in account 770.2, Unamortized 
premium on debt. Debt expense shall be included in account 743, Other 
deferred debits.
    (b) Each fiscal period there shall be charged to account 548, 
Amortization of discount on funded debt, a proportion on a consistent 
basis of each of the debit balances in the discount and premium accounts 
and correspondingly there shall be credited to income account 517, 
Release of premiums on funding debt, a similar proportion of each of the 
credit balances in these accounts. Related debt expense shall also be 
charged to account 548 on a proportional and consistent basis. The 
amounts for the respective debit balances for discount and expenses 
applicable to a particular issue of obligations may be charged directly 
to account 548 at time of issue when the aggregate of such amounts does 
not appreciably affect the accounts. The method of apportioning debt 
discount, issue costs, and premium to accounts 517 and 548 shall be the 
interest method, where the effective interest rate on the date of 
issuance is applied to the carrying value (debt, less related discount, 
and issue cost, plus related premium of each specific issue to the 
beginning of any given period.) However, other methods of amortization 
may be used if the results obtained are not materially different from 
those which would result from the interest method.
    (c) When any funded debt which has been actually issued to bona fide 
holders for value is reacquired by the accounting company, that 
proportion of the balance remaining in accounts containing discount, 
expense and premium on funded debt for the subclass of the security 
reacquired applicable to the portion reacquired shall be credited or 
charged thereto, as appropriate, and concurrently charged or credited to 
account 519, Miscellaneous income, account 551, Miscellaneous income 
charges; or to account 570, Extraordinary items, as appropriate, in 
accordance with the text of these accounts. Such proportion

[[Page 46]]

shall be based upon the ratio of the par value of the security 
reacquired to the par value of all the securities of the subclass 
actually outstanding immediately before such reacquirement. Gains and 
losses from extinguishment of debt (excluding debt maturing serially) 
which is acquired to satisfy sinking fund requirements, shall not be 
recorded as extraordinary items regardless of amount, but shall be 
included in accounts 519 and 551, as appropriate. Such gains and losses 
shall be separately disclosed in reports to this Board.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4325, Feb. 11, 1987]

    5-4  Discount, premium, and assessment on capital stock. (a) 
Separate ledger accounts shall be provided for each subclass of capital 
stock issued or assumed by the accounting company to cover discount 
suffered and premium realized at the time of sale of capital stock. 
General levies or assessments against stockholders shall be credited to 
the appropriate ledger accounts for the subclass of capital stock 
against which the levy or assessment is made.
    (b) The total of net debit balance in these ledger accounts shall be 
included in account 793, Discount on capital stock, and the total of net 
credit balances in account 794, Premiums and assessments on capital 
stock.
    (c) Discount on each subclass of capital stock may be offset or 
reduced by charges to account 794, Premiums and assessments on capital 
stock, to the extent that net gains from premiums or assessments have 
been included therein or to account 795, Other capital, to the extent 
that net gains from reacquisition and resale or retirement of capital 
stock applicable to such subclass have been included therein. Any 
remaining discount may be amortized by charge to account 616. Other 
debits to retained earnings, or may be retained and carried in account 
793, Discount on capital stock, until the stock to which the discount 
applies is retired.
    (d) In case the accounting company is permitted and elects with the 
approval of the Board, to distribute all or any part of the net balance 
of other paid-in capital to its stockholders, the amount thus 
distributed shall be charged to account 795, Other capital.
    (e) When capital stock is reacquired, either by purchase or 
donation, and is retired or cancelled, account 791, Capital stock, shall 
be charged with the par value, stated value of no par stock, or if no 
par stock without stated value, the proportionate amount at which the 
particular class of stock is included in account 791. Any excess of 
reacquisition cost over the recorded value of the stock shall be charged 
to account 795, Other capital, to the extent of the accumulated net 
gains included in this account applicable to reacquisition and resale or 
retirement of such subclass. Any remaining excess reacquisition cost 
shall be charged to account 616, Other debits to retained earnings. Any 
excess of recorded value over reaquisition cost shall be credited to 
account 795, Other capital.
    (f) When capital stock is reacquired, either by purchase or 
donation, and is not retired or cancelled, nor properly includable in 
sinking or other funds, the reacquisition cost shall be charged to 
account 798.5, Treasury stock.
    (g) When treasury stock is resold, account 798.5, Treasury stock, 
shall be credited with the cost paid for it. Gains shall be credited to 
account 795, `Other capital. Losses shall be charged to account 795, 
Other capital, to the extent that previous net gains from sales or 
retirements of the same class of stock are included therein; otherwise, 
to account 616, Other debits to retained earnings.
    5-5  Joint liabilities. The accounting company shall state as a 
liability in its balance sheet the difference between the total par 
value of securities jointly or severally issued by it and others and the 
portion of such liability which, under the joint arrangement, it is 
expected will be liquidated by the other party or parties to the joint 
arrangement. The amount of the jointly or severally issued securities 
expected to be liquidated by the other party or parties shall be shown 
as a contingent liability in accordance with instruction 5-6 pertaining 
to contingent assets and liabilities.
    5-6  Contingencies. (a) The proper accounting treatment for 
contingencies depends upon whether the contingency

[[Page 47]]

is: Probable: the event or events are likely to occur; Reasonably 
possible: the chance of occurrence of the future event or events is more 
than remote, but less than likely; or Remote: the chance of occurrence 
of the future event or events is slight.
    (b) Loss contingencies must be accrued when they are probable and 
the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Where they are only 
reasonably possible, only footnote disclosure is required. Where they 
are remote, footnote disclosure is not required, but is permitted.
    (c) Gain contingencies usually are not reflected in the accounts 
since to do so might be to recognize revenue prior to its realization. 
Adequate disclosure shall be made of contingencies that might result in 
gain, but care shall be exercised to avoid misleading implications as to 
the likelihood of realization.

[42 FR 35017, July 7, 1977, as amended at 52 FR 4326, Feb. 11, 1987]

    5-7  Long-term obligations. Commitments under unconditional purchase 
obligations associated with suppliers' financing arrangements and future 
payments on long-term borrowings and redeemable stock shall be disclosed 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Such 
disclosures shall not preclude accounting recognition if the substance 
of a financing arrangement is the acquisition of an asset or incurrence 
of a liability.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLEARING ACCOUNTS--Table of Contents

<R05>


    6-1  Items to be charged. In recognition of the fact that certain 
expenditures incident to the construction and the operation of property 
are not chargeable directly to any particular property investment or 
expense account, clearing accounts have been provided for the purpose of 
securing an equitable distribution of such items to the proper primary 
accounts.
    6-2  Material and stationery store expenses. (a) To clearing 
accounts called Material store expenses and Stationery store expenses 
shall be charged expenses in connection with purchasing, handling and 
storing material and stationery in and distributing it from the 
company's storehouses. Including the pay of officers and employees in 
the purchasing and store departments and their traveling, office, and 
other expenses; also expenses, including wages, fuel, and supplies, of 
operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to the service 
of switching at material storehouses. (Expenses of incidental switching 
at material yards by locomotives in regular switching service shall be 
charged to the appropriate transportation accounts.) The pay and 
expenses of men employed in purchasing or inspecting a single class of 
material, such as ties, shall be added as store expenses to the cost of 
that particular material.
    (b) The total amount of storehouse expenses charged to these 
accounts shall be distributed among the accounts to which material and 
stationery has been charged, in proportion to the amounts charged to 
each account for the items issued, except that the amount representing 
the purchasing department expenses shall be apportioned on the value of 
the items issued which were purchased by that department. To avoid 
monthly fluctuations in the ratio of store expenses to the value of 
material and statonery purchased or issued, carriers may make a monthly 
apportionment on the basis of fair percentage rates, provided the store 
expense accounts are adjusted and closed out at the end of each year.
    6-3  Shop expenses. (a) To a clearing account entitled Shop expenses 
shall be charged items of expense at shops, enginehouses, repair tracks, 
and other places where mechanical work is performed, not assignable 
directly to specific accounts. Such expenses shall be apportioned among 
the various accounts affected. The basis of distribution shall be the 
relative proportion which the total amount of charges to Shop expenses 
bears to the total of the directly distributed labor. To avoid monthly 
fluctuations in the ratio of shop expenses to the total of distributed 
labor, carriers are permitted to make the monthly apportionment on the 
basis of a percentage of the distributed labor, provided the shop 
expense

[[Page 48]]

account is adjusted and closed out at the end of the year.
    (b) The expenses assignable to this account shall include the pay of 
foremen (who exercise supervision over all departments), their clerks, 
and other employees engaged in general work in and about shops, cost of 
heat, light and power; cost of small tools and supplies and water and 
power purchased; also cost of removal of snow and ice from transfer 
tables and shop yards, and other incidental shop expenses. To this 
account shall be charged expenses, including wages, fuel and supplies, 
of operating switching locomotives when exclusively assigned to 
switching service at shops (the expenses of incidental switching at 
shops by locomotives in transportation switching service shall be 
charged to appropriate transportation accounts).
    6-4  Gravel and sand pits and quarries. (a) When a gravel or sand 
pit or quarry is opened for operations likely to extend over a long 
period, an account shall be set up designated, Operations of gravel pit 
at --------------, or Operations of quarry at --------, as the case may 
be. To this account shall be charged cost of the land in excess of its 
estimated value after the gravel, sand, or stone has been removed 
(credit to the property account in which the cost of the land is 
included); payments for right to enter upon and remove ballast from land 
not owned by the carrier; cost of sinking test holes; and costs 
preparatory to opening the pit or quarry. To this account shall be 
charged also the cost, in excess of the estimated salvage value, of 
rails and fastenings, ties, other material and labor used in 
constructing tracks to and in the gravel pit or quarry (the estimated 
salvage being carried in an appropriate suspense account); cost of labor 
and train service employed in producing, quarrying, and loading ballast, 
including the cost of operation, repairs, and depreciation of power 
shovels and other machines and machinery; pay and expenses of watchmen; 
cost of explosives and hand tools, and miscellaneous expenses; and cost 
of installing, operating and maintaining signals and interlockers at 
gravel pits.
    (b) Credit to the clearing account shall be made each month to cover 
the cost of ballast material produced during the month. The cost of 
production shall include the expenses directly assignable to the monthly 
output plus a proportion of the expenses not directly assignable, such 
as cost of land, tracks, machinery, and interlockers. This latter amount 
shall be computed upon the basis of the ratio which the monthly output 
bears to the total estimated yardage to be taken from the pit. When any 
portion of the product of such pits or quarries is sold, the cost 
thereof shall be credited to this clearing account and any related 
profit shall be credited to account 110, Incidental.
    6-5  Power plant operations. (a) The accounting for the expenses of 
maintaining and operating an electric, steam, or other power plant (both 
building and machinery) shall be determined by the purpose for which the 
power produced is used. When a power plant is intended and used for 
producing power solely for the carrier's own operations and the cost of 
operating the plant is chargeable to clearing account Shop expenses, or 
to any one specific account for operating expenses, the expenses of 
maintenance shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance accounts, 
and the cost of operation to the account appropriate according to the 
use of the power.
    (b) When the power from such a plant is properly chargeable to more 
than one account, the expenses of maintaining and operating the plant 
shall be included in clearing account designated Power plant operations. 
The expense of maintenance shall be cleared from that account to the 
appropriate maintenance accounts. The expenses of operation shall be 
apportioned to the appropriate accounts upon the basis of quantity of 
power used for the various purposes.
    (c) When a part of the power produced by a power plant is sold and 
the remainder is used in the carrier's own operations, the cost of 
maintaining and operating the plant shall be charged to a clearing 
account. The expense of maintenance shall be cleared from that account 
to the appropriate maintenance accounts. The proportion of the expenses 
of operation assignable to the power sold, on the basis of ratio of

[[Page 49]]

quantity of power sold to total quantity of power produced, shall be 
credited to this clearing account and any related profit shall be 
credited to account 110, Incidental. The remainder of the cost of 
operation shall be distributed to the appropriate expense accounts for 
the carrier's own operations.
    (d) When power plants are intended and used solely for furnishing 
power to others, their investment cost shall be included in account 737, 
Property used in other than carrier operations, and the revenues and 
operating expenses shall be included in the accounts provided for 
operations of such property.
    (e) The accounting for the maintenance of transmission systems and 
distribution systems shall be in accordance with instructions pertaining 
to power plant operations.

General Expenditures--Table of Contents

<R05>


70  General expenditures.
    The primary accounts of this general account are designed to include 
expenditures made in connection with the acquisition and construction of 
original road and equipment, and with extension, additions, and 
betterments to road and equipment property, when such expenditures 
cannot properly be included in any of the foregoing accounts as a part 
of the cost of any specific work. When assignable, such expenditures 
shall be included in the cost of the property for which the expenditures 
occurred.
76  Interest during construction.
    (a) When any bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness are 
sold, or any interest-bearing debt is incurred for acquisition and 
construction of original road and equipment, extensions, additions, and 
betterments, the interest accruing on the part of the debt representing 
the cost of property chargeable to road and equipment accounts (less 
interest, if any, allowed by depositaries on unexpended balances) after 
such funds become available for use and before the receipt or the 
completion or coming into service of the property so acquired shall be 
charged to this account.
    (b) When such securities are sold at a premium, the proportion of 
such premium assignable to the time between the date of the actual 
issuance of the securities and the time when the property acquired or 
the improvement made becomes available for service shall be credited to 
this account.
    (c) This account shall also include such proportion of the discount 
and expense on funded debt issued for the acquisition of original road, 
original equipment, road extensions, additions, and betterments, as is 
equitably assignable to the period between the date of the actual 
issuance of securities and the time when the property acquired or the 
improvement made become available for the service for which it is 
intended. The proportion of discount and expense thus chargeable shall 
be determined by the ratio between the period prior to the completion or 
coming into service of the facilities or improvements acquired and the 
period of the entire life of the securities issued.
    Note A: Interest on bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness 
accruing before the proceeds from the sale of the securities become 
available for use shall not be included in this account, nor shall there 
be included any interest accruing after the property with respect to 
which the proceeds are expended is received or becomes available for use 
in connection with commercial service.
    Note B: If securities issued or assumed by the carrier are 
subsequently sold or exchanged by or for the carrier, the excess of

[[Page 65]]

the par value and accrued interest of the securities over the actual 
money value of the consideration received shall be deemed a discount. In 
no case (except as provided in the third paragraph of this account) 
shall discount be included as part of the cost of items included in the 
accounts prescribed in this classification.
    Note C: Whenever interest, premium, or discount assignable to the 
construction period is incurred in connection with an expenditure 
covered by some specific road and equipment account or accounts, such 
interest, premium, or discount shall be charged directly to the specific 
accounts to which it is related. Unless provided for otherwise, interest 
costs shall be capitalized in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles.
    Note D: This account shall not include interest during the 
construction period on the carrier's own funds expended in connection 
with the acquisition or construction of original road and equipment, 
extensions, additions, and betterments.

Other Property Accounts--Table of Contents

<R05>


80  Other elements of investment.
    (a) This account shall include amounts resulting from adjustment of 
the primary property accounts to conform with cost of property in 
valuation records. The amount in this account shall be cleared on a 
consistent basis as property is retired from service or otherwise in 
accordance with the rules in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this 
account. Any material amount in this account assignable to property 
previously retired from service shall be cleared immediately.
    (b) When property is retired from service, an equitable portion of 
the balance in this account assignable to such property shall be cleared 
when the retirement entry is made. The amount so cleared, when a debit, 
shall be charged to account 551, Miscellaneous income charges, or, when 
a credit, shall be recorded in account 519, Miscellaneous income. The 
exception to this general rule with respect to a credit balance 
assignable to property retired is that when property classified as 
depreciable is retired from service and the balance in the accumulated 
depreciation account for the property is materially deficient, because 
of sudden retirement or other unusual cause, the portion of a credit 
balance cleared for the retirement, equal to the deficiency, shall be 
applied to reduce the amount of loss otherwise chargeable to the 
accumulated depreciation account.
    (c) A carrier may apply to the Board for authority to clear the 
entire balance from this account immediately or amortize the balance 
over a short period of time by appropriate inclusion in account 616, 
Other debits to retained earnings, or account 606 Other credits to 
retained earnings. Any amount so authorized or directed by the Board to 
be cleared and written off to retained income shall be in lieu of 
amounts includible in accounts indicated in paragraph (b).
    (d) Other plans for clearance, disposition, or classification of a 
balance in this account in conformity with sound accounting principles 
may be submitted to the Board with suitable details for consideration. 
This includes application for disposition of a balance in this account 
attributable to reduction of capitalization in a reorganization. An 
accounting procedure so applied for shall become effective only after 
Board approval. Each carrier shall maintain a record of items initially 
included in and cleared later from this account and the basis used in 
computing such items.
    Note: The amounts attributable to past mergers, consolidations and 
purchases of property included in this account shall be merged with the 
adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this text.
90  Construction in progress.
    This account shall include expenditures incurred by the carrier in 
the process of constructing road and equipment with its own forces or 
under contract during the period prior to the time property is placed in 
transportation operations, including cost of materials and supplies 
located at point of use and of necessary land acquired for such 
projects. When a project is completed or when a segment of a large 
project is completed and placed in service, the cost of the completed 
project or the completed segment thereof shall be transferred to the 
appropriate road and equipment primary accounts. Separate subaccounts 
may be maintained

[[Page 66]]

for road, equipment, or other classes of expenditures. Expenditures for 
relatively unimportant projects may be included directly in primary 
accounts.

or agreements are credited by the operating company to the tenant 
companies which participate therein. The bill rendered by any creditor 
company against a debtor company for the latter's proportion of the 
expense of maintenance and operation of joint facilities, which includes

    (1) The operating expense accounts use a six-digit code. The first 
two digits denote natural expense, the second two digits denote 
activity/subactivity, and the third two digits denote detailed 
functions. [See Table A for an overview of the coding structure and 
Tables B-E for detailed functions.]
    (2) The operating expense account explanations use a three-tier 
format. Section 1 contains natural expense explanations with applicable 
activity/subactivity and function assignment. Section 2 details the 
activity/subactivity explanations. Section 3 explains the functions 
appropriate for each activity/subactivity. To obtain a complete 
explanation for a particular account, refer to section 1 to locate the 
natural expense and activity/subactivity (first four digits) and read 
the appropriate account text. Accounts that are assigned to functions 
are appropriately listed. For further information, refer to section 2 
and section 3.
    (3) All accounts listed in Table A and section 1 are for freight 
only. Refer to Table F for applicable passenger or common account codes. 
Account numbers designated with an asterisk in section 1 denote freight 
only accounts, while other accounts are used for both freight and 
passenger or common accounts.
    (4) All expense assigned to common operating accounts shall be 
allocated

to freight and passenger accounts in accordance with Part 1242 of this 
chapter.

\1\ Each operating expense account has a six-digit code divided into three two-digit groups. The first two-digit group denotes the natural expense [see control column], the second group
  denotes the activity/subactivity for freight, passenger or common service [see Table F]; and the third group signifies applicable function assignment [see Tables B, C, D & E].
\2\ The account numbers shown on this matrix are for freight only. The account numbers for passenger and common are derived by applying the natural expense code (first two digits) to the
  activity codes shown in Table F. Natural expenses are used only in the same activities as shown for freight.
\3\ Expenses shall be reported by applicable functions [see account text].

Specialized Services Operations Subactivity--(XX-34-XX)
    (4) Specialized Services Operations subactivity of the 
Transportation activity refers to operating services which are 
specialized in nature and in cost characteristics, including all of 
those so designated by the Board. The purpose of segregating the cost of 
such services is primarily to preclude distortion of general costs 
applicable to the Train Operations and Yard Operations subactivities. 
Secondarily, further breakout of the costs of operating individual 
specialized services can be provided in less detail than the full range 
of natural expense accounts, in reports used for recurring cost analysis 
purposes pertaining to each type of specialized service.
    The designated specialized services operations are as follows:
    (a) TOFC/COFC Operations refers to the function of operating rail-
to-ground or water and ground or water-to-rail transfer facilities for 
handling trailers or containers, including related storage; and the 
highway movement of trailers or containers within a terminal area for

dedicated yard serving the facility, or switching within the dedicated 
supporting terminal facility when performed by yard crews. They also do 
not include costs appropriate to the Way and Structures, Equipment, or 
General and Administrative activities.
    Floating operations should be classified by line and terminal 
operations. The distribution should be made based on the nature of the 
operation and not the facility or equipment. When the service occurs 
between distinct terminals, the operation should be considered a line 
operation. When the service is conducted within a general terminal or 
harbor area, the operation should be considered a terminal operation.
    (c) Coal Terminal Operations and Ore Terminal Operations refers to 
operations of rail-to-water or water-to-rail transloading facilities for

and Administrative activity except for those otherwise included in the 
definition of this subactivity.
    Carrier staff, administrative, or clerical operations related to 
operating or transportation department general administration should not 
be charged to this subactivity. The Administrative Support Operations 
subactivity may be performed at local stations, regional offices, or 
even at the general offices; however, the location of the operation 
performance does not affect its nature. The operations included in this 
subactivity should reasonably correlate to the quantity of shipments or 
to the quantity of carloadings.
General and Administrative Activity--(XX-60-XX)
    (D) General and Administrative activity refers to the providing of 
overall administration or other general support for carrier operations. 
It comprehends only that portion of general and administrative 
activities that relates to carrier operations (as distinguished from

charged, as they accrue, to the appropriate accounts.
712  Material and supplies.
    (a) This account shall include the balances representing the cost of 
all unapplied material, such as road and shop material, articles in 
process of manufacture by the accounting company, fuel, stationery, and 
dining car and other supplies. In determining the cost of material and 
supplies suitable allowance shall be made for any purchase discounts 
allowed. The cost shall include all specifically assignable 
transportation charges incurred in obtaining the delivery of such 
materials and supplies upon the premises of the carrier including 
loading and unloading, and a suitable proportion of purchasing and store 
expenses. The cost shall also include sales and excise taxes on material 
purchases; however, sales and excise taxes may be charged to account 
656000, ``Other taxes; General and administrative,'' provided this 
procedure will not adversely affect the accounts and is consistently 
followed. Taxes on gasoline, other motor fuel, and motor oil are also 
includible in this account.
    (b) Materials recovered for reuse in connection with construction, 
maintenance, or the retirement of property shall be charged to this

their net realizable value.
    (d) Material and supplies shall be credited to this account and 
charged to the appropriate operating expense or other account on the 
basis of recorded cost, average cost, or other recognized pricing 
system, provided that such system is consistently applied and is based 
on the cost of such material and supplies.
    (e) An inventory of material and supplies shall be taken during each 
calendar year and the necessary adjustments to bring this account into 
harmony with the actual inventory balances shall be made in the accounts 
of the year in which the inventories are taken. In effecting this 
adjustment, determined differences in accounting for important classes 
of material shall be equitably assigned among the accounts to which the 
classes of material are ordinarily chargeable. Other differences shall 
be equitably apportioned among the primary accounts to which material 
has been charged since the last inventory. (Also see instruction 5-
1(b).)
    Note: Balances representing the cost of unapplied construction 
material and supplies located at the point of use, which have been 
purchased for projected new roads and extensions, or for new railroad 
equipment, shall be included in account 90, ``Construction in

which time the amounts thereof shall be transferred to account 715.
    Note: The ledger value of assets of the character indicated in

such funds and which constitute support for long-term borrowing 
arrangements.

such items shall be transferred to this account.
    Note B: The term affiliated companies (also see definition 4) 
includes:
    1. Controlled companies, including companies solely controlled by 
the accounting company, and also companies jointly controlled by the 
accounting company and others under a joint arrangement.
    2. Controlling companies, including both companies solely 
controlling the accounting company, and companies which jointly control 
the accounting company under a joint arrangement.
    3. Companies controlled by controlled companies.
    4. Companies controlled by controlling companies.

By control (also see definition 4) is meant the ability to determine the 
action of a corporation. For the purposes of this account, the following 
are to be considered forms of control:
    (a) Right through title to securities issued or assumed to exercise 
the major part of the voting power in the controlled corporation.
    (b) Right through agreement or source other than title to 
securities, to name the majority of the board of directors, managers, or 
trustees of the controlled corporation.
    (c) Right to foreclose a first lien upon all or a major part in 
value of the tangible property of the controlled corporation.
    (d) Right to secure control because of advances made for 
construction of the operating property of the controlled corporation.
    (e) Right to control only in a specific respect the action of the 
controlled corporation.

A leasehold interest in the property of a corporation is not considered 
a form of control over the lessor corporation.
    Sole control is that which rests in one corporation.
    Joint control is that which rests in two or more corporations and 
which is held under a joint arrangement.
    Note C: The value of securities borrowed by the accounting company 
and pledged shall not be included in this account. A memorandum record

when the assets are written down or written off, or are sold or 
otherwise disposed of at a loss, the reduction in the book value or the 
losses sustained shall be charged to this account to the extent of the 
credit balance in the account applicable to the particular items 
involved, and the remainder, if any, shall be charged to account 551, 
``Miscellaneous income charges.'' Where a general provision for losses

subdivided according to the different classes of debt.

                    Long-Term Debt Due After One Year

765  Funded debt unmatured.
    (a) This account shall include the total par value of unmatured debt

within one year.'')
    (b) The amounts included in this account shall be divided to show

(pledged and unpledged) held in the company's treasury, by its agents or 
trustees, or otherwise subject to its control, including both those 
reacquired after actual issue and those nominally but never actually 
issued; and (2) certificates or other evidences of funded debt issued 
and actually outstanding, being those not held by the company, its 
agents or trustees, or subject to its control.
    (c) The amounts included herein shall be further divided so as to 
show the amount of each class of funded debt, as follows:
    (1) Mortgage bonds. Bonds secured by lien on physical property and

franchises, can claim payment of interest only in case interest is 
earned.
    (4) Miscellaneous obligations. All funded obligations not provided 
for by the other subdivisions of this account, also notes, unsecured 
certificates of indebtedness, debenture bond, plain bonds, real estate 
mortgages executed or assumed and other similar obligations maturing

or deferred equipment purchase contracts for which provision is made in 
accounts 782, ``Other liabilities,'' and 766, ``Equipment obligations,'' 
respectively.
    (5) Receipts outstanding for funded debt. Receipts for payments on 
account of funded debt. When certificates are issued for such payments, 
the par value shall be included in the account covering the class of 
funded debt for which the certificates are issued.
    (d) Each of the above classes shall also be divided into subclasses 
according to differences in mortgage or other lien or security therefor, 
rate of interest, interest dates, or date of maturity. Parts of any 
issue agreeing in other characteristics but maturing serially may be 
treated as of the same subclass.
    (e) Records shall be maintained in such manner as to show (1) 
securities the issuance or assumption of which has been authorized by 
the Board under provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, and similar 
securities issued or assumed prior to the effective date of such 
provisions of the Act, and (2) other obligations of a kind which may 
legally be issued or assumed without such authorization.

for current settlement. If no provision has been made for current 
settlement, matured funded debt shall be included in account 768, ``Debt

securities or obligations) the par value of such evidences shall be 
credited to this account.
    Note: The par value of equipment securities or the principal amount 
of obligations incurred for the purchase of equipment under conditional 
or deferred payment contracts shall be included in account 766, 
``Equipment obligations.''
768  Debt in default.

companies the collection of which is not enforced by the controlling 
company shall (to the extent of the principal amount held by the

accounts included in this account, when such interest is not subject to 
current settlements. The amounts included herein shall be divided as 
follows:
    (a) Notes, including not only nonnegotiable notes that run longer

to be the property of an affiliated company.

[[Page 123]]

    Note C: The term affiliated companies includes:
    1. Controlled companies, including companies solely controlled by 
the accounting company, and also companies jointly controlled by the 
accounting company and others under a joint arrangement. (See definition 
4.)
    2. Controlling companies, including both companies solely 
controlling the accounting company, and companies which jointly control 
the accounting company under a joint arrangement.
    3. Companies controlled by controlled companies.
    4. Companies controlled by controlling companies.

action of a corporation. For the purposes of this account, the following 
are to be considered forms of control:
    (a) Right through title to securities issued or assumed to exercise 
the major part of the voting power in the controlled corporation.

other than title to securities, to name the majority of the board of 
directors, managers, or trustees of the controlled corporation.

value of the tangible property of the controlled corporation.
    (d) Right to secure control in consequence of advances made for 
construction of the operating property of the controlled corporation.

    Joint control is that which rests in two or more corporations and 
which is held under a joint arrangement.

or equipment obligations. Separate subdivisions shall be maintained for 
each issue of such obligations. (See instruction 5-3.)
    Note A: Issue costs related to long-term debt (debt expense) shall 
be included in account 743, ``Other deferred debits.'' (See instruction

savings, relief, hospital, or other provident purposes.
    (b) The carrier may use the ``full accrual basis'' to account for 
pension costs upon prior approval of the Board. Full accrual basis as 
used herein means recording in the accounts now and hereafter costs of 
employees pensions accrued, including credits for past services, upon 
the basis of actuarial computations, even though the sum has not been

    (b) Separate subaccounts shall be maintained to show the amount 
provided for each liability and the nature of and amounts of debits and 
credits to the subaccounts.
    (c) If settlements for claims when audited are charged to this 
account, the balances for each year shall be kept separately until all 
items have been adjusted and cleared. If the settlements when audited 
are charged to the appropriate expense accounts, the balance in this 
account shall be adjusted through the expense accounts so as to reflect 
the probable liability at the close of each accounting period for claims 
which have been or may be filed for actuarial occurrences.

applicable subaccount shall be cleared to the appropriate operating 
expense or other account. Prior Board approval shall be required for 
clearance of balances in accrued liability subaccounts which were 
originally established by authority of the Board.
    (d) Estimates of amounts payable within one year covering any 
liability included in this account shall be transferred to account 759, 
``Accrued accounts payable.''
781  Interest in default.
    This account shall include the amount of matured and unpaid interest 
(for which no provision has been made for current settlement) on all 
indebtedness issued or assumed by the accounting company except interest 
which is added to the principal of the debt on which incurred. Where 
interest is in default, subsequent accruals shall be credited to this 
account.

with these transfers showing: (1) Original cost to carrier (or fair 
value if not purchased), (2) accumulated depreciation, and (3) estimated 
salvage value, if any.
    This account shall be charged periodically, and account 503, 
``Railway Operating Revenues--Amortization of Deferred Transfers from 
Government Authorities,'' shall be credited with amounts equal to the 
depreciation costs of the assets to which they apply. When such assets 
are retired or otherwise disposed of, this account shall be charged, and 
account 503 concurrently credited with any remaining associated amounts. 
(See instruction 1-15.)
    Note A: This account shall not include government transfers in the 
form of, or designated for the purchase of land or other non-depreciable 
property. Transfers of this type are includible in account 795, ``Other

                Subpart B--Branch Line Accounting System

900  Definitions.
    Unless otherwise required by context, the following definitions 
apply in this subpart:
    Account means an account in the ICC's Uniform System of Accounts 
(USOA), for Railroad companies (49 CFR Part 1201, Subpart A).
    IC Act means the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), as 
amended.
    Branch Line or Branch means a rail line or segment of line which (a) 
has been designated on a transportation system diagram in categories 
(1), (2), (3), or (4) (49 CFR 1152.10(b) (1), (2), (3), (4)); or (b) is 
the subject of a directed service order under section 304(d)(3) of the 
3R Act; or (c) is the subject of a rail continuation service agreement 
entered into prior to the designation of the line on a system diagram.
    STB or Board means the Surface Transportation Board.
    Designated State agency means the instrumentality created by a State 
or designated by appropriate authority to administer or coordinate its 
State rail plan as required by section 5(j)(2) of the Department of 
Transportation Act (90 Stat. 131) or section 402(c)(1)(A) of the 3R Act 
(87 Stat. 985) or regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.
    RSPO means the Rail Services Planning Office of the Surface 
Transportation Board.
    Railroad means a common carrier by railroad, as defined in section 
1(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. 1(3)).
    3R Act means the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, Pub. L. 
93-236, 87 Stat. 985, as amended.
    4R Act means the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act 
of 1976, Pub. L. 94-210, 90 Stat. 31.
    XX, when used in place of digits in a six-digit account number, 
means that all accounts containing the remaining four-digits are 
included. Example: 11-21-XX refers to all salary and wage accounts for 
locomotives because 11 designates salaries and wages and 21 designates 
locomotives. Thus, 11-21-XX includes all of the following accounts: 11-
21-01; 11-21-40; 11-21-48; 11-21-39; and 11-21-99. Similarly, XX-31-67 
means all accounts containing 31 (train operations) and 67 (locomotive 
fuel).

[43 FR 1733, Jan. 11, 1978, as amended at 47 FR 49596, Nov. 1, 1982]
910  Purpose and scope.
    (a) Section 205(e)(1)(A) of the 3R Act directs the office to issue 
regulations which will permit the collection and publication by the 
Consolidated Rail Corp. (ConRail), or by profitable railroads of 
information necessary to determine accurately the revenues attributable, 
avoidable costs, and service units of light-density lines scheduled for 
abandonment. This accurate information is intended to facilitate the 
determination of the revenues and avoidable costs in abandonment 
proceedings and in potential offers of subsidy. This information is 
intended to be compatible with the Regional Subsidy Standards (49 CFR 
Part 1155), for those lines which were not conveyed to ConRail under the 
final system plan and with the National Subsidy Standards (49

[[Page 140]]

CFR Part 1152, Subpart D), for all other lines. The purpose of the 
Branch Line Accounting System regulations is to specify an accounting 
system for the collection and publication of this information.
    (b) For further information regarding the Branch Line Accounting 
System, persons may contact the RSPO's Cost Evaluation Branch: Cost 
Evaluation Branch, Rail Services Planning Office, 1900 L Street NW., 
Washington, DC 20036, 202-254-7552.

[43 FR 1733, Jan. 11, 1978, as amended at 47 FR 49596, Nov. 1, 1982]
920  Collection of data.
    (a) Lines for which data collection is required. The railroad shall 
collect data on all branch lines which meet the criteria listed in 
paragraphs 1 through 4 below. The data to be collected are specified in 
section 920(b).
    (1) Branch lines in categories (1), (2), and (3) on the System 
Diagram Map include, respectively, lines for which a carrier intends to 
file an abandonment application within three years, lines which the 
carrier has under study and are potentially subject to abandonment, and 
lines for which an abandonment application is pending before the Board. 
The collection of data on such lines shall commence on the first day of 
the month after the line has been designated in one of the categories 
and will continue so long as the branch line is retained in one of these 
categories. The assignment and apportionment methodology set forth in 
Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.
    (2) For branch lines operated under an order directing service, 
under section 304(d)(3) of the 3R Act, data shall be collected from the 
effective date of the order until the order is withdrawn. The assignment 
and apportionment methodology set forth in Part 1155, Subchapter B 
(Regional Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.
    (3) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation 
agreement under section 1a(6)(a) of the IC Act, data shall be collected 
from the effective date of the agreement until the termination of the 
agreement. The assignment and apportionment methodology set forth in 
Part 1152, Subchapter B (National Subsidy Standards), shall be applied.
    (4) For branch lines operated under a rail service continuation 
agreement under section 304 of the 3R Act, data collection shall 
commence on the effective date of the agreement and shall continue until 
the termination date of the agreement. The assignment and apportionment 
methodology set forth in Part 1155, Subchapter B (Regional Subsidy 
Standards), shall be applied.
    (b) Data to be collected. The data collected shall include the items 
of revenue, expense, and service units which are specified in Parts 1152 
and 1155, Subchapter B (National and Regional Subsidy Standards), as 
described in the account texts listed in section 950. The format for 
presentation of these data is specified in section 940.

[43 FR 1733, Jan. 11, 1978, as amended at 47 FR 49596, Nov. 1, 1982]
930  Publication of data.
    (a) General. The railroad shall file on or before June 30 of each 
calendar year the certification included in these regulations as 
Appendix I. The railroad shall include a description of each branch line 
using the format set forth in Appendix I of these regulations. The 
description of each branch line requires the same data as that submitted 
under 49 CFR 1152.11. This section prescribes the branch line 
information required in conjunction with the system diagram maps 
specifying the line's designation, states and counties traversed, 
delineation of mileposts, and location of agency and terminal stations.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Access to records. The records, accounts, working papers, and 
other documents reflecting the revenues, cost, and service unit data of 
each branch line for which the railroad must maintain data shall be made 
available for inspection and examination by the Board and, for lines 
situated within its State, by the designated State agency at a time and 
place mutually agreeable to the parties. The railroad shall also 
reproduce such records for the designated State agency, provided the 
agency pays the reasonable cost thereof.

    (d) Waivers and modifications. The Office may, with respect to 
individual requests, upon good cause shown, waive or modify any 
requirement of this section not required by law.

unloading, upon the basis of tariff rates.
    Note: This account shall be maintained so as to reflect separately 
(1) revenue from detention of cars, and (2) revenue from detention of 
trailers and containers used in TOFC/COFC service.
    110 Incidental. This account is designed to show the amounts which 
the carrier becomes entitled to receive from services rendered 
incidentally with rail-line and water-line transportation; for the use 
of facilities of which the expenses for operation and maintenance are 
not separable from railway expenses and from incidental sources not 
provided for elsewhere. Among the items included in this account are 
revenues derived from (1) hotels and restaurants, (2) operations 
conducted at stations and on trains by individual or companies other 
than railway companies, (3) storage, (4) the sale of electric power, (5)

revenue from the operation of joint tracks, yards, terminals and other 
facilities operated by other companies, which under existing contracts 
or agreements are credited by the operating company to the tenant 
companies which participate therein. The bill rendered by any creditor 
company against a debtor company for the latter's proportion of the 
expense of maintenance and operation of joint facilities, which includes 
also a credit covering a proportion of the revenue to be paid over, 
shall show the distribution of the credit for such proportion of the 
revenue separately from the distribution of the expense of operation.
    Note B: No credits shall be made to this account representing 
amounts creditable by the operating company to primary accounts 101-103, 
105, and 110.

[[Page 149]]

    122 Joint facility, debit. This account shall include that 
proportion of revenue from the operation of joint tracks, yards, 
terminals, and other facilities, which is creditable to other companies, 
including revenue from hotels, restaurants, grain elevators, sale of

from operation of a terminal company or other carrier which, under the 
terms of existing contracts or agreements covering the joint use of 
tracks, yards, and other facilities, is credited to other carriers that 
participate in the benefits from such joint use. The bill rendered by a 
creditor company against a debtor company for the latter's proportion of 
expense of maintaining and operating joint facilities, which includes a 
credit covering the debtor company's proportion of the revenues from 
operation of such joint facilities, shall indicate separately the proper 
distribution of both the revenues and the expenses included in the bill, 
and such distribution shall be adhered to the debtor.
    Note B: No debits shall be made to this account representing amounts 
creditable by the operating company to primary accounts 101-103, 105, 
and 110.

``Miscellaneous rents,'' is sublet by the accounting company, the rent 
receivable therefore shall be credited to this account.

used in other than carrier operations.''
    Note D: Rent and other income from real estate acquired for new 
lines or for additions and betterments shall be credited to the 
appropriate road and equipment accounts until the completion or coming 
into service of the property.
    519 Miscellaneous income. (1) This account shall include all items, 
not provided for elsewhere, properly creditable to income accounts 
during the current year. Among the items which shall be included in this 
account are:

operating agreement and (2) would cease if freight service on the line 
were discontinued.

accompanied by a statement executed by a person having personal 
knowledge of the facts indicating the type of data included within the

                          List of Instructions


<R05>
Sec. 1242.00  Separation of common operating expenses.

    (a) Commencing with annual reports for the year 1978 or for any 
portion thereof until further order, all class I railroad companies 
including class I switching and terminal companies (Sec. 1240.1 of this 
chapter) subject to section 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended 
shall separate operating expenses common to both freight service and 
passenger service in accordance with the regulation in this part.
    (b) The carrier shall maintain records supporting its common 
operating expense apportionments to freight and passenger services. The 
carrier shall report common expense apportionments to the Board as 
required.

                                 General


<R05>
Sec. 1242.01  Expenses solely related to freight service and passenger service.

    The Uniform System of Accounts for Railroad Companies (49 CFR part 
1201) requires that carriers assign directly to freight service or to 
passenger service, including allied services, the expenses, taxes, and 
purchased services incurred solely for the benefit of either freight or 
passenger service.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.02  Common expenses.

    The Uniform System of Accounts also requires that carriers assign to 
common expense accounts the remaining expenses, taxes and purchased 
services which are not solely related to either freight or passenger 
service. The following instructions govern the separation of common 
expense accounts between freight and passenger services.

[[Page 173]]


<R05>
Sec. 1242.03  Made by accounting divisions.

    The separation shall be made by accounting divisions, where such 
divisions are maintained, and the aggregate of the accounting divisions 
reported for the quarter and for the year.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.04  Special tests.

    When the separation of common expense accounts between freight and 
passenger services is based upon special tests or service unit factors, 
such tests shall be made at sufficiently frequent intervals to represent 
actual operating conditions. The service unit factors used are those of 
the reporting period.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.05  Operating expense account number notation.

    (a) The operating expense account numbers consist of a six-digit 
coding structure divided into three two-digit groups. The first two-
digit group denotes natural expenses; the second group denotes 
activities/subactivities for freight, passenger or common service; and 
the third group signifies applicable function assignment.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC03MR91.050

    (b) For reporting purposes, four natural expense categories are 
utilized. The categories are: salaries and wages (account 11-XX-XX); 
material, tools, supplies, fuels and lubricants (account 21-XX-XX); 
purchased services (accounts 31-XX-XX to 41-XX-XX, inclusive); and 
general (accounts 61-XX-XX to 65-XX-XX, inclusive, 51-XX-XX, 52-XX-XX, 
53-XX-XX and 12-XX-XX).
    (c) The symbol ``XX'' in the first two-digit group is used 
throughout the separation instructions to denote more than one natural 
expense associated with the same activity/subactivity-function account 
structure. For reporting purposes, the natural expense account numbers 
represented by ``XX'' include:

11--Salaries and wages;
21--Materials, tools, supplies, fuels, and lubricants;
30 or 41--Purchased services:
    30--Summation of certain purchased service accounts;
    41--Other purchased services;
61--General.

    (d) The ``30'' natural expense designation indicates a summation of 
specific purchased service accounts that are reported in total rather 
than individually. The specific accounts under the way and structures 
activity except for administration functions include 39-1X-XX, repairs 
billed by others, Dr.; 40-1X-XX, repairs billed to others, cr.; and 41-
1X-XX, other purchased services. For the equipment activity excluding 
administration functions, the ``30'' designation denotes the summation 
of 39-2X-XX and 41-2X-XX.
    (e) The ``41'' natural expense designation (other purchased 
services) is the purchased service category of the ``XX'' code for the 
following:
    (1) Way and structures activity administration--function accounts,
    (2) Equipment activity administration--function accounts,
    (3) Transportation activity expense accounts, and
    (4) General and administration activity expense accounts.
    (f) The ``61'' general natural expense designation is applicable to 
all accounts with the ``XX'' symbol except transportation, train and 
yards accounts (XX-(33/43/53)-XX).
    (g) The natural expense account number ``50'' is used throughout the 
separation instructions to indicate the summation of accounts 52-XX-XX, 
Other casualties, and 53-XX-XX, Insurance, that are reported as one 
item, ``Casualties and Insurance,'' (50-XX-XX).
    (h) The number ``98'' in the function account group (last two 
digits) is used in the separation rules to designate the summation of a 
natural expense consisting of more than one functional assignment that 
is reported as one item. This includes Repairs Billed to Others, Cr.--
Equipment (40-2X-XX). For example, the locomotive subactivity contains 
accounts 40-(21/24/26)-40, 40-(21/24/26)-41, and 40-(21/24/26)-48 which 
are treated as 40-(21/24/26)-98.


<R05>
Sec. 1242.06  Instructions for separation.

    (a) Certain instructions for separating common expense accounts 
(dependent accounts) between freight and passenger services base the 
allocation on

[[Page 174]]

the proportional freight/passenger separation of other common expense 
accounts (independent accounts). The dependent account is frequently 
identified by an ``XX'' symbol in the natural expense position (first 
two digits) with corresponding independent accounts also identified by 
the ``XX'' natural expense symbol. Unless otherwise stated, the 
applicable natural expense associated with ``XX'' symbol shall be the 
same for both the dependent and independent accounts.
    (b) To illustrate, Sec. 1242.10 provides instructions for separating 
common Way and Structures, Administration--Track accounts (dependent 
accounts) designated by XX-19-02. The separation is based on certain 
other common Way and Structures accounts including Roadway--Running, XX-
17-10, and Roadway--Switching, XX-18-10.
    (c) As Sec. 1242.05 states, the ``XX'' symbol denotes the following 
natural expenses for Way and Structures administration functions:

11--Salaries and wages,
21--Materials, tools, supplies, fuels, and lubricants,
41--Other purchased services, and
61--General.


These natural expenses shall be individually applied to the separation 
rules in Sec. 1242.10. In each case, the independent accounts providing 
the basis for freight/passenger separation of the dependent account 
shall have the same natural expense designation. For example, the basis 
of separating account 11-19-02, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, 
Administration--Track, would be based on certain independent accounts 
including 11-17/18-10, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, Running/
Switching, Repair and Maintenance, Roadway.

                 Operating Expenses--Way and Structures


<R05>
Sec. 1242.10  Administration--track (account XX-19-02).

passenger services in the same proportion as the common expenses of the 
following accounts are separated between freight and passenger services:

<R05>
Sec. 1244.1  Definitions.

    (a) Railroad--an individual railroad or terminal company subject to 
the Interstate Commerce Act and every receiver, trustee, executor, 
administrator or assignee of any such railroad. If a railroad and its 
railroad subsidiaries report to the Board on a consolidated basis, they 
would collectively be considered as a railroad.
    (b) A railroad subsidiary--a railroad owned or controlled by another 
railroad.
    (c) A waybill, which may be referred to by other names such as mine 
tickets, is the document or instrument prepared from the bill of lading 
contract or shipper's instructions as to the disposition of the freight, 
and used by the railroad(s) involved as the authority to move the 
shipment and as the basis for determining the freight charges and 
interline settlements.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.2  Applicability.

    (a) Effective July 1, 1981 and thereafter, unless otherwise ordered, 
each railroad as defined in Sec. 1244.1 above is required to file 
waybill sample information for all line-haul revenue waybills terminated 
on its lines if it terminates at least 4,500 revenue carloads in any of 
the three preceding years, or if it terminates at least 5% of the 
revenue carloads terminating in any state in any of the three preceding 
years. A railroad required to file waybill sample information under this 
section shall herein be referred to as subject railroad.
    (b) Waybill terminations shall include all line-haul revenue 
movements

[[Page 185]]

terminating for waybilling purposes on the subject railroad's line 
whether the lading is destined for the terminating station as denoted on 
the waybill or the shipment is being rebilled or forwarded to the 
ultimate destination by another railroad or another mode of 
transportation (e.g., lake cargo, inbound transit, or other rebilled 
movements).
    (c) Each subject railroad shall also file the required waybill 
sample information for all of its railroad subsidiaries.
    (d) Each subject railroad shall also file the required waybill 
sample information for any other railroad for which it performs revenue 
billing and/or interline settlements under special agreement.
    (e) The surviving corporate entity of railroads (subject to the 
Interstate Commerce Act) who have merged or reorganized shall be 
required to report waybill sample information if its predecessor 
railroad or any of its predecessor railroads were required to report 
under this section.
    (f) In order to determine the number of carloads terminated in each 
state, railroads not otherwise submitting waybill information must 
report annually the number of carloads terminated by state for the last 
calendar year. These reports shall be submitted by March 1 of the year 
following the report year.
    (g) Transition. This final rule will apply to all subject waybills 
which are in the subject railroad's audit month of July 1981 and all 
audit months thereafter. The former rule will continue to apply to all 
subject waybills for the prior audit months up to and including June 
1981.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.3  Sampling of waybills.

    (a) Subject railroads shall file waybill sample information in one 
of the following two ways. (1) Authenticated copies of a sample of 
audited revenue waybills--the manual system (Sec. 1244.3(b)). (2) A 
computer tape containing specified information from a sample of 
waybills--the computerized system (Sec. 1244.3(c)).
    (b) The Manual System. (1) The sample of subject waybills shall be 
as follows:
    (i) All waybills with less than 6 carloads per waybill whose serial 
numbers are 1 or end in 01,
    (ii) All waybills with 6 to 25 carloads per waybill whose serial 
numbers end in 1; and,
    (iii) All waybills with 26 or more carloads per waybill whose serial 
numbers end in 1 or 7.
    (2) The expected sampling rates for the manual system are as 
follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Expected
                Numbers of carloads on waybill                   sample
                                                                  rate
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 to 5........................................................    1/100
6 to 25.......................................................     1/10
26 and over...................................................      1/5
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (3) Upon giving the subject roads 60 days notice, the Board may 
require random serial number endings in lieu of the respective endings 
shown in Sec. 1244.3(b). These random serial number endings would have 
the expected sample rates shown in Sec. 1244.3(b)(2).
    (4) If the subject waybills have no waybill numbers or serial 
numbers, or have seriously flawed waybill or serial numbers, then the 
subject railroad should serialize those documents in blocks of 1,000 or 
blocks of multiples of 1,000 (e.g., 1, 2, . . . 1,000; 1, 2, . . .) and 
use these constructed serial numbers for selection purposes.
    (c) The Computerized System. (1) The tape shall be required to 
conform to the standards and format specified in Statement No. 81-1, 
Procedure for Sampling Waybill Records by Computer, issued by the 
Surface Transportation Board, which may be revised from time to time.
    (2) The sampling rates for the computerized system are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  Sample
                  Number of carloads on waybill                    rate
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 to 2..........................................................    1/40
3 to 15.........................................................    1/12
16 to 60........................................................     1/4
61 to 100.......................................................     1/3
101 and over....................................................     1/2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (d) Controls and Annual Counts. (1) Each subject railroad shall 
maintain a control procedure to ensure complete and accurate reporting 
for the waybill sampling. All pertinent waybill data shall be included 
on hard copy waybill

[[Page 186]]

submissions including inbound references for transit waybills. All such 
pertinent waybill data shall be legible.
    (2) All subject railroads shall maintain a record of the number of 
line-haul revenue carloads that terminated on their line in a calendar 
year and shall furnish this number when requested by the Board.
    (3) All subject railroads using the manual system of reporting shall 
furnish the Board, in accordance with instructions on the Transmittal 
Form OPAD-2, the total counts of line-haul revenue waybills terminated 
in each reporting period for the following three categories:
    (i) Waybills, with less than six carloads per waybill,
    (ii) Waybills with 6 to 25 carloads per waybill, and
    (iii) Waybills with 26 or more carloads per waybill.
    (4) All subject railroads on the computerized system of reporting 
shall furnish the Board the control counts and tape specification 
information as required by the Statement No. 81-1.
    (5) Certification by a responsible officer of the subject railroad 
as to the completeness and accuracy of sample shall be made once a year 
in accordance with the instructions on the Transmittal Forms OPAD-1 or 
OPAD-2.

<R05>
Sec. 1244.4  Date of filing.

    (a) The reporting period for which subject railroads submit waybill 
sample information shall be the audit (accounting) month except as 
specified below:
    (1) Subject railroads using the computerized system may submit 
waybill sample information quarterly as specified in Statement 81-1.
    (2) Subject railroad using the manual system may submit waybill 
sample information quarterly if it submits fewer than 1,000 waybills per 
year.
    (b) Waybill sample information shall be forwarded no later than 60 
days from the end of the reporting period to the Board.
    (c) When the submitted waybill sample information is returned to the 
submitting railroad for correction, that railroad shall resubmit 
corrected data to the Board promptly but no later than 60 days after its 
receipt.
    (d) Transmittal Forms. (1) Subject railroads using the manual system 
of reporting shall complete the Transmittal Form OPAD-2, to accompany 
each waybill sample submission.
    (2) Subject railroads using the computerized system of reporting 
shall complete the Transmittal Form OPAD-1, to accompany each waybill 
tape submission.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.5  Retention of files.

    (a) Subject railroads which submit waybill sample data by the 
computerized system instead of the manual system shall retain the 
underlying hard copy waybills or facsimilies capable of producing 
legible copies, which shall be complete including inbound references for 
transit waybills, for a minimum period of four years.
    (b) This file of retained waybills shall be maintained in such a 
manner that the railroads on the computerized system may readily 
retrieve waybill copies using the waybill identifier code as shown on 
the submitted computerized waybill record.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.6  Special studies.

    (a) Although routine submission of hard copy waybills is eliminated 
when a railroad reports under the computerized system, the Board may 
order that railroad to submit hard copies of the underlying waybills for 
special studies.
    (b) The Board may order the subject railroads to supply additional 
data for submitted waybill copies or records for special studies.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.7  Analysis of waybill data.

    Users of the waybill sample when presenting waybill analysis before 
the Board shall ensure that the appropriate weighting factors are 
applied to account for the stratified sampling. See Statement 81-1 for 
guidelines for weighting waybill data and for computing sampling errors.


<R05>
Sec. 1244.8  Procedures for the release of waybill data.

    (a) General. The procedures for the release of waybill data identify 
five classes of users of the STB Waybill

[[Page 187]]

Sample, define the waybill information or data that each class of users 
may obtain, and set forth the applicable requirements for the data's 
release. They also formalize notice and protest procedures for the 
possible release of waybill data to other users to protect against the 
inappropriate release of confidential data. The Director of the Office 
of Transportation Analysis shall be responsible for releasing waybill 
data in accordance with these procedures.
    (b) Class of user, available data, and applicable release 
requirements. (1) Railroads. Each requesting railroad may obtain any 
waybill record from the STB Waybill Sample covering traffic that 
originated, terminated, or was bridged by that railroad. The railroad 
shall not have access to waybill data pertaining to traffic in which it 
did not participate. Also, it must meet all STB and legal requirements 
concerning release of shipper information in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 
11910(a).
    (2) Federal agencies. Each requesting Federal agency (including 
quasi-governmental agencies) may obtain any waybill record from the STB 
Waybill Sample subject to the following requirements:
    (i) The Federal agency shall make the information contained in the 
STB Waybill Sample available only to its employees or those contractors 
working on the particular project or study requiring the waybill data.
    (ii) The Federal agency will ensure that railroads and shippers are 
afforded the same privilege and protection against disclosure of the 
waybill data as the Board provides.
    (iii) The Federal agency will not release any data to the public 
unless the data elements are aggregated to contain at least three 
shippers and to prevent identification of an individual railroad.
    (iv) The Federal agency will refer any requests for waybill data and 
accompanying documentation to the STB for processing and will so inform 
the requesting party of such referral to the Board.
    (v) The Federal agency must sign an agreement annually with the 
Board agreeing to these restrictions.
    (3) States. Each requesting State may obtain any waybill record 
pertaining to traffic that was originated, terminated, interchanged in, 
or that passed through its State subject to the same requirements 
imposed on federal agencies under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (v) of 
this section.
    (4) Transportation practitioners, consulting firms, and law firms--
specific proceedings. Transportation practitioners, consulting firms and 
law firms may use data from the STB Waybill Sample in preparing verified 
statements to be submitted in formal proceedings before the STB and/or 
State Boards (Board) subject to the following requirements:
    (i) The STB Waybill Sample is the only single source of the data or 
obtaining the data from other sources is burdensome or costly, and the 
data is relevant to issues pendng before the Board.
    (ii) The requestor submits to the STB a written waybill request that 
complies with Sec. 1244.8(e).
    (iii) All waybill data must be returned to the STB, and the firm 
must not keep any copies.
    (iv) A transportation practitioner, consulting firm, or law firm 
must submit any evidence drawn from the STB Waybill Sample to the Board 
only unless the evidence is aggregated to the level of at least three 
shippers and will prevent the identification of an individual railroad. 
Nonaggregated evidence submitted to the Board will be made part of the 
public record only if the Board finds that it does not reveal 
competitively sensitive data. However, evidence found to be sensitive 
may be provided to counsel or other independent representatives for 
other parties subject to the usual and customary protective order issued 
by the Board or appropriate authorized official.
    (v) For each Board proceeding, a firm must sign a confidentiality 
agreement with the STB agreeing to the above restrictions before any 
data will be released. This agreement will permit use of the released 
data for a period of one year from the date the agreement is signed by 
the user. If the data is required for an additional period of time 
because a proceeding is still pending before the Board, the firm must 
sign a

[[Page 188]]

new confidentiality agreement covering the data needed for each 
additional year the proceeding is opened.
    (5) Public use. Nonconfidential waybill data may be obtained from 
the ``Public Use Waybill File''. Reports produced from the Public Use

who filed objections will be sent written notice of the Director's 
decision not less than 14 calendar days prior to the disclosure date.
    (ii) The Board reserves the right to deny the release of waybill 
data although no objections may be filed.
    (iii) Appeals must be filed with the Chairman within 10 days of the 
date of the Director's decision. Responses to appeals must be filed

confidentiality or misuse of confidential waybill data must include the 
following:

Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423. A copy of the complaint 
shall also be served on the alleged violator(s).
    (4) An answer must be filed within 20 days after service of the 
complaint.

          compensation.
1245.2  Reports of railroad employees, service and compensation.
1245.3  Employees; definition, service hours, and compensation.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 721, 11145.

    Source: 32 FR 20462, Dec. 20, 1967, unless otherwise noted.
    Note: The report forms prescribed by part 1245 are available upon 
request from the Office of the Secretary, Surface Transportation Board, 
Washington, DC 20423.


<R05>
Sec. 1245.1  Rules governing classification of employees, service, and compensation.

    The rules governing the classification of railroad employees and 
reports of their service and compensation outlined in Secs. 1245.3 and 
1245.4 are required, and all Class I railroads within the scope of 
Section 11145 of the Interstate Commerce Act shall be governed by such 
rules in the preparation and submission of their annual and other 
periodic reports to the Surface Transportation Board in accordance with 
the forms adopted for such returns (Sec. 1245.2); and also with respect 
to any other matters covered by these rules.

[47 FR 53867, Nov. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1245.2  Reports of railroad employees, service and compensation.

    Beginning with the reporting period commencing January 1, 1983, and 
quarterly thereafter until further ordered, each Class I railroad is 
required to file a Quarterly Report of Railroad Employees, Service, and 
Compensation, (Form QRSC). In addition, such carriers shall also file an 
Annual Report of Railroad Employees, Service, and Compensation, (Form 
ARSC) for each calendar year. Both reports shall be filed with the 
Bureau of Accounts, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423. 
The quarterly report shall be filed within thirty days after the end of 
each calendar quarter. The annual report shall be filed within forty 
five days after the end of the reporting year.

[47 FR 53867, Nov. 30, 1982]


<R05>
Sec. 1245.3  Employees; definition, service hours, and compensation.

    (a) Definition of ``employees''. The word employees, as used in this 
part, is intended to include every person in the service of the 
reporting carrier subject to its continuing authority to supervise and 
direct the manner of rendition of his service. Persons engaged to render 
only specifically defined service and not subject to the continuing 
authority of the carrier to supervise and control their acts, such as 
customhouse brokers, lawyers retained only for specific cases and not 
under general or continuing retainer, etc., are not employees in the 
meaning of the term used in this part.
    (b) Counting employees. Since the number of employees fluctuates, 
carriers are required to classify and count all of their employees at 
twelve different times each year.
    (c) Joint employees. Each person jointly employed shall, if carried 
on the payrolls of the several joint employers, be counted by each 
employer and represented in its return of number of employees by a 
fraction based on the number of employers reporting him; if a person, 
for example, is reportable by three employers, each should include him 
in its number of employees as one-third of an employee. When the entire 
compensation of a joint employee is shown on the payroll of a single 
joint employer and is paid to the employee by that employer such 
employee should, for the purpose of returns, be treated as if employed 
solely by such employer.
    (d) Service hours. (1) The number of hours on duty, or held for 
duty, and the

[[Page 191]]

number of hours paid for are to be ascertained and recorded for every 
class of employee. For enginemen and trainmen, the actual number of 
miles run and miles paid for but not run are to be recorded, as well as 
the number of hours on duty and the number of hours paid for. (The 
service time of all classes of employees shall be recorded in hours 
instead of days or hours as heretofore.)
    (2) Whenever an employee works at more than one occupation, or in 
more than one class of service, both the number of hours worked and the 
compensation paid, should be separated and reported under the proper 
Reporting Divisions.
    (3) If an employee is paid a day's wage for a smaller number of 
hours than constitutes a day's work, the number of hours paid for as 
well as the actual number of hours the employee is on duty should be 
ascertained and recorded. Time allowed for meals, part holidays, 
holidays, absences on leave, vacations, etc., should be excluded from 
time actually worked, but if such time is paid for it should be 
appropriately reported as ``Time paid for but not worked'' on Form A or 
as a ``constructive allowance'' on Form B. These requirements apply to 
enginemen and trainmen paid on the basis of trips or of miles run, and 
to employees paid at piece rates, as well as to employees paid on 
hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or other time basis. Service hours for 
officers and employees who do not receive payment for overtime should be 
reported as the number of hours in each month at 8 hours per day 
contemplated for the position.
    (e) Compensation. The compensation of employees as defined in the 
rules in this part is to be stated in such manner and detail as the 
forms adopted for periodical returns require.


<R05>
Sec. 1245.4  Forms required to be used.

    (a) The report of information to the Surface Transportation Board on 
railroad employees, service and compensation includes two forms. Form A 
relates to employees other than train and engine service employees. Form 
B relates to train and engine service employees.
    (b) With general reference to the statement of the compensation of 
employees in Forms A and B, it should be understood that the total 
compensation received by the employees in each Reporting Division, as 
well as the amount of work they perform, should be shown properly 
distributed under the prescribed column heads as indicated by the forms. 
It should be noted that if the work of an employee varies during a 
report period, his time and compensation should be apportioned 
accordingly. Amounts reported should be gross compensation paid.

    Illustrations. (a) In the course of a month, an employee works as a 
Machinist, and as such earns $200 and he works also as a Gang Foreman 
and earns $130. The pay received by him in the occupation of Machinist 
with corresponding time should be included in returns for Division 61, 
``Machinists'', and his other pay and time as indicated should be 
included in returns for Division 53, ``Gang Foremen and Gang Leaders''. 
(b) When an employee works at two or more of the occupations of 
engineer, fireman, conductor, and brakeman, his time and compensation 
should be assigned in accordance with the facts. For example, in a 
certain month an employee earns as a Through Freight Engineer $110, as a 
Local or Way Freight Engineer $140, as a Yard Engineer $100, and as a 
Local or Way Freight Fireman $75. The time and the compensation of this 
employee should be correspondingly distributed among Reporting Divisions 
122, 123, 124, and 127 as they are respectively applicable, without 
regard to the predominance of the time worked or the amount earned by 
him in one occupation.

    (c) As elsewhere indicated, the statement of the number of employees 
in the service of a company with respect to Reporting Divisions depends 
upon the allocation of the individual employees as of the day of count.
    (d) The Reporting Divisions shown in Forms A and B following will 
also be used in connection with the employees' schedule in the annual 
reports of railroads of classes I and II to the Board. Railroads of 
class III and lessor companies shall report only the information 
required in the annual report forms prescribed for such companies.

Sec. 1280.1  Purpose.

    To set forth those provisions of the Surface Transportation Board 
Security Regulations to the extent that they affect the general public.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.2  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Surface Transportation Board to act in 
accordance with Executive Order 12356, dated April 6, 1982, in matters 
relating to national security information.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.3  Authority to classify.

    The Board does not have authority of its own to classify any of its 
internally generated documents. The only documents handled by the Board 
which are classified as confidential, secret, or top secret are those 
generated by Executive Branch Agencies with original classification 
authority.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.4  Responsibility for handling of classified documents.

    (a) Responsible Official. Primary responsibility for the handling of 
classified documents shall rest with the Assistant to the Director of 
the Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance, who is also Emergency 
Coordinator for the Board. All documents bearing the terms ``Top 
Secret,'' ``Secret,'' and ``Confidential'' shall be delivered to the 
Emergency Coordinator or his/her alternate immediately upon receipt. The 
alternate is also an Assistant to the Director of the Office of 
Compliance and Consumer Assistance as set forth in Sec. 1280.4(b) of the 
rules. All potential recipients of such documents shall be advised of 
the name of the Emergency Coordinator. In the event that the Emergency 
Coordinator or his/her alternate is not available to receive such 
documents, they shall be turned over to the Associate Director, Office 
of Compliance and Consumer Assistance, and secured, unopened, in the 
combination safe located in Room 5325 of the headquarters building until 
the Emergency Coordinator or alternate is available. All material not 
immediately deliverable to either the Emergency Coordinator, alternate, 
or the

[[Page 211]]

Associate Director, Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance, shall 
be delivered at the earliest opportunity. Under no circumstances shall 
classified material that cannot be delivered to the Emergency 
Coordinator be stored other than in the designated safe in Room 5325 of 
the STB headquarters building.
    (b) The alternate to the Emergency Coordinator for the receipt and 
handling of documents mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section, shall 
be the other Assistant to the Director, Office of Compliance and 
Consumer Assistance.
    (c) Any person whose position requires access to classified 
information must execute Form SF 189.
    (d) Any contracts with media representatives by personnel with 
access to classified material and involving such material will be 
cleared through the Emergency Coordinator and more than one person shall 
be present during any briefing or interview.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.5  Safeguarding of classified material.

    (a) Reproduction of classified material shall take place only when 
absolutely necessary, and in accordance with section 2001.46 of the 
Directive. Should copies be made, they are subject to the same controls 
as the original document. Records showing the number and distribution of 
copies shall be maintained by the Emergency Coordinator and the log 
stored with the original documents.
    (b) Any suspected or actual unauthorized disclosures of classified 
information shall be reported to the Emergency Coordinator or Alternate. 
An immediate investigation will be undertaken by the Emergency 
Coordinator or Alternate to establish all facts surrounding the 
disclosure. The Emergency Coordinator or Alternate shall ascertain the 
nature of the information disclosed and the extent to which it has been 
disseminated and will maintain records of disclosures as evaluated and 
investigated.
    (c) Any suspected or actual unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information will be reported as soon as possible to the Department of 
Justice and the Information Security Oversight Office.
    (d) Any unauthorized disclosure of classified information or any 
failure to cooperate with the investigation of unauthorized disclosures 
by an employee shall be cause for appropriate disciplinary or other 
remedial action as provided in the Board's Canons of Conduct, 49 CFR 
1000.735-31.

[49 FR 7832, Mar. 2, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 38998, Sept. 22, 1989]


<R05>
Sec. 1280.6  Storage of classified documents.

    All classified documents shall be stored in the safe located in Room 
5325 of the STB headquarters building. In those instances where the 
Emergency Coordinator is not available to receive classified documents, 
they may be stored, unopened, in the safe located in Room 5325.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.7  Education of employees.

    All employees who have been granted a security clearance and who 
have occasion to handle classified materials shall be advised of the 
procedures outlined in 49 CFR part 1280. They shall also be required to 
review Executive Order 12356 and appropriate directives of the 
Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO). This shall be achieved by 
a memorandum to all affected employees at the time these procedures are 
implemented, and by appropriate instructions to new employees receiving 
security clearances in the future.


<R05>
Sec. 1280.8  Requests for mandatory review.

    Because the Board does not itself generate classified documents, any 
requests made for mandatory review shall be coordinated by the Emergency 
Coordinator with appropriate officials of the Department or Agency 
responsible for issuance of the document involved.

    Authority: 49 U.S.C. 721(a) and 11101(f).

    Source: 61 FR 35140, July 5, 1996, unless otherwise noted.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.1  Scope; definitions.

    (a) The provisions of this part address the requirements imposed on 
rail carriers by 49 U.S.C. 11101(b), 11101(c), 11101(d) and 11101(f).
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of 
this part apply to any common carriage transportation or service 
provided by a rail carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface 
Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 10501.
    (c) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation 
or service provided by a rail carrier under a contract authorized under 
49 U.S.C. 10709 or former 49 U.S.C. 10713 (repealed effective January 1, 
1996).
    (d) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation 
or service provided by a rail carrier to the extent that such 
transportation or service is exempted from rate notice and disclosure 
requirements pursuant to an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502 or 
former 49 U.S.C. 10505 (repealed effective January 1, 1996).
    (e) For the purposes of this part, ``service terms'' means all 
classifications, rules, and practices that affect the rates, charges, or 
level of service for rail transportation.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.2  Disclosure requirement for existing rates.

    (a) A rail carrier must disclose to any person, upon formal request, 
the specific rate(s) requested (or the basis for calculating the 
specific rate(s)), as well as all charges and service terms that may be 
applicable to transportation covered by the rate(s). For purposes of 
Sec. 1300.4(a)(1) of this part, a formal request under this part is one 
that clearly notifies the railroad that the requester seeks not only 
immediate information but also notification of any future increases in 
the rate(s) involved or changes in pertinent service terms.
    (b) The information provided by a rail carrier under this section 
must be provided immediately. (It is expected that the response will be 
sent within hours, or at least by the next business day, in most 
situations.) Such information may be provided either in written or 
electronic form as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot 
agree, such information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) 
form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it 
is to be provided in writing.
    (c) A rail carrier may, at its option, require that all requests 
submitted under this section be in written or electronic form, although 
the carrier may permit oral requests.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.3  Response to request for establishment of a new rate.

    Where a shipper or a prospective shipper or person acting on behalf 
of a shipper or a prospective shipper requests that the carrier 
establish a rate in the absence of an existing rate for particular 
transportation, the carrier must promptly establish and provide to the 
requester a rate and applicable service terms. The information may be 
provided either in written or electronic form, as agreed to by the 
parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided 
in electronic (non-passive) form where both parties have the requisite 
capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided in writing. The response

[[Page 213]]

should be provided as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 
business days from receipt of the request. If a carrier determines that 
additional information is required from the requester before a rate or 
term can be established, the carrier must so notify the requester as 
soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days after receipt of 
the request. Once the additional information is received, the carrier 
must set the rate and related service terms, and relay them to the 
requester, as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business 
days from the receipt of the additional information. (However, the 
parties may agree to a different time period, in which case these time 
periods would not apply.) A rail carrier may, at its option, require 
that requests submitted under this section be in written or electronic 
form, although the carrier may permit oral requests.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.4  Notice requirement.

    (a) A rail carrier may not increase any rates or charges, or change 
any service terms (except for changes that are equivalent to rate 
reductions), unless 20 days have expired after written or electronic 
notice has been provided to all persons who, within the previous 12 
months:
    (1) Have formally requested under Secs. 1300.2 or 1300.3 of this 
part the affected rates or service terms; or
    (2) Have made arrangements with the carrier for a future shipment 
that would be subject to the increased rates or changed service terms.
    (b) The notice required by this section may be in written or 
electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot 
agree, the information is to be provided in electronic (non-passive) 
form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it 
is to be provided in writing.
    (c) For purposes of this section, a mailed notice is deemed 
``provided'' on the date such notice is postmarked.
    (d) The notice required by this section must clearly identify the 
increases in rates or charges or the changes in service terms.


<R05>
Sec. 1300.5  Additional publication requirement for agricultural products and fertilizer.

    (a) With respect to transportation of agricultural products 
(including grain, as defined in 7 U.S.C. 75, and all products thereof) 
and fertilizer, a rail carrier shall publish, make available, and retain 
for public inspection its currently effective rates, schedules of rates, 
charges, and other service terms, and any scheduled changes to such 
rates, charges, and service terms. This requirement is in addition to 
the requirements imposed by Secs. 1300.2, 1300.3, and 1300.4 of this 
part.
    (b) The information published under this section must include an 
accurate description of the services offered to the public; must provide 
the specific applicable rates (or the basis for calculating the specific 
applicable rates), charges, and service terms; and must be arranged in a 
way that allows for the determination of the exact rate, charges, and 
service terms applicable to any given shipment (or to any given group of 
shipments). Increases, reductions and other changes must be symbolized 
or highlighted in some way to facilitate ready identification of the 
changes, the nature of those changes and their effective dates.
    (c) A rail carrier must make the information available at offices 
where it normally keeps rate information. Access to the information at 
such offices must be provided to any person, without charge, during 
normal business hours.
    (d) A rail carrier must also make the required publications 
available to all persons (hereinafter referred to as subscribers) who 
have subscribed to a publication service operated either by the rail 
carrier itself or by an agent acting at the rail carrier's direction. 
Such publications may be made available either in printed or in 
electronic form as agreed to by the parties. Any scheduled changes must 
be published in a manner that provides timely notice to subscribers. A 
rail carrier may impose reasonable charges for such publications. 
Publications may be limited to the specific information requested by the 
subscriber, and charges for such limited publications should be set 
accordingly.

apply to pipeline carriers only with respect to the transportation of 
commodities other than water, gas, or oil.

[[Page 215]]

    (b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section,

provided by a pipeline carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the 
Surface Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 15301.

rate(s)), as well as all charges and service terms that may be 
applicable to transportation covered by those rate(s).
    (b) The information provided by a pipeline carrier under this 
section must be provided immediately. (It is expected that the response 
will be sent within hours, or at the latest by the next business day, in 
most situations.) Such information may be provided either in writing or 
in electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the parties cannot 
agree, such information is to be provided in electronic form where both 
parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it is to be provided 
in writing.

    Where a shipper or a prospective shipper, or a person acting on 
behalf of a shipper or a prospective shipper, requests that the carrier 
establish a rate in the absence of an existing rate for particular 
transportation, the carrier must promptly establish and provide to the 
requester a rate and applicable service terms. The information may be 
provided either in writing or in electronic form, as agreed to by the 
parties. If the parties cannot agree, such information is to be provided 
in electronic form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; 
otherwise, it is to be provided in writing. The response should be 
provided as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 10 business 
days from receipt of the request. If a carrier determines that 
additional information is required from the requester before a rate or 
term can be established, the carrier must so notify the requester as 
soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days after receipt of 
the request. Once the additional information is received, the carrier 
must set the rate and related service terms, and relay them to the 
requester, as soon as possible, but no later than 10 business days. The 
time period for response set forth in this section will not apply when 
the parties agree to a different time period. A pipeline carrier may, at 
its option, require that requests submitted under this section be in 
writing or electronic form, or the carrier may permit oral requests.


<R05>
Sec. 1305.4  Notice requirement.

    (a) A pipeline carrier may not increase any rates or charges, or 
change any service terms (except for changes that are equivalent to rate 
reductions) unless 20 days have expired after written or electronic 
notice has been provided to all persons who, within the previous 12 
months:
    (1) Have requested, under Sec. 1305.2 or Sec. 1305.3, the affected 
rates or service terms; or

writing or in electronic form, as agreed to by the parties. If the 
parties cannot agree, the information is to be provided in electronic 
form where both parties have the requisite capabilities; otherwise, it 
is to be provided in writing.

subject to such tariffs.
    (b) The provisions of this part apply to all movements of household 
goods defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and to those 
movements of household goods defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section 
that are not provided under contracts entered into pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 
14101(b) or former 49 U.S.C. 10702 (repealed January 1, 1996).
    (c) For the purposes of this part, the term household goods means 
personal effects and property used or to be used in a dwelling, when a 
part of the equipment or supply of such dwelling, and similar property 
if the transportation of such effects or property is:
    (1) Arranged and paid for by the householder, including 
transportation of property from a factory or store when the property is 
purchased by the householder with intent to use in his or her dwelling; 
or
    (2) Arranged and paid for by another party.
    (d) For the purposes of this part service terms means all 
classifications, rules, regulations and practices that affect the rates, 
charges, or level of service for movements of household goods.


<R05>
Sec. 1310.2  Requirement to maintain tariffs.

    (a) Except when providing transportation for charitable purposes 
without charge, carriers subject to the Board's jurisdiction under 
Chapter 135 of Title 49 of the United States Code may provide 
transportation or service for movements of household goods only if the 
rates, and related rules and practices, for such transportation or 
service are contained in a published tariff that is in effect under this 
section. The carrier may not charge or receive a different compensation 
for the transportation or service than the rate specified in the tariff, 
whether by returning a part of that rate to a person, by giving a person 
a privilege, by allowing the use of a facility that affects the value of 
that transportation or service, or through another device. Tariffs shall 
be published in the English language and rates shall be stated in money 
of the United States.
    (b) Tariffs maintained pursuant to this part must be available for 
inspection by the Board, and must be provided to the Board promptly and 
free of charge, upon request, by mail or other delivery service.
    (c) A carrier that maintains a tariff pursuant to this part may not 
enforce the provisions of the tariff unless the carrier has given notice 
that the tariff is available for inspection in its bill of lading or by 
other actual notice to individuals whose shipments are subject to the 
tariff, as provided in Sec. 1310.4 of this part.
    (d) The Board may invalidate a tariff prepared by or on behalf of a 
carrier under this part if that tariff violates 49 U.S.C. 13702 or the 
regulations contained in this part.


<R05>
Sec. 1310.3  Contents of tariffs.

    (a) Tariffs prepared under this part must include an accurate 
description of the services offered to the public; must provide the 
specific applicable rates, charges and service terms; and must be

[[Page 217]]

arranged in a way that allows for the determination of the exact rate, 
charges and service terms applicable to any given shipment. Increases, 
reductions and other changes must be symbolized or highlighted in some 
way to facilitate ready identification of the changes and their 
effective dates.
    (b) All information necessary to determine applicable rates, charges 
and service terms for a given shipment need not be contained in a single 
tariff, but if multiple tariffs are used to convey that information, the 
tariff containing the rates must make specific reference to all other 
tariffs required to determine applicable rates, charges and service 
terms. The carrier(s) party to the rate(s) must participate in all of 
the tariffs so linked and all such tariffs must be made available to 
shippers upon reasonable request.


<R05>
Sec. 1310.4  Incorporation of tariff provisions by reference.

    (a) Carriers that maintain tariffs pursuant to this part may 
incorporate the terms of such tariffs by reference (i.e., without 
stating their full text) into the bill of lading or other document 
embodying the contract of carriage for the transportation of household 
goods, provided that:
    (1) The bill of lading or other document must contain a conspicuous 
notice that the contract of carriage incorporates the terms of the 
carrier's tariffs; the carrier must give notice that its tariffs are 
available for inspection in its bill of lading or by other actual notice 
to individuals whose shipments are subject to such tariffs; and the 
carrier must make the full text of incorporated terms readily available 
for inspection by the shipper, free of charge, upon request. If such 
terms cannot be made available immediately, they must be made available 
promptly and free of charge by mail or other delivery service.
    (2) If the incorporated terms include any of the terms set forth in 
paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the notice on 
the bill of lading or other document must indicate that such terms are 
included; the shipper must be provided with a brief summary of the 
principal features of such terms on or with the document; and the 
shipper must be able to obtain a more complete explanation of such terms 
upon request.
    (i) Limits on the carrier's liability for loss, damage, or delay of 
goods, including fragile or valuable goods.
    (ii) Claim restrictions, including time periods within which 
shippers or consignees must file a claim or bring an action against the 
carrier for its acts or omissions or those of its agents.
    (iii) Rights of the carrier to impose monetary penalties on shippers 
or consignees, increase the price of the transportation, or change any 
terms of the contract.
    (b) A carrier may not claim the benefit as against a shipper or 
consignee of, and a shipper or consignee shall not be bound by, any 
tariff term that is incorporated by reference under this section unless 
the carrier has complied with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this 
section.
    (c) The disclosure requirements established by this section preempt 
any State requirements on the same subject, for tariff terms that are 
incorporated by reference into the bill of lading or other document 
embodying the contract of carriage for the transportation of household 
goods.


<R05>
Sec. 1310.5  Availability of tariffs at carrier offices.

    (a) Each carrier shall maintain, at its principal office, a complete 
set of its effective tariffs and those to which it is a party.
    (b) Each carrier shall also maintain some or all of its tariffs at 
its other business offices, upon request. Carriers shall provide 
information regarding all locations where tariffs may be viewed.
    (c) At all points where tariffs are maintained, they shall be made 
available for inspection by any person during the carrier's normal 
business hours. The tariffs shall be accessible and readable. The 
carrier shall also display, in a conspicuous place in those locations, a 
notice, in large print, which contains a statement that the tariffs are 
available for public inspection.
    (d) At all other carrier business offices, the carrier shall display 
a notice advising the public of the location of the nearest available 
tariff. The notice

[[Page 218]]

shall be in large print and posted in a conspicuous place. In addition, 
the carrier shall, upon request, make its tariffs available at that 
location as soon as possible but not later than within 20 days, or 
provide the sought information orally if satisfactory to the requestor.
    (e) Any publication referred to in a tariff must be maintained with 
that tariff.
    (f) If any tariff maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this 
section has not been used for a substantial length of time, the 
availability of that tariff, including its reissues, may be discontinued 
at that office until such time as it is again requested. It shall then 
be made available within 20 days.


<R05>
Sec. 1310.6  Furnishing copies of tariff publications.

    (a) Copies of tariffs, specific tariff provisions or tariff 
subscriptions shall be provided upon request to any interested person.
    (b) Except for providing to shippers the full text of tariff terms 
incorporated by reference into the bill of lading or other document 
embodying the contract of carriage for the transportation of household 
goods, as described in Sec. 1310.4(a)(1), carriers may assess charges 
for furnishing copies of tariff publications to interested persons. If a 
charge is made, the charge must be reasonable, and identical for the 
same publications and delivery service.

<R05>
Sec. 1312.2  Requirement to publish and file a tariff.

    (a) Requirement for tariff. Except when providing transportation for 
charitable purposes without charge, or when providing transportation or 
service described in Sec. 1312.1(b), carriers subject to the Board's 
jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. Chapter 135 may provide transportation or 
service described in Sec. 1312.1(a) only if the rates, and related rules 
and practices, for such transportation or service are contained in a 
published tariff that is on file with the Board and in effect under this 
part.
    (b) Adherence to tariff. The carrier may not charge or receive a 
different compensation for the transportation or service than the rate 
specified in the tariff, whether by returning a part of that rate to a 
person, giving a person a privilege, allowing the use of a facility that 
affects the value of that transportation or service, or another device. 
The carrier shall keep such tariffs available for public inspection and 
shall make such tariffs available to subscribers as required in this 
part.
    (c) Other information. Provisions for information purposes only may 
be included in a tariff, provided they are clearly identified as such. 
Such provisions may include rates and service terms covering 
transportation not subject to regulation by the Board, and advertising 
and promotional material.
    (d) Effect of filing. The tender of a tariff and its receipt and 
acceptance by the Board do not relieve a carrier of liability for 
violations of the Act, other laws, the Board's regulations, or any

[[Page 220]]

decision of the Board or a court, or have any effect on the rights of 
persons to file complaints for substantive violations of the Act or the 
Board's regulations.
    (e) Tariff relief. Relief from the provisions of this part may be 
sought. Requests for such relief shall be submitted in duplicate and 
accompanied by the appropriate fee (see 49 CFR part 1002). Packages 
containing applications for relief shall be prominently marked ``SPECIAL 
TARIFF AUTHORITY APPLICATION.'' The application shall cite all pertinent 
tariff matter and shall provide complete information regarding 
applicant's justification, purpose and manner of relief sought.
    (f) Invalidation of tariffs. Tariffs that violate section 13702 of 
the Act, or a regulation of the Board carrying out that section, may be 
invalidated by the Board. When a tariff is invalidated, the party that 
filed it will be furnished a written explanation of the reasons for such 
action. Tariffs issued in lieu of invalidated tariffs shall so state.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.3  Tariff contents and standards; Essential criteria.

    (a) Contents. Tariffs filed with the Board must include an accurate 
description of the services offered to the public; must provide the 
specific applicable rates (or the basis for calculating the specific 
applicable rates) and service terms; and must be arranged in a way that 
allows for the determination of the exact rate(s) and service terms 
applicable to any given shipment (or to any given group of shipments).
    (b) Use of multiple tariffs. All information necessary to determine 
applicable rates and service terms for a given shipment need not be 
contained in a single tariff, but if multiple tariffs are used to convey 
that information, the tariff containing the rates must make specific 
reference (by STB tariff designation) to all other tariffs required to 
determine applicable rates and service terms, and the carrier(s) party 
to the rates must participate in all of the tariffs so linked.
    (c) Clarity. Tariff information must be presented in a way that 
facilitates the determination of the prices and services offered, and 
the related service terms. Ambiguous terms and complex methods of 
presentation shall not be used.
    (d) Explanations. Reference marks and abbreviations, other than 
commonly used abbreviations, shall be explained either in the item in 
which they are used or in a separate item.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.4  Filing of tariffs.

    (a) Filing requirements. (1) Tariffs shall be filed in English with 
rates explicitly stated in U.S. dollars and cents. Two copies of each 
tariff publication shall be filed with the Board. Packages containing 
tariff filings should be prominently marked ``TARIFF FILING'' and 
addressed to: Section of Tariffs, Surface Transportation Board, 1925 K 
Street, NW., Washington, DC 20423-0001.
    (2) A tariff filing must be accompanied by an authorized document of 
transmittal identifying each publication filed, and by the appropriate 
filing fee (see 49 CFR part 1002). Acknowledgment of Board receipt of a 
tariff filing can be obtained by enclosing a duplicate transmittal 
letter and a postage-paid, self-addressed return envelope. Each 
transmittal letter shall clearly indicate in the upper left-hand corner 
thereof:
    (i) The assigned alpha code of the issuing carrier or agent;
    (ii) The number of pages transmitted;
    (iii) The filing fee enclosed, the account number to be billed, or 
the credit card to be charged;
    (iv) The transmittal number if the filer utilizes transmittal 
numbers; and
    (v) If the filing fee is charged to a credit card, the credit card 
number and expiration date, and an authorized signature.
    (b) Paper size. Tariffs shall be printed on paper not larger than

<R05>
Sec. 1312.5  Amendments to tariffs.

    (a) Manner of making changes. An amendment is a change in, addition 
to, or cancellation of part of a tariff. Supplements are the tariff 
publications used to amend bound tariffs, and new or revised pages are 
the tariff publications normally used to amend looseleaf tariffs, 
although looseleaf tariffs can also be amended by supplements. Tariffs 
can also be canceled by new or reissued tariffs (see Sec. 1312.7).

[[Page 221]]

    (b) Supplements. Supplements issued to amend a tariff shall be 
consecutively numbered. Each new supplement shall identify any 
supplement(s) that it cancels, and any supplement(s) that are still in 
effect. A tariff amendment published in a supplement may be carried 
forward to later supplements if it is identified as reissued without 
change from the supplement in which it was originally published.
    (c) Looseleaf pages. Looseleaf pages to an original tariff shall be 
designated as ``Original'' (e.g., Original Title Page, Original Page 1, 
Original Page 2, etc.). Looseleaf pages issued to amend the tariff shall 
bear consecutive revision numbers and shall cancel the prior version(s) 
of the same page (e.g., 1st Revised Page 1 Cancels Original Page 1, 2nd 
Revised Page 1 Cancels 1st Revised Page 1, etc.). Additional original 
pages may also be issued to amend a tariff, by adding new numbered pages 
after the last numbered page, or by adding existing numbered pages with 
alphabetic suffixes (e.g., a page designated as Original Page 2-A could 
be added between pages 2 and 3, etc.). Each looseleaf tariff shall 
include a Check Sheet, a Correction Number Check Sheet, or some other 
method of determining the looseleaf pages issued to amend such tariff.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.6  Advance notice required.

    (a) Notice requirement. Unless otherwise specifically authorized by 
the Board, tariffs must be filed with the Board on not less than the 
notice shown in paragraph (b) of this section. Notice means the number 
of days the publication is on file with the Board prior to its effective 
date(s). The date the publication is received by the Board counts as the 
first day of notice.
    (b) Length of notice. A tariff may not become effective earlier 
than:
    (1) Thirty days after filing for all collectively established tariff 
matter.
    (2) Seven workdays after filing for independently established 
increased tariff matter.
    (3) Upon filing for independently established new tariff matter, 
independently established reduced tariff matter, the addition or 
restoration of a carrier's participation in a tariff, a correction to 
the list of participating carriers in a tariff (other than the 
cancellation of a carrier's participation), an extension of the 
expiration date of tariff matter, or a postponement of the effective 
date of proposed tariff matter.
    (c) Receipt of tariffs by the Board. The Board will receive printed 
tariff filings between the hours of 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. Eastern Time 
on workdays. Printed tariff filings delivered to the Board on other than

received the next workday. The Board will accept electronic tariff 
filings in accordance with the provisions of 46 CFR part 514, as 
provided in Sec. 1312.17.
    (d) Definitions. For the purposes of this section:
    Increased means any tariff change that results in higher charges to 
the payer of freight charges or reduced service at the same rate;
    New means an initial rate or other provision for a new service;
    Reduced means any tariff change that results in lower charges to the 
payer of freight charges or expanded service at the same rate; and
    Workdays means all days except Saturdays, Sundays and all Federal 
holidays observed in the District of Columbia.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.7  STB tariff designation.

    (a) Format. Every tariff shall show an authorized tariff designation 
consisting of:
    (1) The characters ``STB'';
    (2) The assigned alpha code of the carrier or agent issuing the 
tariff; and
    (3)(i) The tariff number (selected by the carrier or agent) to 
distinguish that tariff from all other tariffs filed by the same issuing 
carrier or agent. Tariff numbers shall not exceed 5 numerical digits and 
may be followed by not more than 2 letter suffixes. Examples of tariff 
numbers are:

STB XXXX 100
STB XX 8000-A
STB XXXX 12345-AB

    (ii) Suffixes may be used only to designate reissues of tariffs. As

Sec. 1312.12  Posting requirements.

    (a) General posting requirements. (1) Each carrier shall maintain, 
at its principal office, a complete set of its tariffs (proposed and 
effective) and those to which it is a party.
    (2) Each carrier shall also maintain some or all of its tariffs at 
other locations, as may be useful. Carriers shall provide information 
regarding all locations where tariffs may be viewed.
    (3) At all points where tariffs are posted, they shall be made 
available for inspection by any person during the carrier's normal 
business hours. The tariffs shall be accessible and readable. The 
carrier shall also post, in a conspicuous place in those locations, a 
notice, in large print, which contains a statement that the tariffs are 
available for public inspection.
    (4) At all other carrier business offices, the carrier shall display 
a notice advising the public of the location of the nearest available 
tariff. The notice shall be in large print and posted in a conspicuous 
place. In addition, the carrier shall, upon request, make particular 
tariffs available at that location as soon as possible but not later 
than within 20 days, or provide the sought information orally if 
satisfactory to the requestor.
    (5) Any publication referred to in a tariff must be posted with that 
tariff.
    (b) Exception to the posting requirements. If any tariff maintained 
pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section has not been used for a 
substantial

[[Page 223]]

length of time, the posting of that tariff, including its reissues, may 
be discontinued at that station until such time as a request is made to 
have it reposted. It shall then be reposted within 20 days.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.13  Furnishing copies of tariff publications.

    (a) Definitions. Subscriber, as used in this section, means any 
person (other than carrier participants in a tariff) that is voluntarily 
furnished, or that requests that it be furnished, one or more copies of 
a particular tariff with or without subsequent amendments or reissues of 
that tariff.
    (b) Sending new publications to subscribers. (1) The publishing 
carrier or agent shall send each newly-issued tariff, supplement, or 
loose-leaf page as requested to each subscriber by first class mail, or 
other means requested in writing by the subscriber.
    (2) Newly-issued tariffs, supplements, or loose-leaf pages shall be 
sent to each subscriber not later than the time the copies for official 
filing are sent to the Board.
    (3) Carriers or agents may, if acceptable to a subscriber, furnish 
only specific portions of original tariffs and amendments affecting 
those portions.
    (c) Certification. The letter of transmittal accompanying the copies 
filed with the Board shall contain the following certification:

    I certify that compliance with 49 CFR 1312.13 has been made.

    (d) Charges. (1) If any charge is made, the charge for copies of 
tariff publications sent to subscribers shall be reasonable, and 
identical for the same publications.
    (2) No charge may be made (even for the cost of sending the 
publication) for any publication that is invalidated by the Board.
    (e) Notice of invalidation. If a publication is invalidated, the 
subscribers shall be notified.
    (f) Alternative subscription services. The service described in this 
section must be available to any subscriber requesting it; however, the 
requirement to offer such service does not preclude the offering of 
different services to subscribers requesting those services.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.14  Powers of attorney and concurrences.

    (a) Authorization. Rates and services of a carrier must be filed in 
a tariff issued in that carrier's name unless they are filed:
    (1) In an agent's tariff when the carrier has executed a power of 
attorney authorizing that individual or entity to serve as its tariff 
agent; or
    (2) In a tariff of another carrier through issuance of a concurrence 
to the latter carrier authorizing the first carrier's participation in 
joint rates and through routes.
    (b) Disclosure of authorization. If two or more carriers execute 
powers of attorney to the same agent, it is not necessary for those 
carriers to exchange concurrences to participate in joint rates in that 
agent's tariffs. Powers of attorney and concurrences are not to be filed 
with the Board, but shall be provided to any person on request.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.15  Change of carrier or agent.

    (a) Change in carrier. When a carrier's name is lawfully changed, or 
a fiduciary assumes possession and control of a carrier's property, all 
affected tariffs must be amended to reflect the change. The amendments 
required by this paragraph shall be filed promptly and, if possible, 
prior to their effective date, but in no case later than 60 days 
thereafter. Regardless of the date the tariff is actually filed, the 
effective date for an amendment required by this paragraph is the date 
the event occurs.
    (b) Change of agent. When a new agent is appointed to take over an 
agency, or when an alternate agent assumes the duties of the principal 
agent, each of the superseded agent's effective tariffs shall 
immediately be amended to reflect the change, bearing an effective date 
the same as the date of the transfer. In the case of a new agent, this 
may only occur after one or more of the participating carriers issues a 
power of attorney to the new agent, and revokes the previous power of 
attorney. At the same time, all affected tariffs will be amended to 
reflect the new powers of attorney, and all carriers who have not issued 
them must be canceled from the tariff.

<R05>
Sec. 1312.16  Substitution of service.

    If a water or motor carrier (hereafter referred to as Carrier A) 
desires to have the option of substituting the services of a carrier of 
a different transportation mode (hereafter referred to as Carrier B) for 
part of its movement of a shipment, it may do so if:
    (a) The shipment moves on the bill of lading that would be used if 
Carrier A were performing the service;
    (b) Carrier A assumes the responsibility for the lading while it is 
in the possession of Carrier B; and
    (c) Movement of the lading has been made prior to, or will be made 
subsequent to, the service performed by Carrier B.


<R05>
Sec. 1312.17  Electronic filing of tariffs.

    (a) Use of FMC system. Subject to the requirements of this section, 
the tariffs required by this part may be filed electronically through 
the Federal Maritime Commission's ATFI system, in lieu of being filed in 
printed form.
    (b) Compliance with FMC requirements. All tariffs filed 
electronically must fully comply with the filing and posting procedures, 
and the data record format and content requirements, established for the 
ATFI system (see 46 CFR part 514).
    (c) Fees. Electronically filed tariffs will be subject to the filing 
and retrieval fees established by the FMC in 46 CFR 514.21 (g) and (i), 
but such tariffs will not be subject to fee item 78 in 49 CFR 1002.2(f).
    (d) Relief from this part. Electronically filed tariffs will not be 
subject to the filing and posting procedures, and the format 
requirements, for printed tariffs as set forth in Secs. 1312.4, 1312.5, 
and 1312.7 through 1312.15; however, such tariffs must otherwise fully 
comply with the requirements of this part.

<R05>
Sec. 1313.1  Scope; definition of terms.

    (a) This part addresses the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 10709 that 
require rail carriers to file with the Board a summary of each contract 
for the transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as 
defined in 7 U.S.C. 75 and products thereof) and that allow complaints 
to be filed with the Board regarding such contracts.
    (b) The provisions of this part do not apply to any transportation 
that is exempted from the Board's contract regulation pursuant to an 
exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 10502 or former 49 U.S.C. 10505 
(repealed effective January 1, 1996).
    (c) For purposes of this part, the term contract means an agreement, 
including any amendment thereto, entered into by one or more rail 
carriers and one or more purchasers of rail services to provide 
specified transportation of agricultural products (including grain, as 
defined in 7 U.S.C. 75 and products thereof) under specified rates and 
conditions. The term amendment includes contract modifications agreed to 
by the parties.
    (d) An amended contract is treated as a new contract under this 
part. Remedies are revived and review is again available, upon 
complaint.


<R05>
Sec. 1313.2  Contract summary filing requirement.

    (a) Rail carriers subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface 
Transportation Board under 49 U.S.C. 10501 must

[[Page 225]]

promptly file with the Board a summary of each contract entered into for 
the transportation of agricultural products.
    (b) Contract summaries not in compliance with this part may be 
rejected by the Board. If a contract summary is rejected, it will be 
considered as not filed, and the carrier must promptly file a corrected 
contract summary to replace the rejected summary.


<R05>
Sec. 1313.3  Board review; contract disapproval.

    (a) Board review. (1) No later than 30 days after a contract summary 
is filed, the Board may, on complaint, begin a proceeding to review such 
contract on the grounds described in Sec. 1313.9.
    (2) If the Board begins a proceeding, it shall determine, within 30 
days after the proceeding is commenced, whether the contract is in 
violation of 49 U.S.C. 10709.
    (b) Contract disapproval. If the Board finds that the contract is in 
violation of 49 U.S.C. 10709, it will:
    (1) Disapprove the contract; or
    (2) Where the Board finds unreasonable discrimination, in accordance 
with 49 U.S.C. 10709(g)(2)(B)(i), order the contracting carrier(s) to 
provide to the complainant(s) rates and service substantially similar to 
those contained in the contract at issue, with such differences in terms 
and conditions as are justified by the evidence.
    (c) Applicable rates/charges if a contract is disapproved. If the 
Board disapproves a contract (or contract amendment), the appropriate 
non-contract rates/charges (or the contract provisions otherwise in 
effect) will be applicable.


<R05>
Sec. 1313.4  Filing procedures and formats for contract summaries.

    (a) Filing of Summaries. (1) Two copies of each contract summary, 
containing the applicable information specified in Secs. 1313.6, 1313.7, 
or 1313.8, as appropriate, must be filed with the Board as soon as 
possible, but no longer than 7 days after the date of the contract (or 
contract amendment).
    (2) The outside envelope or wrapper containing one or more contract 
summaries must be prominently marked ``Rail Contract Summary'' and 
addressed to: Tariffs Branch, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, 
DC 20423.
    (3) A transmittal letter identifying the submitted publication(s), 
and the name and telephone number of a contact person, must accompany 
each filing of one or more contract summaries. Each transmittal letter 
shall clearly indicate in the upper left-hand corner thereof:
    (i) The assigned alpha code of the filing carrier;
    (ii) The number of summaries transmitted;
    (iii) The filing fee enclosed, the account number to be billed, or 
the credit card to be charged;
    (iv) The transmittal number if the filer utilizes transmittal 
numbers; and
    (v) If the filing fee is charged to a credit card, the information 
must include the credit card number and expiration date, and an 
authorized signature.
    (b) Contract summary title page. The title page of each contract 
summary must contain only the following information:
    (1) In the upper right corner, the contract summary number (see 
paragraph (c) of this section), followed by the amendment number if an 
amended contract summary.
    (2) In the center of the page, the filing carrier's name, followed 
by the words ``CONTRACT SUMMARY'' or ``AMENDED CONTRACT SUMMARY'', as 
applicable, in large print.
    (3) Date of contract and its effective date.
    (4) In the center lower portion, the individual submitting the 
filing, and the name of the individual(s) for service of complaints (if 
not the same individual). If not otherwise noted, a complainant may rely 
on service to the individual submitting the filing.
    (c) Contract summary numbering system. (1) The contract summary 
identification number must include the word ``STB,'' the standard 
carrier alphabetic code for the filing railroad (limited to four 
letters), the letter ``C,'' and a sequential number, with each separated 
by a hyphen. The following is an example: the 357th contract summary 
filed

[[Page 226]]

by the Conrail would have the following identification number: ``STB-CR-
C-357.''
    (2) At its option, the carrier may issue contract summaries with 
nonconsecutive numbers if it assigns blocks of numbers for specific 
uses. An index to the blocks of reserved numbers shall be filed with the 
Board.
    (d) Format requirements for contract summary information. (1) The 
contract summary must enumerate and have each item required in 
Secs. 1313.6, 1313.7 or 1313.8 of this part, as applicable, completed. 
When the item does not pertain to the contract, the term ``Not 
Applicable'' (``NA'') shall be used.
    (2) Changes in prior contract summaries must be underscored and must 
be followed by the words ``addition,'' ``deletion,'' ``extension,'' 
``cancellation,'' or other appropriate descriptive phrase in 
parentheses. If the change to the contract is only in confidential 
matter, a statement to that effect must be made in the amended contract 
summary and must indicate the particular feature to which the change 
applies (i.e., rate, special feature, etc.). If ``not applicable'' is 
permitted in the original summary under Secs. 1313.6 through 1313.8 of 
this part, the amended summary may use ``not applicable'' with a 
notation that a change pertained only to confidential data.
    (3) Amended contract summaries may not substitute phrases such as 
``not applicable'' or ``no change'' where disclosure was required in the 
original contact summary (such as in the commodity description); amended 
contract summaries must set forth all required non-confidential terms in 
the contract, whether amended or not.


<R05>

    (a) A complaint may be filed against a contract covered by this 
part:
    (1) By any shipper on the ground that such shipper individually will 
be harmed because the contract unduly impairs the ability of the 
contracting rail carrier or carriers to meet their common carrier 
obligations to the complainant under 49 U.S.C. 11101;
    (2) By a port on the ground that such port individually will be 
harmed because the contract will result in unreasonable discrimination 
against such port; and
    (3) By a shipper of agricultural commodities on the ground that such 
shipper individually will be harmed because:
    (i) The rail carrier has unreasonably discriminated by refusing to 
enter into a contract with such shipper for rates and services for the 
transportation of the same type of commodity under similar conditions to 
the contract at issue, and that such shipper was ready, willing, and 
able to enter into such a contract at a time essentially contemporaneous 
with the period during which the contract at issue was offered; or
    (ii) The contract constitutes a destructive competitive practice.
    (b) Unreasonable discrimination, for purposes of paragraph (a)(3)(i) 
of this section, has the same meaning as the term has under 49 U.S.C. 
10741.

    (iv) Nexus. Where the complaint challenges a carrier's ability to 
perform its common carrier obligation, the nexus between the information 
sought and the common carrier obligation of the contracting carrier(s).
    (4) Service of pleadings. The complainant must certify that 2 copies 
of the complaint, and discovery petition if filed, have been sent to the 
contracting carrier(s) either by hand, express mail, or other overnight 
delivery service the same day as filed at the Board. The contracting 
carrier shall in turn serve the contracting shipper with a copy of the 
complaint and petition. Replies shall be served in the same manner on 
complainant/petitioner.
    (5) Submission of contract. Immediately upon the filing of a 
complaint, the rail carrier filing the contract summary shall forward to 
the Board, by hand, express mail, or other overnight delivery service, 
the subject contract or amended contract.
    (6) Replies. Replies to the complaint/petition are due within 5 days 
from the date of filing of the complaint/petition, and in no event later 
than noon on the 23rd day following filing of the contract summary.
    (7) Copies. An original and 10 copies of complaints, petitions and 
replies must be filed with the Board in a package marked ``Confidential 
Rail Contract Material''.
    (8) Discovery appeals. If action on a petition for discovery is 
taken under delegated authority, that action may be appealed to the 
Board, subject to the following:
    (i) An appeal must be received within 2 days of the initial 
decision, but in no event later than the 28th day after the contract 
summary is filed.

opposing parties.
    (iv) Replies to the appeal must be filed within one day after the 
appeal is filed.
    (v) An original and 10 copies of appeals and replies must be filed

[[Page 230]]

    (b) Informal discovery. (1) Prior to filing a petition for formal 
discovery under paragraph (a) of this section, a petitioner may request 
discovery from the carrier.
    (2) The carrier must promptly grant or deny the request.
    (3) Agreements between carriers and shippers for informal discovery 
are permitted under these rules.
    (c) Confidentiality. If confidential contract data are filed with 
the Board in a pleading, the party filing these data should submit them 
as a separate package, clearly marked on the outside ``Confidential 
Material Subject to Protective Order.'' The order in paragraph (d) of 
this section applies to the parties specified in the order who receive 
confidential information through proceedings before the Board or through 
informal discovery.
    (d) Protective order. Petitioner and carriers, and their duly 
authorized agents, shall limit to the contract complaint proceeding the 
use of contract information or other confidential commercial information 
which may be revealed in the contract, the complaint, reply, or in any 
other pleading relating to the contract. This restriction shall be a 
condition to release of any contract term to a petitioner/complainant 
and shall operate similarly on a carrier in possession of confidential 
information which may be contained in a complaint, petition for 
discovery, or request for informal disclosure. Any information 
pertaining to parties to the contract or subject to the contract 
(including consignors, consignees and carriers), or pertaining to the 
terms of the contract, or relating to the petitioner's/complainant's 
confidential commercial information, must be kept confidential. Neither 
the information nor the existence of the information shall be disclosed 
to third parties, except for: consultants or agents who agree, in 
writing, to be bound by this regulation; information which is publicly 
available; information which, after receipt, becomes publicly available 
through no fault of the party seeking to disclose the information after 
it has become publicly available, or is acquired from a third party free 
of any restriction as to its disclosure. The petitioner/complainant or 
carrier must take all necessary steps to assure that the information 
will be kept confidential by its employees and agents. No copies of the 
contract terms or other confidential information are to be retained by 
the parties not originally privy to the data subsequent to the 
termination of the proceeding.
    (e) Contract review proceeding. If the Board institutes a proceeding 
to review the contract, the complainant's case-in-chief is due 9 days 
after the institution of the proceeding, but no later than 39 days after 
the filing of the contract summary. Replies are due 16 days after the 
institution of the proceeding, but no later than 46 days after the 
filing of the contract summary.

subject to withdrawal of their immunity for serious continuing 
violations of Board standards, and individual tariff publications will 
be subject to rejection, suspension, or investigation for improprieties 
in the rate bureau process.
    (c) Absent Board approval, no other changes may be made in any 
approved agreement.
    (d) For the purposes of the statute, the following definitions shall 
apply:
    (1) A general increase is a proposed general adjustment of

regionally.
    (3) An innovative fare will be determined on a case-by-case basis; 
the Board will, on request, issue opinions on whether particular rate 
proposals may be regarded as innovative. Two examples of an innovative 
fare are:
    (i) A fare for unlimited passenger travel; and
    (ii) An experimental fare providing for transportation at the 
passenger's option over the line of one or more carriers.
    (4) A promotional fare generally has three characteristics:
    (i) Limited duration;
    (ii) Attractive price or level of service quality; and
    (iii) Some added feature in addition to those normally offered.

[59 FR 5110, Feb. 3, 1994. Redesignated at 63 FR 52193, Sept. 30, 1998]


<R05>
Sec. 1420.2  Classification of carriers--motor carriers of property, household goods carriers, and dual property carriers.

    (a) Common and contract motor carriers of property subject to the 
Interstate Commerce Act are grouped into the following three classes:
    Class I. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues 
(including interstate and intrastate) of $10 million or more after 
applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A.
    Class II. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues 
(including interstate and intrastate) of at least $3 million but less 
than $10 million after applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A.
    Class III. Carriers having annual carrier operating revenues 
(including interstate and intrastate) of less than $3 million after 
applying the revenue deflator formula in Note A.
    (b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by 
annual carrier operating revenues (excluding revenues from private 
carriage, compensated intercorporate hauling, and leasing vehicles with 
drivers to private carriers) after applying the revenue deflator formula 
in Note A. Upward and downward classification will be effected as of 
January 1 of the year immediately following the third consecutive year 
of revenue qualification.
    (2) Any carrier which begins new operations by obtaining operating 
authority not previously held or extends its existing authority by 
obtaining additional operating rights shall be classified in accordance 
with a reasonable estimate of its annual carrier operating revenues 
after applying the revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.

[[Page 238]]

    (3) When a business combination occurs such as a merger, 
reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be 
reclassified effective as of January 1 of the next calendar year on the 
basis of the combined revenues for the year when the combination 
occurred after applying the revenue deflator formula shown in Note A.
    (4) Carriers shall notify the Commission of any change in 
classification and any change in annual operating revenues that causes 
them to exceed the class I limit by writing to the Office of Economics, 
Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. In unusual or 
extraordinary extenuating circumstances, where the classification 
process will unduly burden the carrier, such as partial liquidation, or 
curtailment or elimination of contracted services, the carrier may 
request from the Commission a waiver or an exception from these 
regulations. This request shall be in writing, specifying the conditions 
justifying the waiver or exception. The Commission shall notify the 
carriers of any change in classification.
    (5) Carriers not required to file an Annual Report (Form M-1 or Form 
M-2) may be required to file the Annual Carrier Classification Survey 
Form. All carriers will be notified of any classification changes.
    (c) For classification purposes, the Commission shall publish in the 
Federal Register annually an index number which shall be used to adjust 
gross annual operating revenues. This index number (deflator) shall be 
based on the Producers Price Index of Finished Goods. Its intended use 
is to eliminate the effects of inflation from the classification 
process. See Note A that follows:
    Note A: Each carrier's operating revenues will be deflated annually 
using the Producers Price Index (PPI) of Finished Goods before comparing 
those revenues with the dollar revenue limits prescribed in paragraph

Sec. 1420.3  Classification of carriers--motor carriers of passengers.

    (a) Common and contract carriers of passengers subject to the 
Interstate Commerce Act are grouped into the following two classes:
    Class I--Carriers having average annual gross transportation 
operating revenues (including interstate and intrastate) of $5 million 
or more from passenger motor carrier operations after applying the 
revenue deflator formula as shown in the Note.
    Class II--Carriers having average annual gross transportation 
operating revenues (including interstate or intrastate) of less than $5 
million from passenger motor carrier operations after applying the 
revenue deflator formula as shown in the Note.
    (b)(1) The class to which any carrier belongs shall be determined by 
annual carrier operating revenues after applying the revenue deflator 
formula as shown in the Note. Upward and downward reclassification will 
be effected as of January 1 of the year immediately following the third 
consecutive year of revenue qualification.
    (2) Any carrier which begins new operations (obtains operating 
authority not previously held) or extends its existing authority 
(obtains additional operating rights) shall be classified in accordance 
with a reasonable estimate of its annual carrier operating revenues 
after applying the revenue deflator formula shown in the Note.
    (3) When a business combination occurs, such as a merger, 
reorganization, or consolidation, the surviving carrier shall be 
reclassified effective as of January 1 of the next calendar year on the 
basis of the combined revenues for the

[[Page 239]]

year when the combination occurred after applying the revenue deflator 
formula shown in the Note.
    (4) Carriers shall notify the Commission of any change in 
classification or when their annual operating revenues exceed the Class 
I limit by writing to the Bureau of Accounts, Interstate Commerce 
Commission, Washington, DC 20423. In unusual circumstances where the 
classification regulations and reporting requirements will unduly burden 
the carrier, the carrier may request from the Commission a waiver from 
these regulations. This request shall be in writing specifying the 
conditions justifying the waiver. The Commission then shall notify 
carriers of any change in classification or reporting requirements.
    (c) For classification purposes, the Commission shall publish in the 
Federal Register annually an index number which shall be used for 
adjusting gross annual operating revenues. The index number (deflator) 
is based on the Producer Price Index of Finished Goods and is used to 
eliminate the effects of inflation from the classification process.
    Note: Each carrier's operating revenues will be deflated annually 
using the Producers Price Index (PPI) of Finished Goods before comparing 
them with the dollar revenue limits prescribed in paragraph (a) of this 
section. The PPI is published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
The formula to be applied is as follows:

of Passengers (Form MP-1). Other than Class I carriers are not required 
to file Form MP-1.
    (b) Motor Carrier Quarterly and Annual Report Form MP-1 shall be 
used to file both quarterly and annual selected motor carrier data. The 
annual accounting period shall be based either (1) on the 31st day of 
December in each year, or (2) an accounting year of thirteen 4-week 
periods ending at the close of the last 7 days of each calendar year. A 
carrier electing to adopt an accounting year of thirteen 4-week periods 
shall file with the Commission a statement showing the day on which its 
accounting year will close. A subsequent change in the accounting period 
may not be made except by authority of the Commission. The quarterly 
accounting period shall end on March 31, June 30, September 30, and 
December 31. The quarterly report shall be filed within 30 days after 
the end of the reporting quarter. The annual report shall be filed on or 
before March 31 of the year following the year to which it relates.
    (c) The quarterly and annual report shall be filed in duplicate to 
The Bureau of Accounts, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC
